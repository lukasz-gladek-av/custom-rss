            <p>
Following EA's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-black-panther-game-reportedly-cancelled-and-studio-closed-resulting-in-more-layoffs">pull the plug on its Black Panther game and close the studio making it</a>, the publisher has insisted the move doesn't reflect a change to its partnership with Marvel, and confirmed it still has "at least three" additional Marvel games in development.
</p>
<p>
Little had been revealed of EA's Black Panther game since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-single-player-black-panther-game-from-new-studio">announcement in 2023</a>, and word of its cancellation - alongside yet more layoffs at the company - arrived earlier this week. Commenting on the decision to end development in an email to employees, EA Entertainment president Laura Miele said the move would help the publisher "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities".
</p>
<p>
Miele also stressed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-iron-man-single-player-game-in-the-works">developer EA Motive's Iron Man game</a> was unaffected, but Black Panther's cancellation - which comes as the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">continues a planned retreat away from "future licensed IP"</a> - had some commentators wondering if the company's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-iron-man-part-of-three-game-marvel-deal">previously announced three-game deal with Marvel</a> could be wrapping up prematurely. 
</p>
<p>
Now, however, EA has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-still-making-at-least-3-marvel-games-even-after-black-panther-cancellation">confirmed to IGN</a> that not only is the deal alive and well, the company is still working on "at least three" Marvel games following Black Panther's termination. "The multi-title, long-term relationship between Marvel Games and EA... remains strong," an EA spokesperson told the publication. "Development of our console and PC titles, beginning with Marvel's Iron Man, is led by Motive Studios."
</p>
<p>
Black Panther's cancellation and subsequent job cuts follow a string of similar incidents at EA this year. In April, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-lays-off-over-300-employees-cancels-new-titanfall-game">laid off more than 300 employees</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and Star Wars Jedi studio <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a> losing around 100 staff. At the same time, EA cancelled a number of in-development projects - reportedly including a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> game - as part of what it called a "continued focus on our long-term strategic priorities". Still more layoffs were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-it-is-reducing-roles-at-codemasters-and-redeploying-as-many-as-possible">confirmed last month, following EA's decision to end its licensing partnership with the WRC</a>.
</p>
<p>
A second Black Panther project unconnected with EA - Skydance Games' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, from Uncharted writer Amy Hennig - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amy-hennigs-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-next-year">recently delayed into next year</a>.

This week, PC users can add Playdead’s breakout video game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/limbo"><u>Limbo</u></a>, and Gearbox’s Dungeons &amp; Dragons-inspired Borderlands spinoff, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands"><u>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</u></a>, to their libraries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both titles are available to nab from now to next Thursday, June 5, at 8am PT / 11am ET, at which point they’ll no longer be free to own. Even if you don’t find yourself playing games on PC very often, you might as well sign into an Epic Games Store account and claim both games for the future just in case.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is a Borderlands side story that launched for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S in early 2022. While previous entries in the series see players team up to loot and shoot across twisted sci-fi settings, this spinoff drops fans into a fantasy setting with a few gameplay shakeups, such as new weapon types and fleshed-out character customization, to keep things interesting. Thanks in part to a surprisingly star-studded cast that includes Andy Samberg, Wanda Sykes, Will Arnett, and more, we felt Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands was a fitting addition to the Borderlands universe, giving it an 8/10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-review-pc-xbox-playstation"><u>our review</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Limbo, meanwhile, is a much more scaled-down adventure that sees players controlling a small child as they trudge through an unforgiving, colorless world. It’s a short story that <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/5304" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>HowLongToBeat</u></a> says takes just over three hours to complete, but it’s been more than enough to leave an impression on gamers for nearly 15 years. We gave it a 9/10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/08/02/limbo-review-2"><u>our original review</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands and Limbo follow <a href="https://in.ign.com/sifu/231653/news/free-video-games-this-week-epic-games-is-offering-sifu-gigapocalypse-and-deliver-at-all-costs-amazon" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>last week’s free Epic Games Store titles</u></a>, which included Deliver At All Costs, Gigapocalypse, and Sifu.

For example, Wolverine has the exaggerated claws and mask, while Venom is decked out in his game-accurate blue color scheme. The Psylocke figure in particular showcases the extreme articulation possible with these new figures.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously, not every character from the Marvel vs. Capcom games is represented here, but collectors can always look to past Marvel Legends releases to fill out their lineup. At this point, even relatively more obscure characters like Marrow and Blackheart have been featured in the Marvel Legends line. The bigger challenge is assembling the Capcom side of the roster.

                <p>Nvidia's GeForce Now app lets players stream games to devices to take advantage of Nvidia's powerful cloud hardware, but Steam Deck users have historically had to jump through some hoops to get it working. Today, Nvidia finally launched a native GeForce Now app for the Steam Deck.</p><p>In a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-steam-deck-geforce-now/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a> marking the app's launch, Nvidia highlighted that GeForce Now lets Steam Deck players take advantage of much more powerful hardware and more advanced technical features than can run locally on the handheld. Nvidia also states that GeForce Now lets you play games at up to 4K/60FPS if you connect the Steam Deck to a TV.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GeForce NOW | Supercharge Your Steam Deck Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Perhaps its most impactful feature is that GeForce Now enables you to play games that are nearly (or completely) impossible to play, either due to performance issues, lack of support, or incompatibilities with Steam Deck's Linux-based operating system. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, for instance, is blocked from running locally on Steam Deck (unless you go through the process of installing Windows), but I confirmed that it is now playable through the native GeForce Now app.</p><p>Testing done by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/676167/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-test-hands-on" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> suggests that GeForce Now lets you max out the settings on many more games, including particularly resource-intensive titles. Most excitingly for me, as someone who plays most of my PC games on a Steam Deck, The Verge's tests confirm that playing via GeForce Now requires a <em>fraction</em> of the battery power of playing games locally on the handheld, likely due to the fact that the Steam Deck's hardware only has to handle video streaming instead of rendering the entire game.</p><p>For those who might be new to the world of games streaming, GeForce Now works by letting you access many of the titles in your PC games libraries from a remote machine running Nvidia hardware. There are different tiers of subscriptions; the cheapest is ad-supported, has longer queues for access, and uses lower-end hardware, while the premium membership uses machines that have Nvidia's 4080 GPUs.</p><p>GeForce Now arrives at an interesting time for the Steam Deck, which runs on hardware that is a bit dated. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-steam-deck-has-transformed-pc-gaming/1100-6509947/" data-ref-id="1100-6509947">Originally released in early 2022</a>, the Steam Deck has not received any upgrades to its specifications beyond an OLED model that rolled out in late 2023. Despite this, the Steam Deck is still quite popular, and it has influenced other PC hardware companies to release handhelds of their own. Being able to stream more demanding games straight to the Steam Deck through the official GeForce Now app may help revitalize its role in the gaming ecosystem.</p>

		<p>GAME has announced it has cancelled some Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders, and the company has said it is trying to re-instate some of those pre-orders. The reason for the cancellation of these orders has not been stated. GAME has emailed affected customers about the cancellations, and has said it will send further details about next steps. The full statement is below.</p>
<p><em>“We sincerely apologise for the recent cancellation of some Nintendo Switch 2 preorders. We understand how disappointing this is, especially for those who have been eagerly awaiting their order. We’re currently working hard to reinstate as many preorders affected as possible. If your order was impacted, please know that we’re doing everything we can and will be in touch with further updates and next steps. Thank you for your patience and understanding while we work to resolve this. We truly appreciate your support.”</em></p>


<p>Those who have had their pre-orders cancelled are unlikely to be able to secure a pre-order anywhere else.<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-uk-pre-orders-argos-has-stock/"> All retailers went out of stock</a> on the day they were available to pre-order, which was April 8th. There is only one week to go until the Nintendo Switch 2 will be released, with the console getting into people’s hands on June 5th.</p>

			<p>Today, Hangar 13 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amarmiKaV2w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a new developer diary detailing the making of Mafia: The Old Country. The developer revealed that it has partnered with Stormind Games, an Italian studio known for games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/remothered-broken-porcelain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remothered: Broken Porcelain</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/batora-lost-haven-bathing-in-shadows-to-reach-dim-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Batora: Lost Haven</a>, and, more recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</a>. Stormind is based in Sicily and helped Hangar 13 make Mafia: The Old Country as authentic as possible. Here are a few quotes from the video interview:</p>
<p><em><strong>Salvo Fallica, Senior Project Manager at Stormind Games:</strong> Our priority has always been to ensure that everything in the game feels authentic. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Matthew Aitken, Lead Writer at Hangar 13:</strong> The details are absolutely key in keeping the immersion of the player. </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Alex Cox, Game Director at Hangar 13:</em></strong><em> We need to make sure that the game is grounded in the real history of the Sicilian Mafia.&nbsp;</em><em>Experts in their field are able to kind of help us contextualize things that we read in the stuff that we see on the screen with real lived experiences. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Steve Noakes, Art Director at Hangar 13:</strong> When it comes to something like the knives in the game, there's very little reference that's available for that. Right? And so really we had to dig very deep. We went into some tiny little backwater of a machine shop where this guy and his son were still crafting knives by hand, imbuing them with their particular regional styles, known for their thumbprints, if you like, of their particular approach to building knives. We just wouldn't really experienced that any other way.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Jakub Vavrik, Associate Art Director at Hangar 13:</strong> Previous Mafia games were more or less city heavy, and now we are moving to more organic wildlife setting of Sicily.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Alex Cox:</strong> A very realistic, high fidelity, authentic setting. It really feels like we're transporting you back to 1900 Sicily. That's what Mafia players really expect from one of our games. Players will form a relationship with Sicily over the course of this game.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Steve Noakes:</strong> The landscape is always a character in any Mafia game. I think that's especially true of this location and of this time period and setting. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Alex</strong> <strong>Cox:</strong> The promise is to play a classic mob movie. That's the game that you're going to play, allowing players to really imagine themselves back in that time and playing through the game as a Sicilian gangster. I hope players find it as exciting as we do</em></p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-launches-on-august-8th-for-only-50-new-gameplay-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will launch on August 8</a> at $50. Unlike its predecessor, it's a strictly narrative-driven game.

			<p>Gearbox Software president Randy Pitchford recently caught the ire of players regarding the potential price of Borderlands 4 when he told one person <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555">on X that a "real fan"</a> would find a way to pay $80 for the upcoming game if that ended up being the price.</p>
<p>This all started during <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-announces-new-risk-of-rain-2-expansion-and-digs-into-more-details-on-borderlands-4-at-pax-east-2025/">PAX East</a>, when Pitchford was asked what the price of Borderlands 4 would be while Gearbox was presenting on the main stage. Pitchford's answer boiled down to "<em>I don't know</em>," and gave a <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1925108385625809225">long speech</a> about why he didn't know and couldn't give an exact answer about the price, how it's not his decision what the price ends up being, and the many variables that go into pricing a video game.</p>
<p>If he hadn't taken it further than his speech at PAX East, the story of Borderlands 4's pricing would have stopped there, and it wouldn't have come up again until the game's price was officially revealed. But, in response to a player telling Pitchford that, "<em><span>alot of gamers aren't gonna pay 80 dollars and feed this notion of constant increase of the price tag</span></em><span>," he <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-says-a-real-fan-will-find-a-way-to-pay-80-for-borderlands-4-if-that-ends-up-being-the-price/">responded in a way that many deemed to be condescending</a>, using an example of how when he was a kid, he put in the extra work at his minimum wage ice cream shop job to pay for a game he was looking forward to.<br>
</span></p>
<p>He's recently apologized for that response, but not in a way where he necessarily takes ownership for what he said. Instead, Pitchford apologized for the "<em>misunderstanding</em>" of his comments.</p>
<p>"<em><span>I am sorry there was a misunderstanding. The absolute sincere truth is that I don’t want anyone to pay any more than they should or are comfortable with and I always work with the intent and hope that a customer always feels they got the better end of the deal no matter what they</span></em><span><em> pay</em>,</span>" is how he began what is a <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1927802548326650365">very long post on X.</a></p>
<p>Pitchford went on to explain that he believes he "<em>triggered some people</em>" when he used the phrase "<em>real fans,</em>" and that he was in no way making "<em>some big</em> <em>statement,</em>" or that he "<em><span>was taking the audience for granted</span></em>."</p>
<p>A quick scroll through the replies to his apology makes it clear that it did not land with fans the way Pitchford might've hoped. He tries to sound sincere, but as the first reply makes clear, he loses players right from the top, by apologizing for the misunderstanding, instead of just apologizing for what he said, and moving on to his "<em>sincere truth</em>" that he wants anyone who buys his games that they feel like they got the better deal "<em>no matter what they pay</em>."</p>
<p>Video game pricing is currently a sore spot for players, with Mario Kart World officially kicking up the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">potential standard to $80</a>, and the fear that every new, current-generation game will be priced at that new threshold. It's already believed that Take-Two will (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-at-100-would-be-a-bridge-too-far-even-for-grand-theft-auto">at the very least</a>) match Mario Kart World's pricing when they release Grand Theft Auto VI next May.</p>
<p>$70 became the standard only a few short years ago, following the launch of the current-gen consoles. The rest of the industry quickly jumping to $80 is something that players are fearful of, especially when the price of actual life essentials (food, shelter) is going up around the world.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-3-leaked-september-13th/">Borderlands 3</a> came out in 2019, it did so at the then-standard $60 price. It's unlikely that Borderlands 4 will come in at anything less than $70, but it'll be interesting to see how players vote with their wallets when it comes to the seemingly inevitable wave of $80 games.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-expedition-33-story-mode-difficulty-tips</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-clair-obscur%E2%80%99s-story-mode.1201959/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-expedition-33-story-mode-difficulty-tips<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I know it’s dangerous to say these days, but I pride myself on being part of the silent majority. I mean this, of course, in the same sense that everybody means it: I play video games on normal difficulty. Where others ascend the internet’s sheerest cliffs and flaunt their hard, impossible, or nightmare mode accomplishments for all to see, I quietly plug away at the developers’ intended vision;or at least, the one they figure the greatest number of people will interact with. But for the past few weeks, I’ve been playing <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> on “story” mode, a rung down from normal. It’s taken some getting used to.</p><p>I’m fine with a decently difficult experience every once in a while, but that’s not typically what I want out of story-driven role-playing games. I’m there for grand narratives about love that transcend time and space and/or killing god, not a series of encounters that test my will and reflexes. <em>Clair Obscur </em>offers both, and I admire it for that. The bones of its dodge-and-parry-packed turn-based combat are very good; indeed, I would call them one of the main draws of the game. But taken as I immediately was by <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s world and story, my trance was broken the moment I caused Gustave to pirouette into a series of closed fists during a tutorial encounter. I immediately realized that on normal difficulty, I was going to die a lot, and that was going to repeatedly yank me out of the experience.&nbsp;</p><p>So I opened the settings menu and switched over to story mode, a less punishing option <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-story-mode-is-down-to-maelle-actor-and-baldurs-gate-3-favorite-jennifer-english-i-really-want-to-play-this-game-and-i-dont-think-i-can-without-it-being-on-easy-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">born of a request from Maelle’s voice actor</a>, Jennifer English. This made my characters tankier and widened dodge and parry windows ever so slightly. The cumulative effect was a weight off my shoulders; I am by nature a bundle of nerves, but with the looming specter of death removed from many encounters, I was able to calmly – rather than anxiously – find a flow state. I’d get bopped at first, sure, but it was no big deal. I would still have plenty of time to learn the rhythm of different enemy types’ attack patterns.&nbsp;</p><p>However, this gave way to another problem: My relatively worry-free traipse through <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s opening hours felt out of sync with the story it was trying to tell. Gustave, Maelle, and Lune’s journey is one of desperation; a scratching, clawing climb up a mountain of corpses left behind by <a href="https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-journals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generations of previous expeditioners just like themselves</a>. By all rights, they should have been emerging from each battle bloodied and afraid. This same world, after all, had chewed up and spat out their forebears, not to mention their childhood friends. Soon, a new voice wormed its way into my head: “You’re playing the game wrong. You’re <em>not </em>experiencing the developers’ intended vision.”&nbsp;</p><p>This really bothered me for my first ten or so hours with <em>Clair Obscur</em>. I couldn’t decide what I wanted: a friction-free tale that I’d probably enjoy more on the whole or an exercise in frustration that would, in some ways, better serve that story. But as I peeled back more and more of <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s layers, I found that story mode is more than a rebranded easy mode. You can’t just stand still in battle; you won’t instantly die if you fail a few dodgies or parries, but you will die if you fail a few more. Some bosses – especially optional ones – will still one-shot you if you’re not careful. You still need to put some effort into your character builds. In other words, you can’t just turn off your brain. <em>Clair Obscur</em>, even on story mode, demands that you play the video game. Having seen a number of people weigh in on this week’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-good" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Great</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-bad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parry Debate</a> to voice their misgivings with <em>Clair Obscur</em> in particular, I can now say with certainty: Turn on story mode. You’ll have a better time.</p><p>This got me thinking about difficulty as it pertains to games in general, and what I get out of it. I think there’s a meaningful distinction to be made between true, tear-your-hair-out-but-feel-like-you-just-tamed-Moby-Dick difficulty and more illusory, dramatic difficulty. These days, I tend to prefer the latter. I want there to be palpable tension, an implicit understanding that I <em>could </em>lose – even if I probably won’t. I want highs and lows; I just don’t want the lows to come so regularly as to be craterous or all-consuming. Many games, especially single-player ones, try to provide this. Hit boxes are wider or more variable than they might seem. Enemies are designed not to outflank and corner you, but to do interesting things before they ultimately die by your hand.&nbsp;</p><p>Even members of the fabled hard game pantheon, like FromSoftware’s entire <em>Souls</em>/<em>Sekiro</em>/<em>Elden Ring</em> oeuvre, trade in the illusion of difficulty just as much as they do the reality of it. There are means by which to grind or create OP builds to get around tough bosses. You can summon help. There’s a reason, after all, that these singularly challenging experiences have been conquered not just by a small handful of individuals, but instead millions.</p><p>Difficulty is an agent of drama, and at the end of the day, what matters is that you’re getting a level of drama that serves your sensibilities. If you need to get your ass kicked for things to stay interesting, cool! But if, as I’ve learned, all you really want is to see your health meter flash red once every couple hours, that’s fine too. You don’t need to overthink it. Especially in a world as well-realized as <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s, you’re better off just losing yourself in the ride. Because in truth, it’s impossible to know exactly what the developers intended, but a) if they were <em>that </em>precious about it, they’d probably be making movies instead of games, and b) they certainly didn’t intend for you (me) to be in your head the whole time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ushimitsu-gao-beastars"><h3>Ushimitsu Gao Is A Ghost Cuckold Romance Manga For Folks Who Defend Beastars (Me)</h3></a><p>Paru Itagaki let her freak flag fly with Beastars.

            <p>
"BEING A TEENAGER SUCKS. So we made a videogame about it." These are the opening words on the Steam page for Jenny Jiao Hsia's Consume Me, a "life-simulation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>" about feeling "stupid, fat, lazy, and ugly in high school." Now, I'm going to go out on a limb and say many of you that are of a post-high-school age probably don't want to re-experience it anytime soon, but Consume Me looks like such a good time I'm going to suggest you do so anyway, especially because it just got a demo.
</p>

<p>
That self-described genre of life-simulation RPG certainly seems apt as the game sees you do things like performing Tetris-esque puzzles to make a well-balanced breakfast, putting make-up on, and walking your dog. It almost looks like an RPG by way of the mundane sections in any of the modern Persona games, said mundanity amped up and sillified to 11.

<p>
Rather than an RPG mechanically though, there's two things it reminds me of first and foremost. One is the WarioWare series, there's a real oddball minigame feel to a lot of what Consume Me appears to offer, even if it's a bit occasionally a bit slower paced than what the greedy yellow-capped… Wario is. It also reminds me of old Flash games - think Newgrounds, Miniclip, Nitrome, that sort of thing, the kinds of games you'd play during IT classes when you were meant to be putting an Excel sheet about the price of eggs together.
</p>
<p>
I'd actually seen a much, much earlier version of the game at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overthinking-games-the-achievable-goals-of-wobble-yoga">the V&amp;A's Design/Play/Disrupt exhibition</a> way back in, cripes, 2019, and was enamoured by it then. It's great to see how far it's come - it even won the IGF Grand-Prize earlier this year! No release date for this one just yet, but you can go ahead and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2359120/Consume_Me/">wishlist it on Steam and check out that demo anyway</a>.

                <p>One of the most infamous items in Call of Duty is the riot shield, and it's making its Black Ops 6 debut--but not how you might think.</p><p>Now that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-season-4-patch-notes-bo6-and-warzone-update-makes-a-drastic-change-to-solo-br/2900-6623/" data-ref-id="2900-6623">Season 4 update</a> has gone live, the new battle pass is out, too, and one of the rewards is a riot shield-themed finishing move. As you can see in the video below, the finishing move animation involves the attacker smacking their foe with the shield and then hitting them with a pipe. The finishing move is called "On the Ground" and it's on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-season-4-battle-pass-adds-stitch-and-two-new-guns-in-bo6-and-warzone/2900-6616/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6616">page 9 of the battle pass.</a></p><p>People have pointed out that it appears to be the Call of Duty: Vanguard-era riot shield that's now in Black Ops 6.</p><p>Activision confirmed prior to Black Ops 6's launch in 2024 that the riot shield <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-wont-have-the-controversial-riot-shield-at-launch/1100-6527297/" data-ref-id="1100-6527297">would not be in the game upon release</a>, and indeed it's still not in the game for functional gameplay purposes beyond the finisher.</p><p>The riot shield can be particularly frustrating to run up against in matches because it deflects incoming fire and requires players to try different tactics to defeat a player using it. Skilled players who successfully utilize the riot shield can sway the flow of any given match, especially so in certain modes like Hardpoint and Domination. Some people love the riot shield and others very much do not.</p><p>Black Ops 6 does already have a shield, of sorts, as players can use their enemies as a "meat shield" similar to the long-running feature in the Gears of War games. If a player can successfully sneak up behind an enemy, they can choose to use them as a body shield for a period of time, or execute them immediately.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-season-4-all-the-new-black-ops-6-multiplayer-maps-including-fan-favorite-remaster/2900-6609/" data-ref-id="2900-6609">new maps</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-new-call-of-duty-season-4-guns-and-how-to-unlock-them-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/2900-6617/" data-ref-id="2900-6617">guns</a> in the Season 4 update, along with our breakdown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-season-4-battle-pass-adds-stitch-and-two-new-guns-in-bo6-and-warzone/2900-6616/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6616">what's in the new battle pass.</a> The Zombies mode, meanwhile, gets a big update with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-grief-mode-explained/1100-6531917/" data-ref-id="1100-6531917">introduction of Grief mode.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-and-limbo-are-free-on-the-epic-games-store/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next two free games up for grabs as part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store 2025 Mega Sale</a> are <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/tiny-tinas-wonderlands" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/limbo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Limbo</a>.</p>
<p>The first game is the 2022 spin-off of the Borderlands series, built as a sequel of sorts to Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep, a Borderlands 2 DLC. The premise is completely different and more familiar to fans of tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons: the titular Tiny Tina is the dungeon master of a fictional tabletop RPG called Bunkers &amp; Badasses, and the twist is that she can modify the game world on the fly at her whim.</p>
<p>The game turned out to be quite successful in terms of sales (which exceeded the expectations of publisher Take-Two) and average critic score. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands earned an 8.5/10 score here on Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tiny-tinas-wonderlands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Rosh Kelly</a>:</p>
<p><em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, with its fantasy setting, tabletop homage, and constant references, takes the world exploration in a different direction. For the first time in the Borderlands IP, players will have an overworld to wander through, complete with side quests and secrets. This travel by map can make the locations feel a bit unconnected, but it also allows for a huge variety of places to delve into. And once you’ve reached your location, you’ll have the full experience you’re used to.</em></p>
<p>The other game gamers can grab for free this week on the Epic Games Store is Limbo, the masterpiece puzzle/platform/horror indie game released in 2010. Limbo was developed by Playdead, a Danish studio also known for 2016's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/inside-review-what/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inside</a>. In the game, an unnamed boy roams traps and dangerous environments in the desperate search for his sister. Limbo received multiple awards and accolades, winning the coveted Game of the Year prize at the Game Developers Choice Awards and BAFTA Video Game Awards in 2010.</p>
<p>As usual, both games are available to be permanently added to your Epic Games Store library as long as you grab them before next Thursday at 5 PM.</p>

But it will be completely new, partially because so many people died in season one. </p><p> “We killed everyone in the season,” Gunn told <em>EW</em>. “So we kind of had to [film a new intro]. Everyone died! Also, we have a lot of new cast members — Tim Meadows is Langston Fleury, Sol Rodriguez is Sasha Bordeaux, and Michael Rooker’s in the cast, Judomaster is a bigger character this time — so I knew that I needed to do a new dance.” </p><p>And yes, there will be a new song, though ditching Wig Wam’s infectiously catchy “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/fOdSUtGmxwU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/fOdSUtGmxwU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Do You Wanna Taste It</a></span>?” was a tough decision for Gunn. </p><p> “I really went back and forth an awful lot,” said the showrunner. “And at the end of the day, I decided that we use a new song that’s a little bit more about what the season’s about.” </p><p>And for all you fans of Eagly out there, you’ll get to see the bird try to dance this time around. Gunn told <em>EW </em>that in this new intro, we see Peacemaker’s eagle pet try to “dance for the first time.” </p><p>“He is not the best at it, but he tries to really join in the dance sequence at the end. He’s got a little pose this time,” said Gunn. </p><p>Gunn admits that he’s unsure if the new dance sequence will “one-up” the original featured in season one, but that’s okay because he just wants to make something good that people will like, even if it doesn’t get “4 billion views on TikTok.” </p><p>“[The popularity of the original dancing intro] was a complete surprise, and you just can’t replicate that,” said Gunn. “However, the surprises within the show itself, I think, replicate that many times over, because there are so many more twists and turns in this season with what happens and what you find out about this universe.”</p><p><em>Peacemaker</em> finally returns after nearly three years away on August 21 on HBO Max. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hbo-max-dead-back-streaming-service-old-name-wb-zaslav-1851780622&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hbo-max-dead-back-streaming-service-old-name-wb-zaslav-1851780622">Yes, it’s called HBO Max again.</a></span> </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/with-thousands-still-to-test-nintendo-says-no-issues-for-most-switch-games-on-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Nintendo's Switch 2 has a small handful of new releases in its launch lineup, but for the first few months after its release, the main thing you'll be able to play on it will be your existing library of Switch games. And while Nintendo has promised reasonably comprehensive backward compatibility, the company is still working through the process of testing over 15,000 third-party Switch games with the new console.</p>
<p>With a week to go until launch, Nintendo has updated its compatibility support page with the results of nearly two months of extra testing. Of the "over 15,000" third-party Switch games, Nintendo says roughly two-thirds of them either have "no issues" or have problems that will be resolved quickly at or after launch. On the original version of this support page, Nintendo had only performed its basic compatibility testing on roughly 20 percent of all third-party Switch games.</p>
<p>Nintendo says that nearly all of the roughly 5,000 remaining Switch games will launch just fine on the Switch 2 but that "further tests" are "in progress." The support page doesn't say when Nintendo will provide its next update.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also updated PDF documents listing <a href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN_05272025.pdf?_gl=1*1ux5pd1*_gcl_au*NDM5NzMzNjM0LjE3NDY4MTQ5MjU.*_ga*NTkwMzgzMjEwLjE3NDY4MTQ5MjU.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NDg1MzUxMTIkbzUkZzAkdDE3NDg1MzU2MzUkajYwJGwwJGgxNjYzMzE0MjY5">individual games that won't launch</a>, games that start up but have <a href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-launchable_compatibility_issues_EN_05272025.pdf?_gl=1*1ux5pd1*_gcl_au*NDM5NzMzNjM0LjE3NDY4MTQ5MjU.*_ga*NTkwMzgzMjEwLjE3NDY4MTQ5MjU.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NDg1MzUxMTIkbzUkZzAkdDE3NDg1MzU2MzUkajYwJGwwJGgxNjYzMzE0MjY5">some other kind of compatibility problem</a>, and games with problems that should be "<a href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-issues_to_be_addressed_EN_05272025.pdf?_gl=1*1ux5pd1*_gcl_au*NDM5NzMzNjM0LjE3NDY4MTQ5MjU.*_ga*NTkwMzgzMjEwLjE3NDY4MTQ5MjU.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NDg1MzUxMTIkbzUkZzAkdDE3NDg1MzU2MzUkajYwJGwwJGgxNjYzMzE0MjY5">addressed by launch or shortly after</a>."</p>
<p>Nearly all of the 122 first-party Nintendo games will run fine on the Switch 2, with the only exceptions being the Nintendo Labo cardboard kits that were made with the physical dimensions of the original Switch in mind. Additionally, some games that use features of the original Switch Joy-Cons will only work if you pair an external Joy-Con with the Switch 2.</p>

Sapienza--the quaint Italian coastal town from the 2016 Hitman game--is currently being given away as part of the free-to-play Hitman: World of Assassination starter pack. Normally, this edition of the game only gives you a barebones experience with the ICA training missions--and Sapienza on its own is a $10 purchase--but for the low price of absolutely nothing, it can be yours if you claim it before <strong>9 AM PT / 1 PM ET on May 30</strong>.</p><p>Even after nine years, Sapienza is still regarded as one of the all-time best Hitman maps. It has everything you could ask for, from beautiful architecture to secret underground labs, and there are multiple ways to take care of the targets in this map. These range from booting scientist Silvio Caruso off of a cliffside after you feed him tainted spaghetti to disguising yourself as his therapist and smothering him to death with a pillow.</p><p>As mentioned above, you're only getting Sapienza and the ICA missions in this download. Hitman: World of Assassination has a confusing pricing model, as there are currently <em>five </em>different editions of the game to purchase with varying levels of content spread across them. World of Assassination is a compilation of Hitman 1-3, the soft reboot of the game series that began in 2016.</p><p>While the first Hitman game saw each stage released via an episodic model, Hitman 2 and 3 were full releases following IO Interactive's departure from Square Enix. Each sequel introduced several improvements and new ideas to the formula established in Hitman 2016, and they were also retroactively incorporated into the older games.</p><p>Developer IO Interactive is also working on a James Bond video game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-project-007-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/">which currently has the working title of Project 007</a>. The studio is aiming to craft an original take on the world-famous super-spy, and the game was first announced in November 2020, and one of the confirmed platforms for it is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>

What do you think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/islands-and-trains">Islands &amp; Trains</a> is about? I'm not going to give you long, because it really is just right there in the name. As you've presumably already guessed, it is a quaint-looking sandbox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> where you make tiny diorama-like islands, adorning them with tracks for trains to choo-choo along. I told you, it's a name that does what it says on the tin, and if it appeals to you at all, well, there's some good news, as it just came out today.
</p>

<p>
Islands &amp; Trains for the most part looks like one of those kind of build-your-own screensaver type of games, without the screen saving part. Developer Akos Makovics specifically cited games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/islanders">Islanders</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dorfromantik">Dorfromantik</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/townscaper">Townscaper</a> as influences, all titles with a focus on making peaceful places to look at with a hopeful sense of ease. So, if they're up your alley, this one probably will be too.

<p>
There's apparently over 400 types of tiles to play around with, lots of variations amongst those too, and you'll notice animals like cows and ducks flocking in as you build up your city. I'm not typically a sandbox builder kind of person myself, and yet looking at it I can't help but harken back to my own childhood playing with my dad's model railway. 
</p>
<p>
He wasn't the kind of model train enthusiast that had all the extremities like sets and tiny trees, so imagination was key to building up a picture. Islands &amp; Trains looks like a nice opportunity to express that childlike sense of train-oriented curiosity. You can pick it up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1957760/Islands__Trains/">Steam</a> right now if it takes your fancy.

But the big news is that the Switch App will now let you upload screenshots and videos from the Switch 2 directly to your phone without needing to use a QR code. You can even set the Switch 2 to automatically upload up to 100 screenshots and videos to the app. These will remain available to download from your phone for 30 days. Even better, this new feature is available for free, no paid Switch Online membership is needed. However, this new option is only available on the Switch 2. </p><p>Some other great changes include the ability to add friends via the app itself, and the ability to receive notifications on your phone when your friends log on.</p><p>A lot of these features are things that have existed in Sony and Microsoft’s apps and consoles for years now, so it does feel like Nintendo is finally catching up. Still, it’s nice that the Switch app on phones will feel more modern and be far more useful. As someone who never shared a screenshot from my Switch to my phone, I was gobsmacked that you had to use a QR code and transfer it over wifi. Using the cloud and letting the console do it automatically is a huge improvement. </p><p>Here are the full patch notes for the big update:</p><h2 id="h728003"><a id=""></a><strong>Switch App 3.0.1 patch notes</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The app name has changed from Nintendo Switch Online to Nintendo Switch App. Elements of the app design have been updated.</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 consoles are now supported. </li><li>Screenshots and videos saved in your console’s album can now be uploaded to the app. </li><li>You can now receive GameChat invitations.</li><li>More friend features are now available in the app.</li><li>You can now add friends via the app.</li><li>You can choose to receive a notification in the app when a friend comes online.</li></ul><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Various other small improvements and bug fixes have been made.</li></ul><p>&nbsp; .</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-gets-review-bombed-again-this-time-over-its-big-battle-for-super-earth<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The battle for Super Earth is raging on in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a>, as players fight to hold back the invading Illuminate fleet. A new controversy surrounding the invasion, though, has led to some frustration and a fresh flood of negative reviews.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To set the stage, the latest update for Helldivers 2 — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-finally-brings-the-illuminate-invasion-to-the-streets-of-super-earth">Heart of Democracy </a>— brought months and months of storyline building to fruition. The Meridian Singularity, a black hole formed during an operation against Terminids, had been flung towards Super Earth as the tip of the spear for an Illuminate invasion. The "Great Host" fleet flooded through the now-wormhole and onto Super Earth, turning the planet into a battlefield.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the days since the update went live, players have fought to hold the various Mega Cities of Super Earth, which correspond to major cities in real-life. York Supreme, for example, corresponds roughly to New York, and Remembrance to Buenos Aires. As the invasion has continued, more and more cities have fallen; as of this writing, only Equality-On-Sea (Shanghai) and Super Earth's capital, Prosperity City (Stockholm) remain standing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the invasion has approached what feels like endgame, a <em>lot </em>has happened. Helldivers players tend to "get into character" and play up the Major Orders, rallying behind different causes and calls to try and beat each new challenge that developer Arrowhead lobs at them. Some, for example, stopped playing matches on Super Earth to contribute to a new effort in another sector against the Automaton forces, which ultimately brought the DSS — a massive military orbital space station — <a href="https://x.com/Helldivers_NOW/status/1927759821836538125" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back to Super Earth</a> to assist with the defensive efforts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Illuminate gaining ground and taking Mega Cities, efforts rallied behind Equality-On-Sea to make a last stand. Amid all this, there was a sense of comradery extended across nations; as more players dropped in to raise Equality-On-Sea's percentage and hold it against the Great Host, memes and support flooded in. Even as the Illuminate focused efforts on the city, players held out and kept diving.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's all been fairly heartwarming and exciting stuff, the sort of emergent story that Helldivers 2 is quite capable of forging in its greatest moments; where developer storylines, player investment, and community efforts result in some really brilliant moments of cooperative war theater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Equality-On-Sea never hit 100%. From here, the situation gets a little more complex, and a lot rougher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While players made a concerted effort to hold Equality-On-Sea against the continued onslaught, the current arc closed with the cities' percentage meter at 99.9783% (keep that number in mind). Most Major Orders and operations in Helldivers are about completion, a binary success-or-failure state. As some have pointed out, though, there might have been confusion about what the percentage meter meant in the defense of Super Earth. Rather than "liberating" a city and re-taking it, players are holding it. So it stands to reason that Helldivers might not be able to "100%" the defense, because the Illuminate are continuing to invade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, alongside theories that the war is narrowing down to an ultimate showdown in Super Earth's capital of Prosperity City, seems to be the main driver behind a new influx of negative reviews on Steam. As of this writing, roughly 2,312 negative reviews of Helldivers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have been submitted to Steam</a> in the last 24 hours compared to 324 positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the negative reviews are in Chinese, and while the machine translation doesn't seem accurate enough to quote, there are some recurring points one can easily glean: frustration over driving the narrative, the perception of a thumb on the scale from Arrowhead, and repeat mentions of "99.9783%."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Helldivers NOW (@Helldivers_NOW) <a href="https://twitter.com/Helldivers_NOW/status/1928075624414920862?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 29, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, it's important to keep this all in context. Yes, there is a fresh round of negative reviews on the game, and it's obviously a larger amount than the average trickle of reviews. It also still, at this moment, pales in comparison to the more-infamous review-bombing of Helldivers 2 from May 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-ceo-apologizes-amid-helldivers-2-review-bombing">where thousands upon thousands of negative reviews flooded in over PSN requirements</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are, broadly, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ky6fp6/can_we_not_reviewbomb_the_game_because_were/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">understandably</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ky8p1o/we_cant_ever_have_anything_nice/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frustrated</a>. This should be a peak in Helldivers 2 history, as both the culmination of a long-running storyline and one of the cooler in-game moments Arrowhead has concocted. I've spent some time diving on Super Earth, and it's really an incredible feat. Arrowhead has nailed the feeling of holding out in these Mega Cities as massive, terrifying Illuminate forces rampage through, causing wanton destruction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And because so much of this is all tied into national identity, the previous sense of international comradery has been tainted a bit too. Even as players, mods, and fan accounts have <a href="https://x.com/Helldivers_NOW/status/1928044854225031493" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">urged players</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ky7jdu/comment/muw298u/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not get caught up</a> in the controversy, it has put a tinge of a bad taste on this otherwise incredible moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of this writing, Helldivers are still holding out across the Mega Cities of Equality-On-Sea and Prosperity City, with the former holding the higher percentage. It looks like the battle for Super Earth is entering its final phase, and the current order is simple: Hold Super Earth. Hopefully players can still hold out, seize victory, and celebrate the good in all this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> isn't the only racing game coming exclusively to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> when the console launches next week. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fast-fusion/" data-ref-id="5000-671284">Fast Fusion</a> is the latest entry in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/f-zero-is-going-through-a-quiet-resurgence/1100-6531839/" data-ref-id="1100-6531839">F-Zero-inspired</a> Fast series, and a new launch trailer gives us a closer look at what we can expect from the racing game.</p><p>The video, which you can watch in the embed below, shows off how the Switch 2 is powering Fast Fusion high-speed hovercar racing. In addition to giving a sense for how the racing gameplay will look, the trailer also reveals some of the new environments and tracks coming with the game. Gameplay footage from the trailer is running at 4K/60FPS, which the game will support out of the box. We also get a glimpse of how vehicle creation will work in the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB5Hf2HIroc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XB5Hf2HIroc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fast Fusion is a third-party game, developed by Shin'en Multimedia, and so this marks one of the first looks at a third-party Switch 2 exclusive that we've seen. As such, the trailer gives us some insight into how non-Nintendo developers might be able to take advantage of the Switch 2's improved hardware.</p><p>Fast Fusion launches on June 5 concurrently with the Switch 2, and it'll cost $15. It is the follow-up to Fast RMX, which launched on the original Switch in 2017 to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/phoenix-cms/articles/form/">decent critical reception</a>. Fast Fusion is one of the few true Switch 2 exclusives among <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">the console's launch-day lineup</a>.</p><p>If you're lucky enough to have grabbed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2 preorder</a>, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">all of the Switch 2 games confirmed so far</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/" data-ref-id="2900-6398">the original Switch games that are getting updated versions</a>.
