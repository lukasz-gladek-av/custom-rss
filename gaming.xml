Some of them are also using Microsoft’s AI upscaling to reach that frame rate and resolution target, though the website keeps track of that, too. </p><p>In a Build session, Microsoft and Qualcomm showed us how <em>Borderlands 3</em> runs about 60 percent faster with Auto Super Resolution versus native 1440p by tapping into the Qualcomm chip’s NPU, for example:</p><p>Though Auto Super Res could maintain the same frame rate at a higher effective resolution instead:</p><p>Anyhow, 747 games are currently listed as running at a “perfect” 1080p and 60fps, including <em>Control Ultimate Edition</em>, and it should be easy to check against Linaro’s findings when final devices come out.</p><p>Here’s the whole list of 19 “unplayable” games so far, like <em>Fortnite, Roblox, </em>and <em>PUBG</em>, many of which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23999300/fortnite-on-steam-deck-sweeney-says-valve-needs-tens-of-millions-of-users-to-justify-it">famously don’t run on the Steam Deck</a> due to their anti-cheat measures:</p><p>Microsoft says that the BattlEye anti-cheat system does support Arm, though support wasn’t necessarily enough to get big games that use it onto the Steam Deck.</p><p>As far as the accuracy of these tests, Linaro says:</p><div><blockquote><p>The information is intended to serve as a guide, but does not absolutely guarantee that a game will run. The results have been tested, but may not work on your specific machine and configuration. If your results differ, please contribute to the site with your own findings.</p></blockquote></div><div><p>If you want to submit your own results, Linaro is taking your contributions — <a href="https://www.worksonwoa.com/contributing">in the form of commits and pull requests</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, UK developer The Chinese Room (which is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently busy with Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>) unveiled the PC system requirements for Still Wakes the Deep. The upcoming first-person horror game is powered by Unreal Engine 5, but the minimum and recommended requirements <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1622910/Still_Wakes_the_Deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listed on the Steam page</a> don't appear to be too high:</p>
<div><p><strong>MINIMUM:</strong></p><ul>
<li>

<li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 (64-bit required) with DirectX 12</li>

<p>The Chinese Room also unveiled the voice cast of Still Wakes the Deep. Protagonist Cameron "Caz" McLeary will be played by Alec Newman, who has a long track record in the industry. He previously played Vangarre in Xenoblade Chronicles, Lahabrea in Final Fantasy XIV, Sebastian Vael in Dragon Age II, Arthur Tailles in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, Apprentice Maraad and Captain Joris in Star Wars: The Old Republic, Simon Belmont in Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate, Finn in Dragon Age: Inquisition, Graden in The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, Jack the Ripper in the eponymous Assassin's Creed Syndicate DLC, Kram Namwen in Star Wars: Battlefront II, Robert in A Plague Tale: Innocence, Walla in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Adam Smasher (among others) in Cyberpunk 2077, Aitor in Dying Light 2: Stay Human, Blameless Marad in Horizon: Forbidden West, and Vladimir Blum in Alan Wake II. Newman said of his role:</p>
<p><em>The thing was so well written, and so well-conceived, that I don't recall having very long conversations about what Caz should sound like. With this, you can feel the writing, you can feel the characters.</em></p>
<p>The rest of the Still Wakes the Deep cast is notable, too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neve McIntosh as Suze</li>
<li>Karen Dunbar</li>
<li>Michael Abubakar</li>
<li>Clive Russell</li>
<li>Shaun Dooley</li>
<li>Stewart Scudamore</li>
<li>Nicholas Boulton</li>
<li>Duncan Pow</li>
<li>Sandy Batchelor</li>
<li>Alan Turkington</li>
<li>Noof Ousellam</li>
</ul>
<p>In the game, players will step into the role of an oil rig worker when the off-shore platform he works on gets cut out from the world by a violent storm. As you might expect from a horror game, that's the least of the problems for the main character and the rest of the workers.</p>
<p>Still Wakes the Deep is set to launch on June 18 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/endless-ocean-luminous-guide-unlock-all-99-mystery-board-squares/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/endless-ocean-luminous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Endless Ocean Luminous</a>, the latest in Nintendo and developer Arika’s cult aquatic exploration games, is out now, and completing the game’s story mode is no easy task. Doing so requires you to completely fill in the “Mystery Board,” a grid featuring 99 different achievement-style tasks. To make matters even more complicated, the game doesn’t inform you how to solve any of these mysteries, you just have to stumble on the solutions yourself through trial and error. But hey, if you're not up for that grind, scroll on down for our guide to unlocking all 99 squares on the Mystery Board.</p>
<h2><strong>Mystery Board Basics</strong></h2>
<p>The maps in Endless Ocean Luminous are procedurally generated, which means I can’t provide you with specific locations or instructions on how to unlock any of the squares on the Mystery Board – it’s all luck of the draw. That said, there are different types of achievements on the board, so here’s some guidance on how to approach them.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFendlessoceanluminous18.jpg"></a></figure>

<ul>
<li><strong>Disc Puzzles</strong> – These mysteries ask you to “swim aside” a specific creature (look at #32 below for an example). How these puzzles work, is you have to find a large disc on the ocean floor and scan it. You’ll then be given a clue. Determine what creature the clue was referring to, find them, have them swim with you and return to the disc with them.</li>
<li><strong>UMLs</strong> – Number 9 though 18 on the board require you to scan specific UMLs (Unique Marine Lifeforms). <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/endless-ocean-luminous-guide-how-to-find-uml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here’s how to make a UML appear on your map</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Coins</strong> – These coins can be randomly found while scavenging (look for glints of light on the ocean floor).</li>
<li><strong>Treasure Chests</strong> – Look for treasure chests (they look like blue and black blocks) and open them to hopefully find the specific treasure required.</li>
<li><strong>Tablets</strong> – The mysteries with quotes like #3 below are acquired by finding small lore tablets.</li>
<li><strong>Landmarks</strong> - Simply swim past the landmark in question.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, without further ado, here’s how to unlock all 99 squares on Endless Ocean Luminous’ Mystery Board…</p>

<p>And there you go – that’s what's required to unlock the entire Mystery Board. Again, Endless Ocean Luminous maps are randomized, so there’s going to be a fair amount of trial and error and repetition required to do it all. This <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nDyqI1o-PZeiLFLTHX9ty66ye8RbkLNWEFKQ6jOkpyY/edit#gid=1941491767" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit spreadsheet</a> does include a handful of <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/endless-ocean-luminous-guide-how-to-replay-past-maps-including-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dive-Site IDs</a> that will take you to specific maps that contain some of the harder-to-solve mysteries, but beyond that, you’re just going to have to stick with it.</p>
<p>Endless Ocean Luminous can be played on Nintendo Switch. You can check out&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/endless-ocean-luminous-guides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech’s other Endless Ocean Luminous guides here</a>.</p>

  <p id="BBlKfn"><strong>Archie</strong> returns to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-witch-queen-guide/23392341/beginners-guide-starting-tips-lightfall-expansion"><em>Destiny 2</em></a> with a trip to the <strong>Dreaming City </strong>following the May 21, 2024, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24144172/weekly-reset-time-when">weekly reset</a>.</p>
<p id="09PAOE">This is the latest in a series of “<strong>Where in the System is Archie</strong>” quests in the wake of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24124384/destiny-2-into-the-light-patch-notes-onslaught-whisper-zero-hour">Into the Light</a> update — which are being staggered out week-by-week in the lead up to <em>The Final Shape.</em></p>
<p id="BmOKAA">Note this quest expires on the May 28 <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24144172/weekly-reset-time-when">weekly reset</a>, and will be replaced by another Archie quest in a new location. Remember, provided you complete <em>any </em>Archie quest before the arrival of <em>The Final Shape</em>, you’ll get your hands on the Blue Steel shader, while the lore for all Archie quests will be available from June 4 on. </p>

<hr id="SoOGoo">

<p id="7yPZPt">To start the latest “Where is Archie” quest, head to the Tower’s Annex and find the paw prints. For future reference, this is where you’ll find the beginning of every Archie quest each week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161951/ubisoft-xdefiant-unable-to-find-match-launch-day-troubles<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="U4ExXh">People dipping into Ubisoft’s free-to-play arena shooter <em>XDefiant</em> are unable to access matchmaking due to connectivity issues, Ubisoft confirmed Tuesday. “We’re aware that some players are unable to join a game — please bear with us while we look into servers and matchmaking,” <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1792971101233959058">a representative posted from the official X account</a>.</p>
<p id="q2T219">Players are reporting that they’re endlessly stuck searching for other players before receiving an “Unable to Find Match” message. <em>XDefiant </em>officially launched around 1 p.m. EDT, and players almost immediately started facing issues as people flooded to the game. “Matchmaking servers go boom!” <em>XDefiant</em> executive producer Mark Rubin posted on X shortly after launch. “We are working on it.”</p>

<p id="TqTn5n">Ubisoft’s later <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1792992558278217888">updates suggest <em>XDefiant</em>’s server woes</a> are improving, but it also noted the team is still investigating. The company will continue to update players as progress continues. </p>
<p id="KPAg3a"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23680459/xdefiant-preview-release-date-tom-clancy-ubisoft"><em>XDefiant</em> is free-to-play, 6v6 shooter</a> that lets people play as one of five factions based off Ubisoft properties: Libertad revolutionaries from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/far-cry-6/40685"><em>Far Cry 6</em></a>;<em> </em>ex-Ghost Recon specialists known as Phantoms; agents from Splinter Cell’s Echelon spy agency; DedSec street hackers from <em>Watch Dogs</em>; and the Cleaners, former sanitation workers from The Division series. Players can swap factions and weapon loadouts throughout the game, similar to switching characters in <em>Overwatch</em>.</p>
<p id="70Xfhd">Ubisoft intended to release <em>XDefiant</em> in October 2023, but ended up <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisofts-call-of-duty-rival-xdefiant-delayed-indefinitely">delaying the game</a> indefinitely. <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1773741916057665967">Ubisoft then expected <em>XDefiant</em> to be out by March</a>, which got pushed once again. The company is looking toward <em>XDefiant</em> to bolster its place in the live-service space, <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/52CZPA6t2S0cuqWQNd7HFo/55f5a6a5ce31644077755e0b93233b04/Ubisoft_FY24_Q3_PR_English.pdf">according to a February financial report</a>.</p>
<p id="Bhx64F">Overloaded servers might not sound like the worst problem to have — it typically means a lot of people are trying to play. But a free-to-play game with a bad launch runs the risk of its players moving onto something else, if they can’t get in; there’s no real shortage of other shooters for prospective <em>XDefiant</em> play instead.</p>

<p data-characters="448" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s first saga is about to enter its endgame with the launch of&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>&nbsp;expansion on June 4. In the build-up to the game’s next chapter, Bungie has been taking the time to showcase sneak peeks at certain content, like the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-showcases-dread-forces-ahead-of-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Dread enemies</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-shows-off-destiny-2-the-final-shape-exotic-class-armor/" rel="noreferrer noopener">unique Exotic armor</a>. Now, the studio is diving into the nitty gritty, explaining how weapons and their Perks are due to change in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>.</p> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true">Typically, Bungie rebalances weapons and Perks twice an expansion, with one overhaul coming just before launch and another happening around the mid-way point. While these changes may see a powerful gun or Perk combination fall out of favor, the alterations are made in the spirit of keeping&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s meta fresh. Not only are most weapons seeing some kind of change with&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>, but Bungie’s also taking a swing at some over-relied-upon strategies.</p>
 <h2 id="h-weapon-changes" data-injectable="false">Weapon changes</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="765" data-injectable="true">In a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/weapon_tuning_the_final_shape" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dev Insights post</a>, Bungie detailed how weapons would be tuned in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>. The studio kicked things off with changes to weapon mods, mentioning that Boss Spec, Taken Spec, Minor Spec, Major Spec, and Adept Big Ones Spec would be absent for the expansion. However, Bungie noted that all weapon base damage has increased to offset this. Conversely, the damage bonus for Exotic primary weapons and trace rifles has been decreased from 40% to 30%.</p>
 <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">Additionally, Bungie will remove the damage bonus Kinetic weapons have against bosses, and burst weapons will shoot a number of shots reflective of their burst type. Here’s how weapon archetypes are specifically changing:</p> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Pulse Rifles</strong> – 20% damage buff to all PvE enemies (excluding Graviton Lance and Revision Zero). Additional 15% damage increase to Minors (includes Graviton Lance and Revision Zero).</li> <li><strong>Pellet shotguns</strong> – 10% damage buff to all PvE enemies (not including Legend of Acrius, Tractor Cannon, Conditional Finality, or The Fourth Horseman).</li> <li><strong>Slug shotguns</strong> – 9% damage buff to all PvE enemies.</li> <li><strong>Fusion rifles</strong> – 7% damage buff to all PvE enemies (excluding One Thousand Voices).</li> <li><strong>Sniper rifles</strong> – 7% damage buff to all PvE enemies (excluding Izanagi’s Burden’s Honed Edge shots and Cloudstrike’s storm). Minimum reserves have been increased to 17 from 14.</li> <li><strong>Glaives</strong> – 7% damage increase to projectile damage against all PvE enemies.</li> <li><strong>Linear fusion rifles</strong> – 5% damage increase against all PvE enemies. Adaptive Frame linears benefit from decreased recoil and “firing animation kick.”</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Auto rifles</strong> – 15% damage buff against Minor PvE enemies.</li> <li><strong>Sidearms</strong> – 20% damage increase against Minor PvE enemies.</li> <li><strong>Trace Rifles</strong> – 20% damage increase against Minor and Major PvE enemies.</li> <li><strong>Scout Rifles</strong> – 20% damage increase against Minor PvE enemies. Updated hip-fire aim reticle.</li> <li><strong>Bows</strong> – 20% damage increase against Minor PvE enemies.</li> <li><strong>Submachine guns</strong> – 10% damage increase against Minor PvE enemies.</li> <li><strong>Handcannons</strong> – 5% damage increase against Minor PvE enemies. Increased stats for Crimil’s Dagger and Something New.</li> <li><strong>Machine guns</strong> – 7% damage increase against all foes (including PvP).</li> <li><strong>Swords</strong> – 7% damage increase against all foes (including PvP). Sword reticles will display the weapon’s charge state in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>.</li> <li><strong>Wave frame grenade launchers</strong> – The Blast Radius stat will dictate the size of the weapon’s wave in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>. At 50, the wave will be roughly the same size as it is now, going up or down from there with the stat. Special ammo wave frames will have their wave’s length reduced to 15 meters from 22.</li> </ul>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Exotic weapon changes</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true">Alongside the more general weapon tuning, Bungie also targeted a few specific Exotic weapons. Before the studio got into specifics weapon by weapon, it did note that certain Exotic primary weapons proved too powerful with the above buffs, so Sunshot, Trinity Ghoul, Polaris Lance, and Graviton Lance will each see a 10% decrease in splash damage. </p>
 <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="180" data-injectable="false">Additionally, Borealis, Hard Light, and Dead Messenger’s The Fundamentals Perk will see alterations persist through death. Here’s how other Exotic weapons are changing:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Divinity </strong>– It will take 75% more hits before the weak spot (or “cage”) appears.</li> <li><strong>Rat King </strong>– Rat King will now use the same auto-firing animation as other sidearms.</li> <li><strong>Devil’s Ruin</strong> – The unique firing animation can no longer be applied to other weapons by switching to them while the animation is active.</li> <li><strong>Symmetry </strong>– Catalyst additionally grants +10 Reload Speed, +10 Handling, and the Eddy Current Perk.</li> <li><strong>Gjallarhorn </strong>– Wolfpack rounds now accounts for different elemental visual effects.</li> <li><strong>Touch of Malice</strong> – The burn effect applied by the Darkness Ball has been increased to 3.5 seconds from 2 seconds.</li> <li><strong>Osteo Striga</strong> – Added a 4-second cooldown between poison AOEs from defeated enemies. Poison AOEs from continuous damage are unchanged.</li> <li><strong>Necrochasm </strong>– The burn effect from the Cursed Thrall detonation has increased to 3.5 seconds from 2 seconds, and its Intrinsic Trait now increases Reload Speed after precision kills. The Catalyst has also been reworked, rewarding bonus damage, range, and aim assist after rapidly damaging three enemies.</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>The Lament</strong> – 20% decrease to healing received from The Lament and a 20% damage decrease to high-chain revved heavy attacks.</li> <li><strong>Dead Man’s Tale</strong> – Stacks of Cranial Spike will now add +2 Stability and will provide a more noticeable increase to Reload Speed. Per Bungie, the Catalyst will see some “slightly reduced accuracy benefits,” but this will be compensated by the rise to its RPM, going to 140 from 130, and replacing the PvE-only damage buff with one that offers a 15% damage bonus when at full stacks of Cranial Spike.</li> <li><strong>The Colony</strong> – Kills now create extra insect grenades, with tougher foes spawning more.</li> <li><strong>Truth </strong>– Increased AOE damage to compensate for no impact damage and increased reserves by 3.</li> <li><strong>Queenbreaker </strong>– 12% damage increase to bosses, minibosses, Champions, and vehicles. Reserve ammo capacity was also increased by 3.</li> <li><strong>Cerberus+1</strong> – Catalyst rework makes Focus Fire activate with a special reload following a kill and no longer decreases range or fire rate.</li> <li><strong>Bastion </strong>– The Saint’s Fists Perk has been reimagined, increasing charge rate, damage, and reload speed after damaging a foe with a melee. The Perk also now provides a melee damage boost if players hit an enemy with all projectiles in a shot.</li> <li><strong>Eriana’s Vow</strong> – Destroying a Solar shield or an Anti-Barrier Champion’s barrier ignites the target.</li> <li><strong>Deterministic Chaos</strong> – The machine gun will have an intrinsic Anti-Barrier, and its Perks have been updated a bit. Heavy Metal will imbue every fourth bullet with Volatile, and Vexadecimal&nbsp;makes every 16th bullet weaken targets.</li> </ul>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Perk changes</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true">Much like weapons, Perks need a refresh from time to time, too. Here are the Perks changing in The Final Shape and how they’ll be different:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Alacrity </strong>– No longer works in Rumble PvP.</li> <li><strong>Archer’s Gambit</strong> – Will see a reduction to the Perk’s draw time increase from 66% to 60%. The base buff duration will also drop to 4 seconds, but it can be stacked up to the original 8 seconds.</li> <li><strong>Grave Robber</strong> will trigger via both Powered Melee and regular Melee eliminations.</li> <li><strong>Chain Reaction</strong> – 20% less damage and have a 15% smaller radius on Special weapons. The radius remains unchanged on heavy weapons, and damage is increased by 30%.</li> <li><strong>Eddy Current</strong> – Activation will happen after sprinting for 1.5 seconds instead of 3 seconds. It will also buff Handling and scale up all stats by 5%. Being Amplified automatically applies the Perk at peak effectiveness.</li> <li><strong>Underdog</strong> – Will be swapped out for Pulse Monitor on all weapons.</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Osmosis and Permeability</strong> – Now partially fill ammo upon activation and no longer fall off when pulling out a Ghost.</li> <li><strong>Osmosis and Tessellation</strong> – Will match the element of the equipped grenade.</li> <li><strong>Permeability and Elemental Capacitor</strong> – Will match the element of the equipped Super.</li> <li><strong>Chill Clip</strong> – Applies slow stacks based on the properties of a fusion rifle. All other weapon archetypes now take two shots to trigger.</li> <li><strong>High Ground</strong> – Reworked to provide a stacking damage buff as players get kills. Players can instantly earn max stacks when attacking an enemy from above. The buff is 25% in PvE and 15% in PvP.</li> <li><strong>Killing Tally</strong> – 21% Delirium has been updated to reflect the current version of the Perk.</li> <li><strong>Deconstruct</strong> – Will refill ammo from reserves rather than generate it out of nothing. It should also work more reliably across different weapons.</li> </ul>

<p data-characters="279" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/senuas-saga-hellblade-2/">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</a></em> offers a fourth flavor of difficulty in addition to the Neopolitan of Easy, Medium, and Hard. Dynamic Difficulty is designed to work with the player, and deliver the optimal combat experience based on their skill level. Here’s how it works.</p> <h2 id="h-the-goldilocks-difficulty" data-injectable="false">The Goldilocks Difficulty</h2> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">Dynamic Difficulty adjusts the difficulty of combat (<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/placeit-logo-maker-tool/">without touching puzzles</a>) based on the performance of the player. Essentially, if you’re obliterating foes with ease and not getting hit all that much, the difficulty will increase. Conversely, if you’re being treated like a punching bag, the difficulty will scale down until that isn’t the case. </p> <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="837" data-injectable="true">Due to how this operates, the game should feel sufficiently difficult without being rage-inducing and easy enough to enjoy without becoming a passive experience. In the time I’ve spent with <em>Hellblade II</em>, I’ve found this to be exactly the case. As I get better at blocking, dodging, and counterattacking, enemies get better at fighting back. When they get a little too good and I beef it, I’m able to get back into it with a more toned-down experience.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-combat-difficulty.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true">To adjust the combat difficulty in <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em>, open the Settings Menu and select Gameplay. The Difficulty options will be right under Accessibility and offer four choices: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Dynamic.</p>
 <p data-characters="412" data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true">Additionally, under the Accessibility menu will be options for Offensive and Defensive Actions. <strong>Default</strong> is your standard with you controlling Senua in combat. <strong>Simplified </strong>allows players to hit whatever button they like and the game will use the optimal move, regardless of what button was pressed. <strong>Self-Play</strong> essentially turns the game into a movie during combat as players aren’t required to press anything.</p>
 <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false">Ninja Theory is a studio that puts a lot of <a href="https://x.com/NinjaTheory/status/1792571130651312154">emphasis on accessibility</a> and it’s incredibly refreshing to see. For those who want to sit back and experience Senua’s second out as a more theatrical experience absolutely can. Those who want to test their skills can dive into the harder difficulties. For those like me who simply want to enjoy the ride, there’s Dynamic Mode.</p>

            <link>https://www.destructoid.com/first-person-parkour-platformer-downward-returns-with-enhanced-version-on-june-4/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=first-person-parkour-platformer-downward-returns-with-enhanced-version-on-june-4</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-person-parkour-platformer-downward-returns-with-enhanced-version-on-june-4.877809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/first-person-parkour-platformer-downward-returns-with-enhanced-version-on-june-4/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=first-person-parkour-platformer-downward-returns-with-enhanced-version-on-june-4<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="268" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Caracal Games’ first-person parkour platformer <em>Downward </em>first launched back in July 2017, and now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/506900/Downward_Enhanced_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s set to return</a> with some updates. <em>Downward Enhanced </em> throws updated graphics and more into the mix when it hits consoles and PC on June 4, 2024.</p> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">Beyond the visual improvements — which include some new assets —the enhanced version adds optimization and a new ending. Those who already own the base game will be able to upgrade to <em>Downward Enhanced </em>with a free update. You can see more of the dizzying, post-apocalyptic parkour feats in action in the release date trailer below. &nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="642" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="DOWNWARD Enhanced - Release date trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YX3tbw-OgXI?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false">Similar to games like <em>Mirror’s Edge </em>but perhaps not quite as disorienting as VR attempts like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-vr-parkour-game-stride-isnt-for-the-faint-of-heart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Stride</em></a>, <em>Downward </em>has you jumping, sliding, hanging, and running along walls. This time around, however, you’ll be doing so in a ruined world in search of legendary artifacts and an explanation for the apocalypse that brought us to this point in the first place.</p> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true">Along the way, you can upgrade your powers and boost your stats to give yourself an edge against some of the Ancient Guardians that want to put an end to all those pesky acrobatics. There’s also a balance of world exploration that has you using those parkour skills to find hidden items and secret locations.</p>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">It’s not easy to make first-person platforming work in any meaningful way, so when a developer gets it even partially right, I tend to pay attention. When <em>Downward Enhanced </em>launches, you’ll be able to jump into “humanity’s final adventure” on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/506900/Downward_Enhanced_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="272" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a></em> doggo, Archie, is a menace. He’s the Spider-Man to my <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/spider-man-2-why-does-jjj-hate-the-spider-men/">J. Jonah Jameson</a>. This serial escapee has snuck out of the Tower once more and it’s up to us to bring him in. Here’s every one of the wandering woofer’s spots in the Dreaming City.</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-archie-in-the-dreaming-city" data-injectable="false">Where to find Archie in the Dreaming City</h2> <h3 id="h-1-investigate-the-paw-prints" data-injectable="false">1. Investigate the paw prints</h3> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">As with any <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-where-on-the-moon-is-archie/">Archie investigation</a>, it all begins with the paw prints in the Tower’s Annex. Interacting with them will begin the quest proper and point you to Ada-1. Speaking with the armorer reveals Archie somehow managed to get into the Dreaming City, which is no easy feat. It’s time to meet up with Petra Venj.</p> <h3 id="h-2-petra-venj" data-injectable="false">2. Petra Venj</h3> <figure data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-archie-dreaming-city-001.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">The Queen’s Wrath is hanging out in The Strand this week. Pull out your sparrow and head on over. Petra, in an annoyed tone, confirms that Archie was there and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkFYr2SX620">pulling a Lassie</a>. Let’s go check the nearest well for Timmy.</p> <h3 id="h-3-the-blind-well" data-injectable="false">3. The Blind Well</h3> <figure data-current-count="532" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-archie-dreaming-city-002.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">Fortunately, the Blind Well is pretty close. Zip on over to find the next clue entangled in the glowing green paw prints. Despite being cybernetic, Archie has been compelled to search out some bones that like to barter. I’m not sure why he’s bartering with the bones when it’s the bones themselves he wants.</p> <h3 id="h-4-huginn-munnin" data-injectable="false">4. Huginn &amp; Munnin</h3> <figure data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-archie-dreaming-city-003.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="390" data-injectable="false">The only bones in the Dreaming City willing to strike up a deal would be Huginn and Munnin. To reach them, head to the temple in the northeast of Rheasilvia. Proceed to the end and jump down from the balcony. Directly behind you will be a doorway with a big hole. Fling yourself into the abyss and take a left in the next room to find Archie’s paw prints between the Ahamkara shrines.</p> <h3 id="h-5-a-cat-in-the-mists" data-injectable="false">5. A Cat in the Mists</h3> <figure data-current-count="690" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-archie-dreaming-city-004.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="214" data-injectable="false">Archie, following his canine instincts, is in pursuit of one of the many Dreaming City’s star cats. If you chased them down in <em>Forsaken</em>, you’d be forgiven for forgetting where the Divalian Mists cat is.</p> <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true">After spawning into the zone, head towards Rheasilvia. As you near the slope leading to the tunnel, walk towards the cliff and look down. There will be some outcroppings you can jump down onto. At the bottom will be a cave that houses Archie’s paw prints.</p>
 <h3 id="h-6-the-queen-s-throne" data-injectable="false">6. The Queen’s Throne</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-archie-dreaming-city-005.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">The final clue tells us that Archie’s gone to see if Queen Mara is in. Mara Sov’s throne room entrance is in the Spire of Keres. As you head there, you’ll square up against a Taken ambush. The adds will keep spawning, so focus on the Taken Ogre. Once it’s down, the minions will disappear and you’ll be left with an offering.</p>
 <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="181" data-injectable="false">Present the offering to Mara’s attendant in the Spire to be granted passage to the Queen’s throne room. Inside will be the good boy in search of pawsitive reinforcement.</p> <h3 id="h-return-to-ada-1" data-injectable="false">Return to Ada-1</h3> <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">With Archie safely recovered, it’s time to return to Ada-1 in the Tower’s Annex. This week’s gift is an Ahamkara bone the pooch took as a souvenir. It’s probably best that we hold onto this.</p>

People bought the bath water. Some claimed to have tested it for human DNA and accused Delphine of scamming them when it was revealed to not contain any. It turned out the bath water hadn’t even been shipped out yet and they were just making it up to clout chase on YouTube. A wild time was had by all. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.indy100.com/viral/onlyfans-model-belle-delphine-bathwater&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.indy100.com/viral/onlyfans-model-belle-delphine-bathwater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">She said on a podcast earlier this year</a></span> that she sold about 600 bottles total. </p><p>Delphine now explains that selling the bath water was apparently a violation of PayPal’s terms of service, with each infringement costing her $2,500. She said the company would tell her at the time what the problem was but the end result was that all of her revenue from sales of the gamer girl bath water were seemingly confiscated. “So I don’t know if it’s because they don’t allow sex workers to use their platform or if they had a specific issue with me selling bathwater…regardless not even knowing felt shit.”</p><p>PayPal had seemingly confiscated thousands from the account and closed it until recently, when <em>Business Insider </em>and others reached out to the payment processing company for comment on the situation. While the $2,500 penalty policy was dropped last year, it wasn’t until this month that PayPal reportedly decided to return Delphine’s money. “If I didn’t have any [social media] following, they wouldn’t have given my money back,” Delphine told <em>Business Insider</em>. “Which is so shitty because what are all the normal non-social media users meant to do in this situation? I followed all the normal protocols and was roadblocked and gave up.”</p><p>It’s a version of what seems to happen all the time with online content creators who are at the mercy of massive platforms and the financial institutions which power their monetization. People get snagged on the internal machinery of faceless institutions with no one to help them out or explain what’s going on until it goes viral. For every Delphine who eventually gets their account issues settled, hundreds of others probably just give up. After all, that’s basically what she did until deciding to tweet about it on a whim years after the fact. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="443" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Archetype Entertainment <a href="https://www.exodusgame.com/en-US/news/release-your-inner-daemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just revealed</a> a major addition to the narrative of its upcoming sci-fi RPG EXODUS. The developer has been slowly revealing major narrative elements of EXODUS, which many consider the spiritual successor to the <em>Mass Effect</em> series. The new story reveal focuses on a mysterious alien known as the Silicates, which appears it will not only play a major role in EXODUS’ story but also influence its gameplay.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Archetype Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-a-weapon-against-the-celestials" data-injectable="false">A Weapon against the Celestials</h2> <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true">While a lot of the story and even gameplay features of <em>EXODUS</em> is still a mystery, the reveal of the Silicates helps paint a picture of what may be a major factor both narratively and in terms of gameplay elements whenever <em>EXODUS</em> releases.</p>
 <p data-characters="504" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">The mysterious Silicates first were first discovered as eggs that look like simple crystals or gems. However, when touched by a Human, a symbiotic bond causes the Silicate to hatch and merge with human flesh, resulting in death for most, but transcending those that survive into a new powerful being known as a Daemon, undergoing musculature evolutions granting them incredible speed, strength, and other abilities. In essence, they become a weapon that the threat against humanity, The Celestials, fear.</p>
 <blockquote data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true"> <p>Silicates are humanity’s leverage. Daemons don’t need weapons – they are weapons. They give humanity a fighting chance against the Celestials; they even the playing field. Since Silicates will only bond with humans, there are some who see them in a religious light. They believe human-Silicate coexistence was preordained; it was meant to be and brought to fruition by some higher power. Others just see it as a fortunate break for humanity – a piece of good luck to offset all the hardships that we have endured.</p> <cite>‘<a href="https://www.exodusgame.com/en-US/news/release-your-inner-daemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Release your Inner Daemon</a>‘ – Archetype Entertainment, May 21, 2024</cite></blockquote>
 <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">Despite the immense strength Silicates provide to humans, it’s not without major drawbacks. Those that become Daemons are prone to intrusive violent thoughts and urges, which some believe is due to the Silicates “speaking” to their hosts, trying to influence their behavior to serve their own purpose.</p> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true">Even though there is a lot we still don’t know about <em>EXODUS</em>‘, these detailed narrative features are helping to paint the picture of what to expect from the upcoming sci-fi RPG. It sounds like Silicates will not only play a major role in the story but give humans their not-so-human abilities akin to Powers in <em>Mass Effect</em>. I’m excited to hear more.</p>

  <p id="wmt9Qz">The jury trial between <em>Destiny 2</em> developer Bungie and cheating software creator and distributor AimJunkies began Monday, nearly three years after the lawsuit was filed by Bungie lead attorney Jacob Dini in a Seattle court. It’s been a long, complicated journey to this point: AimJunkies, owned by Phoenix Digital Group, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23366835/bungie-destiny-2-aimjunkies-lawsuit-countersuit-hack-file">countersued Bungie in 2022</a> claiming the Sony-owned company illegally accessed James May’s computer and accessed his copyrighted material. Then, in 2023, parts of the lawsuit — anti-circumvention and trafficking violations — were resolved in arbitration, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23609206/destiny-2-bungie-aimjunkies-cheat-maker-lawsuit">with Bungie winning $4.3 million</a>. Months later, AimJunkies filed to appeal the decision, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/aimjunkies-opening.pdf">arguing that the arbitrator “blatantly disregarded some rules in making his decision</a>.” That appeal is ongoing. This week, Bungie and AimJunkies are in court to settle the claim that AimJunkies violated Bungie’s copyright.</p>
<p id="MxwekP">Opening statements began Monday after eight jurors were selected. It’s likely the first time a video game cheating lawsuit has made it this far in the court system, according to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bungie-aimjunkies-destiny-2-trial">lawyers who spoke to Game File</a>. The thing is, cheating isn’t explicitly against United States law. The arbiter determined that AimJunkies violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act’s anti-circumvention rules by bypassing Bungie’s security measures <em>and</em> by trafficking — or selling — software designed to circumvent those measures. Now, Bungie is looking to prove AimJunkies violated copyright law, too.</p>
<p id="DyXRye">Bungie’s lawyers are blaming one of the defendants, James May, for allegedly hacking into <em>Destiny 2</em> to copy its code to create the cheating software sold by AimJunkies, according to court documents. Bungie said May split the revenue with Phoenix Digital’s Jeffrey Conway and Jordan Green. Bungie reportedly found records that Phoenix Digital paid May “more than $700,000 for his work,” according to Bungie lawyer William C. Rava during the opening statement, <a href="https://www.law360.com/articles/1839173/bungie-takes-aim-at-cheat-code-sellers-in-copyright-trial">as reported by Law360</a>. But the sales records provided by Phoenix Digital only documented $43,000 in sales. Bungie’s lawyers claim the company deleted cryptocurrency and other transactions, which is why they’re asking the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F734783690%2FBungie-vs-AimJunkies-via-Polygon&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F24161935%2Fbungie-destiny-2-cheating-jury-trial-aimjunkies" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23925976__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://www.scribd.com/document/734783690/Bungie-vs-AimJunkies-via-Polygon\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/24161935/bungie-destiny-2-cheating-jury-trial-aimjunkies&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23925976__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.scribd.com/document/734783690/Bungie-vs-AimJunkies-via-Polygon&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24161935/bungie-destiny-2-cheating-jury-trial-aimjunkies&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">jury to consider “spoliation of evidence,”</a> according to court documents. This means Bungie’s lawyers are requesting that the jury presume the defendants destroyed evidence that might incriminate them.</p>
<p id="4H3VWk">The evidence that Bungie says was deleted purportedly includes forum messages, records of the cheat software, and sales information. Bungie claims that May “wiped four hard drives that [May] alleges Bungie improperly accessed in relation to this suit.” Phoenix Digital’s lawyers don’t want Bungie to be allowed to ask the jury to consider this, they said in their own filings.</p>
<p id="RpRlEm">Beyond this, Bungie told the jurors about several other confusing details, like Phoenix Digital’s <a href="https://www.aimjunkies.com/ukrainian-bme-to-acquire-leading-independent-us-videogame-cheat-distributor-aimjunkies">purported sale of AimJunkies for 7,000 bitcoins</a>, worth more than $480 million, to a company called Blome Entertainment in 2022. Phoenix Digital founder David Schaefer told Bungie’s lawyers that he created the sale press release to see Bungie “run around in circles and look like fools.” (Phoenix Digital had to pay $5,000, plus attorney fees, to Bungie “as a sanction for Schaefer’s harassing and unprofessional behavior” at one deposition in March 2023, according to court documents.)</p>
<p id="SzN4g8">On Phoenix Digital and AimJunkies’ side, lawyer Philip P. Mann said in his opening statement that May didn’t create the <em>Destiny 2</em> cheat, and that the <em>Destiny 2</em> maker had subjected Schaefer to 16 hours of questioning in a “discovery campaign to find out who Bungie thinks is behind this international conspiracy to develop cheats,” according to Law360. Mann said Bungie doesn’t have much evidence. Mann added that the lawsuit has basically put Phoenix Digital out of business and May out of a job, all while Bungie goes after the alleged $10,000 in profit the company made from <em>Destiny 2</em> cheat software — suggesting this is a David and Goliath scenario. </p>
<p id="qwSIB4">Mann’s argument centers on the fact that cheating isn’t illegal, and that there’s been no copyright infringement by the cheatmakers, because May didn’t even make the cheats — AimJunkies.com is a cheat marketplace, the lawyer said, not a cheat creation company. Phoenix Digital also contends that May isn’t an employee of the company, just another person who sells cheats — crucially, not <em>Destiny 2 </em>cheats, according to Phoenix Digital — on the platform. </p>
<p id="LcCc9U">The cheating software in question lets players do stuff like see through walls, and therefore see where their enemy is located, giving the cheating party an advantage. There are also cheats for having better aim or reducing a gun’s recoil, for instance. Again, it’s not necessarily illegal to cheat in a video game — though Bungie argues it could be a breach of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s terms of service even for the player — but it <em>is</em> illegal for a cheat maker to use copyrighted code to create the cheating software. It’s an argument Bungie and its lawyers are familiar with — Bungie has <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/11/22224696/riot-bungie-destiny-2-valorant-cheat-maker-lawsuit">sued plenty of cheating software creators</a> and sellers in the past few years. A lot of the time, it <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/bungie-lawsuit-ends-with-destiny-cheat-seller-on-the-hook-for-dollar12m/">wins</a> by defaulting or settling before getting to a trial.</p>
<p id="rXg0qQ">Court resumed Tuesday at 9 a.m. PDT and is expected to continue throughout the week. Though the trial will resolve the copyright issue, Bungie and AimJunkies will also have to settle the arbitration appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit at a later date. In the appeal, Mann <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/aimjunkies-opening.pdf">describes</a> this move as the first instance of a company to “actually stand up to Bungie and seek a decision on the merits as to whether ‘cheating’ in computer games is unlawful in the absence of an actual violation and existing intellectual property right.” The appeal is currently being considered for oral arguments in a Portland, Oregon court in August or September. Polygon has reached out to lawyers for both Bungie and Phoenix Digital and AimJunkies for comment. </p>

Even if you don’t have an Nvidia card, however, you should make sure your drivers are up to date.</p><h2 id="h22597"><a id=""></a>Using <em>Hellblade 2</em>’s graphics settings and performance meter</h2><p>It’s well worth your time to dive into <em>Hellblade</em>’s graphics settings before you start up the game as you want to mitigate how much time you spend dealing with menus during Senua’s journey. In Settings &gt; Graphics you’ll find a number of settings to start with, as well as a performance meter in the upper-right corner of the screen that’s more or less self-explanatory. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ninja-theory-hellblade-new-game-greenlit-microsoft-1851490677&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-theory-hellblade-new-game-greenlit-microsoft-1851490677"><em>Hellblade 2</em> Studio Reportedly Already Working On Its Next Game</a></span></p><p>If you’re not used to reading meters like this, you’ll want to pay attention to the “Frame” section and the Video Memory bar. The former indicates how many frames you’re getting per second (FPS). <em>Hellblade</em> is a very narrative game, so 30-FPS makes for a decent experience. I found, though, that the game feels great at 60 and above, so definitely aim for that if you can. </p><p>The next thing you’ll want to mess with is your choice of upscaler, which will vary depending on your graphics card. AMD folks should go with FSR3 while those of us on team green with Nvidia cards should use DLSS. The alternatives should not be used unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>Variable rate shading will reduce how much effort your GPU spends rendering non-obvious portions of the screen. It typically results in an improvement in performance at a less-than-noticeable decrease in visual fidelity.</p><p>Clicking on “Advanced Settings” in the graphics settings will open a drop-down menu where you can tailor the experience to your preferences and the performance power of your machine. </p><p>While I do wish <em>Hellblade 2</em> had a dedicated benchmark tool, the closest is the “Preview,” activated by pressing the spacebar or the menu button on a controller. This will pull the menu back to show a scene with Senua, some foliage, a building behind her, and a puddle for reflections when you’re not in a game. You can then toggle between different levels of quality for specific settings to see the effect in real time.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="91a5b235b4b7a35382c672b9cad91175" data-recommend-id="image://91a5b235b4b7a35382c672b9cad91175" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An animated gif shows the effects of different graphics settings for reflections and foliage detail." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An animated gif shows the effects of different graphics settings for reflections and foliage detail." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="91a5b235b4b7a35382c672b9cad91175" data-recommend-id="image://91a5b235b4b7a35382c672b9cad91175" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An animated gif shows the effects of different graphics settings for reflections and foliage detail." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you navigate to the graphics settings while playing the game and select the “Preview” option, it will show the active scene instead. This is a good way to troubleshoot specific issues you may be having during select moments of <em>Hellblade 2</em>. My preference is to tweak these settings before you load into a game for less distractions, but also because the preview option in the main menu shows more motion than it does while in-game.</p><p>In my experience, I found post-processing, effects, reflection, texture, view distance, and foliage to be worth bumping up to the High settings. Reflections in particular I found to be very much worth bringing up to High. Everything else I kept down to medium, but your results and preferences may differ. </p><p>You may still have to dive into the graphics settings during gameplay to tweak things if you’re not happy with the settings. I suggest not fiddling with things too much once you’ve found a nice sweet spot. </p><h2 id="h22598"><a id=""></a><em>Hellblade 2</em> has an in-game FPS-meter, too</h2><p>Unless you use another program (like TK) to show your framerate, you can monitor it in real-time while playing <em>Saga</em> by going to Settings &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Show FPS. This will pin a frame-rate counter in one of the corners of the screen and you can adjust its opacity and text color. Since <em>Hellblade 2</em> has permanent letterbox bars at all times, the FPS counter isn’t terribly distracting. And it can help you get a sense of how well your framerate is performing if you’re not used to spotting framerate dips by eye.</p><h2 id="h22599"><a id=""></a>How to deal with black dots on character faces</h2><p>There’s a chance you might be struggling with a little visual quirk in <em>Hellblade 2</em> that dramatically sours the experience: Dancing black dots on character faces. These will pop up during gameplay and through cutscenes. </p><p>In my experience, after updating my Nvidia card to the latest driver, I haven’t seen this. But if you’re still struggling with it, I found that bumping up the “Effects” setting to “High” made these go away. </p><h2 id="h22600"><a id=""></a>What about the Steam Deck?</h2><figure id="" data-id="0a3017c1b7e4fe607a3fc952e5bd0220" data-recommend-id="image://0a3017c1b7e4fe607a3fc952e5bd0220" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Senua walking through a rocky environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Senua walking through a rocky environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Captured on Steam Deck.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0a3017c1b7e4fe607a3fc952e5bd0220" data-recommend-id="image://0a3017c1b7e4fe607a3fc952e5bd0220" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Senua walking through a rocky environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>From a qualitative standpoint, <em>Hellblade 2</em> is best played on a big screen, powered by something that can reliably deliver at least a solid 30-frames per second. The Steam Deck is not the machine for that. It will, however, run <em>Hellblade 2</em> with mixed results. </p><p>The majority of my time with <em>Hellblade 2</em> has been on PC, but I have spent a few hours in transit playing the game on Steam Deck. Headphones, of course, are necessary here and given how much of the experience of <em>Hellblade </em>is an aural one, the game is still entertaining in portable format. That said, you will need to bring the graphics to Low settings across the board, with FSR3 turned on. Even then, the game will dip below 30-frames per second and about 1-2 hours of battery life depending on the age of your battery. 19 FPS was the lowest dip I saw thus far.</p><p>It’s certainly “Playable,” but I would advise relying on a more powerful machine to crunch <em>Hellblade 2</em>’s pixels for you. Even relying on Steam’s Remote Play via Steam Deck is a better option than letting the Deck itself run the game on its GPU. </p><h2 id="h22601"><a id=""></a>No, there’s no way to remove the black bars without mods</h2><p><em>Hellblade 2</em> only just launched on PC and Xbox and already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/senuassagahellblade2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/senuassagahellblade2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there are a few mods for tweaking the visual settings</a></span>, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/senuassagahellblade2/mods/3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/senuassagahellblade2/mods/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a mod that removes letterboxing</a></span>. <em>Saga</em> uses a wide variety of post-processing techniques to create a lush, film-like, surreal experience. That, combined with letterboxing, to me is a pretty essential part of the visual look and artistic intent in <em>Hellblade</em> that I’d prefer to keep it as is. </p><p>Note that mods may or may not interfere with the stability of the game, so mod away at your own risk. </p><p>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Regarding Ubisoft titles, for as much as I enjoy their popcorn games, I typically wait until the inevitable Steam launch before picking anything up. They usually drop with a significant discount. But when you have a game like XDefiant, which is free-to-play, the only thing stopping you from having fun at this very moment is Ubisoft Connect. For some, that’s enough. So, when will XDefiant come to Steam?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-xdefiant-launch-on-steam">When Will XDefiant Launch on Steam?</h2>



<p>Currently, Ubisoft Connect is the only way to play XDefiant on PC. However, according to an insider at the studio, that will change in the coming months. While we don’t yet have an exact release date, we do know that XDefiant is coming to Steam in the “next few months.” </p>



<p>If you look at past Ubisoft titles, they generally launch within one year on Steam after Ubisoft Connect. However, XDefiant is a free-to-play title, meaning Ubisoft isn’t soaking in all the retail price purchases. No one is taking a cut. As such, I genuinely believe we’ll see XDefiant on Steam in six months or less.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-xdefiant">What is XDefiant?</h2>



<p>XDefiant is a free-to-play arena shooter with heroes and factions from throughout various Ubisoft franchises, such as Libertard from Far Cry 6, but also brand-new characters and groups from within the universe. </p>



<p>The game offers various game modes, including objective-based modes and numerous unique maps to battle against other players. Furthermore, you’ll have personalized loadouts, meaning no hero is genuinely the same. You can customize your weapons with more than 40 unique attachments, offering a welcome depth to loadouts!</p>

<p>There are lots of ways to enjoy&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/elden-ring-review-come-see-the-softer-side-of-punishing-difficulty/"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, beyond the core attack/dodge/survive gameplay. You can obsess over builds, appreciate the mastery of speedrunners and grand masters like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23198342/elden-ring-let-me-solo-her-fromsoftware-bandai-namco-gift-box">Let Me Solo Her</a>, or mix and match the huge variety of armor in pursuit of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fashionsouls/">Fashion Souls</a>. And then there is lore. There is so much of it, and most of it has the consistency of campfire smoke.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring</em> tells its backstory (written <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24135223/elden-ring-did-george-r-r-martin-write-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc">in part by George R.R. Martin</a>) primarily through item descriptions and environmental hints. The scraps of narrative that do exist stand unsteadily against unreliable narrators, contradictions, <a href="https://gamerant.com/elden-ring-cut-content-shadow-erdtree-miquella-dreams-st-trina/">cut content</a>, and lovably enthusiastic fans who take small hints to their illogical extremes. Developer FromSoftware and primary creator Hidetaka Miyazaki do almost nothing to disprove misunderstandings or reward accurate conclusions, although they appreciate the energy. Miyazaki will just <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-director-hidetaka-miyazaki-look-back-interview-profile">casually tell IGN</a> that there's a "small element" that hasn't been discovered, offer nothing more on that, and leave fans like me craven with an unmet need for conclusion.</p>

<p>I love this and cherish the way FromSoftware will never in my lifetime confirm my hopes or expectations. So with the surprise arrival of an honest-to-goodness <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uT8wGtB3yQ">story-based trailer for&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> expansion</a>, due out June 21, I was given yet another feast of vague notions and evocative images.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Let's dig into it, moment by moment, if not frame by frame. If you're new to <em>Elden Ring </em>lore, you've got a lot of road in front of you. Play the game, probably, as a first step? But then I recommend YouTuber and <em>Souls</em> archaeologist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYDs_Inzkz4">VaatiVidya's 30-minute lore explainer</a>, and then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aacRIObSGZk&amp;pp=ygUTdmFhdGl2aWR5YSBtaXF1ZWxsYQ%3D%3D">his Miquella-specific deep dive</a>.</p>

<h2>The beginning</h2>
<p>"Miquella the Kind spoke of the beginning, the seduction, and the betrayal," says the narrator. And then, as with many primordial myths, there is some body horror. A bloodied hand, with a wrap-around golden bracelet, reaches into some kind of gray, parted part of a biological something, confirmed by the sound effects, pulling out golden threads. This is almost certainly Marika, the matriarch figure that puts most of the main <em>Elden Ring</em> plot into action, given the bracelet (visible in <a href="https://gamerant.com/elden-ring-story-marika-betrays-greater-will-why/">images</a> from before her golden crucifixion).</p>
<p>"An affair from which Gold arose," (all capitalization from the video's captions), "and so too was Shadow born." As in the Land of Shadow, where the expansion takes place. Likely-Marika walks out of a bloody, squishy hall to an opening, holds the threads aloft triumphantly, and a pan back and outward reveals that she has parted (I think) a bloody tree. There are more than a couple biblical references running through <em>Elden Ring</em>'s lore, and some of them are as subtle as a colossal sword.</p>
<p>Then: "What followed was a war unseen, one that could never be put to song."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Senua's Saga: Hellblade II - Official Launch Trailer (ft. 'Animal Soul' by AURORA)</p>
      </div>
<p>Now you know to be especially careful if you're playing Hellblade 2 at night after a long day and your focus isn't exactly as sharp as it could be. In case it's worth mentioning, this is different than the "permadeath" mechanic in Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, which threatened to delete your save file but actually didn't.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review-hell-and-high-water/1900-6418229/" data-ref-id="1900-6418229">Hellblade 2 review</a>, Cogswell praised the impressive visuals, motion capture, and performances at display, as well as music and overall sound design. But other aspects fell flat.</p><p>"There are plenty of games that prove games can be art, but as some studios lean harder into proving that in one specific way that cribs from Hollywood, we're seeing some games that feel afraid of being games," the review reads. "With too much focus on cinematics and too little on creating an experience that is engaging, Senua's Saga fails to reach the same highs as its predecessor--even if it does look stunning whilst trying."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/21/nba-superstars-is-bringing-the-classic-nba-jam-vibe-to-arcades<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>In 1993, the original NBA Jam hit arcades and revolutionized the arcade sports genre. High-flying dunks, flaming basketballs, and the biggest names from the hardwood served as trademarks for the classic quarter-munching cabinet. Though the series has been absent for years now, with the last entry arriving in 2011 under the EA Sports umbrella, Play Mechanix and Raw Thrills have partnered with the NBA and the NBA Players Association to bring that same arcade-style basketball action to arcades with NBA Superstars.</p>

<p>NBA Superstars brings 3v3 arcade-style basketball action, featuring all 30 teams consisting of 120 of the biggest stars in the NBA. Players can take the court as LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokic, Kevin Durant, Luka Doncic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and more in the first NBA-branded arcade game since the mid-'90s. The cabinet supports up to four players and looks to include the same backboard-rattling dunks, physical defense, and longshot three-pointers that made players fall in love with NBA Jam back in the 1990s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game features Superstar Mode, where you can battle it out to earn MVP honors, as well as the ability to track your stats over several play sessions with free online accounts that you log into using a QR code. The entire experience is tied together and brought back to the NBA Jam roots thanks to the inclusion of iconic announcer Tim Kitzrow.</p>

<p>You can see more in the trailer below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p4r22l5Zl90" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>NBA Superstars' arcade cabinet features a fully animated LED stadium scoreboard, a 75-inch screen, camera-flash-simulating marquee lights, and team color-coordinated RGB LED lights. The cabinet is set to arrive in arcades this summer. Unfortunately, there is no word on whether, like NBA Jam before it, it will be making the leap to home consoles following its arcade debut.</p>

<p data-characters="292" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>XDefiant </em>allows players to meet and compete across multiple maps and modes. Like many online-only arena shooters, the game places its players on regional servers to best guarantee the smoothest gameplay. But if you’re looking to change your region in <em>XDefiant</em>, you may come up wanting. </p> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false"><strong>You cannot change your region in <em>XDefiant</em></strong>. This isn’t exactly unique to the game, either. Ubisoft, like many game developers, places players in local servers to ensure the lowest ping, so that the salty feelings are more likely to stem from skill issues rather than matchmaking lag. I can’t help you if an enemy player spawns behind you, mind.

 <p data-characters="518" data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true">If you’ve actively participated in <em>Monopoly GO’s</em> banner events for the past few months, you may recognize this list, as it’s identical to the Cloud Cruisin’ list from February 2024. Fortunately, this means you can pick up <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/working-monopoly-go-free-dice-roll-links/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plenty of free dice</a>, stickers, and cash during it for your Landmark upgrades. However, since there are no ongoing Partners events, digging minigames, or cosmetic milestone tiers, you’d mainly use this to gather extra resources in anticipation of other major events. </p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-score-points-in-the-monopoly-go-cloud-cruisin-event" data-injectable="false">How to score points in the Monopoly GO Cloud Cruisin’ event</h2> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">Scoring points during <em>Monopoly GO’s </em>Cloud Cruisin’ event requires landing on pickup tokens. These tokens randomly spawn around your Monopoly board, giving you two base points that scale with your dice multiplier. There are usually around six on the screen at a time, making them more common than corners or utility and tax tiles.</p> <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="778" data-injectable="false">Since they spawn randomly, watching your dice multiplier is important, especially if you have multiple tiles in quick succession. If you’re lucky, you can land on several tiles within a few rolls, skyrocketing your points if you have enough dice or power-ups like High Roller active. Otherwise, if you’re only one or two spaces away from the next pickup or over ten spots away, your odds of landing on it immediately are low.</p>

The other shoe dropped immediately, with layoffs hitting at least three of the aforementioned sites.</p><p>So far, <a href="https://x.com/ABeeWords/status/1792924969938059562" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alice Bell</a> at RPS, <a href="https://x.com/StephNunneley/status/1792959021689040920" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephany Nunneley-Jackson</a> at VG247, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7198698714452959232/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brendan Sinclair</a> and <a href="https://x.com/JRpotential/status/1792977459652010140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeffrey Rousseau</a> at GI.biz have publicly stated that they were impacted by redundancies. Notably, almost all of these writers and reporters are longtime industry vets; both Sinclair and Nunneley-Jackson had been at their respective sites for more than a decade and occupied managerial positions, and Bell was RPS’ deputy editor. These are people who broke and helped break news in an industry with vanishingly few left to do that job.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Bell, more have been laid off than just those who’ve spoken up so far.&nbsp;</p><p>“The Network has lost a lot of phenomenally talented people, both in front-facing editorial and in more behind-the-scenes roles,” she told Aftermath. “It looks like at least one person from almost any department at a company like this you can imagine got some bad news today.”</p><p>According to both Bell and another ex-Gamer Network employee who was granted anonymity out of concerns regarding severance and future prospects, redundancies appear to have targeted many – perhaps all – Gamer Network employees outside the UK.</p><p>"Not everyone who was made redundant is based outside the UK, but it's starting to look very much like everyone based outside the UK has been made redundant,” said Bell.</p><p>According to laid-off staffers, employees were aware that a sale was in the works. They were not forewarned about layoffs, however.</p><p>“There were rumblings and updates about the sale process for a couple months now,” said the ex-Gamer Network employee. “They never said exactly who was buying us but I think most people had a pretty good idea. I wasn't informed about the possibility of cuts. But like, I wouldn't be, would I?”</p><p>Another ex-employee who was granted anonymity for similar reasons echoed this sentiment, saying that "the layoffs caught everyone off guard" even though "the announcement of when a sale would happen was&nbsp;known."</p><p>Bell had asked management about the possibility of layoffs, only to be reassured that everything would be fine.</p><p>“I'd asked specifically about my job because I'm based in Ireland, outside the UK, and was told the company was intending to sell us lock and stock, so all employees would stay employed on the same basis,” she said. “I was expecting shrinkage after the sale, because that always happens, but not immediately, and honestly not myself because RPS doesn't have an editor at the moment, so without [me] it just won't have editorial leadership. More fool me, eh?”</p><p>Those who’ve lost their jobs at Gamer Network hope that, for the sake of their colleagues, IGN’s leadership ushers in a new era of stability at the revered network of sites. But they have their doubts.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don't want to guess about how this will impact sites other than saying morale will be in the toilet and the people remaining will have to pick up the output of those who were cut, so it's not going to be much fun for them either,” said one ex-Gamer Network employee.</p><p>"Just as I am against the consolidation of video game developers, I am against the consolidation of video game websites, so I cannot see this as a good thing,” said Bell. “I am most worried about people's livelihoods, but I am also very worried that they won't be allowed to be weird and write thoughtful, critical things. I worry that, now that the machine has increased in size, it will necessarily crush my most talented peers from the Network into writing boring, SEO-focused things designed to appeal to the averaged-out reader. But people aren't average, so when you try to appeal to the average you end up appealing to nobody."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo's Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake has added lines confirming villain-turned-companion character Vivian is transgender after references relating to her gender identity were removed in the original 2004 English translation.
</p>
<p>
In The Thousand-Year Door's original Japanese release, Vivian - one of three villainous Shadow Sisters - is deliberately misgendered by various characters, including her sister Marilyn.
</p>
<p>
When the GameCube title was translated for its worldwide release, some territories retained references to Vivian's trans identity - Italy, for instance, had the character respond defiantly to Marilyn instead of apologising after one instance of misgendering, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210921074641/http://www.fti.uab.es/tradumatica/revista/num5/articles/06/06central.htm">saying</a>, "But I am a woman too now, and I'm proud to have turned into a woman!" - while others, including the English and German translations, jettisoned the references entirely.

<p>
But 20 years later, Vivian is officially trans once more. As <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2024/05/21/review-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-for-nintendo-switch/">highlighted by MyNintendoNews</a>, the Thousand-Year Door remake's English translation now explicitly acknowledges Vivian's trans identity, featuring a conversation in which she tells Mario, "Truth is, it took me a while to realise I was their sister... not their brother. Now their usual bullying feels heavier."
</p>
<p>
You can see the moment around the 5:30 mark in NintendoLife's Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZPwyfIL_qU">review</a>. The game itself is set to release for Switch this Thursday, 23rd May.

Fortunately, Square Enix has made this decision trivial with the announcement that <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1792722028354818287">it’s releasing the series on Steam on June 13th</a>. To celebrate, and perhaps destabilize an entire generation of adults for whom the <a href="https://youtu.be/zHXIDMowuzE?si=r0QpAo9TOomoJaSl">first <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>trailer</a> was a transformative experience (aka, <em>me)</em>, a trailer was released with a brand-new recording of Hikaru Utada’s “Simple and Clean.”</p><p>The trailer was executed very intelligently, showing snippets of the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> games in chronological order, suggesting to potential customers (and reminding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/11/23020338/square-enix-kingdom-hearts-4-reboot-hope">lapsed fans like me</a>) in what order the games should be played. Steam will have three <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> games for sale: <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2552430%2FKINGDOM_HEARTS_HD_1525_ReMIX%2F"><em>Kingdom Hearts -HD 1.5+2.5 ReMIX-</em></a> (yes those dashes are officially part of the name), <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2552440%2FKINGDOM_HEARTS_HD_28_Final_Chapter_Prologue%2F"><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</em></a>, and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2552450%2FKINGDOM_HEARTS_III__Re_Mind_DLC%2F"><em>Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind DLC</em></a>. To make things easier, there will also be a bundle available, <em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece</em>, that combines all three games for one price. </p><p>Those who purchase <em>Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind DLC</em> will also get a special keyblade, “Dead of Night,” which looks pretty slick in Steam Logo blue and grey. Each of the three games is itself a bundle of a bunch of <em>KH</em> games spanning platforms and console generations. You can find a full breakdown of which game is in what bundle <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/kingdom-hearts-pc">here</a> or on each game’s Steam page. </p><div><figcaption><em>That Steam-exclusive keyblade looks pretty sick.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Square Enix</cite></p></div><p>Kingdom Hearts suddenly launching on Steam isn’t that surprising. The games have already been available <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278638/kingdom-hearts-pc-release-epic-games">on PC via the Epic Games Store for a few years now</a> with Steam being the next logical choice. There’s also the news that Square Enix plans <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/13/24155604/square-enix-multiplatform-games-xbox-pc">to bring more of its games to more platforms</a>. Throughout its more than 20-year run, the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> series has been predominantly on PlayStation consoles and handhelds with two smaller games making a brief appearance on the Nintendo DS. It was only 2020 when <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>finally came to Xbox with Nintendo offering an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710665/kingdom-hearts-remix-hd-nintendo-switch-cloud-versions">abysmal cloud version of the games in 2022</a>.  </p><p>There’s also the fact that these games are releasing a week before Summer Game Fest with Geoff Keighley posting about the game possibly suggesting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/10/23018977/kingdom-hearts-iv-announced-20th-anniversary-event-square-enix"><em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em></a> might make an appearance. Getting a new crop of players into the series right before sharing more info on the next entry seems like a shrewd idea. </p><p>It is exceedingly hilarious that even though this Steam trailer lists the games in chronological order, the games themselves are not bundled that way. If you want to play the way the trailer lays it all out, you’ll have to start by watching (because it’s a movie, not a game) <em>Back Cover</em> on <em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8,</em> then jump to <em>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5</em> to play <em>Birth By Sleep</em> before jumping back to<em> KH2.8</em> to play <em>Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage</em>. Simple right? </p><p>Speaking of simple, Hikaru Utada’s new version of “Simple and Clean” moved me to tears. I was one of those teenagers who wasn’t the biggest Disney fan but was into Japanese pop, visual kei (think of a Japanese version of glam metal), and Japanese rock. Hearing that new take on such a beloved song made me feel both 16 years old and 36 years old but in a good way. This thing that I have loved, which has inspired the kinds of emotions that led me to my job today, has grown up with me, but not so much that it is unrecognizable to my younger self. And when I go back and play these simple and clean games — some of them again and some of them for the first time — I hope I can <a href="https://youtu.be/Kvnwnf9UftA?si=HGYCJMcl4sgRDLqR">face my fears</a> from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/1/24/18195478/kingdom-hearts-3-review-xbox-one-playstation-4">previous disappointment</a> and be reminded of the <a href="https://youtu.be/QOxDW8RqFvc?si=xVLF3nL4wRQy7OGf">sanctuary</a> I loved so much.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-definitive-guide-to-the-anime-game.877707/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-definitive-guide-to-the-anime-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em><strong>Anime Week continues with a complete definition of the 'anime game' an umbrella term with a myriad of sub-genres.</strong></em></p><p>It’s pretty universally understood that genre definitions in the video game space are tenuous at best and downright nonsensical at worst. What makes a game an RPG in 2024 when most mainstream releases have some kind of leveling and stats system? How are young people today supposed to know what descriptors like “Metroidvania” or “Soulsborne” mean when the games that inspired those terms become increasingly obtuse and comparisons to those games are evoked as often in marketing pushes as they are in reviews? </p><p>Now, add a whole other, and equally varied, artistic medium into the mix and you get the “anime game” genre; which is colloquial nonsense! Genres are supposed to give casual consumers a general idea of what they can expect from a title, and allow critics to trace back the lineage and inspiration informing the mechanical and narrative direction of a work. An anime game could be anything from a super casual mobile game where you do gacha pulls for cute characters, or one of the crunchiest role playing games on the market. </p><p>Having such a spectrum of content bundled under a growingly common moniker isn’t helpful to anyone, so here’s a taxonomy of the different kinds of games that all fall under the “anime game” umbrella term. </p><h3><strong>Tie-In Anime Games</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/29/dragonballkakarot-1706524241085.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><strong>Credit: Bandai Namco</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p>Licensed, tie-in video games based on popular anime are the first kind of game that most will think of when anime games come up in conversation. Since most popular anime fall into the action-focused shonen genre, tie-in anime games tend to be fighting games. Arena fighters in particular are commonplace in this subcategory, with titles like the well-known Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series and the recently released Jujutsu Kaisen: Cursed Clash being textbook examples. </p><p>Of course, there’s plenty of variance here too. Last year’s Infinity Strash: DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai was a clear-cut action RPG, and the many Yu-Gi-Oh video games are, of course, digital versions of the card game. Like most licensed games, though, these titles tend to be middling and are best played by super fans of the adapted franchise, or younger fans looking for an entryway into action or fighting games. </p><p>While FighterZ is, of course an exception to this generalization, it’s not elevating the entire sub-genre and fits more cleanly into the following anime game niche. </p><h3><strong>Fighting Games</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/09/25/undernightthumb-1695652530097.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><strong>Credit: Ark System Works, French Bread</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p>Boy…there sure are a lot of anime games at <a href="https://www.evo.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>EVO this year</u></a>, huh? Between Guilty Gear -Strive-, Granblue, and Under Night In-Birth; there are a lot of games with anime visuals in the biggest fighting game tournament in the world. Of course, the EVO anime game counter ticks up further if you include titles that also have anime vibes and overt influence; like King of Fighters XV, Tekken 8, and two different Street Fighters! Even if you think those cuspier entries aren’t technically anime games, anime’s influence on the fighting game genre is palpable. </p><p>The overt presence of anime games in the fighting game genre makes sense considering how much bigger arcade gaming, the origins of fighting games, is in Japan than the US. Not to mention that martial arts tournaments, characters tying their identity to their fighting style, and settling all disagreements with martial arts are all longtime tropes in the shonen anime genre. The design of fighting games and the combat focus of most shonen anime complement each other perfectly, so these two kinds of media are sure to influence each other for years to come. </p><h3><strong>Games with Anime Aesthetics</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/08/genshinimpactfurinaoverview-1699445722548.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Hoyoverse</figcaption></figure></output><p>Speaking of anime aesthetics, games that are visually similar to what’s broadly considered an anime art style are often labeled anime games, even when they have little else in common. For instance, titles like Catherine, Genshin Impact, Astral Chain, and Sakura Wars are all considered anime games because of their visuals, despite having little in common otherwise. So long as a game visually evokes an anime, it’s an anime game. </p><p>This is one of the more frustrating definitions of what people mean when they say something is an anime game, as the artistic medium of anime consists of a host of different art styles. For instance, One Piece, Monster, Panty and Stocking, and Pop Team Epic are all terrific anime; but could not be more different in both tone and presentation. It flattens and simplifies a wonderfully diverse art form to say that something is or is inspired by anime, based on if it's visually similar to a generalization of the visuals of that medium. </p><p>That being said, pretty much every game that is informed by conventions in anime does borrow visually from that medium as well; so calling something an anime game if it looks like an anime is a reasonable, broad strokes way to file a game under the umbrella term. </p><h3><strong>Visual Novel</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/03/02/paranormasightshogoandyokotrailer-ign-blogroll-1677795507460.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><strong>Credit: Square Enix</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p>Despite having some of the most interesting and personal stories in the gaming medium, visual novels are often overlooked in broader gaming spaces and are generally called “anime games” derogatorily by people who don’t see the appeal of them. While they generally lack the production value and robust interactivity of more expensive AAA titles, good visual novels make up for this in the caliber of writing and direction. For instance, PARANORMASIGHT: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is easily the best game that Square Enix put out last year and Class of 09: The Re-Up is a terrific send up of both American culture in the late 2000s and the anime fandom. </p><p>Visual novels are also an increasingly common way for new game developers to get their feet under them, with countless hobbyist level visual novels available on platforms like Itch.io. While these anime games admittedly aren’t for everyone, visual novels have long standing roots in the gaming medium and are quietly influential on more popular genres today. In fact, visual novels even have their own sub-genre which also fall underneath the anime game umbrella in dating sims. </p><h3><strong>Dating Sim</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/10/24/doki-doki-1571935280950.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Team Salvato</figcaption></figure></output><p>First popularized by 1994’s Tokimeki Memorial, dating sims are games that focus on building romantic relationships with characters. They’re also another kind of anime game that are often glossed over by broader gaming spaces. Which is strange, as the character affinity mechanics they spearheaded are becoming growingly common in mainstream RPGs. The social link system in Persona games is overtly lifted from dating sims, and the same is true for the romance mechanics in 2023’s GOTY, Baulder’s Gate 3. The genre is even successful enough to have games that deconstruct it, like Doki Doki Literature Club and Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator. </p><p>These games generally fall into the anime game genre because of their use of anime visual sensibilities. Some of the most popular dating sims come from developers outside of Japan, though, like Mystic Messenger by the South Korean studio Cheritz. Of course, the voyeurism and more intimate nature of the material in dating sims means that they often bleed into the next genre of anime games.  </p><h3><strong>Hentai Games</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/21/gettyimages-625879648-1716312484595.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: GettyImages</figcaption></figure></output><p>Hentai, an overtly pornographic genre of anime, also has a presence in the gaming space; though most titles in this genre on platforms like Steam are best avoided shovelware. Also called adult games or eroge, hentai games fall under the anime umbrella thanks to their general use of anime aesthetics and because they delve into adult material that anime is more open to exploring than most of western televised media. There isn’t much of a mechanical throughline in this kind of game, with the gamification of adult content being enough to make a title a hentai game.<br>For instance, Hunie Pop<em> </em>famously connected match-three puzzle mechanics with raunchy dating sim elements, and Subverse blends adult vfx scenes with turn based tactics and space shoot ‘em up gameplay. Perhaps because of the more niche nature of these titles, many of them are also built using RPG Maker; like many of the titles from hentai games publisher Kagura Games. Even mostly texted based adult adventure games, like the Corruption of Champions titles, fall into this category. </p><p>While games as a medium can, and have, told moving stories that focus on human sexuality and sexual relationships; this discipline within the anime game umbrella is generally meant to titillate more than inspire. </p><h3><strong>Monster Collectors</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/06/29/griffomonq-1498695106765.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>There’s nothing inherently anime about games that focus on battling and collecting monsters, but so many of them have had related anime that monster collectors are honorary anime games. While Pokémon is the biggest mon’ game by a mile, Digimon and Monster Rancher are also sizable series in this sub-genre. Notably, Digimon has been willing to shake up its identity and explore other genres, with the recent Digimon Survive dipping its toe into visual novel conventions. Monster Rancher also had novel iterations on the monster collecting genre from its inception, with these games allowing players to spawn new monsters from real world CDs. </p><p>While other titles like TemTem and Palworld lack direct anime adaptations, there is simply too much overlap between this kind of game and the anime space to segregate the two. Even flash in the pan games like Medabots and Yokai Watch got anime back in the day! For whatever reason, monsters collectors and anime go hand in hand, making the former forever live under the anime game umbrella. </p><h3><strong>Gacha Games</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/25/honkaithumb-1682435470362.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Hoyoverse</figcaption></figure></output><p>Taking its name and defining mechanic from Gachapon capsule toy machines, gacha games involve players spending in-game or real currency for the chance at unlocking new equipment or character skins. Popular gacha games include titles like Fire Emblem: Heroes, Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle, and, once again in this piece, Genshin Impact. Often, gacha games will have their namesake mechanic built into some form of RPG loop, as a means to meter progression. </p><p>While Gachapon capsule machines have been in operation since the 1970s, gacha games have drawn a myriad of criticism in the gaming space. Most of the critique of gacha games center on how they potentially promote gambling, how pull odds can be subject to manipulation, and how there’s no way to sell or trade virtual assets like physical assets gained from gacha machines or trading card packs. Regardless of the controversy around them, gacha games are widely popular among anime fans and definitely fall under the anime game umbrella. </p><h3><strong>JRPGs</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/09/24/48784831621-0dffa00f19-o-1569339934883.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure></output><p>Until anime was big enough globally that tie-in anime games started releasing regularly outside of Japan, JRPGs were the de facto anime game…and now JRPGs don’t really exist anymore. While the distinction between Japanese Role Playing Games and Non-Japanese Role Playing Games was always nebulous, the classification is generally used to denote storytelling conventions and what games a title is informed by. Broadly, JRPGs see players taking over a character with an established identity and playing through their story, like in the Final Fantasy games, and in a Western RPG players create a character and make a story for themselves, like in Elder Scrolls games. </p><p>However, the proliferation of gaming is much greater now than when those distinctions were made in the 90s, and these genres are influencing each other more than ever. For instance, Elden Ring is an RPG developed by Japanese company FromSoftware and takes inspiration from western tabletop games like Magic: the Gathering and the Fighting Fantasy books. Similarly, Toby Fox’s Undertale is a western developed game that draws heavily upon JRPGs like Earthbound. So, well the term JRPG is becoming more antiquated as gaming becomes an increasingly global hobby, it’s still what many think of when they hear the term “anime game.”</p><h3><strong>Mecha</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/08/21/armoredcoresixreview-blogroll-1692643469822.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>Games that make a particular type of anime playable are also considered anime games, and this is more true with Mecha games than any other genre. Mecha anime are a kind of science fiction series that are defined by the presence of giant robots and how they’re used to make observations about real world political or social issues. Note worthy mecha anime include the Gundam franchise that defined mecha fiction as we know it today, the genre subversive Neon Genesis Evangelion, and the kinetic Gurren Lagann. </p><p>Despite giant robots generally being the source of the problem in the shows they appear in, these anime also make piloting them look super cool and thus the experience is often translated into gaming. Popular mech games include the Armored Core franchise, the Virtual On series, and even the much beloved Titanfall 2. Not only would these games not exist without the anime that inform them, but they manage to capitalize on the core appeal of a specific kind of anime and that makes them some of the best examples of anime games. </p><p><em>Lucas DeRuyter is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> earlier this month, CD Projekt RED has released <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/redkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Witcher 3 REDkit</a> to the public. It is now available for free download on PC across GOG, Epic Games Store, and Steam.</p>
<p>The modding tool, created with the help of Hungarian co-development company Yigsoft, was successfully tested with over 18K users before the public release. The goal is to unleash the creativity of modders with a much more robust modding tool than what was previously available for the game.</p>
<p>Ahead of the launch, we reached out to CD Projekt RED's Global Community Director Marcin Momot and Yigsoft's Lead Bence Hambalko to discuss the feature set of The Witcher 3 REDkit (there's full controller support, surprisingly) and what's coming after launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher 3 REDkit — Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMKZQLRkyfU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>The REDkit for The Witcher 2 was released only two years after its launch, whereas nine years have now passed for The Witcher 3. Why the delay?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marcin Momot:</strong> The truth is that, initially, we planned to release it much sooner, but, as usual, reality altered our plans. As we fully transitioned to working on Cyberpunk 2077, we had to adjust our production timeline. After its release, we began reevaluating some of the projects we had in the pipeline beforehand. Around that time, we started forming a closer partnership with Yigsoft, who have been helping us with certain elements of Cyberpunk 2077. As the old saying goes, better late than never, and here we are, releasing The Witcher 3 editor into the hands of players in 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you deem it worthy to release it after all these years?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MM:</strong> The Witcher 3 is one of those games that, even nine years later, is still thriving in the modding scene. Every week, new mods keep popping up as people tinker with various aspects of the game. After releasing the next-gen version in December 2022 and all subsequent updates, we offer this as a sort of parting gift — the final touch, if you will. We hope that now, with everyone having access to an editor that’s as close to being on par with what the game’s developers used to make it as can be, the game can continue to live on for years to come, with even more content being added by the community.</p>
<p><strong>Can you explain the difference between the already released ModKit and the upcoming REDkit?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bence Hambalko:</strong> The already-released ModKit was a simple set of command line tools derived from the internal tools we use for some processes in the engine. Compared to this, REDkit is a full set of tools close to what CDPR used to actually make the game, which means people benefit from having a comprehensive GUI to assist them in creating mods. The community was quite ingenious and figured out ways to create many kinds of mods over the years, but for less technical-savvy people it was difficult to get started. Compared to this, despite how complex of a game engine it truly is, people can get into creating new content for the game much easier and without as many limiting factors.</p>
<p><strong>Does the REDKit support the latest technical features introduced with the next-gen update, such as ray tracing, allowing modders to create ray traced content?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> Yes, REDkit is using the improved toolset used for the Complete Edition of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, so you can preview your content with ray tracing and all the amazing graphical and gameplay settings enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Did you make any usability improvements compared to the REDkit for The Witcher 2 with modders in mind?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> So, actually, quite a few people from the Yigsoft team come from a modding background. Before working on REDkit, together with one of our engine programmers on the project, Moritz Baron, we have been leading the WolvenKit project and have been quite involved with the community for many years. So, when we started working on REDkit, we decided to collaborate with them, learning what kind of features gamers would like to see from a modding tool. A few months before the release of REDkit, we had a small group of people that we were working with, discussing how REDkit was progressing and how we could make it even better.</p>
<p>Once we felt the tool was in good shape and ready to share with more people, we started the Steam Playtest. It’s hard to list all the feedback we received. One interesting point I’d like to touch on, however, was that none of us used REDkit with a controller, and we had a lot of requests to introduce controller support. The end result is that now you can play the game in the editor using a controller. We also wanted to make REDkit as open for everyone as we could, so we decided to port all of our techart tooling to Blender so people could enjoy it for free.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to gather feedback from the community to make further changes post-release?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MM:</strong> Absolutely! The community has been an integral part of the REDkit development process. Earlier this year, we brought some members of The Witcher 3 modding scene on board to help ensure we deliver the best possible experience with the editor. Last month, we launched a closed playtest on Steam, allowing users to test drive The Witcher 3 REDkit. During this phase, we received a lot of very useful feedback that we were able to implement over the past few weeks. We also opened dedicated rooms on our forums and on Discord where people can report any issues they encounter and submit their ideas on how they think we can further improve the tool. The modding community has been incredibly helpful in bringing REDkit to life, and we would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their contributions to the project. Moving forward, we definitely want to build on this and keep listening to the players, taking their feedback into consideration to ensure The Witcher 3 REDkit is the best tool it can be.</p>
<p><strong>Do you believe the new REDKit will allow modders to create whole new regions and storylines within The Witcher universe, like in Bethesda games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> Yes! Allowing gamers to create almost anything they can imagine using REDkit, be it a small piece of content or a full-fledged expansion for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, was our main goal throughout development. We will be sharing a proof of concept project inside our tutorials, which contains a bigger quest with some cutscenes and a new location. We hope it gets the creative juices flowing for the people who watch it!</p>
<p><strong>Some of the most awaited Elder Scrolls modding projects are recreations of previous games in the new engine. Would you be okay if someone decided to remake The Witcher 2 with the REDKit?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> I think it would be quite interesting to see. Some of us in the development team actually did some tests of importing maps and models from a variety of projects, and it was quite fun to see how they look in The Witcher 3 engine.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be an easy way to install mods within the game and without, such as with Steam Workshop support?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> REDkit does feature full Steam Workshop integration, which is a big win for gamers playing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on Steam. That said, aside from what Steam Workshop offers natively, there is currently no UI element in-game allowing for installing mods directly. We’ve also been in contact with Nexus Mods and The Witcher 3 Vortex extension will be updated on REDkit’s launch day to make the experience as smooth as possible from Day 1 for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to highlight the best mods in various ways, such as with contests or articles on the official website?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MM:</strong> Just like with every other project we work on, you can safely assume we will give The Witcher 3 REDkit proper attention on our social media and across our community channels. The modding community is incredibly creative, and we want to ensure that we provide them with a platform to elevate their creations and make sure players around the world hear about them. We have been working on a series of extensive video tutorials tackling the most important aspects of the editor, as well as building a wiki page that will make the onboarding process easier. As for challenges and contests, we are thinking about some ideas. All I can say is — stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
