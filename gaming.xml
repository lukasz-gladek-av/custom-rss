			<p>Today, Bethesda Game Studios celebrates the one-year anniversary since the release of Starfield, its first new intellectual property in 25 years, as well as its first-ever sci-fi franchise. On Twitter/X, the team thanked all the millions of players (14, last we <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> in June) that made this first year 'incredible' for Bethesda. At the same time, they said there's much more on the way, starting with the Shattered Space expansion set for a debut on September 30.</p>
<p>They then took the opportunity to share a few new tidbits about what will be in Starfield Shattered Space:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>ü™ê Over 50 new locations to discover and explore across Va'ruun'kai.</em></li>
<li><em>üî• New grenades to craft that stem from organic material you gather (and it's gross).</em></li>
<li><em>üëæ Formidable new enemies - be on your guard for Redeemed and Vortex Horrors...</em></li>
<li><em>‚öîÔ∏è You haven't seen the last of Zealots, Spacers, or the Crimson Fleet... As you explore the planet, be on the lookout for those taking advantage of the situation.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-adds-new-gameplay-mechanics-has-a-lot-of-densely-packed-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> from Bethesda that Shattered Space is adding new zero-gravity combat scenarios that reportedly change how players approach fights, adding a new layer of strategy. The developers also introduced new ship customization options, allowing players to really tailor their vessels to their play style, and on the exploration front, some new tools and gadgets will help players interact with the environment in deeper, more meaningful ways.</p>
<p>Overall, Shattered Space returns to the old style of Bethesda exploration simply because most of the expansion will be set on a single planet. It will feature densely packed content like hidden quests and unique encounters, as fans have been used to with Elder Scrolls and Fallout.</p>
<p>It won't be long before we check it out for ourselves and discover whether it will be better received by the community than the base Starfield game. Stay tuned!</p>

            <p>I'll admit it, I downloaded the free prologue for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game Baby Blues Nightmares mostly because I couldn't stop giggling at the offer to "utilize the unique abilities of a toddler", encompassing "stealth gameplay", "survival elements" and "upgradeable abilities". It's as though a toddler were actually an undersung class of special operator from a Tom Clancy shooter, rather than a wailing, hyperactive ball of tears and poop. Then again, I imagine Sam Fisher was a toddler once. Perhaps this is how he got started: escaping a smashed-up house full of roaming demon toys.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the game doesn't lean into the stealth-survival premise as much as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2836820/Baby_Blues_Nightmares__Toddler_Horror_Game/">the Steam page</a> suggests. When it talks about "upgradeable abilities" it means tricking out your toy tricycle, which you can use to ferry smaller, non-demonic toys around the house. When it talks about "survival elements", it's talking about soothing yourself with collectible chocolate bars, so you don't burst into tears and alert the monsters (there are also apples, which restore health but don't make you stop crying - what a judgement upon modern Western lifestyles, eh). And when it talks about "the unique abilities of a toddler", it's mostly referring to your size, which transforms the dowdy setting into a grotesque, ogreish playground, with tables to crawl under and playstools to yank around for platforming purposes.</p>
<p>Baby Blue Nightmares isn't the first game to do this - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/among-the-sleep-review-horror-pc">Among The Sleep</a> sent us tottering among gargantuan domestic fixtures back in 2014, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> does the same from a side-on perspective. But Baby Blue Nightmares does have some nice ideas of its own, not least letting you draw on walls using crayons. This is nifty partly because the game is "semi-open world" - you might want to mark up doors and the like to help you navigate and solve puzzles. But it's also cool because I have been waiting for a game that lets me live the swiftly curtailed life of a horror game NPC and cover every available surface with ranty graffiti and unexpectedly practical advice. Here's one of my contributions from the prologue. Sorry about the low brightness - I had the gamma turned up on the other monitor.</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/1_rX8kz4p.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

</figure>
<p>There's a lot of this playfulness in Baby Blue Nightmares. You can fanny around with the toys you find, bouncing rubber balls off the playroom TV, even as it blares Ominous Backstory at you, and stamping on the squeaky toys, even as they give away your position. You can drag and drop scissor-toothed, Blumhousey teddy bears to form a scissor-toothed, Blumhousey teddy bear's tea party. I'm hoping this element of whimsy will take priority over the stealth stuff, which feels quite routine, and possibly grating - you run away from things and hide under other things until the first things move on. The experience of inhabiting a small, pudgy body with zero dodge-roll capability obviously creates some suspense, but the monster designs are familiar from any number of Dead Silence clones, and so far, the game seems to hurl them at you in a familiar way.</p>
<p>The toddler is possibly the biggest monster of all. As you learn in the opening cinematic, he favours scary dolls over non-scary ones, and look, I just don't trust a two-year-old who knows how to accessorise a tricycle - it goes against Nature. There don't appear to be any grown-ups tangibly present in the world, which seems a shame, because as everybody knows, one of the most important functions of children in horror stories is traumatising their parents.</p>
<p>If mum and dad were still about in Baby Blue Nightmares, we could scare the hell out of them by handing over ghastly doodles of, oh, let's say Sam Fisher again. Mr Splinter doesn't like it when you laugh, Mommy! He gets <em>awful mad</em>, and when Mr Splinter gets mad, he does the splits over the kitchen door with his friend, Mrs Karambits.</p>
<p>The full version of Baby Blue Nightmares is out on 16th September - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2836820/Baby_Blues_Nightmares__Toddler_Horror_Game/">download the prologue here</a>. It's the work of Steelkrill Studio, a solo developer who has a thing for horror setups with a twist - take <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2276850/The_Voidness__Lidar_Horror_Survival_Game/">The Voidless</a>, in which you must use a LIDAR device to see.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But choosing not to find all of these extra collectibles will stop you from revealing all of the secret levels and mean you miss out on a bunch of extra content.</p><p>If you want to collect everything in <em>Astro Bot</em> and complete its fun trophy list, you‚Äôll be looking at closer to <strong>12 to 15 hours</strong>, depending on how much trouble you have with its most challenging levels.</p><h2 id="h327"><a id=""></a><strong>How many levels are there in Astro Bot?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="146b20ae45bbd221fb20f04204ca871f" data-recommend-id="image://146b20ae45bbd221fb20f04204ca871f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro stands on a chimney above some houses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astro stands on a chimney above some houses." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="146b20ae45bbd221fb20f04204ca871f" data-recommend-id="image://146b20ae45bbd221fb20f04204ca871f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro stands on a chimney above some houses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are a whopping <strong>80 levels</strong> in <em>Astro Bot</em> across six galaxies. However, it‚Äôs important to note that they‚Äôre not all full-blown levels in the traditional sense‚Äîvarious smaller challenge levels breaking up the larger, more sizable planets. But despite their size, the challenge levels live up to that description, providing some of the game‚Äôs most difficult gauntlets and combat encounters. There‚Äôs something here for even the most seasoned platformer fans.</p><h2 id="h328"><a id=""></a><strong>Can you customize Astro?</strong></h2><p><strong>Yes, you can customize how Astro looks!</strong> After collecting enough puzzle pieces, you‚Äôll unlock a place in the game‚Äôs hub where you can change your outfit to look like various PlayStation icons. We won‚Äôt spoil them all here, but rest assured there‚Äôs likely to be one of your favorites included!</p><h2 id="h329"><a id=""></a><strong>Does Astro Bot have New Game Plus?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="64650ff8bbd4b91da1ba48c436f21350" data-recommend-id="image://64650ff8bbd4b91da1ba48c436f21350" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro collects a golden egg atop a tower above some ruins and water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astro collects a golden egg atop a tower above some ruins and water." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="64650ff8bbd4b91da1ba48c436f21350" data-recommend-id="image://64650ff8bbd4b91da1ba48c436f21350" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro collects a golden egg atop a tower above some ruins and water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Astro Bot</em> does not have a NG+ mode at this time. That being said, you can replay levels as many times as you‚Äôd like, or you can start a new save file to experience the adventure all over again. And when there are so many hidden secrets, it‚Äôs worth returning.</p><h2 id="h330"><a id=""></a><strong>What is Astro Bot‚Äôs trophy list like?</strong></h2><p>Trophy hunters will be excited to hear that <em>Astro Bot‚Äôs</em> trophy list is both manageable and fun to complete. There are no difficulty settings, but you will need to fully complete the game by finding every bot, puzzle piece, and secret exit. You‚Äôll also need to complete a variety of random tasks in the game‚Äôs hub, usually requiring you to interact with specific characters (such as Kratos or Crash Bandicoot) in humorous ways. It‚Äôs all very fun and whimsical, making for an enjoyable path to its lovely Platinum trophy.</p><hr><p>So take your time! This isn‚Äôt a race, it‚Äôs a whimsical place of exploration and surprises. There‚Äôs a bunch of secrets to find, secret exits hidden all over, and puzzle pieces to hunt that unlock extras. Have fun!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The DLC appears to have a distinct cosmic horror flavor. As such, you'll encounter new horrific enemies called Redeemed/Vortex horrors.

		<p><em>The writing seemed to be on the wall for Concord the moment it launched, but it took just about everyone by surprise when Sony announced earlier this week that it would be formally shutting down the game just weeks after it launched. Furthermore, it wouldn't even be selling the game anymore, and started issuing refunds. We just haven't seen a flop and about-face at this scale...maybe ever?</em></p><p><em>But trying who to "blame" for Concord is tough. Game companies are in hot pursuit of establishing their own forever game, like Fortnite. It's a near impossible task, but the reward is fountain of money. Did Concord developer Firewalk simply make the video game Sony asked them to, as part of a misguided live service initiative? Or did Firewalk pitch Sony on their ability to make an inventive one of these types of games and missed the mark? It's probably some version of both, the truth of which we won't know until Jason Schreier tells us.</em></p><p><em>It's given us a lot to think about, though. We talked in-depth about Concord's implosion on this week's episode of Remap Radio, but Patrick and Rob found they still had more to work through about how all this happened and what's next.</em></p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Overwatch was not the first popular team-based game, but it did set a template many companies have chased since. Credit: Blizzard</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>When we were talking last week about <em>Concord </em>and how swiftly a live-service game can be labeled ‚Äúdead on arrival‚Äù, I sure didn‚Äôt think Sony <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/447033/concord-ps5-pc-pulled-refunds-sony-firewalk?ref=remapradio.com"><u>would be turning out the lights</u></a> in just a few days. So that is a hero shooter that arrived August 23, and then by September 3rd it‚Äôs studio announced it was desliting the game, now by the sixth it is going offline entirely.</p><p>Now it‚Äôs premature to say that this is the end for <em>Concord</em>. The studio released <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>the usual statement</u></a> about how they‚Äôre evaluating options and deciding on the best path forward, and I hope they manage to come up with a rework and a model for this game that enjoys some success. However, it‚Äôs also remarkable the speed at which this launch unraveled and how thoroughly Sony is not just halting it, but throwing the entire thing in reverse.</p><p>We spoke at length about how much harder the ‚Äúlive service‚Äù model is than major publishers thought. But I also wonder if the entire way these projects are conceived, developed, and brought to market is increasing the odds of a game launching straight into a death-spiral. After all, when we were talking about <em>Concord </em>we were arguing that once a game misses the mark this badly, players will avoid investing in it because they <em>know </em>it‚Äôs going to be abandoned and shut down as quickly as humanly possible. We didn‚Äôt imagine it would be anything like this fast, and I suppose Sony gets some credit for issuing refunds rather than slinking away from it in a year, but it also serves to demonstrate the core point: players know that publishers and developers are not going to stand behind these games.</p><p>Now maybe <em>Concord </em>is a unique case where the initial reaction was <em>so </em>indifferent that it was clear that nothing was going to save the game from having an unsustainably small player base that would never generate enough positive word-of-mouth to turn the game into being a small cult success. Sometimes a bomb is just a bomb.</p><p>But I also wonder to what degree live service games supported by major publishers can‚Äôt be affordably supported unless they come out of the gate as something approaching a hit. I don‚Äôt know what the budget for <em>Concord </em>was, nor do I know what amount of monthly spending is required to maintain Firewalk Studios staff and infrastructure (the ‚Äúburn‚Äù rate of the studio). Just judging from how quickly <em>Concord </em>has been abandoned, it suggests that there‚Äôs no way for a publisher to wait out the long process of building the community and identity of a multiplayer game.</p><p>The thing is‚Ä¶ how many games like this don‚Äôt need an exceedingly long runway? You could point to <em>Overwatch </em>and say that was an instant hit, but you could just as easily argue that it was capitalizing on the Blizzard brand (built over decades) and then occupying a genre space that people had come to understand thanks to, again, decades of <em>Team Fortress 2</em> and MOBAs. <em>Fortnite </em>had to be retooled to become a battle royale. <em>Apex Legends </em>might be an exception but even there‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure you can pretend it would have emerged fully formed had two <em>Titanfall </em>games not come and gone.</p><p>It takes a long time to get people on board with a new multiplayer-focused game. Way longer than the development cycle of a game. If it has truly new and distinctive ideas, it will take a while for people to warm up to those ideas and for them to be refined and made accessible and appealing to a broader audience. And if it‚Äôs an exercise on a genre that‚Äôs already popular, well, that just means not many people have a reason to play a new one.</p><p>Something that concerns me about this trend toward ‚Äúgrand opening, grand closing‚Äù live service launches is the way they suggest the people who hold the purse strings at studios fundamentally do not grasp this reality. Almost every major success they are pursuing is built on years of foundational work done in modding communities, or as part of a major ongoing franchise that predates the live-service era.</p><p>I suspect a lot of publishers dream of owning the next <em>Warframe </em>but let me tell you, I think every single major publisher would have abandoned <em>Warframe </em>in its infancy, or forced Digital Extremes to undergo debilitating cuts that would have made it impossible to grow and sustain the game.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Some of gaming's live service success stories come from the least likely places, like Warframe. Credit: Digital Extremes</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick:<em> </em></strong>I know that Digital Extremes is largely known for <em>Warframe </em>these days, but in my mind, they‚Äôre actually the studio that helped Epic Games build <em>Unreal</em>. Seriously! They were co-developers on Unreal, Unreal Tournament‚Äîthey were even co-developers on <em>Unreal Tournament 2004</em>, one of the GOATs. It‚Äôs also funny you break up <em>Warframe</em>, because <em>Warframe </em>itself was a free-to-play desperation play by Digital Extremes in the wake of the studio struggling to sign projects, which leveraged its messy 2008 action game <em>Dark Sector</em>. Digital Extremes was a shooter-focused company that‚Äôd been in the genre since 1993. Is it any wonder someone like Digital Extremes was able to, at some point, strike gold with that expertise?</p><p>What‚Äôs interesting about the <em>Concord </em>case is that it‚Äôs shocking to the world we‚Äôre most intimately familiar with, but absolutely standard practice in mobile games. In mobile, it‚Äôs called a ‚Äúsoft launch,‚Äù where a game is released in a select number of countries and nowhere else. If things go well, the game might launch elsewhere, country by country, until it‚Äôs ‚Äúproperly‚Äù released. But it‚Äôs also common for a game‚Äôs ‚Äúsoft launch‚Äù to be the only light of day a game sees before deletion. The modern free-to-play movement was born out of mobile, where competition is vicious, cruel, and unyielding. Those lessons haven‚Äôt been learned in AAA, or else I doubt Sony would‚Äôve actually spent money on expensive motion capture for a game like Concord.</p><p>Supercell, one of the most popular mobile creators, <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2024/03/14/all-games-killed-by-supercell-everdale-hay-day-pop-clash-mini?ref=remapradio.com"><u>has canceled dozens of games that it‚Äôs ‚Äúlaunched.‚Äù</u></a>&nbsp;</p><p>Is that <em>good</em>? Is that <em>sustainable</em>? I can‚Äôt speak to the specifics of mobile economics, but it‚Äôs likely only possible because the ecosystem of budgeting and staffing is built around aggressively accepting failure.</p>

The discount lasts until Monday, September 9, and the 2023 RPG is a whopping twenty percent off, bringing the price down from $59.99 to $47.99. If you‚Äôre at all a fan of RPGs, you‚Äôll find something to love in <em>Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3</em>. The game, which takes place within the iconic <em>D&amp;D</em> setting that is the Forgotten Realms, is full of compelling characters, incredible writing, deep systems, and an unrivaled sense of player freedom. Seriously, if you even think you can do something, the game will likely give you a way to execute it. It‚Äôs also a worthwhile investment for how much time you‚Äôll spend playing it, as just the main story will take you nearly 100 hours to complete, which doesn‚Äôt account for multiple playthroughs and all the wacky hijinks you can get up to between major narrative beats.</p><figure id="" data-id="8032a79b341a1cf73e1b7f2a2b8666a0" data-recommend-id="image://8032a79b341a1cf73e1b7f2a2b8666a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A party of adventurers stand outside a small cottage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A party of adventurers stand outside a small cottage" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Larian Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8032a79b341a1cf73e1b7f2a2b8666a0" data-recommend-id="image://8032a79b341a1cf73e1b7f2a2b8666a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A party of adventurers stand outside a small cottage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And even if you do already own <em>Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3</em>, there are other great Larian games on sale as well.

Many will call <em>BG3 </em>Larian‚Äôs masterpiece but for my money, <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em> represents the studio at their most inventive.<br></p><p>At first glance there isn‚Äôt much differentiating the two: they both have complex companion characters, expansive epic narratives, and interactive TTRPG-inspired systems. However, <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em> has the advantage of not being based on the existing <em>D&amp;D</em> world and rule set, which allowed Larian to create a more compelling world of their own, both in terms of narrative and combat rules. Much like a TTRPG player may tell you <em>D&amp;D</em> isn‚Äôt the be-all, end-all of the medium, and in fact has a number of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/gaming/baldurs-gate-3-rpg-dungeons-dragons-5e-flaws&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/baldurs-gate-3-rpg-dungeons-dragons-5e-flaws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long-running issues</a></span>, I‚Äôm here to argue that <em>BG3 </em>falls short in some ways, and that <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em> outshines it<em> </em>because it lacks the drawbacks inherent to <em>D&amp;D</em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/undisputed-final-preview-calling-all-fight-night-fans<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The Fight Night series may be about to get KO'd by a new challenger to the boxing genre. </h2></div><section><p>While boxing has never been my favorite sport, I can't tell you how many hours I put into the Fight Night series back in the 2000s. The combination of realism and focus on presentation lived up to EA Sports' motto of making you feel like you're in the game. Despite my nostalgia for that franchise, it only took an hour-long preview of Undisputed at PAX West to realize that the boxing video game genre has a new contender on the horizon. </p><p>I jumped right into my Undisputed preview by challenging Steel City Interactive CEO and Co-Founder Ash Habib to a sparring match. In reality, it was more of a tutorial, as he ran through all the basics of the mechanics while explaining how and why they were put into the game. It only took until the character selection screen for me to get my first rush of excitement with Undisputed. It‚Äôs sporting a huge roster of notable boxing stars past and present, including Mike Tyson, Katie Taylor, and Eddie Hall. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Undisputed - September 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>You read that right; you can even play as one of the World's Strongest Men. Naturally, I had to go with Hall as soon as I saw him, even if it was a slight mismatch against Habib's choice of Muhammad Ali. Despite the disadvantage, I was confident that my history with Fight Night would serve me well. Ali might be the greatest of all time, but Hall is an absolute monster of a man. It didn't take long into the fight to show how wrong I was. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Every detail matters in Undisputed, from how characters move to their size and attributes.</p></div><p>At first, the gameplay felt very similar to what I was used to, thanks to my previous experience with boxing games. It wasn't long before I felt comfortable dodging, jabbing, and throwing power punches in rhythm with my opponent's movements. As the fight continued, I began to see small gameplay features that emphasized how important it was to the development team to make matches feel as true to life as possible. Every detail matters in Undisputed, from how characters move to their size and attributes, with each giving way to a certain strategy that changes how you can approach each fight.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Alongside the 60 different punches and different defensive tools in the game, footwork and positioning also play a huge part in controlling the flow of matches. Thanks to a combination of speed and agility, characters like Muhammad Ali can back themselves into a corner, then use the bob and weave mechanic to turn the tables and unleash a flurry of body blows that can deal heavy damage to both health and stamina. </p><p>Just like in real life, there are tactics to recover stamina if you want to play the long game. Refrain from throwing punches, get your opponent into a clinch, or even take a strategic knee, and you'll be rewarded at the end of the round with increased health and stamina. These tactics aren‚Äôt guaranteed to always work, as all it takes is one power punch to send even the strongest fighters to the mat. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Once down, Undisputed uses a disorientation system where you must simultaneously try to line both triggers into a green area, mimicking what it is like for a boxer to try and get up after a knockdown in real life. While this may sound easy, each side's green area moves differently, so it felt like I was trying to rub my belly and head simultaneously in different directions. Not too long into round two, Eddie Hall suffered a hard-fought loss to Muhammad Ali, signaling the end of my first fight in Undisputed. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The decisions made outside the ring are just as important as inside in Career Mode.</p></div><p>After the exhibition, I looked at the in-depth career mode and was shocked by the level of detail that had gone into it. In it, the decisions made outside the ring are just as important as inside, and many factors determine your path. Stick with the same manager throughout your career, and you'll get to see their attributes grow alongside you. The downside to dedication is that you'll only have three attribute slots for them instead of the maximum of five, which more notable valets boast. While going the heartless route and replacing your equivalent to Mickey Goldmill with Don King may have some unique benefits, there are also downsides. Any time you get a new manager or even a cutman, you'll have to start from scratch whenever you hire new people for your team. This means some of the unlocked skills that work as buffs to your attributes need to be unlocked again by completing new challenges. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Other cause-and-effect decisions like fighting above your skill level, growing your fame instead of training, or refusing to rest have consequences that could lead to an early retirement. Even though I only saw about 10 minutes of career mode, I was genuinely impressed with how much effort went into trying to make it as realistic as the gameplay I'd already seen from Undisputed. </p><p>Even with my limited experience with the sport, I can already tell Undisputed is crafted by people who understand and love boxing. While it's been over a decade since a proper game in the genre has been released outside of VR, this one may prove to have been worth the wait. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-open-beta-gets-significant-changes-for-weekend-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Developer Treyarch has made some significant changes to <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> as the open beta heads into its second weekend.</p><p>Black Ops 6, out October 25, 2024, has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-a-new-feature-fans-are-saying-will-get-people-banned-or-make-them-go-viral-or-both">a new Body Shield feature</a>, a new Omnimovement feature, and various features returning from Treyarch's 2020 game, Black Ops Cold War.</p><p>The Black Ops 6 open beta restarts at 10am PT today, September 6, and with it comes tweaks to weapons, spawns, and various other gameplay elements that affect Multiplayer.</p><p>‚ÄúMany of the changes below are based on data and feedback from Weekend 1,‚Äù Treyarch explained in a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/patchnotes/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-open-beta-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, ‚Äúbut rest assured we are also taking this into account as we look ahead to launch. We‚Äôll be sharing more about what‚Äôs to come in the weeks after Weekend 2 concludes.‚Äù</p><p>Highlights include an overall increase to weapon swap speeds, small adjustments to baseline movement speeds on all weapon classes, various weapon balance changes, and adjusted spawn logic across several maps with the goal of reducing a high frequency of spawn flipping. There's a welcome increase to weapon XP gain, too, which will decrease the amount of time needed to gain weapon levels.</p><h2>Check out the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Weekend 2 patch notes in full below:</h2><h2>MULTIPLAYER</h2><h3>WEAPONS</h3><u>WEAPON SWAP SPEEDS</u><p>We‚Äôve seen the feedback about weapon swap speeds, and we agree. We‚Äôll be reducing weapon drop times across the board for an overall increase to swap speeds. Players looking for an even quicker swap speed can try out the Fast Hands Strategist Perk in Week 2 of the Beta. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Assault Rifle, SMG, Shotgun, LMG, Marksman Rifle, Pistol, and Launcher drop times reduced by 50ms </li><li>Sniper drop times reduced by 100ms</li></ul><u>MOVEMENT SPEEDS</u><p>We are making small adjustments to baseline movement speeds on all weapon classes to make sure they are sitting in a good spot relative to one another. We have mostly focused on Move Speeds and ADS Move Speeds, which come into play during combat engagements.</p><p>Overall we are happy with the weapon class usage and performance we‚Äôve seen in Beta Weekend 1, as well as the upper end of movement pacing offered by SMGs, so these adjustments keep SMGs the same and generally improve other classes. We are mindful of speeding the game up too much and will continue to monitor and assess game data and your feedback. </p><p>The other notable change here is to Melee Sprint Speeds. We want players to feel incentivized to pull out their Dedicated Melee weapon as a means of map traversal. We also want to ensure that Melee users can catch up to other players who are sprinting with ranged weapons for those sneaky Body Shields and Finishing Moves.</p>Movement Speed Adjustments<!-- -->Assault Rifles<ul data-cy="list"><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.75m/s -&gt; 1.88m/s </li><li>Move Speed increased from 4.14m/s -&gt; 4.29m/s </li><li>ADS Move Speed increased from 3.07m/s -&gt; 3.23m/s </li></ul>SMGs<ul data-cy="list"><li>Crouch Speed increased from 2.31m/s -&gt; 2.77m/s</li></ul>Shotguns<ul data-cy="list"><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.63m/s -&gt; 1.75m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 4.14m/s -&gt; 4.29m/s</li><li>ADS Move Speed increased from 3.07m/s -&gt; 3.23m/s</li></ul>LMGs<ul data-cy="list"><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.14m/s -&gt; 1.3m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 3.71m/s -&gt; 3.86m/s</li><li>ADS Move Speed increased from 2.31m/s -&gt; 2.46m/s</li></ul>Marksman Rifles<ul data-cy="list"><li>Crouch Speed increased from 2.41m/s -&gt; 2.49m/s</li><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.37m/s -&gt; 1.55m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 3.76m/s -&gt; 3.99m/s</li><li>ADS Move Speed increased from 2.9m/s -&gt; 3m/s</li></ul>Sniper Rifles<ul data-cy="list"><li>Crouch Speed decreased from 2.41m/s -&gt; 2.31m/s</li></ul>Pistols<ul data-cy="list"><li>Crouch Speed decreased from 2.9m/s -&gt; 2.84m/s</li><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.88m/s -&gt; 2.24m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 4.47m/s -&gt; 4.52m/s</li><li>ADS Move Speed decreased from 3.94m/s -&gt; 3.81m/s</li></ul>Launchers<ul data-cy="list"><li>Crouch Speed decreased from 2.44m/s -&gt; 2.18m/s</li></ul>Melee<ul data-cy="list"><li>Crouch Speed increased from 2.9m/s -&gt; 2.95m/s</li><li>Jog Speed increased from 5.16m/s -&gt; 5.31m/s</li><li>Sprint Speed increased from 6.93m/s -&gt; 7.16m/s</li><li>Super Sprint Speed increased from 8.41m/s -&gt; 8.66m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 4.47m/s -&gt; 4.62</li></ul><u><strong>Weapon Adjustments</strong></u>SMG Adjustments<h3>Jackal PDW</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Decreased Maximum Damage from 29 -&gt; 26 <ul data-cy="list"><li>Decreased Maximum Damage range from 15.24m -&gt; 14.61m </li></ul></li><li>Decreased Near-Medium Damage from 23 -&gt; 22 <ul data-cy="list"><li>Decreased Near-Medium Damage range from 22.86m -&gt; 17.78m </li></ul></li><li>Decreased Medium Damage from 22 -&gt; 18 <ul data-cy="list"><li>Decreased Medium Damage range from 29.21m -&gt; 26.04m </li></ul></li><li>Decreased Minimum Damage from 19 -&gt; 15 </li><li>Small increase to view kick strength and view kick deviation.</li><li><strong>CHF Barrel</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Headshot multiplier improved from 1.2 -&gt; 1.4 </li></ul></li></ul><p><em>The Jackal PDW ‚Äòs intended strength is best in class handling and decent mobility, balanced by a slower rate of fire compared to many of the other automatic weapons in the game. It was overperforming at medium ranges, so we‚Äôve increased the damage falloff and pulled the ranges closer along with a slight increase to recoil. Maximum damage and CHF Barrel headshot multiplier have been adjusted to maintain the same hit to kill numbers while using the attachment.</em></p><h3><strong>C9</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Increased medium damage range from 25.4m -&gt; 27.31m </li></ul><p><em>We feel that the C9 is in a good spot as a well-rounded Submachine Gun with a solid rate of fire. It has higher horizontal recoil compared to other Submachine Guns, so we‚Äôve given a boost to its medium damage falloff range.</em></p>Marksman Rifles Adjustments<h3>SWAT 5.56</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Disabled burst fire queuing, which was queuing an additional burst if the fire input was activated at any time during the previous burst or the burst cooldown.</li></ul><p><em>This is a minor change to improve control with the Swat 5.56 (and any future burst weapons). </em></p><u>ATTACHMENTS</u><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Rapid Fire attachment now correctly displays its recoil penalty con. The attachment description has also been updated to indicate the tradeoff.  </li></ul><h3>MAPS</h3>General <ul data-cy="list"><li>Adjusted general spawn logic to enable additional valid spawns under certain scenarios. </li><li>Adjusted spawn logic across several maps with the goal of reducing a high frequency of spawn flipping.</li></ul><p><em>Our longstanding definition of a ‚Äúbad spawn‚Äù is any time a player deals or receives damage within 3 seconds of spawning. This is the cornerstone of building the spawn system and does not change regardless of map size or game mode. We use this metric (among others) to track bad spawn rates for Black Ops 6, meaning that if you dealt or received damage within 3 seconds in Weekend 1 of the Beta, we saw it.</em></p><p><em>As an example, our Core Moshpit entry with the highest bad spawn rate in Week 1 was Domination on Skyline with a 4.2% rate, which means 4.2 out of every 100 spawns saw someone give or receive damage within that 3 second window. While we are generally happy with our averages, we know that an average also consists of worst cases, and we'll continue to assess throughout the lifetime of this game.</em></p><p><em>We also recognize that we each have our own definition of what a good spawn or a bad spawn is, and that‚Äôs not always just about combat situations. For example, did I spawn out too far on Hardpoint? Or why am I spawning on the same side of the map as the enemy team? The overarching spawn system and the placement of spawns in a map are critical to the flow of the match. It is our goal with Black Ops 6, as it has been with every prior Black Ops game, to have a predictable spawn system that results in head-on engagements with your opponents while providing ample time from respawn for decision making. This includes accounting for time before getting into an engagement before you‚Äôre ready for it.</em></p><p><em>For Weekend 2 of our Open Beta, we‚Äôve adjusted general spawn logic and have targeted multiple maps with additional tuning changes with the goal of improving predictability and time to engagement. We know we have some work to do and will continue to process our data, evaluate your feedback, and play the game with you all to draw our own conclusions on how to continue making positive progress.</em></p><h3>SCORESTREAKS</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>RC-XD</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Improved handling and general usability.    </li></ul></li><li><strong>Watchdog Helo</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Increased base health.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Hellstorm</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Increased Cluster Bomb damage radius.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>EQUIPMENT</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Lethal Equiptment<ul data-cy="list"><li>Thermo Grenade<ul data-cy="list"><li>    Reduced explosive ignition delay.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>MOVEMENT</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Slight increase to the time to enter prone or supine during a slide. </li><li>Slight increase to all mantle speeds. </li><li>Slight decrease to time before movement is allowed after landing from a Dive to Prone. </li><li>Slight increase to Dive to Prone landing friction.</li></ul><h3>PROGRESSION</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Weapon XP </strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Increased awarded Weapon XP, which will decrease the amount of time needed to gain Weapon Levels.

            <p>
This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we discuss the most dramatic few days for PlayStation in recent times.

<p>Sony's stunning <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">decision to kill off live-service shooter flop Concord after less than two weeks</a> sent shockwaves around the industry, setting a new precedent for how swiftly a troubled title from a major publisher could be given the axe. After eight years of work, the game has already disappeared from sale, and will soon vanish from people's game libraries, with refunds automatically given. It's a remarkable move - even if Concord does somehow get a second lease of life - and another nail in the coffin for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-confirms-delay-to-half-its-planned-live-service-games">Sony's overly-ambitious live-service plans</a> that have already seen other projects <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">shelved</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">delayed</a>.</p>
<p>And yet Sony has still ended this week on something of a high - riding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-review">a wave of love for Astro Bot</a>, the company's platforming platform mascot and star of an excellent new game, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-playstation-5-pro-design-seemingly-confirmed-by-sonys-official-30th-anniversary-art">subtly-teasing one of the worst-kept secrets in video games right now</a>: the imminent announcement of its souped-up PlayStation 5 Pro. Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Victoria Kennedy and Vikki Blake, as we dissect the week, discuss what might be next for Concord, and where PlayStation goes from here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/street-fighter-6-sales-reach-four-million-globally/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Capcom has announced that Street Fighter 6 has hit a brand-new milestone, just 15 months after the game was first released. <a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1831814865297489924" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As announced on X</a>, Street Fighter 6 has officially reached over four million sales globally. This now puts it on a level playing field with Mortal Kombat, which surpassed that number 11 months after launch. Despite that, at least in the fighting game community, it seems that Street Fighter 6 is the more popular of the two. However, Tekken 8 did significantly better than these combined, reaching two million sales in a month.</p>
<p>With this information, Capcom firmly believes that Street Fighter 6 is on the right path to surpass the sales of Street Fighter 5, which reached over 7.6 million sales in its lifetime. Street Fighter 6 still has a lot of life left in it, with Capcom hoping that the sales will surpass 10 million sales during its lifetime. Currently, there is still a lot of content planned for Street Fighter 6, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/street-fighter-6-terry-gamescom-hands-on-ready-for-domination/">Terry being the latest fighter</a> to join the roster, being officially released on September 24, 2024.</p>
<p>For context, Street Fighter 5 was first released in 2016, and most players continued to play it until the release of Street Fighter 6. The Champion Edition of the game, which included all DLC characters, was released in 2020.</p>
<p>As it stands, Street Fighter 6 is currently in the middle of season 2, with the DLC characters Terry and Mai, fighters from Fatal Fury and The King of Fighters, respectively, joining the game this year. Looking further into the future, Elena is due to return to Street Fighter 6 after her debut in Street Fighter 3 sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>So far, Street Fighter 6 has seen a lot of content added to the game, including DLC fighters such as Rashid, Ed, Akuma, A.K.I, and M.Bison, the most recent fighter to join the roster. Compared to previous iterations in the franchise, Street Fighter 6 is the most accessible, with the option of using Modern Controls, similar to the new feature added to Tekken 8. For those who struggle to do complex button inputs, Modern Controls allows you to use a smaller amount of buttons to execute the same combo. However, it doesn't come without consequences. Using Modern Controls reduces the damage output of Special moves and Supers.</p>
<p>Overall, Street Fighter 6 is on a great path, and with more DLC characters in the future, there is plenty of room for the game to grow and surpass the 4 million sales it has currently reached. Although it isn't stated in the post, it's safe to assume that this number comes from sales across all platforms, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/greedfall-2-developer-spiders-secures-better-pay-and-policies-after-strike.974142/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-strike-policies-negotiations<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>GreedFall 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Steelrising&nbsp;</em>developer Spiders has scored a win for itself by securing better pay and working conditions following a strike that took place earlier this week.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/spiders-employees-secure-boosted-wages-better-remote-work-policies" rel="noopener" target="_blank">statement provided to Game Developer</a>, studio management says it's negotiated raises and improved working policies with employees, although the statement does also contain some pointed remarks regarding allegations made by the union to which said employees belong.</p>
<p>Spiders bosses say that statements made by the SJTV union in an <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/08/open-letter-from-spiders-workers-to-their-employer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open letter to managers last week</a> were "false and defamatory", so even though the managerial side of the studio has agreed to better conditions for employees, it sounds like they didn't do so without some pushback.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spiders-strike-negotiations-greedfall-2.jpg?itok=y5rvSH9B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spiders-strike-negotiations-greedfall-2.jpg?itok=subQOyw4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Spiders is currently working on&nbsp;<em>GreedFall 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Game Developer, Spiders managers have agreed to raise the studio's minimum base salary by 11%, starting from this month (and retroactive to April 1st of this year).</p>
<p>Although that sounds like a pretty big jump, Game Developer does also say that the average Spiders employee will only see a salary increase of around 3% as a result of this move. Still, it's progress, right?</p>
<p>Additionally, workers will now benefit from a "telework company agreement" that should improve remote working policies in the studio, and management has agreed to conduct an audit on working conditions.</p>
<p>Spiders managers aren't just out for SJTV, either; they're also seemingly upset with the media. In the statement given to Game Developer, studio management says that the "portrayal" of the studio's working conditions in the media is an "attempt to destabilize the company".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spiders-steelrising.jpg?itok=TUnfLvqR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spiders-steelrising.jpg?itok=se3ezHa6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Spiders is also responsible for the rather curious Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Steelrising</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering what Spiders is up to right now, the studio is currently gearing up to release the hotly-anticipated RPG sequel&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/greedfall-2-dying-world"><em>GreedFall 2</em></a>, which will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-release-date">hit Early Access later this month</a>.</p>

For your primary weapon, you‚Äôll want to select the Heavy Bolt Rifle. It excels at close and mid-range fights, and you‚Äôll want to ensure that you‚Äôre hitting anything that‚Äôs fairly close to you.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is the only gun that you can swap out in this class, so you won‚Äôt have much freedom with alternative builds in your arsenal.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b0ba7f4d228e8558d50f95fa5ea7faa8" data-recommend-id="image://b0ba7f4d228e8558d50f95fa5ea7faa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Assault Class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Assault Class" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b0ba7f4d228e8558d50f95fa5ea7faa8" data-recommend-id="image://b0ba7f4d228e8558d50f95fa5ea7faa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Assault Class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Assault class is meant for those looking to fight up close and personal. We recommend that you lean far into this. Since this class is unable to have a primary weapon, we suggest using the Heavy Bolt Pistol as your secondary because this can double as a ranged weapon, and it packs a serious punch.</p><p>As for your melee weapon, we highly recommend the Thunder Hammer. One, because it‚Äôs a giant hammer that allows you to live out your Thor power fantasy, and two, because it‚Äôs the strongest weapon of the bunch. Even though it does have the slowest swing out of the three, we are mainly looking for it to dish out maximum damage more than anything else.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3ff0a94d2edd960e64f1cd880a99c7eb" data-recommend-id="image://3ff0a94d2edd960e64f1cd880a99c7eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vanguard Class." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Vanguard Class." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3ff0a94d2edd960e64f1cd880a99c7eb" data-recommend-id="image://3ff0a94d2edd960e64f1cd880a99c7eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vanguard Class." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Vanguard class is meant to be played zippy. For this, you‚Äôll want to have the Instigator Bolt Carbine as your primary weapon. When compared to the Metal and Oculus, it‚Äôs the better fit for Vanguard because it has a three-round burst that allows you to place your shots in a single target. This ensures you inflict as much damage as possible.</p><p>For a melee weapon, you‚Äôll want to stick with the Combat Knife, because when playing Vanguard you‚Äôre not looking to jump into a horde. Instead, you‚Äôre mainly focusing on one target at a time, and this setup will help when going toe-to-toe with enemies.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="40bd4443ea80a5b893d5c7ec101b8791" data-recommend-id="image://40bd4443ea80a5b893d5c7ec101b8791" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bulwark class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bulwark class" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="40bd4443ea80a5b893d5c7ec101b8791" data-recommend-id="image://40bd4443ea80a5b893d5c7ec101b8791" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bulwark class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Even though the Bulwark class is meant to be played in melee combat, you‚Äôll want to make sure you have a proper secondary to help you in unavoidable ranged fights, especially as you don‚Äôt have access to a primary. With that in mind, we recommend using the Plasma Pistol for a couple of reasons: The first is that you won‚Äôt have to worry about reloading it, letting you keep firing without stopping in your tracks. The second is that you can charge it up to ensure you inflict as much damage as possible.</p><p>When selecting your melee weapon, we suggest using the Power Sword. Out of all three, it‚Äôs the most balanced, so it‚Äôll allow you to play with more versatility, and keep you from staying in one play-style. Plus, it has a super cool lighting effect that triggers whenever you swing it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="17910da3b0fe0932ff72d5fb6f818e19" data-recommend-id="image://17910da3b0fe0932ff72d5fb6f818e19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sniper Class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sniper Class" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17910da3b0fe0932ff72d5fb6f818e19" data-recommend-id="image://17910da3b0fe0932ff72d5fb6f818e19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sniper Class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When using the Sniper class, we recommend staying away from the Stalker Bolt Rifle and the Bolt Carbine. The weapon we best suggest you use is the Las Fusil Sniper Rifle because it has the highest firepower out of all of them. This class is meant to be played at a distance, and Las Fusil is the perfect gun for picking off enemies from afar.</p><p>This is another class that doesn‚Äôt have a lot of freedom when it comes to having a diverse loadout. You won‚Äôt be able to switch out your melee or secondary weapon, so make sure you‚Äôre comfortable with the Bolt Pistol and Combat Knife. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f15550fe9e1a48346fcf691fa84d9823" data-recommend-id="image://f15550fe9e1a48346fcf691fa84d9823" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="heavy class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="heavy class" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f15550fe9e1a48346fcf691fa84d9823" data-recommend-id="image://f15550fe9e1a48346fcf691fa84d9823" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="heavy class" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Heavy Class is the only option that doesn‚Äôt allow you to have a melee weapon. The best way to counter that is by equipping the Multi-Melta. This gun is basically a shotgun flamethrower that‚Äôll melt anything it shoots. The only downside is that you have to be close to your targets, but that shouldn‚Äôt be an issue when playing the Heavy.</p><p>As for secondaries, we suggest the Plasma Pistol. This gun has a fairly decent range and can be used in mid-ranged fights when attempting to close the gap for your Melta.</p><hr><p>These are the best loadouts we recommend using while hunting the Emperor enemies in <em>Space Marine 2</em>. As you level up in the game, you can upgrade these weapons and customize them to your liking, which will only help you in combat. Go out there and slay some heretics!<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Not only am I 60 hours in and about 11 chapters deep, but I don‚Äôt see an immediate end anywhere in sight. These games are traditionally massive crime epics stuffed to the brim with characters and activities to do. At the moment, I‚Äôm in the middle of a cabaret mini-game that is its own management sim within <em>Yakuza 0</em>, which is a brawler, and features its own storyline about my character trying to reclaim the neighborhood from the clutches of cartoonishly evil business owners. That‚Äôs on top of all the other irreverent substories that are typically featured in a <em>Yakuza </em>game.</p><p>But these games are just as technically and artistically impressive as they are massive. Real-world settings, like Kabukich≈ç, are the inspiration for the nearly 1:1 era-specific recreations that are rendered across the <em>Yakuza</em> games, which take you to pockets of Tokyo, as well as Osaka, Yokohama, and Hiroshima. I once recognized the exact place a friend had posted on their Instagram story because they happened to be in D≈çtonbori, which is the real-world equivalent of the Sotenbori setting that regularly features in the games, especially <em>Yakuza 0.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>The <em>Yakuza </em>games are deep in more senses than just sheer content. I sometimes bristle against brawlers, which often feel too button-mashy for my taste, but I‚Äôm finding a surprising amount of depth in <em>Yakuza 0</em>‚Äôs mechanics. There are completely different styles of fighting that should be used in the right scenarios/boss fights, but there are huge skill trees attached to each of them, and even a storyline centered around the people training you. Six fighting styles split evenly across two protagonists on entirely different maps means that <em>Yakuza 0 </em>has felt tremendous in scope, but it also hasn‚Äôt been overwhelming. Chapters do a great job of giving either character ample time to breathe, and I‚Äôve thus far been encouraged to go at my own pace and set my own priorities as far as goals, skills, and completion.</p><p>Extrapolate that formula across about six other titles that consistently grow in scale, and you‚Äôre in for a hell of an undertaking with <em>Yakuza Complete Series</em>.

The patch notes reveal several major adjustments, including changes to weapon movement speed and a nerf to last weekend's overpowered Jackal PDW submachine gun.</p><p dir="ltr">This second weekend raises the level cap from 20 to 30, so players will have access to more of Black Ops 6's weapons, scorestreaks, perks, and equipment. This includes popular perks, such as Ninja, Cold-Blooded, and Fast Hands.</p><p dir="ltr">A change is coming to the swap speeds for all weapons. The weapon-drop time was reduced for sniper rifles by 100ms, while weapons in all other classes were reduced by 50ms. Treyarch says players looking for an even quicker weapon swap should try out the Fast Hands strategist perk.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4363189-cod-bo6-needtoknowbeta-025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363189" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4363189-cod-bo6-needtoknowbeta-025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4363189"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 beta rewards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4363189-cod-bo6-needtoknowbeta-025.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The movement speeds of weapon classes are also adjusted for week two. The developer explains that these are small adjustments to baseline movement speeds on all weapon classes to "make sure they are sitting in a good spot relative to one another." These movement adjustments include move speeds and ADS move speeds, which come into play during combat engagements.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Treyarch says it's being mindful of speeding the game up too much and will continue to monitor and assess game data and player feedback.</p><p dir="ltr">Another movement change comes from an adjustment to speed up the melee sprint speeds. The developer says it wants players to feel incentivized to pull out their dedicated melee weapon as a means of map traversal and ensure that melee users can catch up to other players who are sprinting with ranged weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">The first weekend of the beta was dominated by the Jackal PDW submachine gun, but Treyarch confirmed it was overperforming at medium ranges. The nerf includes an increase to the damage falloff, a reduced damage range, and a slight increase to recoil. Additionally, week two gives players access to the new Tanto .22 submachine gun, so players will have another option for submachine guns to try out.</p><p dir="ltr">Spawns are also adjusted based on the feedback from week one. Treyarch has adjusted the game's general spawn logic to enable additional valid spawns, and also changed the spawn logic across several maps with the goal of reducing a high frequency of spawn flipping.</p><p>The full patch notes can be seen below, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-open-beta-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">as shared by Activision</a>.</p><p>Here are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-settings/1100-6526279/" data-ref-id="1100-6526279">some recommended Black Ops 6 settings</a> to try for the beta.

We‚Äôll be reducing weapon drop times across the board for an overall increase to swap speeds. Players looking for an even quicker swap speed can try out the Fast Hands Strategist Perk in Week 2 of the Beta.</p><ul><li>Assault Rifle, SMG, Shotgun, LMG, Marksman Rifle, Pistol, and Launcher drop times reduced by 50ms</li><li>Sniper drop times reduced by 100ms</li></ul><h4><u>MOVEMENT SPEEDS</u></h4><p>We are making small adjustments to baseline movement speeds on all weapon classes to make sure they are sitting in a good spot relative to one another. We have mostly focused on Move Speeds and ADS Move Speeds, which come into play during combat engagements.</p><p>Overall we are happy with the weapon class usage and performance we‚Äôve seen in Beta Weekend 1, as well as the upper end of movement pacing offered by SMGs, so these adjustments keep SMGs the same and generally improve other classes. We are mindful of speeding the game up too much and will continue to monitor and assess game data and your feedback.</p><p>The other notable change here is to Melee Sprint Speeds. We want players to feel incentivized to pull out their Dedicated Melee weapon as a means of map traversal. We also want to ensure that Melee users can catch up to other players who are sprinting with ranged weapons for those sneaky Body Shields and Finishing Moves.</p><h4>Movement Speed Adjustments</h4><p>Weapon Category Adjustments</p><h4>Assault Rifles</h4><ul><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.75m/s -&gt; 1.88m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 4.14m/s -&gt; 4.29m/s</li><li>ADS Move Speed increased from 3.07m/s -&gt; 3.23m/s</li></ul><h4>SMGs</h4><ul><li>Crouch Speed increased from 2.31m/s -&gt; 2.77m/s</li></ul><h4>Shotguns</h4><ul><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.63m/s -&gt; 1.75m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 4.14m/s -&gt; 4.29m/s</li><li>ADS Move Speed increased from 3.07m/s -&gt; 3.23m/s</li></ul><h4>LMGs</h4><ul><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.14m/s -&gt; 1.3m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 3.71m/s -&gt; 3.86m/s</li><li>ADS Move Speed increased from 2.31m/s -&gt; 2.46m/s</li></ul><h4>Marksman Rifles</h4><ul><li>Crouch Speed increased from 2.41m/s -&gt; 2.49m/s</li><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.37m/s -&gt; 1.55m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 3.76m/s -&gt; 3.99m/s</li><li>ADS Move Speed increased from 2.9m/s -&gt; 3m/s</li></ul><h4>Sniper Rifles</h4><ul><li>Crouch Speed decreased from 2.41m/s -&gt; 2.31m/s</li></ul><h4>Pistols</h4><ul><li>Crouch Speed decreased from 2.9m/s -&gt; 2.84m/s</li><li>ADS Crouch Speed increased from 1.88m/s -&gt; 2.24m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 4.47m/s -&gt; 4.52m/s</li><li>ADS Move Speed decreased from 3.94m/s -&gt; 3.81m/s</li></ul><h4>Launchers</h4><ul><li>Crouch Speed decreased from 2.44m/s -&gt; 2.18m/s</li></ul><h4>Melee</h4><ul><li>Crouch Speed increased from 2.9m/s -&gt; 2.95m/s</li><li>Jog Speed increased from 5.16m/s -&gt; 5.31m/s</li><li>Sprint Speed increased from 6.93m/s -&gt; 7.16m/s</li><li>Super Sprint Speed increased from 8.41m/s -&gt; 8.66m/s</li><li>Move Speed increased from 4.47m/s -&gt; 4.62</li></ul><h4><b><u>Weapon Adjustments</u></b></h4><h4>SMG Adjustments</h4><p>Weapon Adjustments</p><h3>Jackal PDW</h3><ul><li>Decreased Maximum Damage from 29 -&gt; 26  <ul><li>Decreased Maximum Damage range from 15.24m -&gt; 14.61m</li></ul></li><li>Decreased Near-Medium Damage from 23 -&gt; 22  <ul><li>Decreased Near-Medium Damage range from 22.86m -&gt; 17.78m</li></ul></li><li>Decreased Medium Damage from 22 -&gt; 18  <ul><li>Decreased Medium Damage range from 29.21m -&gt; 26.04m</li></ul></li><li>Decreased Minimum Damage from 19 -&gt; 15</li><li>Small increase to view kick strength and view kick deviation.</li><li><b>CHF Barrel</b><ul><li>Headshot multiplier improved from 1.2 -&gt; 1.4</li></ul></li></ul><p>The Jackal PDW ‚Äòs intended strength is best in class handling and decent mobility, balanced by a slower rate of fire compared to many of the other automatic weapons in the game. It was overperforming at medium ranges, so we‚Äôve increased the damage falloff and pulled the ranges closer along with a slight increase to recoil. Maximum damage and CHF Barrel headshot multiplier have been adjusted to maintain the same hit to kill numbers while using the attachment.</p><h3><b>C9</b></h3><ul><li>Increased medium damage range from 25.4m -&gt; 27.31m</li></ul><p>We feel that the C9 is in a good spot as a well-rounded Submachine Gun with a solid rate of fire. It has higher horizontal recoil compared to other Submachine Guns, so we‚Äôve given a boost to its medium damage falloff range.</p><h4>Marksman Rifles Adjustments</h4><p>Weapon Adjustment</p><h3>SWAT 5.56</h3><ul><li>Disabled burst fire queuing, which was queuing an additional burst if the fire input was activated at any time during the previous burst or the burst cooldown.</li></ul><p>This is a minor change to improve control with the Swat 5.56 (and any future burst weapons).</p><h4><u>ATTACHMENTS</u></h4><ul><li>The Rapid Fire attachment now correctly displays its recoil penalty con. The attachment description has also been updated to indicate the tradeoff.</li></ul><h3>MAPS</h3><h4>General</h4><ul><li>Adjusted general spawn logic to enable additional valid spawns under certain scenarios.</li><li>Adjusted spawn logic across several maps with the goal of reducing a high frequency of spawn flipping.</li></ul><p>Our longstanding definition of a ‚Äúbad spawn‚Äù is any time a player deals or receives damage within 3 seconds of spawning. This is the cornerstone of building the spawn system and does not change regardless of map size or game mode. We use this metric (among others) to track bad spawn rates for Black Ops 6, meaning that if you dealt or received damage within 3 seconds in Weekend 1 of the Beta, we saw it.</p><p>As an example, our Core Moshpit entry with the highest bad spawn rate in Week 1 was Domination on Skyline with a 4.2% rate, which means 4.2 out of every 100 spawns saw someone give or receive damage within that 3 second window. While we are generally happy with our averages, we know that an average also consists of worst cases, and we'll continue to assess throughout the lifetime of this game.</p><p>We also recognize that we each have our own definition of what a good spawn or a bad spawn is, and that‚Äôs not always just about combat situations. For example, did I spawn out too far on Hardpoint? Or why am I spawning on the same side of the map as the enemy team? The overarching spawn system and the placement of spawns in a map are critical to the flow of the match. It is our goal with Black Ops 6, as it has been with every prior Black Ops game, to have a predictable spawn system that results in head-on engagements with your opponents while providing ample time from respawn for decision making. This includes accounting for time before getting into an engagement before you‚Äôre ready for it.</p><p>For Weekend 2 of our Open Beta, we‚Äôve adjusted general spawn logic and have targeted multiple maps with additional tuning changes with the goal of improving predictability and time to engagement. We know we have some work to do and will continue to process our data, evaluate your feedback, and play the game with you all to draw our own conclusions on how to continue making positive progress.</p><h3>SCORESTREAKS</h3><ul><li><b>RC-XD</b><ul><li>Improved handling and general usability.</li></ul></li><li><b>Watchdog Helo</b><ul><li>Increased base health.</li></ul></li><li><b>Hellstorm</b><ul><li>Increased Cluster Bomb damage radius.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>EQUIPMENT</h3><ul><li>Lethal Equiptment  <ul><li>Thermo Grenade  <ul><li>Reduced explosive ignition delay.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>MOVEMENT</h3><ul><li>Slight increase to the time to enter prone or supine during a slide.</li><li>Slight increase to all mantle speeds.</li><li>Slight decrease to time before movement is allowed after landing from a Dive to Prone.</li><li>Slight increase to Dive to Prone landing friction.</li></ul><h3>PROGRESSION</h3><ul><li><b>Weapon XP </b><ul><li>Increased awarded Weapon XP, which will decrease the amount of time needed to gain Weapon Levels.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> will feature the option to remove all UI elements and add on a "90s filter".</p>
<p>Developer Bloober Team confirmed the news in a recent X/Twitter post, revealing that the 90s filter includes grain effect, colour correction, and screen adjustments for that "old-school experience"... even though <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> released in 2001.</p>

<p>The ability to remove UI elements will likely be welcome news for veteran Silent Hill fans, as that is entirely in keeping with the original game.</p>
<p>"Without UI, player guidance will naturally be directed by the game's visuals, sound effects, and James's behaviour," the team <a href="https://x.com/BlooberTeam/status/1831331610291012035">explained</a>.</p> <div>

<p>"He will glance towards important spots and have different animations and facial expressions during wounded states," Bloober added.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Tom Morgan shared his thoughts on the opening hours of the remake in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2s-remake-dares-to-modernise-a-classic-and-is-largely-succeeding">Silent Hill 2 Remake preview</a>.</p>
<p>"In rebuilding such a beloved classic with upgraded visuals and controls, the new combat style fits in surprisingly well," Tom wrote in his excellent summary.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> creative director and lead designer for Silent Hill 2 Remake, Mateusz Lenart, recently confirmed the psychological horror game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-will-take-more-than-20-hours-for-silent-hill-2-remake-completionists-to-find-everything-hidden-for-you">will take 16-18 hours to complete on average</a>, but teased that it will take "more than 20 hours" for players to find "everything that [the team] put into the game and things we've hidden for you".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Shinji Mikami thought Tango Gameworks would be safe from closure "as long as they continued to make <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> games".</p>
<p>Mikami, who spoke to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shinji-mikami-and-goichi-interview-tango-gameworks-shadows-of-the-damned">IGN</a> alongside Suda 51, was the founder of Tango Gameworks but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shinji-mikami-leaving-tango-gameworks-after-12-years">left in February 2023</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">studio was then closed by Microsoft</a> earlier this year, before being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton-following-microsofts-studio-closure-in-may">acquired by PUBG publisher Krafton</a> last month.</p>
<p>"I had thought the studio would be safe as long as they continued to make Hi-Fi Rush games," said Mikami. "That's one of the reasons I left Tango Gameworks. So I was surprised when the studio was closed down."</p>

<p>When Suda replied the closure was "a bolt from the blue, wasn't it?‚Äù, Mikami was ultimately positive about the future of Tango Gameworks.</p>
<p>"Now Krafton has taken over the business, so I feel like it worked out well in the end. I was reminded that if you make a good game, someone will pick it up. The hard work of the Hi-Fi Rush development team led to a new chapter for the company.</p>
<p>"I think that for a development studio, making a good game is more directly related to survival than making a popular game."</p>
<p>After his departure from Tango, Mikami stated his reasoning for leaving was to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-creator-shinji-mikami-left-tango-gameworks-to-break-free-from-survival-horror">break free of survival horror games</a>. He also wanted to create an environment for younger developers to have more frequent opportunities to gain experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-director-shinji-mikami-founds-new-company">Mikami has now founded a new company</a>, KAMUY, though it's unknown what projects are in the works.</p>
<p>Both developers have been interviewed ahead of the release of Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shinji-mikami-and-goichi-suda-on-shadows-of-the-damned-remastered-killer-7-and-a-sweet-home-remake">pair discussed the nature of remakes with Eurogamer</a>, with Mikami suggesting he'd be interested in a remake of Sweet Home - the game that inspired Resident Evil back in the '90s.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-space-for-dino-crisis-when-monster-hunter-exists-says-shinji-mikami">Mikami also discussed his thoughts on a new Dino Crisis game</a>, noting "the awesomeness of dinosaurs and the stuff you can do with dinosaurs, that's been kind of really nailed down by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> in recent years".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>While the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> has been the runaway winner of the generation, running laps around Xbox for the last few years, it‚Äôs been a pretty bumpy ride. Some of that has been out of Sony‚Äôs hands ‚Äì the chip shortages and the general economy, for example ‚Äì but you do have to wonder about some of the choices they‚Äôve made along the way, where even someone with the most basic grasp of the video game market could have told them they aren‚Äôt making the best decisions.</p>
<p>Outside of the PS5, Sony‚Äôs other hardware plans haven‚Äôt panned out, for various reasons. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PSVR 2</a> is a great headset, but with gamers feeling the financial squeeze, it‚Äôs just priced too high to be appealing. That wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if there were great reasons to save up for one, but outside a handful of exclusives ‚Äì literally, you can count them on one hand‚Äôs fingers ‚Äì there‚Äôs been no sign of first party support, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/15/psvr-2-pc-adapter-review-is-sonys-headset-now-the-go-to-for-pc-vr/">the PC adapter</a> released last month feels like they‚Äôre ready to give up on it.</p>



<p>Then there‚Äôs the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/13/playstation-portal-review/">PlayStation Portal</a>, a truly wonderful idea that should let you stream PlayStation games anywhere you want for ¬£200, and grab some of that juicy Switch market in the process. Except it‚Äôs not quite that simple, because even when playing within a good home network, we‚Äôve seen the remote play stumble and interrupt gameplay, so how is it going to handle hotel or cafe Wi-Fi? A lot of this could be improved if you could just stream from PlayStation Plus, hooking up to Sony‚Äôs optimised streaming servers, and being able to tap into the full PS Plus library.</p>
<p>Sure the Portal sold out as soon as it went on sale, but that‚Äôs pretty much inevitable with tech these days.&nbsp;There are plenty of units available now, but is anyone buying them?</p>

<p>But the bigger problems seem to be on the game development side, where Sony‚Äôs decision to chase after the live service big bucks has stumbled, staggered, lurched forward and picked up a big of momentum, and then fallen flat on its face.</p>

<p>Naughty Dog‚Äôs full The Last of Us multiplayer spin-off was in development for years, having split off from The Last of Us Part II, and grown and grown in scope and ambition‚Ä¶ but then someone pointed out they would <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/15/the-last-of-us-online-has-been-cancelled/">need a full team to support the game as a live service</a> and Naughty Dog did not have the staff to do that. So they cancelled it.</p>
<p>Just‚Ä¶ how? How did it get that far before someone did a headcount at Naughty Dog? Before someone pointed out just how many people have to work at Epic and Bungie to support their games? To make it worse, the game had been teased and mentioned for years since the launch of The Last of Us Part 2, it wasn‚Äôt a secret, so fans were really let down. And let‚Äôs be honest, those fans basically just wanted a revamped Factions mode from TLOU with prettier graphics, TLOU 2‚Äôs enhanced gameplay and maybe a bit better progression to keep them hooked.</p>

<p>But then came Helldivers 2, the sequel that no one asked for but that turned out to be exactly the game everyone wanted. A deservedly massive hit with Sony selling the PC version across the globe, including in regions where you could not make a Sony account‚Ä¶ and then they<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/06/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-pc-psn-requirement-may-6th-update-cancelled/"> told PC players</a> they would need a Sony account to continue playing, were forced to backtrack on that demand, but have still cut off unsupported regions. The game is still great, though, and shows exactly how finding a small niche and going big with it can be a major success.</p>
<p>Which brings us to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>, which is basically the opposite of that. It‚Äôs an excellent, colourful, multiplayer hero shooter that cost money to play. Going up against the biggest game in the world, an excellent, colourful, multiplayer hero shooter called Overwatch which is now free. Oh, and there‚Äôs also just Fortnite, Warframe, Valorant, that Marvel hero shooter that‚Äôs about to come along. They‚Äôre all free to play, and the only time you can really beat free is if you‚Äôre first.</p>

<p>Having a price tag worked for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> because it‚Äôs in a market where paying up front is still common, but Concord turned up to the party much too late, and you have to wonder why was it made and supported more and more and more strongly by Sony over the last few years? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/03/concord-is-shutting-down-this-week-refunds-being-issued-while-they-explore-options/">Taking it offline and reworking it</a>, presumably into an F2P model,</p>
<p>While all that has been going on, Destiny 2 has been coming to its natural end. The expansion, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">The Final Shape,</a> was the perfect conclusion to a story that has been running for ten years. A story that has had fans gripped with mysteries and lore which have taken a decade to pay off, The Final Shape ends with massive battle ripped from Avengers Endgame and a beautiful cut scene that will have had a lot of year one players crying.</p>
<p>Then they announced the game would continue and many people really did not care. Why would they, after investing ten years in that story, building and building to epic and most importantly, satisfying conclusion, players are finding it hard to be engaged with what appears to be a story tacked on to the end of the game just so they have something to sell. And at the same time, Bungie are barrelling down the path of trying to make a big budget PvPvE extraction shooter reboot of the early 90s FPS <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/bungie-announce-some-kind-of-marathon-remake/">Marathon</a> ‚Äì a game that by it‚Äôs very nature will speak to a very different audience than Destiny‚Äôs PvE fans.</p>

<p>Sony‚Äôs live service ambitions are feeling on shaky ground, but what‚Äôs even more confusing is that they‚Äôre not making use of what they already have. Why not bring back Killzone, for example? Now I‚Äôm not pretending that it‚Äôs no work at all, but they could bring back Killzone‚Äôs multiplayer, revive classic maps and modes, release it as F2P on PC and PS5 and make money off Battle Passes and cosmetic DLC. We‚Äôre seeing the arena shooter still has some clout,</p>
<p>Oh, and one other word: SOCOM.</p>
<p>At the very least, this week has given us a reminder of just what made PlayStation so good in the first place. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot is a pure delight</a>, it‚Äôs playful and fun, and it‚Äôs a single player game ‚Äì something that Sony built the whole PS4 generation on. Now, we‚Äôre not going to tell Sony to never do live service or multiplayer, and there are success stories, but it‚Äôs pretty clear that they‚Äôve made some poor decisions along the way, gone too big and tried to go too quickly, when smaller and steadier would have been safer and worked better in the long term.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alan-wake-pc-update-to-remove-iconic-licensed-song.974082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-pc-update-licensed-song<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has announced that a new&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>update is scheduled to arrive next week, and it's set to remove one of the game's most iconic licensed songs, replacing it with an original composition.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/alanwake/status/1831739167392272866" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Remedy reveals that David Bowie's famous song "Space Oddity" will be removed from the PC versions of the original&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>on September 10th. That'll hold across the Steam, Epic, and GOG versions of the game.</p>
<p>"Space Oddity" will be replaced by "a new original song by Petri Alanko" by the name of "Strange Moons". As a reminder, Petri Alanko is a composer who's worked with Remedy on a number of projects, including&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/control"><em>Control</em></a>, and, of course, last year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/alan-wake-2">horror sequel</a>&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alan-wake-david-bowie-removal.jpg?itok=BQcFJjGw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alan-wake-david-bowie-removal.jpg?itok=2GRm6qcd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>David Bowie's iconic "Space Oddity" is being removed from&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>next week.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that this removal only applies to the original PC version of&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake</em>; it doesn't affect 2021's&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake Remastered</em>, which presumably still holds the rights to use the song for a while yet.</p>
<p>Of course, if you're playing the original&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>on Xbox 360, then you'll still be able to hear "Space Oddity" there, too. After all, it's not like Remedy or Warner can physically remove the rights to the song from your Xbox 360 disc, right?</p>
<p>Video games regularly run into problems due to the expiry of music licensing agreements, including&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>itself.</p>
<p>Back in 2017, it was announced that the digital and physical versions of the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-to-be-pulled-from-stores-due-to-music-licensing-issues">would be pulled from stores</a> around the world due to music rights issues. The game subsequently <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1055512227623530496" rel="noopener" target="_blank">returned to stores in 2018</a>.</p>

<p>It has been a year to the day since Starfield was released on Xbox and PC, taking the world by storm but landing a relatively mixed reception after a few days in the open. It was in development for a staggering amount of time, and when it finally hit the market, it wavered in its ability to live up to the hype.</p>



<p>The game is now one year old, and the first major expansion for the title ‚Äì Shattered Space ‚Äì will be released at the end of the month. With that in mind, it‚Äôs a critical time to take a look at the game‚Äôs performance and determine if anyone is still playing Starfield.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-lost-in-the-stars">Lost In The Stars</h2>



<p>At first blush, Starfield looks impressive. It offers a vast universe bursting at the seams with opportunities to explore, along with an immersive, lengthy story, plenty of side quests, factions, and intuitive, innovative ship-crafting mechanics. One of the key selling points of Starfield was that the story unravels in a way that <strong>technically </strong>gives it infinite replay value.</p>



<p>But once you start digging, you find a plethora of copied and pasted content, baseless side missions, forgettable factions and bosses, and a gameplay ‚Äòreset loop‚Äô that quickly becomes stale and repetitive.</p>



<p>In the months that followed Starfield‚Äôs release, Bethesda Game Studios became slow to release any new content for the game. Even minor updates were spread out across a gap-laden cadence, and it has taken an entire year for the team to ship Shattered Space, an expansion that was marketed before Starfield was released.</p>



<p>With that being said, is there much of a market ready to receive Shattered Space, or has everyone long since moved on?</p>



<h2 id="h-mixed-numbers">Mixed Numbers</h2>



<p>Using Steam as a representative example of Starfield‚Äôs player count, it looks as though the game isn‚Äôt faring too badly. It had 7,311 players in the game at the time of writing, which isn‚Äôt awful for a single-player game a year after it was released.</p>



<p>But Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3, which was released a month before Starfield, has 68,586.</p>



<p>Elden Ring, which was boosted by the June release of Shadow of the Erdtree, has 57,600.</p>



<p>Fallout 4, which was released in 2014 by Bethesda Game Studios, has 16,180 players exploring a post-apocalyptic wasteland ‚Äì <strong>ten years</strong> after launch. </p>



<p>It‚Äôs important to stress that <strong>many </strong>players will still be locked in on Xbox Series X|S, but it‚Äôs near impossible to get those numbers.</p>



<p>One of the biggest boons in the Bethesda world is the extent of modding opportunities that bleed into the tech titan‚Äôs games. On Nexus Mods, Fallout 4 has 61,700 mods, and Skyrim has almost 100,000. Even 2010‚Äôs Fallout: New Vegas has 35,000 mods.</p>



<p>Starfield has just 496 mods available a year down the line, despite BGS pushing out official mod support several months ago. Even Fallout 76, which doesn‚Äôt <strong>officially </strong>support mods, has more than 2,000 files on Nexus Mods. I get that it‚Äôs tough to code mods for Starfield, but that‚Äôs another issue.</p>



<p>If we look at the sentiment around streaming, we can see that, at the time of publishing, Starfield had just <strong>62 live viewers </strong>on Twitch. That‚Äôs down from an all-time high of 522,021. By comparison, Fallout 4 had around 2,000 live viewers. If we look at some space-faring competitors to Starfield, we can see that they‚Äôre all doing better than Bethesda‚Äôs title:</p>



<ul>
<li>Elite: Dangerous ‚Äì 184</li>



<li>No Man‚Äôs Sky ‚Äì 517</li>



<li>Star Citizen ‚Äì 4,705</li>
</ul>



<p>According to Google, the search volume for Starfield bottomed out at the start of 2024 and has never picked back up again.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-dlc-outlook">The DLC Outlook</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Shattered Space <strong>could </strong>do something to revive Starfield, but I doubt it‚Äôll be anything major. In recent trailers, Bethesda Game Studios made it more of a priority to showcase the arrival of an in-game vehicle than it did the impending release of Shattered Space. Players were excited for a faster way to get across the game‚Äôs many planets ‚Äì but Shattered Space isn‚Äôt turning heads.</p>



<p>Historically, Bethesda Game Studios‚Äô DLC game has been sublime, especially in Skyrim and Fallout 3, way back in the day. Fallout 4 had some solid expansions, and Fallout 76 has been getting better for almost six years. But I‚Äôm just not feeling the same level of excitement from the community for Starfield‚Äôs Shattered Space expansion.</p>



<p>Those other games had expansions released <strong>faster </strong>than this, so perhaps that‚Äôs a problem. </p>



<p>Let‚Äôs not forget that Todd Howard <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-wants-annual-starfield-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wants <strong>annual </strong>Starfield expansions</a>, but that‚Äôs only going to work if there‚Äôs a player base there to receive them. Also, Phil Spencer said he wants Starfield to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-starfield-popular-skyrim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as popular as Skyrim is</a> 12 years after launch. Will that be a reality a decade from now if it‚Äôs not even true <strong>today</strong>?</p>



<p>I‚Äôm willing to give Shattered Space a run, even if I completed Starfield <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-one-month-later/">and then never looked back</a>. I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôll do much to bring many players back into the fold, but it should be entertaining for a few hours at least, and given that I bought the Constellation Edition, I want to get the most from my money.</p>

<p>At Gamescom, I sat down with the team at MADFINGER to learn about the next evolution for Gray Zone Warfare. The team has been preparing a super-sized content update that has just been revealed in full, at the heart of which sits the ‚Äòday/night‚Äô mechanics. This long-awaited feature plunges Lamang into darkness, altering the game state in many ways.</p>



<p>That‚Äôs only scratching the surface of this update, though. MADFINGER‚Äôs Rick Lagnese advised me that a wipe is ‚Äò100% necessary‚Äô because of all the new features and mechanics being implemented, which means that once you‚Äôve installed the update, you‚Äôll find your account reset.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-am-the-night">I Am The Night</h2>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare emerged earlier this year to considerable success, hitting more than 800,000 sales in just a few days. It won players over with gorgeous visuals and an open-world approach to the extraction shooter formula, despite the team being adamant that it‚Äôs not <strong>strictly </strong>an extraction shooter.</p>



<p>There‚Äôs plenty in the GZW pipeline, I‚Äôve come to learn. As I sat down with the guys at Gamescom, I was presented with exclusive live footage of the new update, checking out how darkness impacted the world of Lamang. To survive at night, you‚Äôll need to have your wits about you and plenty of equipment: night-vision goggles, flashlights, tracer rounds, and other tactical devices like lasers.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs <strong>very </strong>realistic. In designing the night cycle, the team has gone so far as to replicate the Southeast Asian sky, matching up constellations you‚Äôd see in the real world in the game. They‚Äôve also tweaked how the AI behaves at night, with soldiers sleeping, taking reduced patrols, and using their own aids like flashlights when needed.</p>



<p>Oh, and the squad is adding a series of night-only quests that‚Äôll force you into that less comfortable environment.</p>



<h2 id="h-getting-better">Getting Better</h2>



<p>MADFINGER has boosted the world of Lamang in this update, deploying more points of interest that add a little backstory to the region, and the in-game economy has been ‚Äòrebalanced‚Äô.</p>



<p>This means rewards, prices, loot, AI equipment, vendor stocks, and progression have all been addressed. This overhaul is why ‚Äòa wipe will be 100% necessary‚Äô, Rick Lagnese said. With this update comes high-value loot, boosted loot density, and various other elements like stash cases, faction chat in the wider world, streamer mode, and even an emote system.</p>



<p>Movement mechanics have been tweaked or added, such as prone leaning and diagonal sprinting, and the team has worked tirelessly to address some of the biggest issues in Gray Zone Warfare:</p>



<ul>
<li>AI being overpowered</li>



<li>‚ÄòDeafening‚Äô helicopters</li>



<li>Long helicopter wait times</li>



<li>Rubber-banding</li>
</ul>



<p>Ultimately, all this is just a taste of what‚Äôs coming in the next Gray Zone Warfare update. If you‚Äôve not yet picked the game up, consider investing in it on PC ‚Äì you won‚Äôt regret it.</p>

Not only are they doing the right thing by their workers, they‚Äôre also helping to preserve the human art, ingenuity and creativity that fuels interactive storytelling. These agreements signal that the video game companies in the collective bargaining group do not represent the will of the larger video game industry.

As is evident in the quotes above and our reporting on the strike, chief among the members' concerns (and a large reason for the strike itself) are guaranteed protections against the use of unethical genAI practices.
