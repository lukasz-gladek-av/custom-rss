			<p>Embark Studios has finally shared the debut gameplay trailer for ARC Raiders. The game was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2021 as a free-to-play cooperative shooter. However, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-the-latest-game-to-be-delayed-to-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> several delays that led Embark to <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-discovery-team-fps-embark-studios-first-game-before-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focus</a> on The Finals (formerly known as Project Discovery), their competitive shooter, first.</p>
<p>In May 2023, the developer finally re-<a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> ARC Raiders as a third-person PvPvE extraction shooter, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-pc-playtesting-begins-this-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playtesting</a> took place last month. Today, Executive Producer Aleksander Grøndal said about the playtest:</p>
<p><em>This was a really encouraging playtest for us. We now have lots of data and feedback to sift through. We know that players appreciate the atmosphere of the world we've created and the immersion we bring to the table. We also know there's a lot we can do to continue to optimize and balance the experience. We're keen to deliver on a much expanded late-game experience, with deeper progression and extensive quests that take players across new locations, as well as a larger variety of ARC machines and other world-encounters.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="ARC Raiders | Gameplay Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OpCooWm-PDs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In ARC Raiders, players scavenge the surface of the world for vital supplies and materials through quests and raids assigned by the merchants of Speranza. While scavenging the surface, they will encounter enemy ARC machines and other raiders competing for resources.</p>
<p>Engaging in firefights may be the only way out of a tight spot, but it's also risky. Sometimes, being cautious and staying out of sight is a better option to stay alive. To keep the hard-earned loot, players must reach extraction points and risk being ambushed. Success means getting their hands on vital materials for crafting and upgrading, or items to sell to the merchants for currency.</p>
<p>According to the developers, ARC Raiders mixes high-intensity, time-sensitive extraction challenges on the surface with strategic survival elements underground, where progress is closely tied to the player's workshop. Building and upgrading various crafting stations allows users to craft new equipment, such as advanced weapon mods or unique gadgets.</p>
<p>The merchants in Speranza will give quests in exchange for extra currency and experience, as well as the occasional item. The vendors offer different items and equipment, depending on their specialty. Players may also spend experience in a skill tree to customize their playstyle.</p>
<p>ARC Raiders will be released next year on PC (Steam and Epic Games Store, with support for NVIDIA's GeForce NOW cloud), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p>Payload Studios is laying off even more staff, just months after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payload-studios-lays-off-25-percent-of-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letting go of 25%</a> of the company. The developer of TerraTech has confirmed to GamesIndustry.biz (GIBiz) that it is letting go a number of employees after being put in a “very difficult position”.</p>



<p>“It’s true that last week we announced another redundancy round,” CEO and co-founder Russell Clarke told GIBiz. “This has come out of the blue after a project that we were relying on did not materialise, and placed us in a very difficult position. </p>



<p>“The details, including the handling of the notice period and redundancy payments as well as the number of people who will ultimately lose their jobs, are still to be determined – but we had to notify staff last week, to give as much warning as possible to all those who might be affected.”</p>



<p>While Clarke didn’t confirm the number of people let go, GIBiz claims that eight people were let go this time around. Clarke said that his hope was to “give answers” to the staff sometime this week. It’s also being reported that those let go weren’t receiving any sort of redundancy pay.</p>



<p>Sources also told GIBiz that one of Payload’s co-founders was part of the layoffs, though the company wouldn’t confirm which one.</p>



<p>“We are still figuring out the details, but the team that goes forward will need to be very lean,” Clarke said about the future of Payload Studios.</p>



<p>In 2024, there have been <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roughly 13,500 jobs lost</a> in the games industry across more than 160 companies. The real total is likely higher, however, as some companies didn’t make public how many people had been laid off. </p>

            <p>
As the season of wild consumer abandon and deep Black Friday discounts descends upon us, Sony has announced it's temporarily slashing the price of the PS5 Slim Digital Edition by $70 in the US, although it's made no indication the offer might be reflected elsewhere in the world.
</p>
<p>
The discount, revealed at the end of Sony's new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J40QG4CVaww">Play Has No Limits commercial</a>, brings the price of the PlayStation 5 Slim Digital Edition down from its usual $449.99 to $379.99 - meaning the console is officially cheaper than its chunkier predecessor for the first time, given the $50 price increase Sony slapped on the Slim Digital Edition when it launched last year.
</p>
<p>
Sony says the offer - which doesn't yet appear <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-console-model-group-slim">on the PlayStation website</a> - will run until 24th December (or "while stocks last"), so consider that your starting point if you were planning on picking one up in the US during this year's Black Friday sales. As to whether Sony is planning a similar price reduction in Europe, it hasn't yet said, but it <em>did</em> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-drops-price-of-the-playstation-5-slim-for-a-limited-time">recently announce a temporary price cut</a> for the standard PS5 Slim across multiple territories.

Sony's PS5 Slim Digital Edition discount for the US follows last week's confirmation the company has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">seen a drop in console sales</a>, down to 6.2m from the 8.2m sold in the same quarter last year. On the plus side, software sales are up - the marvellous Astro Bot even managed to shift 1.5m copies in its first month - and Sony will also be hoping the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-playstation-5-pro-weve-removed-it-from-its-box-and-theres-new-information-to-share">recently launched PlayStation 5 Pro</a> helps give its numbers a boost.
</p><p>
And speaking of Sony's £700 console, Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-sony-playstation-5-pro-review-across-the-board-improvements-but-is-it-really-worth-the-money">shared its PlayStation 5 Pro verdict</a> last week. "The truth is, the standard PS5 is still the best choice for most people," Richard Leadbetter wrote, "but for the core enthusiast looking for the best possible experience, the Pro option is there for you, albeit with a substantial premium."

			<p>The twenty-year-old MMORPG EVE Online has just received its newest expansion, The Revenant, which introduces powerful ships, weapons, and dens for capsuleers as well as The Deathless for the alliance.</p>
<h2>Revenant expansion adds new content to the iconic space MMO EVE Online, letting capsuleers use new mercenary dens and fearsome deathless ships</h2>
<p>The 21-year-old sci-fi space MMO: EVE Online, developed by CCP Games, has today received the Revenant expansion, bringing new content and enhanced gameplay. The Revenant expansion introduces new powerful ships, mercenary dens, and weapons to battle against enemies but The Deathless adds a new layer of mystery to the game.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Image Credit: eveonline.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Deathless is seemingly an untrustworthy character who is difficult to trust but can be both a valuable ally and a threat that players must cooperate with as they face the Drifters. The Drifters are a powerful faction that needs to be tackled with the help of Deathless, who will provide powerful ships, weapons, and ammunition in return for encrypted infomorphs.</p>
<p>Bergur Finnbogason, Creative Director for&nbsp;<em>EVE Online says,</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The Deathless…can he be trusted? What are his intentions? An untrustworthy ally is an ally nonetheless, but the clock is ticking. The Drifters will be back,</p></blockquote>
<p>These encrypted infomorphs can be produced using new mercenary dens that are deployed in orbit around temperate planets. The players can form coalitions to protect these dens or raid the enemy structures to disrupt operations in the Nullsec, which is ready to witness massive battles.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Image Credit: eveonline.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>EVE Online Players will be provided with powerful Deathless ships in the Revenant expansion that can be used to gain strategic advantage in New Eden's power struggles. These are the <em>Tholos Destroyer&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cenotaph Battlecruiser&nbsp;</em>which specialize in close-range combat. These ships bring the cloaking ability to perform SCARAB breaching pods and striker clone weaponry that can tear through shields, armors, and hulls from the inside, giving the corporations and alliances a high-stakes opportunity to reshape territorial control.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Image Credit: eveonline.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>To further increase the impact of corporations, the Revenant expansion brings enhanced corporation projects to set broader goals for members. Plus, a new Ship Insurance project type enables them to offer insurance-backed compensation.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Image Credit: eveonline.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>CCP Games is also providing SKINs via 40 new patterns and new nanocoatings for players to experiment with their ships, allowing customizations and letting players make beautiful patterns and unique designs. With customizations, EVE Online players can design exclusive SKINs for their corporations and alliances to represent their identity in both cooperative and competitive contexts.</p>

Typically, that PS5 model costs $449.99, but it will start at $379.99 through December 24th, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J40QG4CVaww">according to a new ad</a>. </p><p>This holiday deal brings the slim PS5 digital edition just under the original $399.99 price of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21436287/sony-ps5-digital-edition-price-release-date">launch version of the PS5 digital console</a>. The footnote at the end of the ad specifies that this price is only for the disc-free console, so it seems like the model with a disc drive already attached will still start at $499.99. But the holiday pricing also means that by buying a digital PS5 slim and one of Sony’s separate $79.99 PS5 disc drives, you can make your own PS5 with a disc drive and save about $40.</p><p>Another way to save money would be to opt for one of Sony’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24241914/sony-refurbished-playstation-5-ps5-dualsense">refurbished PS5s</a>: a digital refurb costs $349.99 while a model with a disc drive costs $399.99. But those refurbished consoles also come in the original design for the PS5 that’s larger (and arguably) uglier than the slimmer model.</p><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, Sony offers the $699.99 PS5 Pro. But that doesn’t come with a disc drive, and whether it’s worth the higher cost might depend on how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">far away you sit from the screen</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To convince people to buy a PlayStation 5, Sony’s new ad announces that the PS5 Slim Digital Edition will be marked down to $380. </p><p>Normally, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-console-model-group-slim&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-console-model-group-slim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation 5 Slim Digital Edition costs $450</a></span>. So this is a discount of $70. (I’m not factoring in things like shipping, tax, etc.) This new temporary discount, which ends on December 24, means that you can now buy a PS5 Slim and a digital game while paying about the same (or less) than you would normally for a game and a new PS5. That’s nice. </p><p>However, keep in mind that this deal is only on the PS5 Slim Digital Edition. So if you want a PS5 with a disc drive, you’ll have to either buy that console or buy a disc drive separately. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-disc-drive-cost-selling-out-where-to-buy-amazon-1851646276&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-disc-drive-cost-selling-out-where-to-buy-amazon-1851646276">And uh, good luck with that</a></span>. It should also be noted that the Slim doesn’t come with a vertical stand. You’ll need to buy that separately.</p><p>Finally, let’s not forget that when the digital-only PS5 initially launched, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-out-in-u-s-on-nov-12-costs-500-for-main-model-1845081999&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-out-in-u-s-on-nov-12-costs-500-for-main-model-1845081999">it was just $400.</a></span> Then, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-slim-all-digital-disc-drive-price-1850914803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-slim-all-digital-disc-drive-price-1850914803">Sony raised its price after the launch</a></span>. So when you factor that in, this means the PS5 Slim that Sony is selling during the holidays is only $20 less than it was four years ago. Bleh. </p><p>Also, this deal doesn’t apply to the recently released <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-disc-drive-sony-why-1851657354?_gl=1*rhztje*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTQyMDM2Mi4xMDMuMS4xNzMxNDMwODY4LjQ2LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-disc-drive-sony-why-1851657354?_gl=1*rhztje*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTQyMDM2Mi4xMDMuMS4xNzMxNDMwODY4LjQ2LjAuMA..">PS5 Pro, which still costs an eye-watering $700</a></span>. It might be Christmastime, but Sony ain’t discounting its newest and most expensive console anytime soon. Do you want ray tracing this holiday season? You gotta pay up. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4547039255696769967">blog</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Valve admitted the original process was "fairly obscure," but now lets developers "offer players this choice from within the game itself."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These changes, it continued, "give players more clear choices in how they want to engage with the game. Some want to be part of your beta branch where you are testing out the latest updates, while others may want to play on an older stable build that they know works well with their save file."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Previously, players would have to access those beta branches on their own in the 'Settings' tab; now, developers can add a button and text to a game's menu that shows what a build a player has and invite them to join the beta branch. Inside that branch, players will "see new UI immediately next to the play button in Steam that shows the current beta they have set, and easily lets them opt back out if they so choose."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once selected, Steam will reboot and relaunch the game into beta mode and its player-selected build. That build will be further reflected in the game's Steam library page.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for game saves, Valve said the new APIs make it so players are asked if they would like to still use the older version of a title rather than defaulting to the newer one. It noted that "trouble can arise when players with dozens or hundreds of hours of playtime find that their save file no longer works with the latest version of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By "adding some logic" to their game, devs can check what version a player's existing save is linked to, something Valve said is primarily an issue for Early Access games. Alternatively, they could specify version numbers in save files or map a version of their game to a branch ID that "creates a table somewhere in your game that is aware of which versions correspond with each Steam Beta Branch."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The onus will fall on devs to plug these four APIs into their games themselves, and more information on them can be read </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamApps">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-vatican-city</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/somehow-baldurs-gate-3-has-sold-two-copies-in-vatican-city.1033812/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-vatican-city<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Given how popular&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>is, it's no stretch to imagine that the game has been played all around the world, but Larian has revealed that two people in a very unusual place indeed have enjoyed the game.</p>

<p>According to publishing director <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1855995474492207263" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Michael Douse on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, two copies of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>have been sold in Vatican City, and one person there has it on their Steam wishlist as well.</p>

<p>Douse rather amusingly says he likes to imagine the wishlisting person is "the Pope waiting until he has a free minute", expressing a wish to "see their mod list" and suggesting said list is "absolutely gnarly". That seems like an understatement.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-vatican-city-karniss.jpg?itok=q9QxJQxL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-vatican-city-karniss.jpg?itok=TAhuSMY4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>has somehow sold two copies in the Vatican, of all places.</figcaption></figure><p>Technically speaking, the Vatican is a city-state in its own right, although it does qualify as the smallest state in the world. At <a href="https://www.vaticanstate.va/it/stato-governo/note-generali/popolazione.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">last count</a>, 764 people inhabited Vatican City, with 618 of those people being citizens.</p>

<p>It should go without saying that Vatican City is an intensely religious place, so it's quite amusing to imagine someone living in such a place playing&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, a game that might have been considered heretical by the Catholic Church just a few decades ago.</p>

<p>Perhaps even more amusingly, <a href="https://x.com/samito/status/1856006701259816994" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">one person</a> in the replies to Douse's original post suggests that the two Vatican City sales of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>were a "clerical error". Badum, and indeed, tish.</p>

<p>In any case, I hope the two Vatican City players of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>are enjoying it, whoever they happen to be, and I hope whoever has it on their wishlist decides to take the plunge and buy it. You won't regret it!</p>

Larian has already confirmed that this update <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-preview-larian" rel="nofollow">won't be the game's last</a>.</p>

They include Switch bundles, $20 to $30 off games ranging from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> to <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, and discounted controllers. Here’s the full list so far:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Hardware</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li> Switch <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> Bundle - $300 (normally $380)</li><li>Switch OLED <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> Bundle - $350 (normally $430)</li><li>Switch Lite Hyrule Edition w/ Online + Expansion Pack - $210 (normally $250) </li></ul><p><strong>Games</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>The Legend of Zeld: Tears of the Kingdom</em> - $50 (normally $70)</li><li><em>Super Mario Maker 2</em> - $40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons - </em>$40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Pikmin 4</em> - $40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Nintendo Switch Sports - </em>$40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em> - $40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>﻿Super Mario Odyssey </em>- $30 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Pikmin 1 + 2 </em>- $30 (normally $60)</li></ul><p><strong>Accessories</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li> Neon Red and Neon Blue Joy-Con controllers - $60 (normally $80)</li><li>Switch Pro Controller - $50 (normally $70)</li><li><em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> Switch Carrying Case - $15 (normally $25)</li></ul></blockquote><p>As has become something of a seasonal tradition, the <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> bundle is back in pole position, with both base Switch and OLED variants that essentially include the hit party racing game for free as well as a year of Switch Online. The Expansion Pack portion is missing though, which is a shame since that’s what includes access to all of the <em>Mario Kart 8 DLC </em>for free (otherwise it’s $30 extra).</p><p>In fact, Nintendo is pushing Switch Online memberships big-time as part of its Black Friday deals this year. The Hyrule Edition Switch Lite, which looks fantastic, will be bundled with a year of Switch Online + Expansion Pack for $40 off. The subscription includes access to dozens of games from the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis libraries. </p><p>When it comes to games, there’s no noteworthy deals on anything that got released this year or even in late 2023 like <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> or<em> Super Mario RPG</em>. Then again, $20 off <em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> isn’t bad by Nintendo’s normally stingy standards. While it never got DLC, the game’s world is so massive, it still essentially feels like a forever game. I have over 100 hours in it and still haven’t seen everything. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ubisoft’s Project U returned to the drawing board this year following five years of development.</p>



<p>Project U was officially announced in September 2022 as a revolutionary “new kind of session-based cooperative shooter,” but after over two years since its announcement, nothing publically about the game has yet been announced. That’s because <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-project-u-gameplay-details-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project U</a>, internally codenamed Pathfinder, quietly returned to the drawing board in Spring 2024 following issues surrounding the game’s replayability.</p>



<p>For those unfamiliar with Project U, its premise is that Earth has been invaded by machines that want to mechanize all life. The game would see ten teams of four battle it out in PvE combat against progressively more difficult enemies as they progressed through the map’s zones, which could have thousands of enemy AI robots on the map at any given time. Eventually, players would enter the final zone in the middle of the map, where they’d need to defeat the boss.</p>



<p>Despite initially receiving generally positive feedback from players, one fundamental flaw plagued the game from the start: its replayability. Sources say it was a constant issue for the developers and would see the project’s budget balloon due to continuous reworks. Such reworks included adding more variations to the map with biomes and adding new bosses to change its repetitive nature; however, playtests in February 2024 revealed that the game lacked the replayability needed.</p>



<div><p>In March 2024, Ubisoft Annecy announced that Project U (codenamed Pathfinder) development would cease immediately and that outsourcing studios would move on to different projects. Two of the game Directors, Mathieu Granjon and Damien Kieken left the project among many other developers, with Granjon moving to Assassin’s Creed and Kieken eventually making his way to DICE this month.</p><p>Instead of being canceled, Ubisoft internally noted that PvE games can still be successful, citing the viral launch of Helldivers 2, which sold an estimated million units in its first five weeks. As such, it’s said that Ubisoft still believes in the project and moved Project U back into incubation with a new producer and a small team to explore new ideas. However, after over five years of development, current and past project developers tell me it’s difficult to see how the game would succeed.</p></div>



<p>Will Project U end up being another decade-long project at Ubisoft? Only time will tell.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-first-preview-compulsion-games-bets-big-on-art-music-and-deep-south-folklore<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Hypnotized by that southern charm.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you adored 2013 indie darling Contrast or were disappointed by 2016’s We Happy Few, it’s hard to argue that developer Compulsion Games doesn’t swing for the fences and try new things. After spending a day with the team taking a closer look at South of Midnight, it’s clear that innovation streak hasn’t slowed down one bit, and I went from mild curiosity to full-blown hype for this unique action-adventure game. Though I didn’t see anything that blew my socks off in terms of gameplay, it stood out in just about every other way, especially with its striking setting, curious stop motion animation, and stellar original soundtrack. That all left me eager to see more and play it for myself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">South of Midnight is set in a part of the world we don’t see too often in games: the American deep south. It isn’t just a backdrop for you to fight monsters, but rather the entire premise on which the adventure sits, with characters, folklore, and mythical creatures all drawn from real-world places and stories. During a hands-off demo, I saw flooded wetlands after a recent storm, mosquito-riddled swamps, and ostentatious Antebellum manors, each infused with elements of fantasy I’d not seen anywhere else.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">South of Midnight Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These exotic places fit nicely with an equally unusual art style that emulates stop motion animation – yet another rarity in games, and one that would be sure to fog up Guillermo del Toro’s glasses. The whole thing looks like it was ripped from the pages of a children’s story book, which I really dug. It definitely took some getting used to at first, as the jerky movement might easily be mistaken for framerate wonkiness to the untrained eye, but it also adds to the otherworldly fantasy charm that South of Midnight oozes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It can sometimes be pretty difficult to understand how exactly a game will feel to play during a hands-off demo, but in the case of South of Midnight touching a controller wasn’t necessary to recognize its best quality: its music. Each level has you facing off against a cryptid from deep south folklore as southern-inspired blues and jazz intensifies and the lyrics help tell the story of whatever beast you’re tracking down. In the case of this demo, it was an enormous alligator called Two-Toed Tom (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-Toed_Tom" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>based on an actual legendary creature</u></a>). At first the music started slow with a slick bassline and a choir whispering “Two-Toed Tom,” but by the time we unraveled the mystery of the mythical gator and progressed to the final confrontation, the chorus reached a fevered pitch, the words of which told the tale of poor, old Tom.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The setting, art, and music set South of Midnight apart in a major way and made me extremely excited to get my hands on it."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these components – the setting, art, and music – set South of Midnight apart in a major way and made me extremely excited to get my hands on it. The flipside of that is that what I saw of gameplay offered far less originality. Combat looked like a pretty by-the-numbers system of dodging, striking, and finishing moves that are quite well-trodden, and exploration relied on double jumping, midair dashing, and grappling to distant locations that are pretty standard stuff. The boss fight against Two-Toed Tom, for example, was a very repetitive process of leaping over telegraphed attacks and whaling on the gator when he presented obvious opportunity to do so.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Compulsion Games says that while they expect gameplay to be engaging, it isn’t nearly as much of a focus as the story, music, and other elements they’ve clearly put the lion’s share of work into. Instead, they’re keeping levels relatively short for a ten-ish hour story and putting all of their chips into South of Midnight’s exceptional presentation and worldbuilding, and so far I’m convinced they just might pull it off. After all, even without playing it myself, it’s made a great impression on me. Here’s hoping it delivers when we finally get to play it next year.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In September 2023, the North Carolina studio behind Fortnite and Unreal Engine <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-maker-epic-games-laying-off-870-employees"><u>suffered a significant round of layoffs</u></a> that saw 830 employees, about 16% of its workforce, lose their jobs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Separately, Epic divested music service platform Bandcamp and spun off most of SuperAwesome, a kid-safe technology company. These were acquired by Epic Games in 2022 and 2020, respectively. Around 250 people left Epic through the divestitures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Sweeney said the company had been spending “way more money than we earn, investing in the next evolution of Epic and growing Fortnite as a metaverse-inspired ecosystem for creators.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also pointed to a “major structural change to our economics” after Fortnite growth transitioned from the explosively popular and highly profitable battle royale that funded its initial expansion, to the lower margin business that came from creator content with significant revenue sharing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking during a presentation at Unreal Fest 2024, Sweeney said that Epic “spent the last year rebuilding and really executing solidly on all fronts.” He added: "I'm happy to tell you now that the company is financially sound, and that Fortnite and the Epic Games Store have hit new records in concurrency and success."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On that front, Fortnite hit 110 million monthly active users over the 2023 holiday season, an impressive milestone for a game now seven years old. To put that into context, in August 2018 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/20/fortnite-had-biggest-month-ever-in-august-with-783-million-players"><u>Fortnite hit 78.3 million MAUs</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic rarely makes Fortnite player numbers public, and when it does so it uses various metrics that make direct comparisons difficult. Last year's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/fortnite/Fortnite_Chapter_4_Season_OG_Map"><u>Season OG</u></a>, which brought back the Chapter 1 Season 5 map and with it classic areas like Tilted Towers, Pleasant Park, and Risky Reels, saw Fortnite hit a new peak of 44.7 million players in just one day. Epic previously said Fortnite saw a <em>concurrent</em> player record of 15.3 million players for the December 2020 end-of-season live event, which saw players teaming up with Iron Man, Wolverine, and other Marvel heroes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-galactus-event-start-time-what-to-expect-battle-bus-glitch"><u>to defeat Galactus</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr">At the height of its popularity, Tomb Raider was everywhere, from video games to big-budget movies. Tomb Raider comic books were also produced, and if you've been looking to get your hands on the first run of issues printed by Top Cow, then prepare yourself for some good news. Dark Horse has announced Tomb Raider: Colossal Collection Volume 1, a gigantic reprint of Lara Croft's first adventures that began in 1999. Priced at $99, this massive 888-page hardcover is now available to preorder and will be released on June 25, 2025.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4397764-tomb-raider-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4397764" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4397764-tomb-raider-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4397764"></a><figcaption>Tomb Raider: Colossal Collection Volume One</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4397764-tomb-raider-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Top Cow's Tomb Raider comics have long been out of print, and the older "Archive" editions fetch an astronomical sum on the reseller market, often going for hundreds of dollars each. This hardcover looks to be a <em>nearly </em>comprehensive collection, as it contains issues #1-24 and #26-34 from the first run.</p><p dir="ltr">In case you're wondering, issue #25 saw Lara Croft team up with Witchblade. Tomb Raider was licensed to Top Cow at the time, and with the rights lapsed, it's likely that there were probably a few legal issues that made it easier to omit that particular comic book rather than include it.</p><p dir="ltr">The Tomb Raider series ran for 50 issues from 1999 to 2005, and it was pretty popular as it was released during the peak of Tomb Raider-mania. The comics were set in the same continuity as the games developed by Core Design, making a few tweaks to Lara Croft's story along the way. A pretty talented roster of artists and writers were involved in this series, including Dan Jurgens, Adam Hughes, Michael Turner, Andy Park, Marc Silvestri, David Finch, and several others.</p><hr><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4398010-evercadetombraider.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4398010" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4398010-evercadetombraider.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4398010"></a><figcaption>Evercade EXP-R with Tomb Raider games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4398010-evercadetombraider.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for some more Tomb Raider gear, you can also check out the upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Gaming-Handheld-Console-Atari-2600/dp/B0D1VZQ2VL?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evercade EXP-R</a>.

<p dir="ltr">As seen in the trailer above, the page designs are similar to Fortnite's style of battle pass. Each page features several items that can be unlocked in any order, giving players more choice and flexibility. Unlocking all the items on a page will then grant a high-tier item called the HVT reward.</p><p dir="ltr">Just like previous years, players can still choose to have their battle pass tokens automatically unlock rewards sequentially, or they can turn the auto feature off and pick and choose the order they want to unlock.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 1's pass includes the new Krig C assault rifle and Saug submachine gun in the free tiers of the pass, while the paid version includes several high-end operator skins and weapon blueprints. The extra-premium BlackCell pass also returns with tons of additional content and battle pass tier skips.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on Call of Duty, make sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-roadmap-shows-mp-maps-7-new-weapons-and-castle-map-for-zombies/2900-5940/#11">all the major highlights from the Season 1</a> roadmap, including new multiplayer maps, the first look at the upcoming Zombies map, and all the big changes for Warzone.</p>

It’s something I’ve grown to love very much, and I’ve developed a few basic principles for how I approach things that I’d like to share. These techniques straddle the border between visual design and tech because that’s my skillset, and they’re mostly designed to create something acceptable as fast as possible. If you specialize in UI/UX, you may even be offended by my low-brow approach! But I hope you can forgive me and we can still be friends.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="One neat trick">One neat trick</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I’m looking into a new project, art direction is one of the first things I establish, and the art direction naturally guides the appearance of the UI as well. Once I have a general idea of how the game will look, I usually program a few helper functions/shaders to make certain effects or shapes as easy as possible to drop in anywhere. Then, for years after that, I use those little helper functions everywhere… all of the time… for everything.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That’s the entire trick, but we can look at it in practice with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beastieball.</span></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Parallelograms and patterns in Beastieball">Parallelograms and patterns in Beastieball</h2><p>Images via Greg Lobanov/Klei Publishing.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beastieball</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> UI, the key theme is all parallelograms because they are the sportiest shape. (I think ESPN did this). The game is an RPG with a lot of UI, numbers and lists, so this basic style works great because it’s just </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>barely</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a twist on the most boring, simple layout style you can do, which is just putting text in rectangles. The slight skew, and arranging things on an angle rather than straight up and down, makes the game feel infinitely more stylish. In the biz, this is what we call "art direction."</span></p><p>The other main repeating visual motif are the looping shape patterns (dots, lines, diamonds) which scroll ambiently. Images and captions via Greg Lobanov/Klei Publishing.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All of these were supported by very simple one-line functions, which I used everywhere, brainlessly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>draw_pgram(x1,y1,x2,y2) </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">was the first of these I wrote. It just draws a parallelogram within the specified boundaries. The angle of the tilt is determined by a universal macro/global number which I basically never changed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>shader_set_scrollpattern(graphicAsset, color) </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">was another one. I created a shader which would take an input texture (like a scrolling dot pattern) and overlay it on whatever was rendered after that, with the texture position slowly scrolling over time. So for example, if I set this shader to use a dot pattern and a yellow color, then rendered a pink parallelogram, the result would be a pink parallelogram with scrolling yellow dots on it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That’s pretty much it. The entire UI style of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beastieball</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was founded on basic one-line functions like this. Some of the cleverness comes in the consistency of application; by using these visual motifs for EVERYTHING, I sometimes ran into problems conveying the info I needed. But I persevered and made everything work without ever breaking the boundaries I’d set. As a developer, this can be seen as a sort of laziness, but to players I think the effect is also one of the game having a very clear and consistent visual style.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lazy tweens">Lazy tweens</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I need to credit my college professor </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://jervo.org/">Jervis Thompson</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for this one. I use it so many times per day, I sometimes forget that it might(?) not be common knowledge to everyone. It’s basically a braindead method for having stuff move around the screen in a pleasing way, using as few codelines and states as possible. This is it:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Position += (TargetPosition - Position) * Speed;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Position</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the current position of a UI element (this could also be its angle, scale, opacity, or any variable, really).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>TargetPosition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the intended final resting place of that element.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Speed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a value above 0 and below 1. My favorite value for Speed is 0.3 but maybe you’ll find your own which you like even more!</span></p><p>Images via Greg Lobanov/Klei Publishing.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This simple sort of code is what drives a ton of tiny UI animations in the game, like the scale and position of elements animating when you open and close a menu. It’s really easy to add this anywhere, and it always makes things look better, so it’s a good habit to get into if you’re a complete hack (affectionate) like myself and Jervis.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Indexed palettes">Indexed palettes</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I use this technique everywhere I possibly can, not just in UI. But, basically: I define a small list of colors, and then every UI element gets its color by referencing one of those pre-defined colors by index (i.e. color 1, color 2, color 3…). I do this rather than defining the colors for each asset, or using imported image assets with colors already on them, because it makes it very easy to adjust the colors as I go, and also ensures that every visual element is harmonious.</span></p><p>I can also swap out the list of colors easily to create visual theme options for players that work across all menus. Images and captions via Greg Lobanov/Klei Publishing.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="UI should support the core gameplay">UI should support the core gameplay</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is the part where I get more annoying and philosophical about UI design like I’m some kind of sage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think it’s really important to recognize that UI is the player’s window into the soul of your game. The things that you choose to show them, and NOT show them, entirely define their understanding of your world. So be careful about overusing or underusing UI… think about where you want the player’s attention to be and where you want them to look to find certain information. A classic example of overwrought UI would be when maps in games are easier to navigate than the game world itself, leading players to navigate purely by UI and ignore all your amazing environments, etc.</span></p><p>Images via Greg Lobanov/Klei Publishing.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’ll share one specific example where I avoided UI overuse (in my opinion). In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wandersong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, there’s a section with a bunch of different islands you can visit, each containing parts of a larger puzzle/quest so the player has to navigate around between them. Generally, the game is a side-scroller, and my initial plan for navigating the islands was to add some sort of quick menu that would let the player fast travel between them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But when it came time to implement, the menu idea seemed incredibly boring for an over-the-top adventure like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wandersong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I wound up adding a special screen that was unlike anything else in the game, wherein you used singing to steer a pirate boat around instead. It does feature a map of the islands, which you can quickly bring up with a button press </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>(that’s a lazy tween…), </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">but you can’t move while looking at the map, so it invites you to plan a route and then sing your way there. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>(Also, we hid a secret bonus island under the character’s thumb).</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Mechanically speaking, it’s very shallow, and it certainly added a lot of extra travel time. But it also remains one of the most popular segments of the game and one players frequently comment on, I think in part because of the way it breaks with expectations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lesson here isn’t that all fast travel menus should be replaced with a musical pirate boat, but more that it’s worth taking the extra time to consider your approach to game elements and to be intentional about how and when you use different interfaces. A fast travel menu is convenient, but it also invites players to look at your world in a more utilitarian way, and takes away the simple pleasure of moving yourself from point A to point B. It’s a great fit for lots of games, but maybe not all of them.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Core gameplay supports the UI">Core gameplay supports the UI</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">OK, last point to make from way up here on my high horse.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You know how I said UI is the player’s window to the game’s soul? Well, it’s also yours as the developer. It’s an organized visual representation of the chaotic, dark inner world of the thing you’re making. And when your game has problems, sometimes those will first surface in the UI. Because of this, it can be helpful to actually design your game’s underlying systems in such a way that they support the UI (!).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was an idea that was crystallized really well in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/into-the-breach-interface-design">Into the Breach</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/into-the-breach-interface-design">’s design post-mortems</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which I think all designers could stand to learn from.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’ll say this has come up all the time in a million tiny ways while designing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beastieball</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and I’m sure any designer who’s worked on a tactics or RPG-style game can relate. To improve the clarity of UI, we put all sorts of restrictions on the design, such as how many status effects a move can apply. Sometimes, we’ll have a great idea for a new play or a new Beastie game mechanic, but it gets tossed out in the planning stage because we realize there’s simply no easy way to explain it to players. And, to be clear, I don’t think that compromises the quality of the game design… the fact that our ideas are too complex to communicate via UI means they are inherently confusing and unnecessary! The UI is just always our first clue to that realization.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In many ways, the design of the UI </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>is</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the game design, too. Even on larger teams that segment those into separate roles, I’d recommend that teams foster good communication and let UI designers have a voice in broader design decisions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thanks for reading, I hope you go make some awesome video games!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is reviving its beloved original map once again - but this time as a permanent mode.
</p>
<p>
Chapter 1 Season 1 of Fortnite will begin once more on 6th December, developer Epic Games said today, with future updates offering the chance to "relive OG seasons".

Fans expect the permanent Fortnite OG mode to rotate through each of the game's first 10 seasons over time, giving players a chance to relive the map's various iterations. Remember when the meteor hit? When the iceberg arrived? When the volcano erupted?

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-smashes-concurrent-user-records-as-over-6m-players-log-on-this-weekend">Fortnite OG originally returned last November to enormous success</a>, giving the game its best-ever player count of 44.7 million participants in 24 hours. As a result, Epic Games promised to revive Fortnite OG again this year. 
</p>
<p>
Exactly what that meant, however, remained unclear - until now. Earlier this year, Fortnite launched its faster-paced Reload mode based on a shrunk-down version of the game's OG map. And <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-estimated-release-date-and-time">Fortnite is currently hosting another OG-style take, this time of its Chapter 2 incarnation</a> - although now remixed with various musical stars like Eminem and Snoop Dogg.

It should be made clear, all of this comes alongside Fortnite's next all-new map. Fortnite Chapter 6 is expected to arrive on Sunday, 1st December, meaning players have around five days to check that out before the OG mode goes live.

What is Epic Games cooking? Well, based on leaks and teases, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-map-features-japanese-theme-leaks-suggest">Fortnite Chapter 6 looks like it'll have a Japanese vibe</a>.

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> pulled up to the starting line with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/04/sony-confirm-the-55-ps5-pro-enhanced-games-for-launch/">a broad list of 55 games that were PS5 Pro enhanced</a> at launch. While we’re still waiting for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7’s</a> update, three of these are racing games – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/ea-sports-f1-24-review/">F1 24</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/29/the-crew-motorfest-review/">The Crew Motorfest</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/13/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a> – and they really do give us the full highs and lows of what PS5 Pro Enhanced games can be with different results thanks to a trio of bespoke in-house game engines.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro Enhanced Racing Game Round-up –&nbsp;F1 24, The Crew Motorfest, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHMdNTV6IE8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Let’s start with The Crew Motorfest, which would appear to be the most straightforward. As a cross-gen game it’s inherently very scalable son base PS5 you had two graphics modes because of this, giving you a pretty much locked 30FPS in Quality mode and generally solid 60FPS in its Performance mode. Visual quality between the two is pretty much identical outside of resolution –&nbsp;a full 4K target in Quality mode, and a dynamic 1440p with FSR2 upscaling in Performance mode –&nbsp;though there’s some more noticeable pop-in for smaller scenery items and shadows in performance mode, arriving at roughly half the distance to the camera.</p>


<p id="caption-attachment-454498">The overhead lanterns pop in at around 215m for PS5 Pro, 175m for PS5 ‘Fidelity’, and 115m for PS5 ‘Performance.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro ditches the graphics setting, giving you a 60FPS target and a 4K output, but it using PSSR upscaling to enable Ubisoft Ivory Tower to push some higher quality effects, as detailed in the patch notes.</p>

<p>Screen Space Reflections are still used here, as opposed to a jump to ray tracing, but they use higher level of detail to make car bodies and water look more precisely reflective, so you have the same weaknesses that SSR give you, such as driving under a bridge darkening all the road’s surface light reflections for a moment. They’ve also increased the shadowmap cascade detail, to give sharper shadowing. Then there’s a 15% bump in world objects and foliage, aiming to fill out crowds that bit more, upgraded volumetric clouds, and an increase in the number of Image-Based Lighting elements to again improve quality of lighting and reflections. With PSSR, the game should have around 1700p before upscaling to 4K, and the result is sharp and good looking.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454496">Outside of some minor pop in and a softer image, PS5 ‘Performance’ holds up well.</p>
<p>The thing is that this all feels like the RPG looting and perks where you get a 2% upgrade to damage output – it’s a little bit underwhelming. The PS5’s performance mode is really the go-to, with FSR2 working fairly well from a 1080p to 1440p core resolution range, and while that does give a softer image, it’s honestly quite difficult to spot when you’re 2 or 3 meters from your TV. Get closer and the PS5 Pro does take that step forward, but without the highlighted features from Ubisoft, I was very hard pressed spotting the differences outside of sharpness. Not only that, but there are minor dips in performance still, which I could find when skimming through frame-by-frame for points of comparison.</p>
<p>Still, this is a good “does what it says on the tin” kind of upgrade.</p>
<hr>
<p>Moving on to F1 24, and we get meaningful ray-tracing on console for the first time in this series. Ray tracing first debuted with F1 21 on PC, but on console had only ever been featured during non-racing moments. Now with the PS5 Pro, ray tracing is featured in racing for the first time and in a rather refined form as Codemasters have iterated on their EGO engine.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454489">F1 24 ray tracing is best seen during wet races.</p>
<p>First things first, F1 24 has a different meaning to quality and performance than most games. The base PS5 Quality here is the 60fps game mode with a native 4K target, while Performance shoots for 120fps.</p>
<p>Really the only place for the PS5 Pro to go is for adding ray tracing on track. There’s the eye-catching ray-traced reflections, of course, but that’s joined by ray traced ambient occlusion (RTAO) for improved shading, and dynamic diffuse global illumination (DDGI). The main one that’s missing on PS5 Pro during a race is ray traced shadows. Put things together and, depending on the time of day, the lighting and weather, this can all lead to some quite notable changes.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454494">The screen is no longer reflected unrealistically on the wet track surface.</p>
<p>The difference is most strikingly rendered on a very wet race day. The base PS5 uses screen space reflections, but with a wet and shiny asphalt surface, the limits of SSR are shown as it can be excessive and give an over-the top mirroring effect, where reality would be much more subtle. By contrast, ray traced reflections are a little less… shouty, let’s say. Things like billboards on bridges and big screens are no longer reflected in the wet floor as their reflected or emitted light is more rapidly diffused onto the rough surface.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454492">Spot the ray-traced reflections in the glass barriers at Melbourne.</p>
<p>However, there are still more shiny ray-traced reflections on show. You can spot it in places like the reflective protective glass along the pit wall at Albert Park mirroring the grand stands opposite, as opposed to being a white reflection of the sky, as just one trackside example, or on the often shiny front wheel vanes that will now reflect the scenery you’re zipping past. One neat improvement is that, where SSR in bodywork refreshed at 30Hz on PS5, the ray-traced reflections update at 60Hz on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454490">RTAO adds shading to the trees in the track scenery.</p>
<p>RTAO and DDGI both also really help to bring more realistic feeling light and shade to the environment, and this is most noticeable on tracks at night, where trees behind trackside barriers are no longer uniformly lit through all their branches, and even further in the backdrops, you can see the skyscrapers in Singapore lit directionally in a way that fits with a city’s nighttime lighting. During the day, take a comparative peek at covered grandstands and you’ll notice that they’re more shaded inside</p>
<p>You’ll spend a lot of time look at the exhaust and rear end of both rivals and your own car if you race third person, and there’s a lot of complexity to the self-shading and reflections that come from the flowing bodywork, suspension and rear wings that is better represented here.</p>
<p>All in all, there’s a pretty good case for bringing ray tracing into racing games as GPU power is increasing… so long as the same frame rate target can be met. The thing is that, as will be familiar to PC gamers, adding ray tracing is expensive, forcing you to sacrifice resolution and use upscaling to claw back the difference. Without ray-tracing the base PS5 has that native 4K target, but the PS5 Pro with ray tracing drops to a dynamic resolution limit of 1440p and uses Sony’s PSSR to get back to 4K. That’s a high enough resolution to give high quality results, though upscaling problem areas like chain fences can break up a bit in motion, having a more jagged, aliased appearance compared to the temporal anti-aliasing of the base PS5 game… not that this matters at the speeds you’re typically going!</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454491">PSSR and the lower base resolution on PS5 Pro does lead to some more jaggies.</p>
<p>Two further features that the PS5 Pro offers to F1 24, though which we weren’t able to test at this time, were the 120Hz performance mode and an 8K resolution mode – both sacrificing ray tracing to get the job done.</p>
<p>On the whole, F1 24 on PS5 Pro is a success, folding in naturalistic ray-tracing features without impacting underlying performance. It’s an often subtle difference though, and you’re already starting from a 4K 60fps game on base PS5.</p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, we come to the runt of the litter with Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown. This open world racer had a troubled launch back in September with some spotty performance and image quality to go alongside its launch server issues. PS5 Pro support was added in patch 2 a few days ahead of the console release, but there’s very little song and dance about this. In fact, the messaging in general is rather confusing.</p>
<p>For the base PS5, patch 2 reportedly increases the resolution of the 30FPS quality mode from 1080p to 1440p, though it was meant to be 1440p at launch already. The update also makes certain optimisations to try and steady the frame rate in the 60fps performance mode, though dips are still pretty easy to find.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454493">There is no meaningful improvement for PS5 Pro in TDU Solar Crown.</p>
<p>For PS5 Pro, there’s no apparent difference in the settings –&nbsp;it’s the same Quality and Performance options with no naming distinction or description changes –&nbsp;and there’s no appreciable difference in frame rate, resolution or graphics targets. The PS5 Pro might be able to work at the top end of any dynamic resolution scaling and there’s perhaps some areas where frame stutters have been ironed out, but I’ve also found areas that do still stutter and resolution gains are debatable without pixel counting. There’s also identical visual quirks and glitches in areas glass building faces, shadow draw distances, and plenty more beside.</p>
<p>If you were hoping that PS5 Pro would be some kind of panacea to improve the game’s visuals, it sadly hasn’t been, and KT Racing still has a good bit of work to do if they’re to win over a somewhat disaffected community.</p>

<p>This is definitely a genre that can benefit from higher powered machines, whether it’s helping open world racers pull off 60fps, or feeding more ray tracing reflections, lighting and shading in to provide more realistic, true-to-life visuals. Though this trio of games definitely shows the variance in what different games, engines and developers can and will pull off.</p>
<p>And on the whole, I would say that it’s fair to be a little bit underwhelmed. The Crew looked good in PS5 performance mode, F1 24 was already at 4K 60 so leans on ray tracing to actually add more subtlety to its graphics instead of glitzy reflections that were already there, and Test Drive Unlimited is… well, it’s still in a difficult spot. So… see you for Gran Turismo 7, racing fans!</p>
