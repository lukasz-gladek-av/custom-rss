			<p>An early PlayStation 5 Pro comparison video shared online earlier today highlights the visual improvements the new console will bring to select existing titles.</p>
<p>The video, which was put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1">Cycu1</a>, is based on the footage shown during yesterday's technical presentation, and, as such, it may not properly represent how these games will run on the actual hardware. Even so, the comparison makes it clear that some games will benefit more than others, such as Hogwarts Legacy, which will use the console's capabilities to offer better ray tracing with more solid performance, and Gran Turismo 7, which will also feature ray tracing during races. Other games don't seem to benefit as much, sporting only marginal improvements to image quality.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro was officially revealed yesterday, following months of rumors and speculation. The biggest upgrade the new model launching in two months features over the base console is a more powerful GPU which offers <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/">45% faster rendering</a> thanks to 67% more compute units and 28% faster memory. The console will also feature the AI-powered <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-spectral-super-resolution-to-work-across-the-full-library-without-patches-will-also-support-ps-vr2/">PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler</a>, which will increase games' visual quality while offering smooth framerates. Enhancing the visual quality of Performance Mode was one of the main goals of the new system, as the vast majority of players preferred 60 FPS gameplay over higher resolution and visual quality over the course of the generation, as confirmed by Mark Cerny himself during the console's reveal.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th for the price of $699.99, £699.99, €799.99. Despite the high price, analysts expect the system to sell as <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-low-volume-product-sell-much/">well as the PS4 Pro did.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24241706/sony-ps5-pro-price-next-gen-consoles<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The PS5 Pro’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24167932/ps5-pro-sony-specs-announcement">announcement yesterday</a> wasn’t a surprise. What was a surprise was the price: at $699.99, it debuts as Sony’s most expensive console ever. It brought back memories of the PS3’s controversial price tag, a console that when adjusted for inflation is the same $779 price point of a PS5 Pro with the additional disc drive. It’s a very expensive PlayStation, and I fear it’s a test of what’s to come for next-gen console pricing.</p><p>For years, console gamers have been used to purchasing hardware at a significantly reduced price compared to what you could build yourself in the PC gaming space. Yes, you can find components that match the PS5 or Xbox Series X on paper, but it’s still difficult to hit the price points that consoles sell for, especially when they’re discounted during promotions. Besides, the easy plug-and-play model, simplified UI, and hassle-free warranty process are all big benefits over having to build or find a good prebuilt PC and then deal with Windows and driver updates. Consoles sell in their millions because they’re far more consumer-friendly than PCs.</p><p>It increasingly feels like that gap between console and PC is blurring, though. Microsoft and Sony both pushed this current generation in the direction of having the type of CPU, storage, and GPU power that you’d find inside a gaming PC. The PS5 and Xbox Series X / S have far more capable CPUs for gaming instead of underpowered laptop-like ones and improve the performance of your existing library of games just like a GPU upgrade would on the PC side. That’s why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review">I called the Xbox Series X a next-gen PC</a> when I reviewed it in 2020.</p><div><figcaption><em>The PS5 Pro ships without a disc drive.﻿</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div><p>The PS5 Pro demonstrates that trend even more clearly. Sony’s entire selling point is a $700 upgrade for existing and new games to hit better frame rates while maintaining visual quality. That’s been the selling point of GPUs for decades, and now Sony is about to test if console gamers are willing to upgrade their hardware in the same way PC gamers build entire new rigs.</p><p>The big difference this time is that Sony wants you to pay out for that upgrade in the same way that PC gamers have begrudgingly gotten used to GPU prices skyrocketing in recent years. Both Sony and Microsoft typically sell consoles at a loss initially to subsidize the hardware and grow the market for next-gen systems. These initial hardware losses are usually covered by digital game revenues and in-game purchases.</p><p>The PS5 Pro is all about digital sales, shipping without a disc drive. Sure, you can buy one separately ($79.99), but if you don’t bother, Sony will benefit from this digital sales push and the 30 percent cut it gets on most purchases. Microsoft and Sony are both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24241265/sony-ps5-pro-game-console-disc-drive-end">pushing toward a discless future</a> for consoles, and it seems likely that next-gen systems won’t ship with disc drives as standard. Hopefully you’ll still be able to purchase one separately, though.</p><p>It also seems likely that next-gen consoles will be a lot more expensive than we’re used to. Component costs aren’t coming down, the console market isn’t growing, and Microsoft’s Xbox chief Phil Spencer admitted earlier this year that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24108670/xbox-epic-games-store-phil-spencer-interview">subsidizing hardware is now challenging</a> because the price of components isn’t dropping fast enough.</p><p>Last year, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880635/microsoft-ps5-reveal-email-xbox-nadella-spencer">Microsoft document revealed</a> that the company had planned to subsidize the Xbox Series X and S to the tune of $1.5 billion in 2021 to hit its price targets of $499 and $299, respectively. “That’s our largest hardware subsidy ever” in Microsoft’s profit and loss for its gaming division, the document revealed. With Xbox Series S / X sales still lagging behind the PS5, it’s unlikely that Microsoft is going to gamble again on highly subsidized Xbox hardware for its next-gen consoles.</p><div><figcaption><em>The PS5 Pro promises better visuals at higher frame rates.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div><p>Sony already appears to be at the point of not heavily subsidizing its PlayStation consoles. The lack of a disc drive helps drive console costs down for Sony on both the PS5 Slim and Pro models. The pricing of the PS5 Pro also looks like it’s designed to be profitable from day one, instead of months or years later. It took Sony nearly a year to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609150/sony-playstation-5-ps5-loss-profit">no longer sell the $499 PS5 at a loss</a>, and the company then hiked PS5 prices outside the US <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/25/23321301/sony-ps5-price-increase-europe-uk-japan-china-australia-mexico-canada">a year later</a> to cover inflation and component costs. In 2022, PS5 prices jumped by 10 percent in Europe, 12.5 percent in Japan, and by around 6 percent in the UK. Sony has hiked PS5 prices in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24229420/ps5-prices-are-going-up-again-in-japan">Japan three times</a> since the console’s launch in 2020.</p><p>Crucially, Sony hasn’t ever increased the price of the PS5 in the US, the one market where it still faces competition from Xbox sales. Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-microsofts-claim-that-it-has-20-market-share-in-europe-vs-playstations-80-was-accurate">admitted last year</a> that it has a 20 percent market share in Europe, compared to Sony’s 80 percent share. When there’s no competition in Europe, Sony can adjust prices by 10 percent or sell a new PS5 Pro for €799.99 (about $884).</p><p>Pricing is even worse in the UK for the PS5 Pro. The PS5 originally launched at £449 in the UK and $499 in the US — a currency gap given the weaker value of the British pound over the past decade. After the price hike to £479 in 2022, the UK is now facing £699 pricing for the PS5 Pro compared to the $699 launch price in the US. If you want to purchase a PS5 Pro and the separate disc drive in the UK, it works out to a steep $1,045. In the US, it’s as little as $818 with sales tax in many states for the same console and disc drive, nearly a $230 difference.</p><p>Sony faces little competition in Europe and the UK from Xbox console sales, and Microsoft’s plans for an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880111/microsoft-xbox-series-x-new-design-refresh">Xbox Series X redesign</a> have been put on hold. It seems to be skipping a mid-generation spec bump in favor of an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24174793/microsoft-xbox-series-x-white-digital-edition">all-digital white version of the Xbox Series X</a> and a 2TB limited-edition model. Neither of these offers the improved GPU that the PS5 Pro includes, and it leaves a gap for Sony to set the PS5 Pro pricing around the world accordingly.</p><p>While I’m hopeful that the price of next-gen consoles won’t push close to $999, I can’t help but think that a $699 price tag wouldn’t be all that surprising by the time next-gen hardware arrives. Maybe we’ll all need to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2005-07-06-sony-wants-you-to-earn-that-playstation-3.html">work more hours</a> to afford one. We’re heading into uncharted territory for console generations, and Sony’s PS5 Pro pricing is about to test the waters for the decisions that Sony and Microsoft are making right now for their next-gen hardware choices. Hold on to your disc drives and wallets, because consoles are about to get expensive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Gold Gold Adventure Gold is a game that relies on raw enthusiasm and moxie to power you through a blizzard of confusing references. It boldly describes itself as a "Cult-of-the-Lamb-lite, Rimworld-lite, Majesty-like mixed with Black &amp; White with a pinch of Against the Storm". Whoa there, pardner, save a few subgenres for the rest of us! I think that's half the New &amp; Trending keywords on Steam in one sentence. If you're mystified, best watch the announcement trailer - it paints a clearer picture, though it does involve a startling amount of cartoon decapitation and dismemberment.

<p>
Still mystified? I guess I'd better write the rest of this article, then. In this "reverse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> / city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> / pet game", you must (deep breath) construct a settlement around a dungeon to attract adventurers who'll earn you gold with which to buy food for your horrible god-beast pet. 
</p>
<p>
Adventurers come in all shapes and sizes, from undead to mothmen, all represented as pleasantly laconic and fatalistic-seeming 2D anime sprites. You'll lure them to your town with promises of "gold or glory", and assign them quests such as exploration, defending areas, or going after specific munsters. You can let them battle the menagerie by themselves, or intervene and help them secure items and skills. It sounds like you shouldn't let them get too powerful, for "each level brings them one step closer towards a forbidden evolution". 
</p>
<p>
When not enticing and managing adventurers, you'll tend to a growing fantasy-medieval economy based on farming or monster-slaying. The blurb cautions that heroes might try to steer your town's direction, should you let up your Sauron-like surveillance for but a single moment. "Your units have a life of their own - they might form parties, fund their own buildings, or give each other quests," it warns. "Watch your dark alleys closely!" I always do, game.
</p>
<p>
And then there's the matter of your pet god-beast, which must be fed and pampered to stop it running amok. "It might be wise to teach it what is right and wrong, before it grows too big to care about your opinions," explains the blurb. "Raise it, teach it spells or tricks, pet it, brush it, and if necessary discipline it. You might find that it becomes a trusted companion upon your journey!" That "might" has a definite edge to it. I wonder if it'll be like in Black &amp; White, where you and your Creature could end up with opposing moral alignments. If necessary, you can kill two birds with one stone and feed misbehaving heroes to your god-beast.
</p>
<p>
Let me try for a different bundle of references and parallels: this is like you're actually <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stay-awhile-and-play-this-free-diablo-inspired-indie-as-the-mayor-of-tristram">running Sanctuary in Diablo</a>, managing those rapscallion dungeon-delvers while also catsitting one of the Prime Evils. The cute-but-grisly visuals remind me of the nastier magic girl animes, like Madoka Magica. I'm quite interested, in short. There’s no release date yet, but you can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3133650/Gold_Gold_Adventure_Gold/">Steam</a>.

They’re not technically available to buy just yet—the listings still have “Coming soon” on them—but for someone looking to finally take the plunge four years into the current console cycle, it’s not a bad deal, especially when you consider the $350 model is <em>half</em> the price of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-playstation-everything-announced-specs-price-1851644090&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-playstation-everything-announced-specs-price-1851644090">new PS5 Pro launching in November</a></span>. </p><p>Sony has pushed some pretty good PS5 deals from time to time as it tries to hit ambitious sales goals for the console, but there’s never been an actual price cut for the hardware, which is very unusual compared to the PS4 and PS3 generations. As a result, as recently as earlier this year there were roughly 50 million players still using PS4s. And even though Sony’s games are no longer cross-gen on the older machines, perennial blockbusters like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Madden NFL 25</em> are still available on the last-gen consoles. </p><p>Sony is also selling refurbished DualSense controllers, though at $65 that’s a much less appealing value proposition.

With FromSoftware now making the fight a little easier again, some players are already touting their “pre-nerf” Radahn-slaying bona fides.</p><p>Update 1.14 includes a slew of other changes as well, including PVP balance adjustments like decreased damage to Backhand Blades, Pata weapon, and dual-wielded spears. Scattershot Throw is also weaker against other players. Meanwhile on the PVE front, Moon-and-Fire stance and Devonia’s Vortex were buffed, and heavy attack speed for various weapons was increased.</p><p>You can find the complete list of 1.14 patch notes below:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><h2 id="h1287"><a id=""></a><strong>Final Boss balance adjustments</strong></h2><p>The following adjustments have been made to the final boss of “<strong>SHADOW OF THE ERDTREE</strong>”</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Changed the action pattern when the battle starts.</li><li>Adjusted some attack moves.</li><li>Decreased the damage of some attacks.</li><li>Decreased stamina damage of some attacks.</li><li>Decreased the attack range of some non-weapon-based attacks.</li><li>Improved the visibility of some attack effects.</li></ul><h2 id="h1288"><a id=""></a><strong>PvP-exclusive balance adjustments</strong></h2><h3 id="h1289"><a id=""></a><strong>Equipment</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Decreased the damage of Backhand Blades against other players.

<p>IShowSpeed, the divisive, aggressive streamer best known for his over-the-top antics and controversial performances, has just broken his peak viewer count record. He’s on something of a world tour of late, and his most recent stop has been in Thailand, during which he has been spending hours going wild in front of a camera.</p>



<p>It was revealed that he hit a peak count of 610,000 users, which is a fair distance past his previous record of 548,000 users. He secured the previous record while attending 2023’s Ballon D’or ceremony.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-into-a-wall">Into a Wall</h2>



<p>On September 9, IShowSpeed appeared on stream in Thailand climbing into the driver’s seat of a ‘Tuk Tuk’. Moments after assuming control of the vehicle, he ploughed into a wall, with the claim being that he had no idea how to drive a manual vehicle (with a clutch).</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It made for great watching, but many believed it was nothing more than a bit, which gels nicely with IShowSpeed’s traditional operating model.</p>



<p>Previously, he has leapt over speeding cars, lit fireworks in his bedroom, and ‘accidentally’ exposed himself on stream.</p>



<p>In a relatively short period, IShowSpeed, whose real name is <strong>Darren Jason Watkins Jr</strong>., has soared up the streamer charts. He has gone from being a content creator broadcasting the occasional game of Fortnite to a superstar streamer appearing on-screen during live WWE events and meeting superstar athletes like Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>



<p>What’s your opinion of IShowSpeed? Are you a fan or does he get on your nerves?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-shield-mini-room-television<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the past couple of months, my husband and I have gotten really, really into the early 2000s FX show <em>The Shield</em>. Watching makes me long for the halcyon days of “peak TV,” and makes me mourn a way of making television that seems to be going extinct.</p><p><em>The Shield</em> is a perfect television show, and it could have only existed at the time that it did. Part of that is because the show itself is a reaction to the environment in which it was created. Creator Shawn Ryan was inspired by the LAPD “Rampart” scandal of the late 90s—<em>The Shield</em> was almost named after it. While the scandal was complex, spanning for years, the gist was that the LAPD was letting teams of cops basically ignore the law they were supposed to be upholding. It was a level of corruption that was as shocking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampart_scandal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as the Wikipedia page about the scandal is long</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>After <em>The Sopranos</em> proved a critical and financial success for HBO in 1999, the fledgling FX network was in the market for a Tony Soprano-esque anti-hero. Enter Vic Mackey, played by Michael Chiklis, a corrupt cop working with an LAPD strike team of equally corrupt cops.&nbsp;</p><p>Mackey is a fascinating character to follow because, despite how often he flagrantly commits crimes, he is convinced he does everything for the greater good. If <em>he</em> doesn’t monitor and take a cut from the local drug dealers, how can he be sure they're not selling to kids? If <em>he</em> doesn’t have an on-again off-again affair with a local sex worker, how can he be sure she’ll actually get clean? If <em>he</em> doesn’t plant evidence on a suspect he is 100% sure committed a crime, how can he be sure they’ll end up behind bars?Often, the tension is built by wanting to know how the fuck Mackey is going to wriggle out of the consequences of his actions. You almost root for him despite yourself.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Shield - A Different Kind of Cop Scene (S1 E1) | Rotten Tomatoes TV" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yID-laN-uqM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Alongside Mackey and his strike team are detectives Claudette Wyms and Holland "Dutch" Wagenbach, played by C.C.H. Pounder and Jay Karnes, respectively. While Claudette and Dutch abhor Mackey’s methods, the image of “good” policing they provide is also disgusting. They lie to and manipulate suspects in custody, hold people in interrogation rooms without charging them, deny them access to lawyers to coerce confessions, even lie about what evidence they have or have not found. It’s lucky, through the magic of television, that we know these characters are all guilty of their crimes.</p><p>While Claudette tries her best to do her job in a corrupt system, Dutch is just a smug piece of shit in an entertainingly different way than Mackey. Dutch is a criminal profiler; he’s obsessed with catching serial killers and is often indifferent to their victims. He does put killers behind bars, but it’s the moments when he and Mackey find camaraderie that are most interesting to me. They’re both fans of gallows humor, especially gallows humor about the dead people whose cases they’re trying to solve. After a few episodes of <em>The Shield</em>, the show makes it clear that even “good” cops are bad cops, that the kinds of people who choose police work are often too vain and violent to actually protect anyone.</p><p>But what really strikes me as interesting about <em>The Shield</em> are the mechanical aspects of the show. First and foremost, you can see and feel how much the show benefits from having 13 to 15 episodes a season. It allows for room for characters like Julien, who wants to be a good cop but struggles with his sexuality—which makes him a target for both hate crimes and blackmail. Every episode has an A-plot and B-plot, sometimes even a C-plot, allowing several different characters to get at least a little screen time every episode, and for those characters to develop and evolve as the show moves forward. Members of Mackey’s strike team get filled out as actual characters instead of just caricatures. Shane Vendrell, played by Walton Goggins in his first breakout role, gets more interesting as he’s given space to be around, as both Goggins and the writer’s room get a feel for what kind of a person Shane is.&nbsp;</p><p>These days, it feels like shows with the same tone and mission as <em>The Shield</em> run for 8 to 10 episodes—and if you’re not an instant hit, <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-cancelled-star-wars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can’t count on ever getting another season</a>. If <em>The Shield</em> could only count on 10 episodes, I don’t think it would be able to support full narrative arcs for all the characters, which is often the complaint I have about eight episode television shows. No matter how hard you try, something is going to feel rushed.</p><figure><figcaption>The Shield, FX</figcaption></figure><p>Creator Shawn Ryan has had the opportunity through his career to work in a <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/shield-writers-room-reunion-at-901814/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaborative environment</a> to create his television shows, a kind of environment that is rapidly disappearing. Before <em>The Shield</em>, Ryan worked on <em>Nash Bridges</em> and <em>Angel</em>, where he worked in full writers' rooms. Joss Whedon, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/joss-whedon-allegations.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sex pest and showrunner for <em>Angel</em></a>, often made it clear how important the environment of a writers' room was to the success of his shows; his former collaborators, like Jane Espenson and Drew Goddard, have gone on to become extremely successful Hollywood writers and showrunners. During the Writer’s Strike of 2023, one of the things writers often talked about was the practice of “mini rooms,” instead of full writers' rooms. Mini rooms are popular because they cut down on costs—instead of hiring a bunch of writers to work throughout the season, a studio will hire a handful of writers to break out an entire season in a few weeks. <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/writers-guild-contract-negotiation-mini-room-1235568173/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to writers who spoke to Variety</a>, even if the show is picked up, the writers in the mini room often don’t continue on with the show. Newer writers, who need credited work to get more jobs, are especially impacted here.&nbsp;</p><p>You can feel this when you watch TV today, especially streaming TV with short episode runs. Everything feels rushed, and sometimes characters, plot points, and tone feel inconsistent from episode to episode.&nbsp;</p><p>Studios are also more reactive than they were when<em> The Shield</em> was new. In a conversation with <em>TheWrap</em>, a writer said that they were <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/wga-strike-mini-rooms-frustration-roundtable-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told to change gears on a script they were working on because of Twitter trends</a>. It is hard to imagine <em>any</em> network picking up <em>The Shield</em> as it exists now, if only because of the abuse the cast and crew would face for daring to make a show about cops being corrupt. I mean, spoilers for a twenty year old television show, but this is how the pilot episode ends. Even on a “prestige” network like Max, it’s hard to imagine this making it to air:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Shield - Bawitdaba" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/069OoA63I84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Ryan did get pushback from FX while <em>The Shield</em> was on the air, but also enough room to push back against criticisms from executives. In particular, FX wanted Ryan to drop Walton Goggins, but Ryan wanted to prove to the network that Goggins was a capable actor. Shane Vendrell is now considered the breakout role of Goggins’s career.</p><p>“Little did I know, after that pilot, the executives wanted to fire me,” Goggins said in the <a href="https://ew.com/tv/the-shield-oral-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly<em> </em>oral history of <em>The Shield</em></a>. “Shawn didn't tell me until the end of season 1 during a DVD commentary recording, and I said, ‘How?! I had two lines!’ He said to them, ‘I know what this guy's capable of, let me prove it,’ and he focused the second episode on Shane. I'm glad he didn't tell me because I may have f---ed that up.”</p><p>Going to <em>The Shield </em>after an eight episode television show feels like taking a sip of cold, clear water after a drought. There is television as good as <em>The Shield</em> still on the air—Ryan Murphy’s <em>9-1-1</em> is a delight—but I’m afraid that the economics of television are too fraught for more talent to emerge. I used to dream of working in a writers' room like the one <em>The Shield</em> had, where you could take real world politics and create something shocking and enlightening. I don’t know if that kind of room still exists, and I mourn its loss with each episode of <em>The Shield</em> that I watch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/11/ps5-pro-price-performance-and-what-it-means-for-next-generation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>So, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> has been revealed, and brought with it a lot of cutlery-based exclamations from gamers over the price tag. £700 for a beefed up PS5… and that’s without a disc drive? Needless to say, the overwhelming reaction has been pretty negative. But will it really matter to Sony’s bottom line? And what does it say about the next generation of consoles?</p>
<p>The main hurdle that the PS5 Pro has, compared to the PS4 Pro, is that it’s not selling a new technology. In 2016 Sony could tie in with the rise of 4K TVs and, making use of the early upscaling technique of checkerboarding, could make a compelling case that the PS4 Pro would give you 4K or close to it. The end results were a good bit below that, often topping out at 1440p, but this was also the advent of graphics modes to let you choose to run games at standard resolution and with higher frame rates –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/09/08/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-on-ps4-pro-has-three-graphics-options/">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> being an early example of this –&nbsp;and shore up performance in games that struggled on base PS4.</p>
<p>And it’s performance mode that has come to dominate gaming habits in the last few years, as Mark Cerny pointes out early in his presentation. Gamers just want 60FPS, coming up against developers who want and need to push graphical fidelity as far as possible, and also to hit a particular release date that’s been handed down to them. There’s plenty of games that launch with only 30FPS modes, before a 60FPS mode and other optimised options are patched in down the line.</p>



<p>That’s not even mentioning the slightly blurry elephant in the room: upscaling. The use of DLSS, FSR and XeSS has skyrocketed in the last few years, various techniques that try to fill in the blanks using previous frames as reference points, to varying degrees of quality. They allow games to run at lower actual resolutions while outputting 4K, being used as a necessary crutch alongside dynamic resolutions to keep frame rates steady, even at 30FPS. Without dedicated hardware support in PS5 or Xbox Series, both have had to rely on AMD’s FSR, when DLSS has much higher quality. Sony’s answer here is their own custom PSSR solution.</p>

<p>Per Digital Foundry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-ps5-series-x-s-tech-review">Alan Wake 2 at launch</a> ran at 1270p to upscale to 4K in quality mode, but drops that to 847p to upscale to 1440p in performance mode. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-alan-wake-2-on-playstation-5-remedy-raises-the-bar-for-visual-accomplishment-once-again">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora was a similar compromise</a>, ranging from 1296p to 1800p in quality, or 864p to 1260p in performance.</p>

<p>So here’s the thing: even if PS5 Pro is able to combine quality and performance modes, we’re still well short of native 4K in both these games. Clarity will be improved, but that’s difficult to show in a heavily compressed YouTube video, even if you actually zoom in on images and don’t just crop them funny.</p>
<p>Developers will still be free to use console resources as they see fit, as well. Sony might want to get rid of graphics options, but in reality this is simply shifting the goal posts. You can bet good money that there will still be 30FPS modes in new and updated games, but they might now be a native 4K instead of 1440p-ish. <em>Or</em> developers will get to use the enhanced ray tracing capabilities, which will add a burden to the CPU which hasn’t been meaningfully improved, keeping us back at 30FPS again.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting aspects is how this can actually affect backward compatibility, with Sony saying that PS4 games could be enhanced using PSSR. Early generation games that were never made PS4 Pro compatible could suddenly get a free 4K upscale boost, getting a similar result to Microsoft’s code injection from Xbox backward compatibility, but in a very different way. The only caveat here is that this will be for “select” PS4 games.</p>
<p>But is that worth £700? That’s pricing that feels very much like a halo product, designed to appeal to the comparative few. It’s sure to sell out on day one, and I’d bet there’s at least 10 million people in the world who would consider and be able to afford this, but at the same time I can see it pushing many gamers to think about getting or upgrading a gaming PC instead. With more and more console exclusives coming to PC – whether at the same time for Xbox games, or a little down the road for PlayStation Studios games – that could be rather appealing.</p>
<p>Looking beyond the PS5 Pro and to the next generation, the $700 / £700 price tag is a pretty clear indication that we’re going to see another price hike for the PS6 and next Xbox. The PS5 and Xbox Series X both targeted $500 at launch in 2020, already a big $100 jump over the previous generation launch price, but where many would have expected that price to follow historical trends and gradually slide downward, it’s gone the opposite direction with the price actually increasing around the world in 2022. Even with release of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/11/the-ps5-slim-launch-hides-some-sneaky-price-increases/">PS5 Slim</a>, typically the point at which economies of scale and lowering component cost could enable a lower price, didn’t bring the price down. Heck, there were actually price increases for the digital edition in the US and Japan, and Japan has had yet another price hike since then.</p>
<p>Despite this, the PS5 has continued to sell at roughly the same pace as the PS4, and in a tougher economic climate.</p>
<p>Of course, this has also come at a time where general consumer electronics are going up and up in price. The iPhone 5S started at $650 in 2013, and the iPhone 7 was sticking to that price in 2016, but by 2020, the iPhone 12 started at $800 and iPhone 12 Pro at $1000, and that’s without talking about the plus size models and gouging storage options. There’s plenty of people willing to get the biggest and the best version of a phone.</p>

<p>Perhaps a better point of comparison is GPU costs. In 2013, the GeForce GTX 770 (the third tier GPU behind the GTX 780 and Titans of the day) was $399, now that third tier is the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super, which debuted at $799 –&nbsp;and that only after Nvidia stepped back from backlash to the 4070 Ti being branded as a 4080 and costing $100 more.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s very different pressures for a new console generation than for an optional mid-gen bump and glory project. For the next generation, both Microsoft and Sony will have to weigh up the actual cost of manufacture against the need to build their audience as quickly as possible to make the generation profitable quickly, meaning they will probably start off by selling at a loss. However, with the rate of progress on die shrinks slowing as we approach 1nm, and so the ability to reduce costs also slowing, brace yourselves for at least a $600 starting price. Without a disc drive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-ray-tracing-4k/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Much like its predecessor, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom looks incredible with some choice mods, including those introducing ray tracing.</p>
<p>A new video put together by Digital Dreams shows the latest main entry in the series by Nintendo running on PC via emulation with some mods, including the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/MaxLastBreath" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UltraCam mod</a>, which introduces a variety of visual improvements and the Beyond All Limits Raytracing ReShade preset. While in some scenarios, the game looks a little too bright, there's no denying the visual improvements these mods bring to the game, making it look and run much better than it does on native hardware.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K60] Zelda TotK - Ultra CAM Mod beyond all limits RAYTRACING  - Ultra graphic gameplay 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R6Z8Zuo-7N4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Even in its vanilla state, however, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is an excellent game that no fan of the series should skip. While very similar to its predecessor, Tears of the Kingdom is a richer and more rewarding game, as highlighted by Nathan in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom sticks closely to the blueprint established by The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but it’s a richer, more rewarding game in most ways that count, offering a more intricate world, versatile suite of abilities, epic story, and satisfying dungeons. The familiarity of this Hyrule and a handful of frustrating sections keep Tears of the Kingdom from feeling quite as surprising and magical as its predecessor, but make no mistake, the wait has been worth it. While it probably behooves Nintendo to carve out an entirely new Legend next, Link’s latest should fill most fans’ heart meters nicely in the meantime.</em></p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is now available on Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>No timeframe is given as to when&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>will get its next full-time creative director, so it looks like we'll just have to wait and see what Andreas and Almir bring to the project in the interim.</p>

One user <a href="https://x.com/kizuati/status/1833868706394366069" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> that this decision "was likely with how things went down during Year 1", while <a href="https://x.com/ForeverKnifes/status/1833870588349153367" rel="noopener" target="_blank">another says</a> that Mio's departure is "unfortunate" but "a massive W" nonetheless.</p>
<p>Mio's exit from his role as director comes as&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>continues to flag in terms of player count and user reviews. A quick look at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> shows that&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>currently has just under 600 players online with a 771-player 24-hour peak, while&nbsp;<em>Payday 2</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">24-hour peak</a> is much higher at just under 15,000.</p>
<p>All told, it's been a rough ride for&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>. The game launched in September last year to middling reviews, and although it enjoyed tens of thousands of concurrent players at launch, those numbers quickly dwindled as players fled, seemingly in order to return to&nbsp;<em>Payday 2</em>.</p>
<p>In February this year, Starbreeze <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-payday-3-performance">admitted</a> that&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>had performed at "significantly lower levels" than it wanted, and former CEO&nbsp;Tobias Sjögren <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down">stepped down in March</a>, partly due, it seems, to the game's poor performance.</p>

<p>In response to&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s woes, Starbreeze announced an ambitious initiative called Medic Bag, which involves overhauling many of the game's key systems. Last month, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-roadmap">a roadmap was released</a> showing off some of what's coming in the next few months as part of that initiative.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/satisfactory-release-player-record/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In 2019, Satisfactory was released as an early-access game by Coffee Stain Studios. It pulled in some pretty solid reviews on account of it being quite a unique title, but recently, it was teleported to another level entirely. On September 10, Satisfactory graduated to a fully released game, and shortly after, the player count <strong>skyrocketed</strong>.</p>



<p>Within a few hours of the 1.0 version of Satisfactory being released, more than 100,000 concurrent players were recorded enjoying the game on Steam. That put it in leagues with the likes of Rust and Deadlock, and it pushed it above games like Apex Legends and Baldur’s Gate 3.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-than-satisfactory">More Than Satisfactory</h2>



<p>Satisfactory offers players a unique premise. They’re charged with exploring diverse open-world environments, scavenging up resources and putting them to use in a construction capacity. They’ll need to mine and process materials to build fully automated factory systems, and along the way, they’ll have to manage power systems and deal with alien attacks.</p>



<p>Before hitting the 1.0 release window, Satisfactory had only peaked at around 34,000 concurrent players, which helps to represent the success of the full release. </p>



<p>To ‘qualify’ as a 1.0 version, Satisfactory underwent a staggering number of changes. From run-of-the-mill quality-of-life improvements to bringing the entire game up to spec on the latest version of Unreal, Satisfactory’s full list of changes for the 1.0 update is <strong>hefty</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/506456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Twitch</a>, the game is approaching a new all-time high. It peaked in January 2024 at 70,861 concurrent viewers, but at the time of publishing, it was sitting at around 66,000.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first game to see great success after hitting that 1.0 window. Most recently, 7 Days to Die and Sons of the Forest graduated, moving out of early access and becoming listed as a full game. </p>



<p>Are you considering playing Satisfactory now it’s a full release? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

<p>GameStop has published a financial update that highlights the company’s performance through the second quarter of the year. It’s not looking good for the retailer, with the key talking point being a 45% decrease in sales year-on-year. It has been a rough few months for the company, as earlier this year, layoffs were made and stores were closed down.</p>



<p>This financial update is an indicator that further cuts will need to be made.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-down">Going Down</h2>



<p>GameStop might have recorded a rise in net income, but sales were down 45% year-on-year, the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/09/10/2944123/0/en/GameStop-Discloses-Second-Quarter-2024-Results.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent financial report</a> confirmed. This follows a downturn in the Q1 financial report – and it’s a growing figure. Earlier this year, the company reported a 26% drop in sales.</p>



<p>This news comes weeks after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-informer-shut-down-gamestop/">GameStop laid off</a> the entire Game Informer team and shut the publication down after it had been operational for more than thirty years. It also arrives a few months after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamestop-layoffs-share-price/">plummeting stock prices</a> that haven’t yet recovered by the time of writing.</p>



<p>It didn’t help that the firm just offered up 20 million more shares to the market, causing the stock value to cascade by another 10%.</p>



<p>Per a report <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/videogame-retailer-gamestop-misses-quarterly-revenue-estimates-2024-09-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Reuters</a>, GameStop’s leadership team is preparing to shut down more stores across North America. It’s no big secret that the rise of online shopping and digital-based gaming has impacted the likes of GameStop quite hard, and we’re seeing it now in black and white.</p>



<p>In the United Kingdom, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-reportedly-ending-in-store-sales-for-physical-currency-cards/">GAME</a> recently revealed a horizon loaded with cuts, layoffs, and store closures.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/most-of-those-creepy-flying-things-in-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-arent-lobotomized-babies-the-truth-is-much-weirder<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a> has broken free from the shackles of its Warhammer 40,000 setting and made inroads into the gaming mainstream, and that means there are plenty of players new to its grim dark far future.</p><p>For them Space Marine 2 is a somewhat bewildering experience, as it leans on much of the lore that Warhammer 40,000 owner Games Workshop has built over decades, with hundreds of novels, rule books, and magazine articles fleshing out the background fans know intimately.</p><p>Warhammer 40,000 fans have enjoyed seeing newcomers react in shock at just how grim and dark Space Marine 2 is. And it’s not just the extreme gore, mass death, and terrifying alien enemies that appear in the game either. Perhaps the most disturbing element of Space Marine 2 that newcomers are seeing for the first time are lobotomized babies.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In Space Marine 2, I really respect how cherubs are one of the first sights to see when on the barge. It's a good tone setter for those who don't really know what they're in for <a href="https://t.co/D3ZHWUiEQY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/D3ZHWUiEQY</a></p>— Iggy (@IgnacioVitalis) <a href="https://twitter.com/IgnacioVitalis/status/1832584285787976020?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>A tweet from Forbes writer Paul Tassi, below, sums up the reaction to Space Marine 2’s winged babies, who seemingly fly about the Battle Barge, the spaceship on which the Space Marines live and plan their missions, performing monotonous busywork.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">uhhh what <a href="https://t.co/j7BvzzcHv3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/j7BvzzcHv3</a></p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1833203541940551902?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>On the face of it, the apparent “good guys” of Space Marine 2’s story have lobotomized babies cleaning up their mess. Sound messed up? Welcome to Warhammer 40,000’s Imperium of Man, a fascist regime always on the brink of extinction and an extreme vision of the far future in which pretty much anything goes.</p><p>Warhammer 40,000 is intended to be grim and dark, and so stuff like this is par for the course (lobotomized babies aren't close to being the most disturbing thing in the setting, if you fancy some light reading, check out what the Drukhari get up to in their spare time). Space Marine 2's far future is a truly miserable place to be, a place in which countless humans die every day from all manner of horrors, be those alien, demon, or humans themselves. Humanity, bogged down by excruciating bureaucracy and religious fanaticism, has collapsed. There is no respite, no joy, only inevitable death.</p><p>With that in mind, Warhammer 40,000 fans are used to things like a “lobotomized church menial cyborg flying baby,” as X/Twitter user ChronoTheHarlequin pointed out. The thing is, with this one in particular, it gets even weirder.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Seeing tweets like these kinda make me realize how numb I’ve gotten to the weird shit in 40k.</p><p>“Lobotomized church menial cyborg flying baby” isn’t something I’d even flinch at now <a href="https://t.co/YcLQdGCQlC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/YcLQdGCQlC</a></p></div>— ChronoTheHarlequin (@ChronoHarlequin) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChronoHarlequin/status/1833620971833725268?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 10, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>As the unofficial Warhammer podcast Adeptus Ridiculous clarified, <em>most</em> of these things aren’t actually lobotomized babies. Most are built from the ground(?) up as flesh automatons with computers for brains (A.I is banned in the 40th millennium because of... reasons). Why do they look like babies? Apart from Warhammer 40,000 being all heavy metal and gothic, according to the lore, it’s for “ceremonial purposes.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Don't worry, most of them are not actually lobotomized babies, most are built from scratch as flesh automatons with computers for brains and just made to look like babies for ceremonial purposes.</p><p>Most of them. <a href="https://t.co/F0hTIhOvHz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/F0hTIhOvHz</a></p></div>— Adeptus Ridiculous (@AdRidiculous) <a href="https://twitter.com/AdRidiculous/status/1833809442116129267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>I’m loving Space Marine 2 and its attention to detail. The developers at Saber clearly love Warhammer 40,000 and made the effort to capture its oppressive, soul destroying atmosphere. I’ve particularly enjoyed the flavor dialogue you hear from the humans who are charged with keeping the Battle Barge afloat. Some bemoan a lack of sleep because of how hard they’re forced to work. Others express concern at the prospect of making even a single mistake. Given the truly miserable galaxy in which they live, these chaps are the lucky ones. And don’t get me started on the servitors.</p><p>We’ve got plenty more Space Marine 2 coverage, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-to-get-ultrawide-support-private-pve-lobbies-and-more-in-first-patch">details of its first patch</a>, its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-post-launch-roadmap-includes-new-maps-a-horde-mode-and-more">post-launch roadmap</a>, and the upcoming addition of class matching for co-op, after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-players-having-awkward-pre-mission-standoffs-because-two-of-the-same-class-cant-play-together"><u>players found themselves locked in a class standoff ahead of Operations mode missions</u></a>.</p><p><em>Image credit: Games Workshop.</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>If the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">recently-announced PS5 Pro</a> is a little too pricey for you but you have been looking to get your hands on a PlayStation 5 at some point, there is a significantly cheaper option on the horizon.</p>
<p>Sony is primed to start selling refurbished PS5 consoles, which it promises will be "as good as new" (although the company does note its refurbished products "may have minor cosmetic imperfections").</p>
<p>While the PS5 Pro is retailing at £700 without the disk drive and vertical stand, these refurbished consoles will sell for £390, as per the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/certified-refurbished?clickref=1100lzz6eob4&amp;emcid=ot-ps-456951">PlayStation website</a>.</p>

<p>On their release, buyers will "receive a product that works like new with genuine PlayStation replacement parts (as needed) that has been thoroughly cleaned, inspected and tested", Sony said.</p>
<p>The refurbished PS5s will come with all of the console's "necessary" accessories, as well as cables and manuals. These will all be packed up in "their own branded Certified Refurbished packaging". In addition, these refurbished PS5s will come with a 12-month manufacturer’s warranty.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, a shipping date for these particular PS5s hasn't been revealed, but we will update you when we hear more.</p>

<p>As for the PS5 Pro, following its reveal noteable games analyst Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis said he expects the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-pro-sales-will-follow-similar-trajectory-to-ps4-pro-analyst-predicts">PS5 Pro's sales to follow a very similar trend to those of the PS4 Pro</a>, even with that rather high price tag.</p>
<p>Last night, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-pro-upgrade-patches-for-around-40-or-50-games-at-launch-this-november">Sony reportedly confirmed "about 40 or 50 or games" will get PS5 Pro upgrade patches</a> when the console launches on 7th November.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-already-has-over-130000-concurrent-players-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immense success</a> of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, it makes sense that so many people have their sights set on additional content. The campaign, at approximately 10 hours, doesn’t take long. The PvE and PvP modes prove most entertaining, but for how long? More is coming, though. Here’s everything you need to know about the Space Marine 2 Season Pass!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-the-space-marine-2-season-pass-offer">What Does the Space Marine 2 Season Pass Offer?</h2>



<p>We’ve discussed this previously, but the free updates coming to Space Marine 2 look more enticing than the paid content. There’s nothing wrong with cosmetics, as they help fund future development without splitting the community, but the Season Pass for Space Marine 2 looks somewhat lacking. Here’s what you’ll get:</p>

<li><strong>Dark Angels (Season 2)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Champion Pack</li>

<li>Weapon Skin Pack</li>

<li>Weapon Skin Pack</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Chapter Pack (Season 4)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Champion Pack</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>There are currently no hints as to which Space Marine chapters we’ll receive during Seasons 3 and 4. I suspect Saber intends to gauge community interest before pulling the trigger on any specific chapters or units, though.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-space-marine-2-season-pass">How Much is the Space Marine 2 Season Pass?</h2>



<p>Previously, you couldn’t buy the Space Marine 2 Season Pass separately, as it was an additional bonus for purchasing the Gold or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/whats-included-space-marine-2-ultra-edition-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultra Editions</a> of the game. However, now that the title is out in the world, developer Saber Interactive lists the Season Pass for <strong>$39.99</strong>.</p>



<p>You can buy it as an add-on for the game.</p>



<p>Is the Season Pass worth $39.99? Well, that’s entirely up to you. But know that it’s primarily cosmetic items, with most of the major content coming as part of the free year-one updates.</p>



<p>If you want to discuss Space Marine 2 with like-minded players, Insider Gaming recently launched its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums</a> where you can join the discussions daily!</p>

<p>The PS5 Disc Drive is selling out at online retailers. </p>



<p>After the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal of the PS5 Pro</a> on Tuesday, it was made clear that in order to get a disc drive for the new console, you’d have to purchase the external drive. Since then, as spotted online by <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1833867035031269754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>, the peripheral has been selling out everywhere.</p>



<p>As of writing, the drive is #8 on Amazon’s best sellers for video games. On Best Buy’s website, you can’t even order the drive anymore as it’s currently sold out. It is still available on sites like Target, Walmart, and PS Direct.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The external PS5 Disc Drive was made available when the new PS5 Slim consoles were announced and released in 2023. Moving forward, it seems clear that it you want to play physical media on your consoles, you’ll have to by an add-on rather than having a default option.</p>



<p>Currently, it retails for $79.99. With the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-ps5-pro-will-cost-200-more-than-base-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$700 price tag</a> of the PS5 Pro, you are looking at $800+ after taxes for the mid-gen upgrade from Sony.</p>



<p>What do you think of the disc drive currently selling out at retailers? Let us know in the comments or join the discussion in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new community forum</a>!</p>

                <p>GameStop has reported earnings for the quarter that ended on August 3, and, to the surprise of some, the retailer has turned a profit. Despite that, GameStop's stock price is sliding--it's down 15% today--due to a downturn in sales and ongoing uncertainty about how GameStop can stay relevant and healthy long term.</p><p>For the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638024000109/gme-20240803.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">quarter</a>, GameStop sales slid from $1.164 billion to $798 million. Despite that, GameStop posted a net income of $14.8 million, which was a marked improvement over the company's $2.8 million loss for the same period a year ago.</p><p>GameStop's selling, general, and administrative (SG&amp;A) costs for the period amounted to $270.8 million, compared to $322.5 million during the same period last year.</p><p>GameStop said the decline in SG&amp;A costs were primarily attributable to the company's ongoing cost-reduction plan, which has included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-confirms-more-layoffs-share-price-tumbles-after-sales-slide/1100-6522189/" data-ref-id="1100-6522189">layoffs</a> and scale-downs in multiple areas of the business, like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-informer-is-shutting-down-after-33-years/1100-6525508/" data-ref-id="1100-6525508">closure of Game Informer after 33 years</a>. GameStop also saved money in the past quarter by closing stores.</p><p>The bulk of GameStop's revenue came from hardware and accessories, which came in at $451.2 million (down from $597 million), with software ($207.7 million, down from $397 million), and collectibles ($139.4 million, down from $169.8 million) making up the rest.</p><p>At the end of the quarter, GameStop had $4.204 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.</p><p>Despite GameStop turning a profit, GameStop's stock price is down significantly following the announcement of the results, presumably due in part to the sliding sales numbers and a lack of faith from investors that the company can turn things around.</p><p>GameStop said part of its plan for the future is to make sure the company is a "fast and convenient" place for people to shop. GameStop said it will do this by increasing inventory, fulfilling orders more quickly, and improving customer service. GameStop also noted that achieving profitability is another one of its goals, following years of losses--and the company has now achieved that. Third, GameStop said said the GameStop name has "strong household brand recognition" and a large network of physical stores, and this could be a key driver for growth in the future.</p><p>"We believe these efforts are important aspects of our continued business to enable long-term value creation for our shareholder," the company said.</p><p>Finally, GameStop said it plans to close a large number of stores going forward as the company aims to "eliminate redundancies and underperforming assets."</p><p>"While this review is ongoing and a specific set of stores has not been identified for closure, we anticipate that it may result in the closure of a larger number of stores than we have closed in the past few years," GameStop said.</p><p>For context, GameStop said in March this year that it closed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-confirms-more-layoffs-share-price-tumbles-after-sales-slide/1100-6522189/" data-ref-id="1100-6522189">287 stores worldwide in the past fiscal year and now has 4,169 stores.</a></p><p>Following the "short-squeeze" situation in 2021 that saw GameStop's stock price massively surge, GameStop's new management, including CEO Ryan Cohen, announced a plan to make GameStop profitable again, something that the company has now achieved. GameStop was also planning a push into the NFT and crypto markets, but those didn't pan out and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-gives-up-on-crypto-after-one-year/1100-6516582/" data-ref-id="1100-6516582">the company's investments in those spaces have come to an end.</a></p><p>Despite GameStop's share price sliding this week, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gme+nyse&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=gme+nyse&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCQgAEEUYOxiABDIJCAAQRRg7GIAEMgcIARAAGIAEMggIAhAAGBYYHjIICAMQABgWGB4yCAgEEAAYFhgeMggIBRAAGBYYHjIICAYQABgWGB4yCAgHEAAYFhgeMggICBAAGBYYHjIICAkQABgWGB6oAgCwAgA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameStop's stock price remains up more than 1,700% in the past five years.</a></p>

			<p>The latest update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-ark-player-numbers-dropped-due-to-massive-bot-ban-wave-community-is-largely-happy/">Lost Ark</a>, titled "Chase the Storm," with maintenance for the patch lasting a whopping 8 hours from 12 AM PT / 3 PM ET / 8 PM BST onwards, adding new events to the game that will help players progress towards Tier 4, as well as the latest threat that players will have to contend with. For those who prefer their <a href="https://www.playlostark.com/en-us/game/releases/chase-the-storm#ags-MediaPopup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a> in video form, the Lost Ark YouTube video channel has a 13-minute video that details all of the patch notes and how they will affect the players.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Ark: Patch Notes with Henry, Chase the Storm" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/liCrDS5vqew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Behemoth is the latest threat that players will have to worry about when participating in the new raid. Behemoth is the Chaos Guardian and a follower of Varkan who is seen as a symbol of fear after killing many in Kurzan. The 16-player raid will allow players to get their hands on honing materials and Weapon Transcendence. The raid will be far from easy, with only eight revives available, requiring an Item Level of 1620.</p>
<p>As stated above, Weapon Transcendence is a new feature that is added into the game, introduced specifically through the Behemoth raid. Weapon Transcendence is similar to Armor Transcendence, but utilizes materials that you can only get from the Behemoth Raid. This allows players to improve the basic effects of their weapons. To be able to transcend your weapons, you will go to the same vendor as the Armor Transcendence. You'll be able to access Weapon Transcendence after you have cleared Gate 1 of Behemoth, with higher levels of Transcendence being available after clearing Gate 2.</p>

<p>September has plenty of events going on and new content for players to dive into, with a Prelude Quest to the Behemoth Raid being available, as well as an Afterstory Questline for players to complete. In addition, there are 14 new achievements and two new trophies to get your hands on as well.</p>
<p>To help players progress through Lost Ark's September update, a new mission-based Progression event has arrived in the update to help players boost their characters from Item Level 1600 to 1620, which is an important milestone if you want to join the Behemoth raid as well as Tier 4 in October. In total, there are three mission categories that you can participate in that will help you gear up. They are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Honing Akkan gear</li>
<li>Clearing Ivory Tower</li>
<li>Clearing Thaemine Gates</li>
</ul>
<p>There is plenty more content for players to dive into, such as the returning events of Arktoberfest and Blooming Mokokos, which happens every year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-deadrop-layoffs-dr-disrespect<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Midnight Society, the studio co-founded by disgraced YouTuber Dr. Disrespect, has announced "significant" layoffs in response to what it calls "multiple unexpected challenges in recent months".</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/3-months-after-firing-dr-disrespect-deadrop-developer-midnight-society-confirms-significant-layoffs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to PC Gamer</a>, a Midnight Society rep said that in order to "adapt to these changes and secure the future of Midnight Society", as well as its debut title&nbsp;<em>Deadrop</em>, a "significant workforce reduction" was necessary. The rep doesn't confirm exactly how many people have been laid off.</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;<em>Deadrop&nbsp;</em>content creator and Midnight Society Founder (that's Founder with a capital F; it's a confusing bit of jargon on the studio's part) <a href="https://x.com/JOK5RR/status/1833294762054455379" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jok5rr</a>, "roughly 50%" of Midnight Society's dev team was hit by the cuts. That's a very significant reduction indeed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/midnight-society-deadrop-layoffs.jpg?itok=9-A0l6aA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/midnight-society-deadrop-layoffs.jpg?itok=VOFVDIqm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Midnight Society is currently working on&nbsp;<em>Deadrop</em>, but layoffs might impact the game's development.</figcaption></figure><p>The Midnight Society rep told PC Gamer that despite the layoffs and "challenges" the studio is facing, Midnight Society remains "dedicated to launching&nbsp;<em>Deadrop&nbsp;</em>in 2025".</p>
<p>While Midnight Society doesn't explicitly name the challenges it's talking about, it's pretty much certain that at least one of them relates to the downfall of Dr. Disrespect, who was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dr-disrespect-fired-midnight-society-sexting-minor">fired from the studio in June</a> following allegations of sexting a minor.</p>
<p>As PC Gamer points out,&nbsp;<em>Deadrop&nbsp;</em>is pretty closely linked to Dr. Disrespect, real name Guy Beahm; it adopts his 80s-inspired cyberpunk-style aesthetic, and some of the game's in-game text references Beahm's catchphrases.</p>
<p>Midnight Society co-founder Robert Bowling says that he and the studio will be sharing their "revised plans and milestones" soon, so we'll get to see how these layoffs have impacted the development of&nbsp;<em>Deadrop&nbsp;</em>before long.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dr.-disrespect-midnight-society-deadrop.jpg?itok=GW5EZiYA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dr.-disrespect-midnight-society-deadrop.jpg?itok=6Z3UmUIm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The now-disgraced Dr. Disrespect formed a key part of Midnight Society and&nbsp;<em>Deadrop</em>'s messaging.</figcaption></figure><p>Midnight Society's layoffs come against the backdrop of a wider wave that has seen major companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">Sony</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs">Take-Two</a> swept up in it, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-developer-singularity-6-layoffs">many</a> smaller <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs">studios</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, the&nbsp;<em>Deadrop</em>&nbsp;developer's case is a somewhat special one given the controversy surrounding Beahm and the allegations against him, but nevertheless, these layoffs are part of a wider pattern. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/">was announced on Tuesday</a>, and it has gotten a wide range of feedback. From people being excited about what in can do to others frustrated over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the large price increase</a>, there’s no shortage of opinions. The big question, however, is how will the PS5 Pro sell on the market?</p>



<p>According to one analyst <a href="https://www.ampereanalysis.com/insight/ps5-pro-sony-pulls-its-pro-strategy-lever-to-engage-playstation-enthusiasts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Ampere Analysis</a>, the PS5 Pro should sell similarly to that of the PS4 Pro.</p>



<p>Piers Harding-Rolls, a games industry analyst at the company, believes that that PS5 Pro will sell around 13 million units by 2029. As far as its launch window, the company thinks that 1.3 million or so consoles will be sold. That prediction puts it just shy of the 1.7 million PS4 Pro consoles sold during its 2016 launch window.</p>



<p>“We expect the price point to soften demand with some consumers, but for PlayStation enthusiasts the pricing is less of a consideration,” he writes.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-the-ps5-pro-price-so-high">Why is the PS5 Pro Price So High?</h2>



<p>As far as that price point of the new system is concerned, Harding-Rolls acknowledges the discourse around the topic. With a 40%-50% increase, he says there are a few reasons for the $699.99 price point.</p>



<p>“PS5 Pro pricing reflects Sony’s adjusted strategy to protect its margin, generally supply chain inflation and a lack of direct competitor to its mid-cycle upgrade compared to last generation (where Microsoft was preparing the Xbox One X),” he said. “The lack of competition means it is an easier decision for Sony to run with a higher price point to protect its existing margins. </p>



<p>“For most prospective PS5 consumers, the standard edition will represent the value sweet spot.”</p>



<p>The PS5 Pro releases on November 7.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Check Out the Space Marine 2 Patch Notes for the New Hotfix]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-patch-notes-hotfix/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/check-out-the-space-marine-2-patch-notes-for-the-new-hotfix.977910/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-patch-notes-hotfix/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It’s always welcome when a developer pays attention to the community and addresses problems within the game. Even one as exciting and excellent as Space Marine 2 isn’t immune to bugs and glitches. But the game’s most recent hotfix solves many issues, including some crashes. So, here are the Space Marine 2 patch notes!</p>



<h2 id="h-full-space-marine-2-patch-notes">Full Space Marine 2 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>The latest Space Marine 2 patch notes are straightforward, solving many of the community’s issues in one sweep!</p>



<p><strong>Crashes and Bug Fixes</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed some rare possible crashes when starting the game</li>



<li>Fixed a rare possible crash that occurred during the first cutscene</li>



<li>Fixed several other rare crashes</li>



<li>Fixed several rare bugs that were causing soft locks in the story mode</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>PC Only</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Optimized CPU behavior on high end CPUs</li>
</ul>



<p>Developer Saber Interactive said, “On top of that first quick fix, we’re preparing a bigger patch for later in September.” The patch they’re talking about includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ultrawide support</li>



<li>Private PvE lobbies</li>



<li>Sparring Arena in the Battle Barge</li>
</ul>



<p>Overall, this hotfix and the one planned for late this month prove rather small but potent. The fixes for the crashes, which plague much of the community, are welcome!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-download-the-hotfix">How to Download the Hotfix</h2>



<p>While your system should automatically download the hotfix the next time you boot up the console or your PC, it doesn’t always work that way. You may need to select the game and manually check for an update.</p>



<p>On Steam, check your Downloads page for an awaiting update. Alternatively, you may need to close and reopen the launcher entirely to force the update through. If that doesn’t work, right-click the game and select Properties, Installed Files, and then verify the integrity of the game files. If there’s an update, it will automatically download for you.</p>



<p>On consoles, select the game and, depending on your system, choose the option to check for recent updates.</p>
