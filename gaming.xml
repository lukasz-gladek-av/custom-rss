            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Professional gaming demands precision and customization that standard controllers simply cannot provide, and <strong>the DualSense Edge addresses these needs with hardware-level adjustments</strong> that competitive players have requested for years. This premium controller takes everything great about the standard DualSense and adds swappable components, remappable buttons, and adjustable sensitivity curves that let you fine-tune performance for specific games or playstyles.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/">Midnight Black edition currently sells for $169 on Amazon, down from its regular $199 price</a>, and <strong>marks an all-time low for Sony’s pro-level controlle</strong>r just before Christmas with <strong>guaranteed holiday delivery</strong>. That 15% discount makes advanced gaming hardware more accessible to serious players who want every possible advantage without spending Xbox Elite controller money.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Personalization That Fits Your Style of Play</h2>
<p>You <strong>can now map back buttons to the bottom of the controller</strong> which changes the way you play games. You can assign actions you use a lot to these buttons. You can assign any face button action, like jump, crouch, or reload, to these back paddles. This way, you can keep your thumbs on the analog sticks when you need to press face buttons. This constant contact with the stick makes it easier to aim in shooters and keeps control of the camera in action games where split-second reactions can change the outcome.</p>
<p>The<strong> replaceable stick modules fix the problem of analog stick drift</strong> that happens to controllers after a lot of use. When the old ones wear out, you can just put in new ones. When sticks start to drift, you have to buy a whole new controller with traditional controllers. With the Edge, you can just replace the worn parts for a lot less money. You can easily switch out the modules without any tools, and Sony sells replacement modules separately so you can keep using them.</p>



<p>You can change how much stick movement counts as input by changing the stick sensitivity and dead zones. This lets you change the response curves to fit your needs and preferences in the game. High sensitivity settings are good for fast-paced shooters where quick camera movements are important. Lower sensitivity settings are better for long-range shooting where accuracy is important. Dead zone adjustments get rid of the unwanted movement that can happen with looser sticks, making it easier to control in competitive play.</p>
<p>The <strong>stick caps that come with it come in three heights and two shapes</strong> so you can pick the ones that fit your hand size and grip style. Taller sticks give you better control because they make your thumb move a longer distance for the same input. This is helpful for precise aiming in tactical shooters. Shorter sticks let you move faster with less thumb travel, which is better for aggressive playstyles in games that need quick changes of direction.</p>



<p>The <strong>trigger stops shorten the distance that L2 and R2 can travel</strong> which lets you fully press the trigger faster for quick firing in shooters. The adjustable stops click into place at different points, and you can change each trigger to fit the needs of the game. Full trigger travel is better for racing games that use analog throttle control, while minimal travel is better for shooters who want to shoot faster.</p>
<p>The Midnight Black colorway gives the Edge a stealthy look that sets it apart from regular controllers while still keeping PlayStation’s clean design style. The matte finish doesn’t show fingerprints as much as glossy plastics, and the high-quality materials feel solid in your hand. Because of the extra electronics, the battery life is shorter than that of standard DualSense controllers. It <strong>usually lasts 5 to 7 hours, depending on how many features you use</strong> which means that you’ll need to keep the charging cable close by during long gaming sessions.</p>
<p>Getting the DualSense Edge for $169 is a great deal because it’s the lowest price this controller has ever been on Amazon and it lets you customize it like a pro. The lowest prices ever make it easier for serious gamers to get pro-level features that they couldn’t afford before.</p>

                <p>Fanatical is closing 2025 out with a new build-your-own bundle deal, the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+25+PC+Games+For+%2464+With+This+New+Fanatical+Deal&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-12-16+15%3A56%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-16+15%3A57%3A04&amp;fnarticle_id=6536985&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbest-of-platinum-collection-build-your-own-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-22-games-for-under-65-at-fanatical%2F1100-6536985%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best of Platinum Collection</a>. This deal offers a selection of various acclaimed PC games featured in the various Platinum Collection bundles throughout 2025, giving you a chance to pick up some excellent games for cheap. Like Fanatical's other build your own bundle promotions, you can pick as many games from the list as you'd like, and the more games you buy, the more you save. To start, you can pick up to four games for $3.33 each. At five or more games, you'll pay $3 per item. Grab 10 or more games, and you'll pay just $2.90 per game, and if you want the full 22-game bundle, it'll run you $63.78, a $547.75 value--not too shabby for literally thousands of hours of entertainment.</p><p>One of the items you can pick, the SteamWorld Classic Bundle, comes with four games: SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Dig 2, SteamWorld Heist, and SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech. So, really, if you decide to add this to the Best of Platinum Collection, it could be a total of 25 games. The list of possible games also includes the strategy game SteamWorld Build as another pick, in case you want to load up on even more of the series.</p><p>With season 2 of the Fallout TV show looming, now's the perfect time to explore the open-world RPGs that inspired the show with Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition and Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition. Both are available as part of the Best of Platinum Collection. These versions include the full base games plus every update, add-on, and DLC expansion. You can round out the selection with Fallout 76, which is an online multiplayer take on the series--though it still offers the same open-ended, first-person exploration and RPG gameplay as the other games. It also recently received a new Burning Springs DLC update that ties into the Amazon Prime Video streaming series.</p><p>For you horror fans, one of the biggest highlights of the Platinum Collection is the inclusion of Amnesia: The Bunker. The Amnesia games are some of the most tense, atmospheric, and terrifying survival horror games to be found in the genre, and getting it at this price is a steal.</p><p>Plenty of other games are available in Fanatical's Platinum Collection, including the narrative-driven RPG Disco Elysium: The Final Cut, the hidden FPS gem RoboCop: Rogue City, the Lego-themed puzzle game Lego Bricktales, and more. Check out the full list below.</p><h2>Fanatical Best of Platinum Collection: Build Your Own Bundle (2025)</h2><ul><li>Amnesia: The Bunker</li><li>Botany Manor</li><li>Disco Elysium: The Final Cut</li><li>Doom (2016)</li><li>Dungeon Tycoon</li><li>Dysmantle</li><li>Edge of Sanity</li><li>Endless Alice</li><li>Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition</li><li>Fallout 76</li><li>Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition</li><li>Gestalt: Steam &amp; Cinder</li><li>The Isletide Hotel</li><li>LEGO Brick Tales</li><li>Mini Settlers</li><li>Neon Garten</li><li>The Pale Beyond</li><li>Paradise Killer</li><li>Reveil</li><li>RoboCop: Rogue City</li><li>SteamWorld Build</li><li>SteamWorld Classic Bundle</li></ul><p>If none of these games are quite your bag or you're after something different, there are plenty of other bundle deals through Fanatical.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you’ve not come across it yet, Songs of Silence is one of the most beautiful fantasy tactics games you’ll ever see. Originally released in 2024, this hybrid RTS/autobattler – with a smidgen of deckbuilding – boasts some truly incredible art nouveau visual design. Characters, artwork, and the different unit classes, sing out from the screen, blessing you with their stunning, evocative looks. Luckily for us, the beautiful action doesn’t have to finish quite yet, with the huge Celestial Church DLC arriving today, bringing with it a host of much-requested features. </p>
<p><iframe title="Songs of Silence: Celestial Church - Official DLC Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mT-oJ5C8-a8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The and biggest and brightest inclusion is six all-new singleplayer campaign chapters, the six-hour-long additions furthering the story and deepening Songs of Silence’s lore, bringing all that incredible artwork to life in a more meaningful way than ever before. </p>
<p>There’s then the addition of a new faction, the titular Celestial Church, who in turn have brought a host of new units, abilities and cards to bear on the battlefield. I can’t wait to test them all out in the coming days.</p>
<p>The expansion was shaped by recurring community requests for additional story-focused experiences. Throughout its development, Songs of Silence has evolved hand-in-hand with player feedback gathered from open betas, surveys, and daily conversations between the team and the community. It’s not about to stop here either, with Chimera confirming that another expansion is planned for mid-2026, accompanied by numerous additional features that will arrive beforehand.</p>

<p>“Players asked for deeper narrative experiences, and the Celestial Church expansion is our answer to that call,” said Songs of Silence’s Executive Producer, Hendrik Lesser. “We’re excited to keep enriching the game and delivering meaningful content for years to come.”</p>
<p>I loved <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/songs-of-silence-review/">Songs of Silence</a> at launch, and of course, I was utterly taken by the visuals, saying, “Stunning. Few other words immediately describe Songs of Silence. Chimera Entertainment have, before anything else, fashioned a piece of gaming art that looks utterly incredible. This 4X strategic auto-battler does plenty of things differently from its genre peers, but its art nouveau-inspired visuals zing from the screen with the clarity of a fresh lemon. To say it’s refreshing would be an understatement.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Commodore 64 Ultimate is the most astonishing retro product I have ever reviewed. I was expecting it to be a straightforward, modern take on the all-time best-selling personal computer. I imagined it would be a newer version of the C64 Mini or C64 "Maxi," with a selection of games and software built in and accessible through a bespoke menu system. Seriously, I would have been totally fine with a modern C64 that hooks to modern 4K displays and televisions and let me experience the C64 ecosystem on the big screen. And it does that, extremely well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it also does so much more, more than I could have ever imagined it would. Better still, it does all those things amazingly well. From the spot-on design of the packaging down to the perfection of the keyboard in every way, the Commodore 64 Ultimate is the kind of modern take on retro hardware that all future endeavors in the space should aspire to. They won't. But they should.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">What's In the Box</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Commodore 64 Ultimate packaging looks the part of its predecessor, although dimensionally they differ. The original C64 box is a little taller and a little less wide, but otherwise the modern take evokes the exact same feeling as the original right from the packaging. It's an excellent combination of both old and new, listing the modern capabilities of the device while using old-school images of people using the original on CRT displays. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Commodore 64 Ultimate is what all future retro endeavors in should aspire to.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Right on the copy printed on the box, the Commodore 64 Ultimate positions itself as an antidote to the modern computing experience, which I'm completely into. As someone who's been using the Internet since before Netscape was even a thing, I often think back wistfully to how much simpler it was when a computer was a tool you used to create things, not a device that serves you ads. The tagline on the back says "Classic Form. Ultimate Function. Distraction Free." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those of you who weren’t born before 1980, the original Commodore 64 was not only the most successful 8-bit computer of the 1980s, it's the best-selling personal computer of all time. So many Gen-Xers grew up with a Commodore 64 as their first home computer, and if they didn't have one (like me), they knew someone who did. It debuted at $595 in 1982, but within a year, competition had cut the price in half. In the 1984 Sears Holiday Wishbook catalog it's listed at $229.99, while the Coleco Adam just a few pages later is $700. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7217-1765913719515.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The C64 was affordable, well supported, handled business and productivity applications while also having a huge library of games. You could load software from 5.25" floppies, cassette tapes, or cartridges. It was versatile, compact, extremely affordable and available everywhere. It also had a custom sound chip that let the C64 sing, literally, giving it a huge edge. The C64 produced an iconic sound modern chiptune artists like 8-bit Weapon still use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Inside the box is the Commodore 64 Ultimate itself, which is actually available in three different versions. There's the classic beige, a fully transparent and LED-lit model, and a special edition gold translucent version only available for those who backed the device early on. I'm going to get into the design later, but as soon as I opened the box I was struck by just how perfect this is in terms of replicating the look of the original.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7219-1765913719516.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also not one, but two, small, double-sided sheets of Commodore-branded vinyl stickers. The stickers are great. They're high-quality, not garbage paper ones like I would have expected, and it's just another delightful part of the experience. There are a few for the logo, one for the classic "READY" prompt, a tiny tape drive and floppy drive sticker, and more. It's great. I'm going to stick these things everywhere (except for the C64 Ultimate itself, of course).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a transparent plastic AC adapter with different interchangeable plug styles for your region, and a generous 2.5 meter HDMI cable in a Commodore branded bag. The cable itself is not branded, however, which is maybe the only thing I can point to with the C64 Ultimate and say "I wish this were different." The cable itself supports Ethernet over HDMI, for reasons I don't understand, as well as 4K resolution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Underneath it all, nestled in a protective cocoon of bubble wrap, is probably my favorite addition to the C64 Ultimate box: an honest-to-goodness spiral-bound instruction manual just like the original. And it's an ACTUAL instruction manual, too. It's not just a 4-page quick start guide translated into 16 different languages to pad it out. This is an almost 250-page tome of goodness we just don't see anymore.  It's more than just a passing resemblance between the new and the old. Yes, there's a quick start guide, but beyond that, the manual teaches you how to use the Commodore 64 Ultimate in the same way the original manual taught you to use the C64. There's a section on BASIC, the computer programming language so many oldheads like me first learned, as well as Advanced BASIC.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The C64 Ultimate comes with an honest-to-goodness spiral-bound instruction manual.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is probably my favorite thing about the C64 Ultimate: the fact it's a modern version of the old hardware on which I love writing BASIC programs. If you're not familiar with the language, its primary purpose was to make computer programming easier for beginners. In fact, the name BASIC is an acronym for "Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code." No one uses it anymore, not for anything serious. Ask anyone now and they'll tell you to start with Python.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7213-1765913719517.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Well I'm here to say those people are wrong, and BASIC is the perfect place to start. One of the greatest things about having a hardware-indentical version of the original Commodore 64 is all those old magazines and books with page upon page of BASIC code will still work exactly as they were intended. You've probably seen engagement-farming social media accounts talking about how "back in the day" people would copy programs from magazines, by hand, into their computers line by line. Can confirm, we really did. And with the C64 Ultimate we can use those same programs, or just copy and paste them and load them in via USB. I think that's cheating but I'm also not above it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I haven't delved deeply into the world of programming the C64 Ultimate, at least not yet, so I can't speak authoritatively on whether or not there's some string of code somewhere that won't work on the Ultimate. Knowing what little I know about FPGA, I don't think that will ever be a problem I'll come across. The beauty of FPGA versus software emulation is the hardware works exactly like the original. Sure, someone out there writing in assembly might find some peculiarity with the system that wasn't present in the original, but for me? Hell nah, let's get some BASIC code going baby!</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Back in the day people would copy programs from magazines, by hand.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact you're taught BASIC in the manual, and then taught advanced BASIC, as well as sprite and sound manipulation, makes the manual even more of a valuable resource. This is exactly the kind of thing I love, and exactly the way computers used to be. You didn't just buy a computer to passively entertain yourself, you bought one to do rudimentary spreadsheets, play some games, and create your own experiences. I love it. The best thing about learning any computer language is the fundamentals are all pretty much the same. Once you understand if-then statements, or "for" loops in BASIC, you'll understand them in JavaScript, or C#, or pretty much any other language.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7215-1765913719516.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Peripherals, Modern and Classic</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">What was maybe the most surprising revelation to me about the Commodore 64 Ultimate was its support for the original Commodore peripherals. Things like the cassette deck and iconic 1501 floppy disc drive will work with the C64. I don't have the cassette deck, unfortunately, and while I have the floppy drive I don't actually have any floppies with which to test it. The big batch of floppies I picked up earlier this year were all unreadable, so sadly I can't speak to that, at least until I luck my way into another cache, one that hopefully works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What I can say is the C64 Ultimate will work with a classic CRT monitor, and that just makes me all kinds of delighted. Is it more convenient to use it on a modern display? Yes, a thousand percent. Is it more fun? Not even close. Thankfully I have several CRT monitors compatible with the Commodore, including an original Commodore CM-141 monitor I drove two hours into the wilderness of Maine's coast to acquire. Weirdly, the default settings were in PAL and so I had to go in to change them, but once I did, I was absolutely delighted by the CRT-goodness. I don't have the correct cable to use the CM-141, but I do have one that let me hook it to an old Magnavox monitor that has a setting to output in a faux phosphor-green. Can't complain about that! </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7208-1765913719517.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I wish more retro-revival hardware had the option for analog video. I'm sure the people who want such a thing make up a very tiny percentage of the population, but for something as specialized as the Commodore 64 Ultimate, it is a perfect fit. The modern Commodore company sells the proper cables on its website, so I'm probably going to buy some just so I can plink away at my next BASIC program in front of the warm glow of a humming, 13" color CRT TV.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another odd peripheral I have is a Commodore 1670 modem, though the Commodore 64 Ultimate lacks the User Port from the original where it hooks up. Instead, the Ultimate has modern connectivity like Wi-Fi and an Ethernet jack. It’s probably for the best anyway – I've messed around with slow, retro modems on old hardware before and it's fun, but 1200 baud makes even BBSes slow to use. And besides, if I do want that old-school experience, there's modem emulation built into the system anyway. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While having Wi-Fi rules, at first I couldn't get the Wi-Fi to work. I entered in my Wi-Fi password and waited for a while, tried it again, rebooted and tried one more time and it never showed the "Link Up" message on the Wi-Fi configuration page. It wasn't until after I hooked it to a wired connection that it decided to come to life, after which I was able to disconnect from the Ethernet cable and have it maintain its wireless connection. Not sure if that was just a coincidence or a weird bug, but it gave me a brief jolt of disappointment.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7216-1765913719517.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm also sadly lacking in C64 game cartridges, which is a bummer since the Commodore 64 Ultimate can play those, natively, through the expansion port in the back of the computer. But since it can run those carts, it can easily run ROM files, ones that you of course own legally or are provided from reputable, legal sources. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Spot-On Design</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Commodore 64 Ultimate is indistinguishable from the original at first glance. Everything about it looks and feels exactly the same as the original. The beige case and brown keyboard is fantastically reproduced from the original, for better or for worse. It's not until you take a closer look do you start to notice the differences, with the modern ports, a transparent window on the side and a much smaller port for the AC adapter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Commodore 64 logo badge on the top? Perfect. The red LED power light? Flawless. The keyboard? OK, like I said before, absolute perfection – for better or for worse. Let me explain myself.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7207-1765913719516.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Typing on the Commodore 64 Ultimate gives you the exact same tactile feel of the original. The key travel is perfect, the "clunk" of the switches, even the subtle texture of the plastic feels exactly like the original. It's just fantastic. I think my love of modern mechanical keyboards can be directly traced back to this era of computing, and the feel is wonderful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeping with the original in every possible way, however, is going to require you to unlearn some of the modern keyboard placements you've been using since things settled down to a standard layout. This isn't a fault with the design, it's unfortunately a byproduct of keeping things so perfectly retro. I find myself struggling with some of the key placement, like where the double-quotes are (they're over the 2-key, by the way). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the C64 is the computer you grew up on, your muscle memory might come back to you easily. But otherwise, there's a little more hunting-and-pecking here than I've done in years. It's not a fault of the design at all, and it can't be avoided, but it's just something that you'll definitely experience when you shift from the modern keyboard layout burned into your brain. And I wouldn't want it any other way.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7206-1765913719516.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">One major, positive design change is the power supply. The original C64 power supply was a brick almost literally, and pretty much every original C64 power supply is waiting to someday blast the original hardware with an overvoltage that will run it. The new one is cased in transparent plastic and doesn't take up half your desk like the original monster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It plugs in right next to the multifunction button, a rocker-style switch that turns the Commodore 64 Ultimate on and off and lets you switch to the special configuration menu. It took a little more effort than I was expecting, and it's just a touch too small for my large hands. Turning off the Commodore 64 Ultimate requires you to push down and hold for 4 seconds, and I don't like that. More than once, I thought I'd activated the button, but was instead standing there like an idiot with the button 90% pressed for 10 seconds. Given the change of configuration of slots and peripherals, I would have liked a two-position switch for power and a momentary switch to go between C64 and configuration modes. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Software </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In keeping with the retro-modernity of the Commodore 64 Ultimate, there's a USB stick in the shape of a cassette tape, complete with cassette case, included in each box. You plug it into a very modern USB port in the back and then access it via the configuration menu in a very old school, hierarchical file system type of way.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7209-1765913719516.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The software on the drive is generous, to say the least. There is so much here, it's overwhelming. Rather than go through every single included piece of software (which I wouldn't mind doing, honestly), I'm going to touch on some of the more notable programs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But before I do that, I'm going to shout out a feature they didn't need to include, but they did anyway: when you start up a program from the file browser, the Commodore 64 Ultimate starts whirring and clicking, with the occasional buzz for good measure. It's making the sounds you would expect from a program loading from a floppy disc and it's absolutely wonderful. When I was a kid using computers, I loved the feedback of those mechanical drives. I always felt like I was listening to the computer "think." This little feature adds so much to the experience, in a way I didn't expect at all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to the software, there are dozens of demos on the USB drive, and not the ones we're all used to. The demo scene, while still around, is a pale reflection of its former self. Basically, programmers and hackers would flex their skills by creating demonstrations of their programming prowess. They would push machines to do things that didn't seem possible with custom animations and music, and you can see some of them here. One of the most notable and well-known demos is Bad Apple, presented here as Bad Apple 64. The Commodore 64 Christmas Demo is also on the USB, which is delightful. I'm nothing if not full of holiday cheer.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/img-7218-1765913719517.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a huge selection of games on the USB, but maybe my favorite addition here is GEOS, a graphical user interface designed specifically for the Commodore 64. While I don't see myself switching from macOS to GEOS any time soon, it's so cool to see this rudimentary GUI running on original hardware. Unfortunately I can't locate my compatible Commodore 64 mouse, but there are still dedicated hobbyists out there making them in our modern times, and Commodore sells compatible devices on its own site.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's so cool to see a rudimentary GUI running on original hardware.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm a little surprised you can't use a modern USB mouse, which would have been much easier for the end-user. I don't think it would have taken anything away from the experience, either. In fact I'd argue it would enhance it, given most people own at least one USB mouse but very few people own compatible Commodore mice. I dug through the various menus and didn't find any options, but if there's a way, please let me know. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/geos-1765917516379.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm mildly obsessed with different GUIs, and will take any opportunity to try them out, so I'll probably scour eBay for a mouse, especially because it also has a whole suite of GEOS software. If I really wanted to (and I do), I have the option to hook up a Commodore printer and print off my own beautiful GEOSPaint creations, or I can use the Virtual Printer and save generated files to the USB as .pngs. From there I can just open it on a modern computer and print it from there. And friends, best believe I'm going to be doing that once I get a compatible mouse.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/commodore-64-ultimate-review]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-solix-c1000-at-record-low-for-christmas-on-amazon-charge-10-devices-with-2000w-output-at-once-2000653967</link>
            <guid>1385452</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When storms knock out power in the winter, portable power stations are very important because you need backup power for heating, medical devices, or just to stay connected in case of an emergency. The <strong>Anker Solix C1000</strong> (Gen 2) fixes the main problems with older portable power stations by charging much faster and giving off more power.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/">newer model is now $371 on Amazon, down from its regular price of $549</a> and it is close to the lowest price ever, just before Christmas when power outages caused by bad weather become more common. The <strong>32% discount makes it easy to get serious backup power</strong> without having to deal with the hassle and cost of installing whole-home generators.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Charging Speed That Makes All the Difference</h2>
<p>When you plug the HyperFlash technology into a wall outlet, it <strong>recharges the whole 1,024Wh battery in just 49 minutes</strong> and it changes how you use portable power stations during long power outages. Traditional models take 6 to 8 hours to fully charge, which means you have to carefully ration power or risk running out at important times. This unit, on the other hand, lets you charge it up during short power restoration periods: If the power goes out for a short time, you can drain the battery that powers important devices and then fully charge it during a one-hour lunch break.</p>



<p>With a <strong>continuous output of 2,000W and a surge capacity of 3,000W</strong>, it can easily handle most power tools and household appliances. The 1<strong>0 ports include AC outlets, USB-A ports, USB-C ports, and a car outlet</strong> and you can use all of them at the same time to run your refrigerator, space heater, coffee maker, and phone charger. The 3,000W surge rating can handle the spike that motors make when appliances first turn on, so your refrigerator compressor won’t shut down when it starts up or your circular saw won’t stop spinning when it starts up.</p>



<p>The <strong>LiFePO4 battery chemistry can be charged 4,000 times before it drops to 80% capacity</strong> which means that you can use it every day for about 10 years before you notice a big drop in capacity. Lithium iron phosphate batteries work better in extreme temperatures than regular lithium-ion cells. They keep working in hot summer cars and cold winter garages, where other types of batteries have trouble.</p>
<p>When the power goes out,<strong> the under-10ms UPS switchover time keeps sensitive electronics</strong> like CPAP machines, computers, and networking equipment running without a hitch. When the power goes out, traditional power stations take hundreds of milliseconds to find the problem and switch to battery power. This can cause computers to restart or medical devices to sound an alarm.</p>
<p>Getting the Solix C1000 Gen 2 for $371 is a great deal because you get advanced charging technology and a lot of storage space for almost half the regular price. The almost-record discount makes professional-grade backup power affordable for families that couldn’t afford to buy generators before. The timing is perfect because it’s right before winter storm season, so you can get ready before you really need it. This Christmas deal is too good to pass up for anyone who needs backup power or off-grid capabilities.</p>

Along with decorative shapes along the edges, the top of the machine has a circus sign flanked by a buildable clown display figure, a rabbit in a magician's black top hat, and balloons.</p></div>                      </div><h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FPF8CCB1,B0C98D1PXL,B0D4Q2V1VP,B0FDVGLVPL,B0D8T6BKL2,B0CB1D2NK8,B0BPD1RRGY,B0DSH2KRRY,B0F2F8BGYJ,B0FQBZJ431,B0CJLPY88R,B0FJLQ6PJH,B0DZ6HWWMZ,B0F733M7R4,B0F7FP2HKT,B0FJ26MF4G,B0FKBFBLCR,B0FKBGKPQ7,B0F7FP2HKT,B0F4D95RN2,B0CGZTGTXC,B0F32N2W6P,B0FJ22PFBH,B0F9PC1DZ4,B0F9PC2TZ8,B0FJ25VWP4,B0CLQ6J936,B0CJVK8CSQ,B0DQL5RYZ2,B0FVM4YWV8,B0FVM6WH1D,B0DCZB4YWD,B0DCZ9XK1F,B0DCZ6NK5P,B0DCYR1JR5,B0D9Y68ZX4,B0D9YD3GVM,B0DMXLBWNM,B0D2JFC2FV,B0C4LC62LS&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">More Pantasy Building Set Deals at Amazon</a></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4624318-pantasybricksets.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624318" data-ratio="0.36271186440678" data-width="1475" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4624318-pantasybricksets.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624318"></a><figcaption>iGame Gaming PC / Astro Boy / Gumball Machine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4624318-pantasybricksets.png"></figure><p>Here's a list of the tech-focused Pantasy sets on sale right now, including the awesome <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PANTASY-Astro-Building-Mechanical-Clear/dp/B0FDVGLVPL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Astro Boy robot figure</a>.

                <p>The Deciphering the Data quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> sends you to Spaceport to check out some Magnetic Decryptors, and finding exactly where they're located can be a bit of a challenge. However, you've come to the right place, as we'll tell you exactly where you can find both locations you need to interact with to complete this quest from Shani.</p><p>You won't need to extract to complete Deciphering the Data--but we recommend you run a free kit either way, as you may come across other raiders working on the quest, too, and you wouldn't want to risk losing your gear if a fight breaks out while you're busy exploring.</p><p>When you're ready to take on Deciphering the Data, follow the steps below.</p><h2>How to complete Deciphering the Data in Arc Raiders</h2><p>The first step of Deciphering the Data sends you to the Fuel Control building, which is located on the northeastern portion of the Spaceport map. This building is very dark inside, so don't be afraid to turn on your flashlight if needed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624313-share_20251216_0918501.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624313" data-ratio="0.562524500196" data-width="2551" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624313-share_20251216_0918501.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624313"></a><figcaption>Fuel Control building location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624313-share_20251216_0918501.jpeg"></figure><p>In the main (very dark) room, you'll find a ton of computer terminals. Along the southeast wall is a different kind of machine that you can interact with to use the Magnetic Decryptor. This will provide you with a new objective, tasking you with visiting the Arrival Building.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624315-share_20251216_0957592.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624315" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624315-share_20251216_0957592.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624315"></a><figcaption>Decypher the data at this machine.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624315-share_20251216_0957592.jpeg"></figure><p>The Arrival Building is located on the northwestern side of the map, so you'll have to cross some open space to reach it efficiently. Be careful doing so, as some raiders like to try to snipe folks running out that way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624312-share_20251216_0918490.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624312" data-ratio="0.5628295254833" data-width="2276" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624312-share_20251216_0918490.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624312"></a><figcaption>Arrival Building location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624312-share_20251216_0918490.jpeg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the Arrival Building, head upstairs to the top level. Here, against the north by northwest wall will be another set of machines. These look a bit different than the one you toyed with back at the Fuel Control building, but they'll get the job done just the same.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624310-share_20251216_0957560.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624310" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624310-share_20251216_0957560.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624310"></a><figcaption>Decypher the data at these machines.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624310-share_20251216_0957560.jpeg"></figure><p>Now that the quest is complete, you can leave via any of the elevators that are still functioning. They're all equally prone to have extraction campers, especially if you did this quest at night, but you should be fine as long as you find a safe spot to wait things out and keep your eyes and ears peeled. Don't forget to turn the quest in when you get back to Speranza.</p><p>For more on Arc Raiders, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-guides-hub/1100-6536157/" data-ref-id="1100-6536157">comprehensive guides hub</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In 2024, Nacon Studio Milan confirmed that its multiplayer co-op game, Terminator: Survivors, would <a href="https://wccftech.com/terminator-survivors-has-been-delayed-to-2025/">no longer be released that year as previously planned</a>, and would instead arrive on PC and consoles sometime in 2025. Now, with a little more than two weeks left in 2025, Nacon Studio Milan <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2617340/view/624439505179377725">has confirmed</a> that Terminator: Survivors has been delayed and will not be released in 2025.</p>



<p>The news comes from a post on the game's Steam page, where the developer outlines its goals with Terminator: Survivors, and not only confirms its delay, but also confirms that it has made a major change in direction. Terminator: Survivors will no longer include a co-operative multiplayer component, and will now be an entirely single-player game.</p>



<p>Nacon Studio Milan also confirms that the game will no longer launch as an early access title, and will instead launch in its full 1.0 state whenever it is ready, sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>"<em>Our aim with Terminator: Survivors has always been to bring you an authentic and immersive open-world Terminator experience that recreates the harsh reality of Skynet's uprising, and the resilience of humanity in spite of it</em>," the post reads. <em>"After months of internal testing, discussions with players and fans of the license, we cam to the conclusion that to give you an authentic 'Terminator' experience with the best possible shooting and exploration gameplay, we would have to put aside the cooperative multiplayer."</em></p>



<p>"<em>We know this may come as a disappointment, but we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgement Day. We've also had to overhaul our release plans, instead of launching in early access, we want your first steps into the wasteland to be a complete and polished experience.</em> <em>You might have guessed already, but that means Terminator: Survivors won't be launching in 2025. We don't have a new date locked in, but we'll let you know when we're ready to share a new release date</em>."</p>



<p>Considering the fact that we went the whole year up until now without hearing from Nacon Studio Milan on Terminator: Survivors, the news of the delay wasn't exactly surprising, but the rest of it certainly is. You don't expect to hear about a game like this changing direction in a serious way, partly through development.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how players react to it once they get it in their hands, and to see if we'll be able to decipher what elements of the final game may have been left over from its previous approach to the Nacon Studio Milan took all the way through to the game's launch. </p>



<p>In the meantime, if you're really hankering for a Terminator game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/terminator-2d-no-fate-delayed-once-again-still-launch-in-2025/">Terminator 2D: No Fate was able to get out the door before the end of 2025</a>, and launched on PC and consoles just a few days ago.</p>

<article>

  
    

  
  <div>
      <div><p>Mark Rosewater has released a sneak peek at the next <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> set. The new <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> teaser has provided tiny snippets of information regarding the set's new cards, creature types, and gameplay mechanics. Here is what was revealed.</p><p>Like all prior glimpses behind the curtain, the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Lorwyn Eclipsed teaser was revealed through a post on Rosewater's <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/markrosewater/803004920167120896/maros-lorwyn-eclipsed-teaser-before-previews" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Tumblr account</a>. As is tradition with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-tarkir-dragonstorm-teaser-gives-fans-sneak-peek" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">past sneak peeks</a>, the teaser contains partial information, snippets of game text devoid of context, in four distinct batches. These are designed to give dedicated <em>Magic</em> players a small glimpse at how the new set may change the play dynamics at the table.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-shaman-artwork.jpg?itok=IKl3PFzM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-shaman-artwork.jpg?itok=z9F3vll4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>The first batch reads as follows:</p><div><ul><li><span>A planeswalker that makes Kithkin creature tokens</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Kindred reprints</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Some counters in the set: charge, dream, flying, first strike, indestructible, and lifelink</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Another card in the Thirst for ________ series</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Another card that makes something a Coward</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>A card that tutors every turn</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>A new card that copies triggers</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>A keyword introduced in 2025 returns</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>A number of Lorwyn/Shadowmoor block mechanics have cameos</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Some tokens in the set: 1/1 colorless Shapeshifter, 1/1 blue/black Faerie, 2/2 black and green Elf, 3/3 green Elk, and 3/4 green Treefolk</span></li></ul><p><span>As per usual, some of this information is straightforward. A Planeswalker that makes Kithkin tokens isn't too wild, given the Kithkin are a major race in Lorwyn. The return of certain Lorwyn and Shadowmoor block mechanics is expected as well.</span></p><p><span>But there are some pleasant surprises. Various Kindred cards getting reprinted is sure to delight players who use any color in their decks. There are also some head-turning phrases. A new card that copies triggers is interesting since it can potentially lead to greater multi-card combos, and a returning keyword from 2025 could mean anything.</span></p><p><span>The second batch of the Lorwyn Eclipsed teaser focuses on rules text. For those interested in how this set may shift the meta, this is where a lot of speculation lies. The batch reads as follows:</span></p><ul><li>“As this artifact enters, choose Elemental, Elf, Faerie, Giant, Goblin, Kithkin, Merfolk, or Treefolk.”</li><li>“where X is the difference between its power and toughness.”</li><li>“Counter all spells your opponents control”</li><li>“Spend only to cast spells with a mana value 4 or greater.”</li><li>“If this is the third time this ability has resolved this turn,”</li><li>“This creature enters with six -1/-1 counters.”</li><li>“At the beginning of each end step, if you put a counter on a creature this turn,”</li><li>"You may cast that card without paying its mana cost if the spell’s mana value is less than or equal to the amount of life you gained this turn.”</li><li>“Add X {G} or X {W} where X is the number of other creatures you control.”</li><li>“Double all damage that sources you control of the chosen type would deal.”</li></ul><p>As expected, the rules text covers many different playstyles. Control decks will enjoy just countering all enemy spells. Those who enjoy high-cost cards may enjoy a resource for cards costing four or more. And there is some mechanics around tokens for those who like engines that ramp up.</p><p>Some rules do stand out. Doubling all damage a chosen type deals can potentially lead to novel twists on burn playstyles, and a card that can be played for free based on life gain could mean a new focus on White spells and life gain.</p><p>The third and final batches of the Lorwyn Eclipsed teaser focus on creature types and card names in the set. Those batches read as follows:</p><ul><li>Creature – Kithkin Ranger</li><li>Creature – Elemental Scout</li><li>Creature – Faerie Assassin</li><li>Creature – Noggle Rogue</li><li>Creature – Goblin Sorcerer</li><li>Creature – Ouphe</li><li>Creature – Giant Mercenary</li><li>Creature – Treefolk Cleric</li><li>Creature – Horse Serpent</li><li>Legendary Creature – Elf Faerie Noble</li></ul><div><ul><li><span>Bark of Doran</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Champions of the Perfect</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Chaos Spewer</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Flitterwing Nuisance</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Gilt-Leaf’s Embrace</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Glister Bairn</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Mirrorform</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Moonglove Extractor</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Moonshadow</span></li></ul></div><div><ul><li><span>Scuzzback Scrounger</span></li></ul><p><span>Generally, this batch is full of expected terms for </span><em><span>Lorwyn Eclipsed</span></em><span>. It is a faerie-coded set, so much so it is now </span><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-digital-supplement-lorwyn-first-light-brings-fey-mischief" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><span>part of the Feywild</span></a><span> in </span><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span></em></a>. As such, seeing Faerie Assassins, Elf Faerie Nobles, and Goblin Sorcerors are not surprising. As for the names, they do hold interesting connotations for the rules presented above.</p><p>Lorwyn Eclipsed is set to release worldwide on January 23, 2026.</p></div></div></div>

It can be challenging to round up each location you need to visit, after all, and find out exactly what to interact with in each spot. Luckily, we've got you covered below.</p><p>Keep in mind that you need to complete every step of this quest in a single round. This means that dying before you wrap things up will result in you having to redo the steps next time you load in. However, you do not need to extract to get credit for completion, so once you've finished the quest, dying won't be as big of a deal. We'd still recommend you try to extract, though, of course.</p><p>When you're ready to knock out The Stench of Corruption, follow the steps below.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Reach_the_southwest_lobby_of_the_Departure_Building">Reach the southwest lobby of the Departure Building</a></li><li><a href="#Find_the_staff_locker_room">Find the staff locker room</a></li><li><a href="#Search_the_room_for_any_clues_of_the_saboteur_s_identity">Search the room for any clues of the saboteur's identity</a></li><li><a href="#Reach_the_tunnels_below_the_Spaceport">Reach the tunnels below the Spaceport</a></li><li><a href="#Use_the_key_on_any_Flushing_Terminal_to_override_the_bypass_protocol">Use the key on any Flushing Terminal to override the bypass protocol</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Reach_the_southwest_lobby_of_the_Departure_Building">Reach the southwest lobby of the Departure Building</h2><p>Your first stop is the Departure Building on Spaceport, which can be found near the middle of the map, just west of the Launch Tower.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624282-share_20251216_0911520.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624282" data-ratio="0.56416028815849" data-width="2221" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624282-share_20251216_0911520.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624282"></a><figcaption>Departure Building location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624282-share_20251216_0911520.jpeg"></figure><p>Since you'll be visiting the southwest lobby for the next part of the quest, we'd recommend approaching the building from that direction anyway.</p><h2 id="Find_the_staff_locker_room">Find the staff locker room</h2><p>The staff locker room is located in the southwest lobby on the bottom floor of the Departure Building.

                <p>Retro gaming manufacturer My Arcade launched its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-miniature-arcade-cabinet-coming-soon/1100-6534625/" data-ref-id="1100-6534625">Sonic the Hedgehog Joystick Player</a> last month, and now it's joined by two more diminutive arcade cabinets--the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/My-Arcade-Hedgehog-Console-Portable/dp/B0DSCN9NQD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sonic</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSCQS39K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pac-Man Mighty Players</a>. These are much larger than the existing Sonic Joystick Player, clocking in at around a foot tall and 7 inches wide, making them tiny enough for a countertop but big enough to be comfortable during extended play sessions. They also feature 3.5-inch screens and come with four pre-installed games. If you're interested in adding them to your game room, they're available now at Amazon for $120 each.</p><div title="6537018 - My Arcade Mighty Players" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5278" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6537018 - My Arcade Mighty Players" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/My-Arcade-Hedgehog-Console-Portable/dp/B0DSCN9NQD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/My-Arcade-Hedgehog-Console-Portable\/dp\/B0DSCN9NQD?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/My-Arcade-Hedgehog-Console-Portable/dp/B0DSCN9NQD?tag=gamespot-promos-20">My Arcade Sonic the Hedgehog Mighty Player</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/My-Arcade-Hedgehog-Console-Portable/dp/B0DSCN9NQD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/My-Arcade-Hedgehog-Console-Portable\/dp\/B0DSCN9NQD?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/My-Arcade-Hedgehog-Console-Portable/dp/B0DSCN9NQD?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$120</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p><span>This officially licensed Sega product features a 3.5-inch color display, wood construction with an illuminated marquee, a rechargeable battery offering five hours of playtime, and a tiny control panel with various buttons and a joystick.

These My Arcade Mighty Players are a bit cheaper than the Arcade1Up Countercades and their $150 price tag--however, a few Countercades are currently on sale for $130, making them worth a closer look ahead of the holidays. This includes the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-Class-Ms-PAC-Man-Galaga-Countercade/dp/B0DF3KQXS3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Class of '81 Ms. Pac-Man/Galaga Countercade</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-PAC-Man-Countercade-Classic-Portable-Table-top/dp/B0DJGHWD1G?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pac-Man Countercade</a>.</p><p>The former includes Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, and DigDug, while the latter offers Pac-Man, Super Pac-Man, and Pac-Mania. Both include a 7-inch LCD display (which is quite a bit larger than the 3.5-inch display of My Arcade), so be sure to give them a look while they're on sale.</p><p>Interested in other retro gaming solutions?

            <title><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Expected To Reject Paramount’s Latest Offer, Sticking With Netflix]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-expected-to-reject-paramounts-latest-offer-sticking-with-netflix/</link>
            <guid>1385380</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the latest development in the saga between Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Netflix, and Paramount, it appears that WBD is sticking with its original agreement with Netflix.</p>



<p>According to a new report from Bloomberg, the WBD Board of Directors is planning on telling investors to reject Paramount’s latest bid for the company. The report states that the Board’s decision is based on what they believe to be a better offer from Netflix.</p>







<p>“After deliberating and reviewing the Paramount bid, the Warner Bros. board still views the company’s existing agreement with&nbsp;Netflix Inc.&nbsp;as offering greater value, certainty and terms than what Paramount has proposed,” the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-16/warner-bros-said-to-prep-paramount-rejection-on-funding-terms?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg report</a> (paywall) reads.</p>



<p>WBD and Netflix <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced a deal</a> that would see the Warner side of the company be acquired in a deal worth $82.7 billion in total enterprise value and $27.75 per share. The Paramount proposal, that came after the Netflix deal was announce, was for the entirety of the company for $30 per share. That offer seemingly put the value of the television networks and other aspects of the company at a value of just $2.25 per share, if you want to keep the same $27.75 value of the WBD Streaming &amp; Services side.</p>







<p>The news of the rejection shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Not long after receiving the “hostile” and “unsolicited” offer from Paramount, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/despite-paramount-offer-warner-bros-wont-change-netflix-sale-recommendation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WBD release stated</a> that the board wouldn’t be “modifying its recommendation” of the Netflix deal.</p>



<p>It should be mentioned, however, that just because the Board recommends the Netflix deal be chosen, there is always the possibility that the investors vote otherwise. If the Netflix deal moves forward, however, the streaming giant’s acquisition of Warner Bros. is planned to close after WBD completes its split into two companies in 2026.

                <p>Steam Replay for 2025 is now available, giving players a fun way to look back at their year in gaming. It shows what games you played, how much time you spent playing, and other simple stats from the year. Many platforms now do yearly summaries like this, with Spotify Wrapped starting the trend, and services like YouTube and Twitch followed by showing users what they watched and enjoyed in 2025.</p><p>Valve's Steam Replay covers your playtime from January 1, 2025, through the end of December 14, 2025. This gives players a clear picture of most of their gaming year, and also focuses on their habits--such as how many games they played games with either a keyboard or controller--and highlights their most-played games. This year, I finally really got into games on Steam with Peak and Repo, and I'm still dabbling with Lethal Company.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Steam/status/2001013695598747896" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>It's the most wonderful time of the year - Steam Replay 2025 is now available!</p><p>Take a trip down memory lane and see how many games you played, how much you played per month, and many more fun stats for the year.</p><p>Check out yours (login required): <a href="https://t.co/Zq9vxaFit4" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/Zq9vxaFit4</a>… <a href="https://t.co/SrVS9oNdIP" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/SrVS9oNdIP</a></p></div>  — Steam (@Steam) <a href="https://twitter.com/Steam/status/2001013695598747896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Other gaming platforms have also released their yearly summaries, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-2025-wrap-up-see-how-much-you-played-this-year/1100-6536799/" data-ref-id="1100-6536799">PlayStation posted its yearly wrap-up last week.</a> To see your Steam Replay, you can visit Valve's website or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/login/?redir=replay%2F%3Fsnr%3D1_4_4__118%26snr%3D1_4_4__118&amp;redir_ssl=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">click the Steam Replay banner</a> in the Steam app's store page. It'll be interesting to see how the Steam Machine will affect players next year for those who prefer a more traditional console setup.</p><p>There are a few limits to keep in mind: Steam Replay does not count time played while offline or disconnected from the internet. It also leaves out unreleased games, preloads, prerelease versions, and disabled games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Earlier today Bloomberg's Jason Schreier published an<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI&amp;leadSource=uverify+wall&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>interview</u></a><u> </u>with Swen Vincke, the CEO of Larian, the company behind the internet's favourite video game and demonic relationship simulator <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>. It could not have gone worse for the guy.</p><p>Among all the expected pre-release interview talk about how their next game, <em>Divinity</em>, will be making all kinds of improvements over their last game, there was this:</p><blockquote>Under Vincke, Larian has been pushing hard on generative AI, although the CEO says the technology hasn’t led to big gains in efficiency. He says there won’t be any AI-generated content in<em>&nbsp;Divinity</em>&nbsp;— “everything is human actors; we’re writing everything ourselves” — but the creators often use AI tools to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text.</blockquote><blockquote>The use of generative AI has led to some pushback at Larian, “but I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it,” Vincke said.</blockquote><p>The quote made an audible record scratch on social media before leading to a ton of blowback from<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kortizart.bsky.social/post/3ma4rztk2yk2m?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>artists</u></a> and<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bryantfrancis.me/post/3ma4d2dzp5225?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>beyond</u></a>, so much so that Vincke<a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>took to Twitter to try to explain himself</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Holy fuck guys we’re not "pushing hard" for or replacing concept artists with AI.<p>We have a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more. The art they create is original and I’m very proud of what they do.</p><p>I was asked explicitly about concept art and our use of Gen AI. I answered that we use it to explore things. I didn’t say we use it to develop concept art. The artists do that. And they are indeed world class artists.</p><p>We use AI tools to explore references, just like we use google and art books. At the very early ideation stages we use it as a rough outline for composition which we replace with original concept art. There is no comparison.</p><p><a href="https://gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">I talked about how we use ML here if you would like to know more</a>.</p><p>We've hired creatives for their talent, not for their ability to do what a machine suggests, but they can experiment with these tools to make their lives easier.</p></blockquote><p>Which only made things worse! Because instead of explaining himself, all his follow-up showed is that Vincke does not appear to understand what it is that his art teams actually do, or indeed how their art is made.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:eioch6ru2ibkm7uabsa3vzua/app.bsky.feed.post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreihaduvsxwn6krehu2wr32fvxnqadpx4xk7pcafz3c75cu42pdwcei"><p lang="en">consider my feedback: i loved working at @larianstudios.com until AI. reconsider and change your direction, like, yesterday. show your employees some respect. they are world-class &amp; do not need AI assistance to come up with amazing ideas.</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:eioch6ru2ibkm7uabsa3vzua?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">anoxicart🍤 (@anoxicart.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:eioch6ru2ibkm7uabsa3vzua/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2025-12-16T16:20:58.862Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>That's OK, Swen, let me explain it for you! Firstly, any use of AI fucking sucks. It's a creative, economic and societal disaster, so really, there's no excusing its use in any circumstances. That's why people got so upset about the initial quote. But to get more specific, let's take a look at your justification.</p><p>Saying you only use AI for "reference" is wild. Artists use image searches and books as inspiration because they are drawing on art (but also everything else from colour palettes to photos to the weather). There's experience there, things they can relate to, be inspired by. There is no inspiration in slop! Everything AI is presenting to you is simply stolen and amalgamated. It's like asking your phone's autocorrect for relationship advice.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you are using AI to generate ideas to explore, that is using AI in your game. This is duplicitous spin to say otherwise. The entire history of creative industry happened just fine without using AI, there is no need to shoot your game in the foot by using it now.</p>— RJ Palmer (@arvalis) <a href="https://twitter.com/arvalis/status/2001019435776418179?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>There's an unsurprising tendency across leaders in the tech world (games included) to see art as merely part of something's production line, a box that needs to be ticked before copies can be sold. It's why AI is often justified as something that saves time, or saves money. But with art, that process <em>is </em>the point. The themes and ideas artists draw on, the way they iterate through those ideas with sketches, the work itself is what creates art. There are no shortcuts.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:oblggmviqritnt4hx4i7qgar/app.bsky.feed.post/3ma4w7yvzzs2z" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidmwci4fnhh4dxew67pkxmgcgjsx6bco2zotg4f2oax7a2v2zd5wy"><p lang="en">In a lot of ways, Larian was a poster child (alongside folks like Remedy) for how retaining a team and continuing to refine a toolset makes seemingly impossible things achievable.

Why spend 2 years talking about how critical this was to BG3's existence--and then say major parts of it don't matter?</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oblggmviqritnt4hx4i7qgar?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Xalavier Nelson Jr. (@writnelson.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oblggmviqritnt4hx4i7qgar/post/3ma4w7yvzzs2z?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2025-12-16T19:50:58.603Z</a></blockquote></figure>

That was all very good for the future of Larian, but it's also creating some pressure now that the developer focuses on its latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity/" data-ref-id="5000-706358">Divinity</a> game.</p><p>"It's more pressure," Larian founder Swen Vincke told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/swen-vincke-says-theres-definitely-more-pressure-to-nail-divinity-after-the-smash-success-of-baldurs-gate-3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "The weight of the expectations weighs high. We're trying not to think about it, because we have to make our own thing."</p><p>Vincke also indicated that the team at Larian believed that making Divinity would be easier after the studio's experience with Baldur's Gate 3. But that turned out to not be the case.</p><p>"When we started on this, it was like, 'Oh, we know how to do this,'" added Vincke. "By now, we've been humbled by the development experience, by the actual development again: No, we don't know anything. We have to relearn everything, but we do have the experience of the past with us. Every game has its own language that you need to learn."</p><p>Vincke recently came under fire for saying that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">Larian uses some generative AI</a> in game development. He subsequently said that AI is not being used to replace human artists, and that generative AI is used to "explore things" and that it allows artists to "experiment" and "make their lives easier." He added that there will be no generative-AI-created content in Divinity.</p><p>According to Vincke, Divinity will probably <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-will-likely-be-an-early-access-game-just-like-baldurs-gate-3/1100-6537011/" data-ref-id="1100-6537011">get an early-access release</a> like Baldur's Gate 3 did. But he didn't fully commit to that and the game doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Larian Studios made quite the splash at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a> when it revealed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/">its next project would be Divinity,</a> a continuation of the other major fantasy RPG series under its belt, and the one that's actually bigger than Baldur's Gate 3. Even though the reveal was <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-divinity-game-is-likely-that-mystery-tga-demonic-statue-announcement/">spoiled ahead of the actual show</a>, it was still one of the night's highlights and had everyone excited about what's coming next from Larian.</p>



<p>Now, the tone around Larian Studios has changed, just days after The Game Awards, thanks to some recent comments and confirmation from the studio's chief executive officer, Swen Vincke. <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/">In a recent interview with Bloomberg</a>, Vincke confirmed a few interesting tidbits about Divinity. Like Baldur's Gate 3, it'll be a turn-based RPG. Vincke also claimed that it'll be "<em>way better"</em> than Baldur's Gate 3, and the point that's making players upset online is that Vincke also confirmed Larian Studios has incorporated generative AI technology into its development pipeline.</p>



<p>On generative AI use at Larian, Vincke admitted to Bloomberg that there's been some internal pushback in the studio, but concluded that "<em>I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it</em>."</p>



<p>That may be true for some of its developers, but once the interview was live, it wasn't just players who are against generative AI use getting about Larian using the technology - it was also former Larian developers.</p>







<p>Amidst comments like this from a former Larian Studios developer and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/larianstudios/comments/1po3oz5/disappointed_in_larian_using_generative_ai_during/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">several comments on Reddit</a> and Bluesky, Vincke has responded to the backlash<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai"> with a statement sent to IGN</a>, where he tries to quell the concerns over how Larian is using generative AI and clarify that Larian isn't looking to replace any of its developers with generative AI technology, nor will it be releasing a game that includes content made by generative AI.</p>



<p>Here's the full statement below, via IGN:</p>



<p>"<em>We’ve been continuously increasing our pool of concept artists , writers and story-tellers, are actively putting together writer rooms, casting and recording performances from actors and hiring translators. Since concept art is being called out explicitly - we have 23 concept artists and have job openings for more. These artists are creating concept art day in day out for ideation and production use. Everything we do is incremental and aimed at having people spend more time creating.</em></p>



<p><em>Any ML (machine learning) tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft. We are researching and understanding the cutting edge of ML as a toolset for creatives to use and see how it can make their day-to-day lives easier, which will let us make better games. We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI. While I understand it's a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it's something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone's working day better, not worse</em>."</p>



<p>In what you'd call less formal wording, Vincke also <a href="https://x.com/laratlarian/status/2001011042642505833">took to X (formerly Twitter)</a> to respond to the criticisms he and Larian Studios are facing over using generative AI.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Holy fuck guys we’re not "pushing hard" for or replacing concept artists with AI.</p><p>We have a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more.

</div></figure>



<p>If nothing else, this whole debacle has proven that generative AI technology and its use in game development are still hot-button issues that can have players turning on you in a flash. Some people, generally studio heads and company leaders, are not only fine with using GenAI, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-doesnt-think-digital-game-stores-should-have-generative-ai-tags/">they're also pushing for it everywhere</a>. Studios are <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reveals-teammates-playable-genai-experience-ceo-says-gen-ai-transform-industry-3d/">already experimenting with it</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-out-now-immediately-called-out-for-ai-slop/">using it in games</a> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">are currently available for you to buy right now</a>, games that have sold millions of copies.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-actor-jennifer-english-using-generative-ai-in-games-dont/">Others don't think it should be used at all</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dan-houser-calls-people-pushing-genai-not-the-most-humane-or-creative-people/">others are calling it a crutch or a sign of someone who isn't very creative to begin with</a>, if they feel the need to use generative AI. Whatever side of the debate you are on, it's clear that <a href="https://wccftech.com/consumers-dont-care-about-ai/">people care about generative AI being used in games</a>. The question remains, though, will they care enough to vote with their wallets against developers who continue to use the tech, even ones that they previously loved? </p>



<p>Apropos of nothing, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 developer Sandfall Interactive was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3lsx5lwmsmk2j">caught earlier this year having used generative AI tech for assets that made it into the final game</a>. The studio never acknowledged the complaints and quietly patched them out. Just a few days ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">it won a record number of awards at The Game Awards</a>, including Game of the Year, <a href="https://x.com/superhys/status/2000615104090341472">and according to Alinea Analytics</a>, sold another 200,000 copies following the show.</p>

But following some initial backlash, Vincke later clarified <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">to IGN</a> that the studio is “neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI” and published his own statement on X.</p><p>Larian announced <em>Divinity</em> last week at The Game Awards with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxzyVeAG00w">“cinematic” teaser trailer</a> that didn’t reveal much about the game itself. Here’s what <em>Bloomberg</em> reported about Larian’s use of AI in <em>Divinity</em>:</p><div><blockquote><p>Under Vincke, Larian has been pushing hard on generative AI, although the CEO says the technology hasn’t led to big gains in efficiency. He says there won’t be any AI-generated content in <em>Divinity</em> — “everything is human actors; we’re writing everything ourselves” — but the creators often use AI tools to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text.</p><p>The use of generative AI has led to some pushback at Larian, “but I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it,” Vincke said.</p></blockquote></div><p>Vincke’s AI comments have received <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1po5xa7/comment/nucssg1/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=comment_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Flarian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">some pushback</a>, including former Larian employee Selena Tobin <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g">saying on Bluesky</a> “consider my feedback: i loved working at @larianstudios.com until AI.” A few hours after <em>Bloomberg’s</em> report, IGN published the following statement from Vincke, which Larian has also shared with <em>The Verge</em>:</p><div><blockquote><p>We’ve been continuously increasing our pool of concept artists , writers and story-tellers, are actively putting together writer rooms, casting and recording performances from actors and hiring translators.</p><p>Since concept art is being called out explicitly - we have 23 concept artists and have job openings for more.
