			<p>A game that has been out since 2015 and has been released on many different platforms is only now seeing a cross-play option implemented next month. If you've been eagerly awaiting the day for Rainbow Six Siege to get PC and Console cross-play, you won't have to wait much longer. Support for cross-play on all platforms will launch in December with the latest update to be added, Rainbow Six Siege's Year 9 Season 4 update named Operation Collision Point. With this update, it means that players can now team up with their friends regardless of what platform they're playing on. However, if there is a PC player in the group, the team will always be put into the PC matchmaking pool.</p>
<p>While this is the first time Rainbow Six Siege is getting cross-play on all platforms, it isn't the first time the game had any sort of cross-play, as there was cross-play and cross-progression enabled for PC, Amazon Luna, and the Google Stadia version of the game in June 2021. However, Google Stadia fizzled out very quickly, and this brings us to the current day, where only PC and Amazon Luna had cross-play, or Xbox and PlayStation, which was added in late 2022.</p>
<p>While it has taken a <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/">relatively long time</a>, this is something they've been actively working towards throughout the years that Rainbow Six Siege has been live. When cross-play for Xbox and PlayStation was released in late 2022, Ubisoft also added cross-progression across all platforms. Adding cross-play between PC and console is the final hurdle, so to speak. It has taken a relatively long time for them to get to this point, but it's because they've also been working to ensure that players are protected and cheaters are accurately punished if detected.</p>
<p>"Player Protection advances this season include Mousetrap Penalty adjustments to account for crossplay, automatic match cancellation if a cheater is detected, an overhaul for the Reputation center, and AI text moderation," says Chris Watters at Ubisoft. All of the information regarding<a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4luBBDMfipI6BDrwGGMV0L/rainbow-six-siege-operation-collision-point-operator-remaster-and-balancing-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Operation Collision Point</a> is available to read on the Ubisoft news page, which breaks down how they have balanced some of the Operators, as well as general improvements that are suited to the cross-platform experience.</p>
<p>To celebrate the news of the upcoming update, Ubisoft has released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoHI1dehzI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four-minute video</a> that provides information on how to utilize Blackbeard, as well as some starter tips for those who may be getting stuck into the game for the first time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-25-sales-2-million-one-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Giants Software has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>hit a very impressive sales milestone within its first week on release, demonstrating (if demonstration were truly needed) the staying power of the long-running franchise.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>managed to sell two million copies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-25-announced-november" rel="nofollow">inside a week</a>. Not only that, but the game's concurrent Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2300320/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">player count record</a> is at 135,970 at time of writing, with a 24-hour peak of 114,176.</p>

<p>By contrast,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 22</em>, the previous mainline entry in the series, has an <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1248130/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all-time player count record of 105,636</a> on Steam, so it looks like the new game has comfortably beaten its predecessor, which will likely come as a relief to Giants.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/farming-simulator-25-sales-vehicle.jpg?itok=MXShq8QN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/farming-simulator-25-sales-vehicle.jpg?itok=q54NeWR6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>has managed an impressive sales performance in its first week.</figcaption></figure><p>What's more, according to the aforementioned press release,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>has broken&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 22</em>'s sales record of 1.5 million copies in its first week, so the new kid on the block really has triumphed over the old hand.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25</em>, well, I'm sure you can work out what we're dealing with here, but just in case, it's...well...a farming simulator.</p>

<p>Created by Giants Software, a studio that's pretty much known for this franchise and not a whole lot else,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>introduces East Asian landscapes to the series, allowing you to farm rice paddies, sell your goods to neon-drenched port cities, and more.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new weather patterns like hail and twisters, forcing you to change up your farming strategy in response to extreme weather (a challenge that I'm sure real-life farmers are also having to grapple with more and more these days).</p>




<p>You can pick up&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300320/Farming_Simulator_25/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/farming-simulator-25/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/farming-simulator-25/9nmcdq6rcjkh" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator</em>-related.</p>

Well, one major detail: <em>Control 2</em> will be an action RPG, seemingly deviating from the action-adventure template set by the original.</p><p>The news came during <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/">an investors presentation</a>, in which the studio revealed <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1858851495493403094">a few other tidbits</a> about its franchises: <em>Alan Wake 2</em> has sold over 1.8 million copies, the “ultimate edition” of <em>Control </em>hits Mac on February 12th, and it will also be getting a free update of some kind next year that will unlock “previously released content.”</p><p>A large part of the presentation was devoted to Remedy’s ambitious plan to build out an interconnected universe, which will span not only game franchises like <em>Control</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24279410/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-expansion-review"><em>Alan Wake</em></a>, but also film and TV. Earlier this year <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231469/control-sequel-movie-tv-remedy-annapurna">the studio announced a partnership with Annapurna</a> to explore bringing its franchises to new mediums, and today creative director Sam Lake said that the process is still in its “very early steps.” Last month <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272812/fbc-firebreak-is-its-own-fully-formed-thing">Remedy also revealed <em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>, its first multiplayer game, which is tied to its other games.</p><p>“<em>Alan Wake</em>, <em>Control</em>, and <em>Firebreak</em> are all set in the Remedy connected universe,” Lake explained during the presentation. “Now, there are many fictional universes out there of course. But in games, an original universe that contains multiple franchises is a unique concept.” Earlier in the presentation, Lake noted that “What we create at Remedy is special, and we must never lose that.”</p><p>As for how far along these games are, Remedy says that <em>Firebreak</em> is in “full production,” while <em>Control 2</em> is in “production readiness.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fable-alpha-gameplay-footage-details-revealed-by-insider/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Reliable industry insider Jez Corden has revealed details about Fable’s alpha gameplay footage, indicating that the game’s style is similar to CD Projekt Red’s.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmNZUoJnqdg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Xbox Two</a> podcast (as shared by <a href="https://x.com/ZakkenKloot/status/1858632263761883513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ZakkenKloot</a> on X), Jez Corden discussed seeing some alpha gameplay footage for Fable and expressed his excitement by describing it as “fantastic.” However, Corden is uncertain about the timeline for this alpha build.</p>



<p>Corden discusses how the alpha gameplay footage of Fable contains elements reminiscent of “CD Projekt Red DNA.” He explains that Playground Games has hired several developers from CD Projekt Red, including a combat designer.</p>



<p>From the combat footage, he can identify where the inspiration originates. While the gameplay isn’t an exact replica of The Witcher, it features similar mechanics. Furthermore, the footage looks “super polished” for an alpha build.</p>



<p>Moreover, Corden revealed that Fable’s alpha gameplay footage showcased various weapon types, including bows and arrows, spells, and melee weapons—similar to those used by Geralt. He also discusses the design of certain enemy types, featuring comedic and frightening elements for chickens and werewolves. Overall, he felt that the gameplay looked impressive, and the combat was “very tight” for an alpha build.</p>



<p>In other news, Alan Wake 2 has sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alan-wake-2-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 1.8 million copies</a>. Also, Pokemon TCG Pocket reportedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-surpassed-120-million-in-earnings-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed $120 million in earnings</a>. What are your thoughts on Fable’s alpha gameplay footage?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>Remedy's upcoming Control sequel - aptly titled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a> - will be an action-RPG.</p>
<p>The developer first announced a sequel to its surreal action-adventure back in 2022, simply stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-officially-announces-sequel-to-control">Control 2 would be an "unexpected journey"</a>. In the time since, the developer has kept most details close to its chest, although in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production-control-2-features-in-playable-form">August of this year it stated "important" Control 2 features are now in "playable form"</a>.</p>

<p>We now have another small morsel of information on the sequel, however, thanks to confirmation from Remedy that the upcoming release will be an action-RPG. The developer shared this little nugget of information during its <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/">Capital Markets day presentation</a>, before following it up with a rather casual bullet point tucked within a social media post.</p>
<p>This same post also said Control Ultimate Edition will release on Mac on 12th February, and Control will receive a free update early next year, which will unlock "some previously released content".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> has now sold over 1.8m units. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-has-now-recouped-most-of-the-money-it-cost-to-make">Earlier this month</a>, Remedy said the sequel was close to recouping the money the studio had spent on developing and marketing the game, 12 months after its initial release.</p>

<p>As for Control 2, while we still admittedly do not know much about the sequel, fans do believe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-2-tease-lies-in-alan-wake-2s-lake-house-dlc-fans-say">Remedy has hidden a little teaser for the forthcoming game in its Alan Wake 2 DLC</a>, The Lake House.</p>
<p>But, while we wait a little longer to see where this tease ultimately leads, Remedy also has its Control spin-off - FBC: Firebreak - in the pipeline. The three-player co-op multiplayer will launch for PC and consoles in 2025, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one</a>. You can check out a trailer for FBC: Firebreak in the video above. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Speaking to investors <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1858851495493403094" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on its recent Capital Markets day</a>, Remedy revealed that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-has-been-slightly-delayed" rel="nofollow">released in October last year</a>, has reached "over" 1.8 million sales, although the company doesn't give an exact figure. By contrast,&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake: Remastered&nbsp;</em>apparently sold around 1.7 million copies.</p>

<p>Last we heard,&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-q3-financials-alan-wake-2" rel="nofollow">almost recouped its development and marketing costs</a>. Presumably, this is still the case, as if the game had done so since that announcement, it's likely Remedy would have told its investors.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-rpg-saga.jpg?itok=wvtB6L7N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-rpg-saga.jpg?itok=dSndfuWZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>has hit 1.8 million sales since its release last year, Remedy has revealed.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>had sold 1.3 million copies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-sales" rel="nofollow">back in February</a>&nbsp;(apparently making it the fastest-selling Remedy game thus far), that means a further half a million copies have been sold since that point, which isn't too bad for a game that is, in the end, fairly niche.</p>

<p>Remedy also had some info to share about the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>&nbsp;on its Capital Markets day. The game, which will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies" rel="nofollow">produced in conjunction with Annapurna</a>, will apparently be "an action RPG".</p>

<p>It's worth saying that the phrase "action RPG" is a fairly broad one; this could mean pretty much anything from a light leveling system all the way through to a full looter-shooter framework, so we'll have to wait and see exactly what Remedy means by that.</p>

<p>However, it does represent a shift in direction from the original&nbsp;<em>Control</em>, which is perhaps best described as an action-adventure game tinged with Metroidvania elements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/control-2-action-rpg-original-control.jpg?itok=ssxjKL7A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/control-2-action-rpg-original-control.jpg?itok=pTFbYKoa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>will head in a more RPG-ward direction than its predecessor.</figcaption></figure><p>What's more, a free update for the original&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>is coming in early 2025, and it will unlock "some previously released content", although Remedy doesn't specify exactly what that content might be. Better watch out for that one, I suppose.</p>

<p>As a reminder, we still don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, nor do we know exactly when the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced" rel="nofollow">recently-announced multiplayer spinoff&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced" rel="nofollow">FBC: Firebreak</a>&nbsp;</em>will be arriving.</p>

<p>Remedy did, however, reveal the kind of budget&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>&nbsp;has, suggesting that as a triple-A action RPG, it has a budget somewhere in the realm of&nbsp;€50 million.&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, meanwhile, as a "mid-price" multiplayer title, has a more modest&nbsp;€30m budget.</p>

<p>According to Remedy,&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>would need to sell around three to four million copies across its lifetime to guarantee a 100% return on investment, while&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>would need to rack up about three million. Whether or not that's realistic, we'll have to wait and see.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/real-life-minecraft-immersive-attractions-announced-by-legoland-company.1039446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legoland parent company Merlin Entertainments has announced a series of real-life immersive&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attractions, with the first set to debut in the UK and US sometime between 2026 and 2027.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.merlinentertainments.biz/newsroom/news-releases/2024/merlin-minecraft-in-real-life/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an official announcement</a> on the Merlin Entertainments website, the attractions will involve "<em>Minecraft</em>-themed guest accommodation, retail, and food &amp; beverage", as well as "a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>-themed ride" at existing Merlin locations in both countries.</p>

<p>In the long term, Merlin says it intends to extend these experiences to other countries as well, but they'll just be in Merlin locations in the US and UK to start with.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments-village.jpg?itok=1S9kkGKx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments-village.jpg?itok=0xX1eR7J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You could be visiting this&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attraction (or something like this mockup, anyway) sometime in the future.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the experiences themselves, Merlin says it'll be introducing "touchpoints" that you can use to augment your&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>experience and add "exclusive in-game content".</p>

<p>The rides and experiences will be costing Merlin somewhere in the region of $110 million to start with, and that number will obviously climb as more rides and&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attractions are introduced around the world.</p>

<p>We're a long way away from the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>theme park map that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-theme-park-map-released-as-part-of-10-year-anniversary-celebration" rel="nofollow">created as part of the game's 10th anniversary celebrations</a> back in 2019; these are proper, physical&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>experiences you'll be able to enjoy at actual brick-and-mortar Merlin locations.</p>

<p>Naturally, Merlin hasn't announced exactly what the attractions will be yet, nor when they'll actually be arriving. It's likely we'll be waiting a little while for that info, since the rollout is at least a year and a half or so away.</p>




<p>It's quite possible the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>experiences will find their home in Merlin's Legoland; after all, you can't say that doesn't make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>However, Merlin also owns the likes of Alton Towers, Thorpe Park, and Chessington, all of which are very popular UK theme park destinations, so the rides could be appearing in those locations, too.</p>

<p>Given that Legoland has US locations in New York and California, though, my money's on there for the inaugural&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attraction rollout. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <p>A long while ago I wrote about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>-likes needing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-survivors-likes-need-to-cut-through-the-clutter">stop overwhelming you with visual clutter</a>. I've since played a few games of a similar ilk that don't hammer you with a chaos that's impossible to dissect with your eyeballs. One of these is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodshed">Bloodshed</a>, an old school <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> take on the VS formula that actually works pretty well and did have me thinking the treacherous phrase "just one more run".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Bloodshed's not actually out just yet, but there's a demo for it over on Steam, and it's sort of Vampire Survivors meets Doom. You pick between a lad with a pistol or a lad with a sawed-off shotgun and you're to head into a grim little town with a raging bonfire at its heart. The aim? Survive for 20 minutes against an ever-expanding horde of occultists and demons (at least, that's the one mission available in the demo).</p>
<p>It's Vampire Survivors in the sense you auto-shoot or (if you're holding a melee weapon) stab whenever you hover your cursor over an enemy, though you can manually shoot and stab, too, if you'd like. And as you slaughter the horde, they drop EXP orbs that level you up. Ding upwards and you'll get to pick from a randomly generated assortment of upgrades, all VS-coded fare: lightning bolts that rain from the sky, eldritch traps, spooky homing-missile skulls, better ammo capacity.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/bloodshed-demo.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Headup</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's Doom, meanwhile, in the way it looks and feels. You've got that nippy cornering and the low hop that's frightfully fast. The shooting is punchy, with enemies bursting into green gunge or red goblets that splatter all over the floor.</p><p>Both the VS and the Doom influences combine pretty well, making for quite the hurried dash around a map that quickly becomes a ripe field of blood and orbs. I liked the fact that losing or finishing a run meant you could spend the cash you accrued on permanent upgrades, or you'd just unlock new in-game upgrades like the bazooka. I'd say, though, that the pace of a run might feel a bit slow at the moment, taking a while to really ramp up. And it's a shame that the upgrades don't appear to combine with one another. So far, they all seemingly exist as separate entities. So no pairing the sawed-off with the lightning for some bolt-slinging shotgun.</p>
<p>Still, it might be worth giving the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2747550/Bloodshed/">Bloodshed demo</a> a go if you're after something Survivory that isn't the usual top-down fare.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/inaugural-indie-game-awards-announce-full-list-of-nominees/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Indie Game Awards have announced the full list of award categories and nominees for its inaugural show on December 19.</p>



<p>In total, there are 15 awards up for grabs at the event with 63 games vying for awards in music, gameplay design, innovation, narrative, and more. Two awards, Storyteller and Industry Impact, didn’t have a list of nominees announced. Instead, those two awards will be announced specifically during The Indie Game Awards show.</p>



<p>“Narrowing down 365 days of remarkable indie games across the 15 categories was a gargantuan task for our curation jury,” The Indie Game Awards co-creator Mike Towndrow told Insider Gaming. “But the list we’ve landed on is a killer reflection of how much the indie scene has stepped up this year. </p>



<p>He added: “Take the Game of the Year category, for example. Those 10 games represent an incredibly diverse range of elements we all look for when discussing some of the greatest games of all time. They’re a perfect snapshot of how indies continue to push the boundaries and drive the industry forward.”</p>



<p>As mentioned, Game of the Year, the biggest award of the show, has 10 games nominated. Those games include 1000xRESIST, ARCO, Animal Well, Balatro, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, Neva, Nine Sols, UFO 50, Mouthwashing, and Crypt Custodian.</p>



<p>“Our goal is for The Indie Game Awards to become the definitive annual celebration of the indie scene,” Towndrow said. “That endgame vision is made possible through the deep collaboration we’ve built with fellow indie showcases, organizations, journalists, content creators, and, of course, the developers themselves. </p>



<p>“And this is just the beginning. We’re more motivated than ever to expand that collaboration and scale, bringing even more individuals into the fold to make The IGAs a staple of the indie scene—a celebration that breaks through into the wider gaming industry.”</p>



<p>You can check out the full list of nominees below. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of The Indie Game Awards when they air on December 19 at 7pm ET.</p>

Longer-term, Merlin will expand these experiences to other destinations globally," the company said.</p><p>Merlin runs the Legoland theme parks, as well as theme parks in the UK, Italy, and Germany, including Alton Towers Resort and Gardaland Resort.

                <p dir="ltr">Sony, parent company of PlayStation, is reportedly in discussions to purchase Kadokawa, parent company of Elden Ring maker From Software. The two companies have been talking, and it's apparently possible an acquisition could be announced in the weeks ahead.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, a possible acquisition would see Sony own the rights to Elden Ring and future games from From Software, also known for Demon Souls (already owned by Sony) and Dark Souls (controlled by publisher Bandai Namco). Acquire, behind Tenchu, and Spike Chunsoft, behind Danganronpa, also sit under <a href="https://group.kadokawa.co.jp/global/business/game.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kadokawa's umbrella</a> and presumably would be part of any merger. Sony already owns a 2% stake in the company.</p><p dir="ltr">Kadokawa's portfolio doesn't just include gaming, though.

            <p>
Microsoft has detailed the Xbox Game Pass titles set to be added to its subscription in the latter half of November.
</p>
<p>
This includes the launch of the long-awaited <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-release-times">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> from Ukrainian studio GSC Gameworld, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aliens-dark-descent-review-more-stand-up-fight-than-bug-hunt">pretty decent tactics title Aliens: Dark Descent</a>, originally launched last year, if you have Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass. 
</p>
<p>
You'll also need Ultimate or PC Game Pass if you want to play Nine Sols, an arty action-platformer that's inspired by Sekiro's combat. But, as you can see below, vanilla Game Pass members do get some new additions too.
</p>
<p>
Here's everything included with Xbox Game Pass in late November:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S), Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass - 19th November</li>
<li>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S), Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass  - 20th November</li>
<li>Little Kitty, Big City (Console), now with Game Pass Standard  - 20th November</li>
<li>PlateUp! (Console), now with Game Pass Standard  - 20th November</li>
<li>Nine Sols (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S), Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass  - 26th November</li>
<li>Aliens: Dark Descent (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S), Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass  - 27th November</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition to all of those, Game Pass Ultimate members will also get a smattering of in-game rewards when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> finally arrives for Xbox tomorrow, Wednesday 20th November. (I'm not well-versed on the Hoyoverse, but Microsoft lists you getting two Intertwined Fate, one Northlander Billet Trove, 10 Hero's Wit, 100k Mora, and 15 Mystic Enhancement Ore, which should help you on your way.)
</p>
<p>
As Microsoft gives, so it also taketh away. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-is-set-to-lose-these-6-games-at-the-end-of-the-month">partially announced yesterday</a>, here are the next set of titles due to exit the Game Pass catalogue on 30th November: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Conan Exiles (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Coral Island (PC)</li>
<li>Hello Neighbor 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Remnant: From The Ashes (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Rollerdrome (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Soccer Story (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Spirit of the North (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>The Walking Dead: The Final Season (PC)</li>
<li>While the Iron's Hot (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you missed the announcement, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cheeky-tweet-hints-at-the-next-big-franchise-coming-to-xbox-game-pass">Microsoft added Spyro Reignited Trilogy to Xbox Game Pass</a> just a week ago.
</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has responded to claims it removed datamined details and anonymous comments from staff who worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a> at developer Deck Nine Games.
</p>
<p>
The claims arose in an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pricefield/comments/1gq3hq8/an_open_letter_to_square_enix_regarding_editorial/">open letter from fans</a> posted to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> reddit r/Pricefield, which described recent content removals by "undue DMCA strikes" as attempts by Life is Strange's publisher to exert "behind-the-scenes editorial control".
</p>
<p>
Square Enix has now acknowledged it was behind the DMCA strikes, but said that "all steps were in accordance with appropriate legal requirements". 
</p>
<p>
The spat comes amid a period of tension between some diehard Life is Strange fans and both Deck Nine Games and Square Enix, sparked by story elements in last month's Double Exposure. Specifically, some fans - particularly those who post on the r/Pricefield reddit - were left disgruntled by the game's handling of fan-favourite character Chloe. ("Pricefield" is the relationship name of returning series protagonist Max Caulfield and her blue-haired BFF Chloe Price.)
</p><p>
Disapproval for how the game handles Chloe began before Double Exposure first launched, thanks to pre-release leaks that popped up from fans datamining <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposures-first-two-chapters-are-mostly-good-but-making-fans-pay-extra-to-play-early-is-a-huge-mistake">the game's early access version</a> and pointed posts on social media suggesting displeasure by members of Life is Strange's original development team Don't Nod, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-director-hits-out-at-hateful-comments-about-life-is-strange-double-exposure">the series' original director finally waded in to call for calm</a>.
</p>
<p>
Over on reddit, the situation was compounded by posts from several anonymous commenters who claimed to have worked on Double Exposure (and who provided some decent proof they had done so), who made a number of claims regarding how the game's story had changed through development, and been shaped by feedback from Square Enix itself.
</p>
<p>
The suggestion that Square Enix was acting to scrub mentions of this, and in particular developers allegedly speaking out of turn, sparked the open letter to be created.
</p>
<p>
"With this recent [removed post], which contained only publicly made comments by D9 and ex-D9 developers, there is no ambiguity left - Square Enix is either willfully removing non-infringing content for reasons other than infringement (which is explicitly NOT the authority or purpose of the DMCA), or doesn't believe that the great power granted to them by the DMCA should come with great responsibility," the open letter alleged. 
</p>
<p>
"One of these options is merely callous, the other is outright abuse of a system which, frustratingly, has no repercussions for abuse. We are concerned that Square Enix is attempting to editorialise this subreddit."
</p>
<p>
In response, in a statement first shared by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/11/18/square-enix-accused-abusing-copyright-law-silence-fan-criticism-22018233/">Metro</a>, Square Enix said it had removed "infringing content" that included "leaks or confidential information due to breach of non-disclosure agreements and datamined content". 
</p>
<p>
The publisher's full statement lies below:
</p>
<p>
"In relation to DMCA notices, all steps taken were in accordance with appropriate legal requirements and reddit's own procedures for reporting intellectual property violations," a Square Enix spokesperson said. 
</p>
<p>
"These processes apply to infringing content shared prior to a game's release, including leaks or confidential information due to breach of non-disclosure agreements and datamined content. No DMCA notices were sent regarding any posts outside of these circumstances."
</p>
<p>
The r/Pricefield reddit community has taken Square Enix's confirmation it removed information in breach of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) as confirmation the publisher was trying to remove confidential details that would further inflame fans. 
</p>
<p>
But while certain posts, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pricefield/comments/1gpjui3/help_the_copyright_notices_are_being_taken_too_far/">this summary of developer comments</a>, have been removed, Eurogamer is still able to find various original comments by users claiming to be Deck Nine staff still remaining, alongside photos of physical items related to the game's development they posted as proof of their identity. 
</p><p>
In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review">Eurogamer's Life is Strange: Double Exposure review</a>, I described Chloe's storyline in the game as "wholly believable" and that, ultimately, there was little room for the character this time around - even if her absence could have been handled better.
</p>
<p>
"There are good reasons other than nostalgia and fan familiarity for why a solo return to Max is interesting," I wrote. "Still, could this inevitable reaction have been handled better by the game, had the desire seemingly been there? Sure."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa.1039380/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-kadokawa-purchase-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report claims that Sony is in talks to buy FromSoftware parent company and media giant Kadokawa, with a deal potentially just weeks away.</p>

<p>The report comes from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, which, in turn, cites the age-old "sources familiar with the matter". As ever, take that with as big a pinch of salt as you like.</p>

<p>According to Reuters' report, talks between Sony and Kadokawa are ongoing, and if the talks are successful, then "a deal could be signed in the coming weeks", so it may not be very long before Kadokawa - and, by extension, FromSoftware - officially belongs to Sony.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dark-souls-3-sony-kadokawa-talks.jpg?itok=fJI5fqBp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dark-souls-3-sony-kadokawa-talks.jpg?itok=FDtKn41p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kadokawa subsidiary FromSoftware is best known for the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series, as well as offshoots like&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In light of the apparent talks, Kadokawa's shares rocketed up 23%, and Sony's closed 0.6% higher than before the report emerged. Naturally, both Sony and Kadokawa declined to comment when asked to do so by Reuters.</p>

<p>Sony already owns a stake in Kadokawa, having purchased shares <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-and-sony-buy-over-30-shares-in-from-software" rel="nofollow">back in August 2022</a> (alongside Chinese gaming giant Tencent). It's possible Sony wants to make a move before Tencent does, but of course, that's pure speculation.</p>

<p>In gaming terms, Kadokawa is perhaps best known as the parent company of&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>developer FromSoftware, although that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kadokawa-acquire-purchase" rel="nofollow">not the only studio it owns</a>, and as a media conglomerate, the company has its fingers in plenty of other pies as well.</p>

<p>If the report turns out to be true, then Sony's desire to acquire Kadokawa makes perfect sense; FromSoftware's most recent release&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">clocked 25 million sales</a> at last count, while DLC expansion&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>racked up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">five million sales in under a week</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-sony-kadokawa.jpg?itok=KsGJZSFX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-sony-kadokawa.jpg?itok=l3QH3BS8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is just one of FromSoftware's many successes.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony could probably do with the kind of boost that purchasing Kadokawa would likely provide right now.</p>

<p>Recently, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">shut down two of its studios</a>, including&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>developer Firewalk, and earlier this year, the Sony Interactive department <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off almost a thousand employees</a> around the world.</p>

<p>Subsidiaries like Bungie also arguably <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees" rel="nofollow">aren't in a good place</a> right now, so if Sony could snap up the parent company of not only FromSoftware but also the likes of Spike Chunsoft and&nbsp;<em>Octopath&nbsp;</em>developer Acquire, then things may well improve. We'll have to wait and see what happens next.</p>

<p>Remedy Entertainment has announced that Alan Wake 2 has sold 1.8 million units to date.</p>



<p>The news came via the <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s capital markets day</a>, during which the company deep-dived into its financials and past and future projects. During the presentations, it was announced that Alan Wake 2 sold 1.8 million units since its October 2023 release date (just over one year).</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Remedy Entertainment announced that the game was close to fully recouping its development and marketing costs with its ongoing sales. Still, it’s unclear if the game has become profitable at the time of writing. However, the recent sales numbers show that 1.8 million times 70 dollars (the high-end average) would put the total amount generated at approximately $126 million.</p>



<p>Released on October 27, 2023, Alan Wake 2 received generally favorable reviews according to review aggregated Metacritic and sold one million units by February 2024. The game won multiple awards at The Game Awards 2023, including Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, and Best Art Direction.</p>

Players have experienced issues, especially with game audio, as well as with performance on PC.</p><p>Players might have been looking forward to playing the popular Rebirth Island map when it was re-added to Warzone with this week's playlist refresh, but the map was pulled from rotation just over three hours after it was added.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1858619592190685225" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">📢 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warzone?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Warzone</a> <br>We've removed Rebirth Island from the playlist while we investigate map-specific issues.

The post said further updates would be posted to the same account, but it's currently unclear how quickly the issue is likely to be addressed.</p><p>The Warzone developer has already been hard at work patching issues associated with the Season 1 launch, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-patch-notes-detail-several-fixes-return-of-nuketown-24-7/1100-6527802/" data-ref-id="1100-6527802">the first patch</a> coming the day after the season started. Other posts on the CoD Updates X (formerly Twitter) account show that the team has already resolved a number of issues, so hopefully players will be able to jump back into Rebirth Island soon--but for now, they'll have to stick to exploring Area 99.</p>

                <p>The shojo-anime-tinged farming game Fields of Mistria is getting its first major content patch. It includes a new seasonal festival, mounts--including unicorns, llamas, cows, and sheep--and expanded romance routes.</p><p>The updates includes the "Shooting Star Festival," which takes place in-game on Summer 28. Romancable NPCs can be invited to stargaze if you have four or more hearts with them. As for other town-related additions, the renown level cap has been raised to 70, and you'll receive new rewards and new "Crown Requests" after level 50. You can buy more items at Merri's, Vera's, and Louis's market stalls. You can claim new sets and rewards at the museum for the Insect, Archaeology, and Fish wings.</p><p>After repairing Hayden's barn, you can ride mounts (and you'll unlock a set of relevant skills to boot). Skill caps across the board have been raised from 30 to 45. You can also encounter two new monsters in the mines--the Essence Bat and the Mimic--and pick up new rare cosmetic items from them.</p><p>In romance and relationships, you can now raise your affection with romancable NPCs to six hearts. When you do so, you'll unlock new events with them. Additional NPC dialogue has also been added.</p><p>According to the game's roadmap, future updates will include even more festivals, skill and level cap raises, and marriage. You can check out the full patch notes for this update below and on the <a href="https://www.fieldsofmistria.com/post/first-major-update-patch-notes-v0-12-0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fields of Mistria website</a>.</p><h2>Full Fields of Mistria v0.12.0 Patch Notes</h2><p>Patch notes will feature a 🌼 emoji whenever the change is based on community feedback and bug reporting!</p><h3><strong>Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li>Romanceable’s Six Heart Events have been added.</li><li>Rideable mounts and mount-specific Skill Perks have been added. <em>Note: The “Upgrade Hayden’s Barn” quest must be finished in order to unlock the Mount Questline</em>.</li><li>The Shooting Star Festival on Summer 28 has been added.<em>Note: To experience the date aspect of the festival, the “Beautification Project” quest must be completed.
