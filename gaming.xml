Zero is just still in early access, launching in full tomorrow (October 11), but that hasn't stopped fans from pushing it to massive early numbers on Steam.</p><p>In fact, Sparking! Zero has sped past the peak player counts of every other Dragon Ball game — and it's not even close. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1790600/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a> currently reports a peak player count of 91,005, which was achieved two days ago. As of the writing of this story, the game still has a sizeable amount of players (55,732 currently, with a 24-hour peak of 70,558), sustaining inarguably healthy momentum leading up to its proper release.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/dragon-1728585567350.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero already has a peak player count of 91,005. Credit: <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1790600/charts/">SteamDB</a></figcaption></figure></output><p>That's already impressive when you consider that's just players who shelled out $100 or more for Sparking! Zero's Deluxe or Ultimate Editions, which allow for access to the game three days early. But that number also doubles the Dragon Ball fighting game with the next-highest peak player count, Dragon Ball FighterZ, which topped out at 44,303 per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/678950/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a> charts. </p><p>It's pretty major when you compare it to other major fighting game franchises, too. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1364780/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Street Fighter 6</a> had a peak player count of 70,573 16 months ago, while <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1971870/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mortal Kombat 1</a> peaked with 38,129 players on Steam 13 months ago. </p><p>That player count will only rise when those who purchased the standard edition of Fighting! Zero get their hands on it tomorrow, so it's worth keeping an eye on. In the meantime, check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-review">our review in progress</a>, where we said playing the latest mainline entry in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series "feels just as much like a labor of love as the effort to resurrect the series in the first place."</p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

The first is the Archetype EXP Chest Set, which includes 10 Hero's Incenses and 5 Hero's Fruits--both of which drive up Archetype experience. The second is the Adventurer's Journey Pack, which gets you 30,000 Reeve, Metaphor's in-game currency, and a bunch of items that can help make your adventure a little easier. These include medicines for recovering HP and MP, and items that deal damage to enemies.</p><p>If you opt for the Altus 35th Digital Anniversary Edition, you get both sets of in-game items, plus a whole host of additional content. The Anniversary Edition includes a digital artbook and digital soundtrack for Metaphor, plus an Atlus 35th anniversary digital history book, and a 35th Anniversary all-time best soundtrack.

                <p dir="ltr">Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg has hinted at launching a Twitch channel focused on the strategy video game Civilization. During the Meta Connect 2024 conference, he spoke with <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pubity/video/7422388239169785120?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc" rel="nofollow ">Pubity</a><span>, revealing his </span><span>deep passion for the game: "In terms of strategy games, the one that I'm more likely to want to be the best in the world at is Civilization." </span>Zuckerberg didn't specify which version of Civilization he plays, leaving it unclear whether he means the original or a more recent entry in the series.</p><p dir="ltr">Zuckerberg offered insight into his gaming routine, joking about his wife's reaction to his playtime logged. "Priscilla looked at my Steam account the other day and she's like: 'What? You've played this for more than a thousand hours?'" He went on to say, "I think at some point, I should do like a Twitch stream of me playing with someone. Because I'm pretty convinced that I'm close to grandmaster status. I'd be surprised if anyone in the world could beat me at that."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK_JrrP9m2U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kK_JrrP9m2U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Sid Meier's Civilization franchise, developed by Firaxis Games, has sold over 50 million copies globally, according to publisher 2K Games. Zuckerberg has previously mentioned his fondness for the game, even recalling during his <a href="https://youtu.be/BmYv8XGl-YU?t=133" rel="nofollow ">2017 Harvard commencement speech</a> how he received his college acceptance letter while playing it.</p><p dir="ltr">The timing of Zuckerberg's comments appears to coincide with efforts to reshape his public persona. During the interview, he sported a black T-shirt reading "Zuck or nothing" in Latin, a departure from his usual minimalist wardrobe of gray shirts.</p><p dir="ltr">Following his remarks, popular Civilization streamer Potato McWhiskey <a href="https://youtu.be/fbo5qiXi1f0" rel="nofollow ">issued a challenge</a>, stating, "I challenge you, Mark Zuckerberg, to a 1v1 duel in Civilization," on his YouTube channel. The official Civilization account also chimed in, responding, "See you in the arena, Zuckerberg."</p><p dir="ltr">Civilization fans have been eagerly awaiting the next installment, which arrives on PC and consoles in February 2025. Early access for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/">Civilization 7</a> begins February 6 for select editions, while the standard release is set for February 11.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/metaphor-refantazio-guides-travellers-voices-gallica</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metaphor-refantazio-doesn%E2%80%99t-want-you-to-use-guides-and-i%E2%80%99m-here-for-it.1006650/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/metaphor-refantazio-guides-travellers-voices-gallica<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The rhythm of playing a gigantic, choice-based game in the modern era is one of quiet tedium. You reach a branching path or a place where there’s a risk of missing out on Optimal Content, and like clockwork, you grab your phone and pull up a guide for that specific moment. Big video game sites, once devoted mainly to news and reviews, are now optimized for this. And while there’s no shame in seeking out the odd tip or trick, it’s hard to fully lose yourself in an experience when you’re constantly abandoning Big Screen for Small, Horrible Screen. <em>Metaphor: Refantazio</em> proposes a better way.</p><p><em>Metaphor</em>, basically a new <em>Persona </em>in fantasy pajamas, is the kind of game I’d normally be checking guides for every several seconds. Like its high school-centric siblings, it operates on a calendar system that sees you split your time each in-game day between various activities like dungeon delving, hanging out with friends/followers, and boosting various “virtues” (which aid you in unlocking new characters and activities). Major events and quests often come with attached time limits as the game’s world continues to move around you. Just as there are optimal paths through each <em>Persona </em>game – which allow you to maximize bonds with party members and other characters, seeing their stories play out in full – I’m sure there’s a “correct” way to play <em>Metaphor</em>. Conversely, I imagine there are cool things I can miss, a thought that terrifies me.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I’m determined to avoid spending half my time with <em>Metaphor </em>consulting Polygon or whoever (no offense, y’all), and on top of that, I’m currently playing a review copy ahead of the game’s official release, so I literally can’t. Typically this limitation would fill me with dread, but <em>Metaphor </em>has proven shockingly accommodating. It’s clear that Studio Zero recognized how many people play its games and built in-game systems accordingly. </p><p>While Gallica, your fairy companion, can be helpful on this front by gently nudging you in the direction of specific side activities if you ask her to, the real game changer for me is “Travellers’ Voices,” an online feature that shows you what other players have done each new day that you reach. You need only press a button, and boom, you have the sum totality of other players’ lived experiences at your fingertips (which in my case means other people with review copies for now).&nbsp;</p><p>Smartly, <em>Metaphor </em>doesn’t collate this data into a prescriptive set of instructions. Instead, the game divides other players’ journeys up into four basic categories – “spent time with supporters,” “spent time in town,” spent time in a labyrinth,” and one I still haven’t unlocked yet – each accompanied by the percentage of players who performed that activity on a given day. Details beyond that are often vague; for example, “took in the scenery” or “talked with an activist” if you’re in town. </p><p>In other words, you’ve still got to do the legwork. You don’t know <em>exactly </em>what you’re in for, unlike with a guide. This system even extends to battle. If you want, you can view a selection of the class/character/level builds players used to tackle various challenges and switch your party accordingly.&nbsp;</p><p>I appreciate how organic it all feels. <a href="https://aftermath.site/yellow-paint-video-game-ledge-climbing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yellow paint</a> this ain’t. Instead, you’re stumbling through a dark cave by following the echoes of those who came before, of entities who are at least somewhat acknowledged by the game’s fiction. And they could be wrong! 30-50 percent of people are often wrong about a lot of things! But FOMO is a social phenomenon just as much as it’s born of what you’re actually missing out on. There is comfort, however slight, in knowing that other people also went to the awkward housewarming instead of the wild rager. </p><p>More importantly, it dispels the illusion that there’s a “right” and “wrong” way to play a game like <em>Metaphor</em>. There are just many different ways, and not everyone is optimizing and having a “better” experience than you. That’s to say nothing of the fact that regret is a powerful and interesting emotion, one games rarely encourage us to sit with in favor of fulfilling our fantasies at every turn. Greater awareness that people aren’t all playing the same way hopefully means more <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/full-of-regret" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussion of those regrets</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Similar systems, I gather, were present in <em>Persona 5 Royal</em> and <em>Persona 3 Reloaded</em>, which makes me substantially more interested in playing those games as well. The last <em>Persona </em>I played was the base version of <em>Persona 5</em>, and I fell off it precisely because I started to feel less like I was exploring a mysterious occult world and more like I was trying to organize my convoluted IRL social calendar (which I keep in the Notes app on my phone, because I’m a freak). Already, there’s less of a nagging weight on my shoulders when I’m playing <em>Metaphor</em>. Maybe that will change as I become more invested in the world and characters – and websites start to publish guides – but for now I’m just… playing the game. It’s freeing. What’s the point of FOMO, after all, if it takes away your ability to be present in a moment? You were so worried about getting there that you forgot to enjoy it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In case you don’t know—and who could blame you—being an Amazon Prime subscriber neets you a whole bunch of benefits beyond two-day shipping and Prime TV. For example, you also get benefits on Twitch like exclusive emotes and a free subscription to give to your favorite streamer, as well as free games that release in waves every month across a variety of PC storefronts. Prime Gaming is probably the most innocuous games subscription service of the bunch, but it also packs some of the best offers if you’re privy to it, and this month is no slouch.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196163" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Firefight’s Back In Halo!

The sequel to the studio’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-the-kotaku-review-1777315801&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-the-kotaku-review-1777315801">acclaimed 2016 reboot</a></span> of the storied franchise, <em>DOOM Eternal </em>follows the Doom Slayer’s continued onslaught against the forces of Hell, only this time the action shifts from Hell to Earth as he brings the fight to the demons. <em>Doom Eternal </em>is somehow even more of a hardcore <em>DOOM </em>experience than its predecessor, pushing the player to be even more aggressive and precise in their dismantling of Hell’s demonic warriors. If you thought 2016’s <em>DOOM </em>had massive levels, <em>Eternal </em>is several times larger, lending it an epic feeling that rarely feels artificial. The demons you kill are larger than life, but the Doom Slayer’s capacity for ripping and tearing is even larger, and it’s truly impressive to watch this gorefest in action.</p><p>Other highlights from October’s Prime Gaming drops include the indie rhythm action game <em>No Straight Roads, </em>the <em>Zelda-</em>like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-s-door-is-as-good-as-everyone-says-1847410512&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-s-door-is-as-good-as-everyone-says-1847410512"><em>Death’s Door</em></a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pumpkin-jack-is-colorful-halloween-action-game-1845056040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pumpkin-jack-is-colorful-halloween-action-game-1845056040"><em>Pumpkin Jack</em></a></span>, a 3D platformer that’s become a bit of a cult classic in the years since its release. I’ve heard great things about <em>No Straight Roads </em>from folks who’ve played it, and I can personally attest to the reputation of <em>Death’s Door</em>, which was my favorite game of 2021! Between these three games and <em>DOOM Eternal</em>, there’s a hell of a lot of variety in this bunch of free games.</p><p>If you’re feeling in a spooky mood given the month we’re in, there’s a few games perfectly aimed at you. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/scorn-hr-giger-ebb-games-xbox-game-pass-pc-steam-date-1849661537&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/scorn-hr-giger-ebb-games-xbox-game-pass-pc-steam-date-1849661537"><em>Scorn</em></a></span><em> </em>is a first-person puzzle game that is absolutely horrifying and grotesque to look at, and I mean that in the best possible ways. Its incredible visual fidelity is leveraged to render the most sumptuous H.R Giger-esque environments. Walking around in that game <em>feels</em> like traveling through the innards of a Xenomorph nest. If you like your horror games with a bit of a psychological bent, it’s hard not to recommend <em>Bioshock Remastered</em>. After all, there’s nothing scarier than the ruling class in any capitalistic society, especially one built by a magnate. </p><p>There’s also a game that I know nothing about that’s simply called <em>Priest Simulator: Vampire Show</em>. One of those words is definitely in the Bible, but I don’t believe anyone has ever been brave enough to stick them altogether like that till now. If you’re anything like me, a bizarre title is all you need to jump into what seems to be an equally strange experience.</p><p>The majority of this month’s games are available now, but the rest of them, like <em>The Gunk</em>, <em>Killing Floor 2</em>, and <em>Monster Train</em> will be releasing on every subsequent Thursday of the month, right up to Halloween. In other words, there’ll be no shortage of free goodies to play every week of the spooky season.

<p>Yes, Blizzard, I have a phone, but I don’t frequently use it to play mobile games. I prefer to play on PC, hunched awkwardly over a mouse and keyboard. But like many of you, I’ve had my eye on Bethesda’s latest mobile game, and now that it’s finally available to everyone on both Android and iOS, I most certainly want to play The Elder Scrolls Castles on PC instead!</p>







<p>While The Elder Scrolls Castles isn’t natively supported on PC, it’s entirely possible to play the point-and-click adventure game using the likes of <a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/apps/simulation/the-elder-scrolls-castles-on-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bluestacks</a>. The third-party app lets you install a client to your computer and then run the Android Play Store. You’ll be asked to sign in to your Google account. After that, you can navigate the entire mobile storefront as if playing on your smartphone, downloading the games and apps you’d like to run on your PC.</p>



<p>Search the store for The Elder Scrolls Castles through the Bluestacks launcher, download the game, and launch it once ready. You may receive a black screen. If you do, close out of the game and relaunch the title.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-bethesda-director-defends-starfield-says-it-s-right-next-to-fallout-and-elder-scrolls">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-aligned-fallout-elder-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethesda Director Defends Starfield, Says It’s ‘Right Next To’ Fallout and Elder Scrolls</a></h6>







<p>Similarly to Fallout Shelter, The Elder Scrolls Castles tasks you with building a miniature empire. Instead of a vault, you’ll construct a medieval castle in the fantasy setting, ruling over the kingdom, defeating enemies, decorating each room to your liking, and interacting with unique characters and races from The Elder Scrolls universe.</p>



<p>The game features 20 levels, interactive gameplay mechanics, unique landscapes, and more to explore. It’s definitely one long-time fans of The Elder Scrolls will want to check out in their spare time, but don’t expect to play for hundreds of hours like in Skyrim. It’s not quite that deep, unfortunately.</p>



<p>Have you tried The Elder Scrolls Castles yet? Let us know what you think of the game in the comments below, or visit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our General Gaming forum</a> to talk about this and other Elder Scrolls titles!</p>



<hr>



<p>The Elder Scrolls Castles isn’t the only game in the long-running franchise that’s doing well. Did you hear <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-online-15m-a-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elder Scrolls Online has earned $15 million monthly for the past ten years</a>?</p>

<p>The first details about possible preorders for Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter Marathon may have just been found. According to data miners, Marathon preorders could begin sometime in Q1 2025.</p>



<p>Bungie recently released an update for Destiny 2, and players immediately started to data mine the files from the update. Within that information (first reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/marathon-pre-order-destiny-2-files-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>) comes a text string that reads “v820.offers.entitlements.d2.marathon.preorder”.</p>



<p>The beginning of the string, v820, is where the suggestion comes. Bungie uses version numbers for its Destiny 2 expansions. With v810 representing the current Revenant episode, v820 would reference the next episode, Heresy. That episode is scheduled to release on February 4, 2025.</p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning, that nothing about potential dates or releases for Marathon have been confirmed by Bungie. The latest news on the game came in September regarding when Bungie planned to hold its next major look at the game. According to those claims, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-significant-reveal-for-bungies-marathon-until-2025-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the next “significant reveal”</a> wasn’t going to happen until Spring 2025.</p>



<p>Last known, Bungie is still planning for a 2025 release for Marathon. The game has seen multiple changes during its development ranging <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from its direction</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-director-fired-at-bungie-over-inappropriate-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">management at the top</a>. There’s even concern from some inside that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-marathon-reaction-isnt-great-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t hit it’s current release deadline.</a></p>



<p>When do you think fans will hear something on Marathon from Bungie? Join the discussion below or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's text-based moderation of in-game text chat and usernames includes 20 languages, and it will also be active for the launch of Black Ops 6. This includes the upgrade of a new analysis system for username reports, which is designed to enhance efficiency and accuracy.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Call of Duty team is dedicated to fostering a positive and welcoming community for all players. Part of these ongoing initiatives involve the development and use of technology to help our teams combat disruptive behavior," Activision said.</p><p dir="ltr">The publisher also shared some results from the moderation program so far. Over 45 million text messages were blocked across 20 languages, and overall exposure to voice toxicity has dropped by 43% since the global launch of the system last year.</p><p dir="ltr">"Since rolling out an improved voice chat enforcement in June 2024, Call of Duty has seen a combined 67% reduction in repeat offenders of voice-chat based offenses in Modern Warfare 3 and Call of Duty: Warzone. In July 2024, 80% of players that were issued a voice chat enforcement since launch did not re-offend. Exposure to disruptive voice chat continues to fall, dropping by 43% since January 2024," Activision said.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, the publisher said Call of Duty's Disruptive Behavior team is continually making enhancements, which includes improved messaging to players, Code of Conduct updates, and enhancements to enforcement strategies.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will be reminded of Call of Duty's Code of Conduct with an in-game message during their first launch of core multiplayer modes in Black Ops 6, which will ask them to acknowledge the Code of Conduct pillars before continuing.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches worldwide on October 25 across Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metaphor-refantazio/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> features a job system referred to as Archetypes, which allows you to swap any of your party members to any Archetype pretty freely. While there are some requirements to use the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-all-advanced-archetypes-and-how-to-unlock-them/1100-6526963/">advanced Archetypes</a>, you will want to swap out Archetypes frequently. In some cases, like certain side dungeons, there are specific Archetypes that will be recommended based on the enemy weaknesses found there, but you can also ignore that if you like your setup. One of the most important factors for determining your team composition is the synthesis abilities that become available when you have specific Archetypes present in your party.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Mage with Seeker, Healer, or Mage</h2><p dir="ltr">The Mage Archetype tree is incredibly powerful, especially early on, since it has access to fire, ice, and electric attacks, which allows you to target a variety of enemy weaknesses. However, the abilities the Mage and its advanced versions can use only targets a single enemy. If you want to use a version that can target all enemies at once, you will need to use the Synthesis version of these abilities, which only becomes available if you have another Mage, a Seeker, or a Healer present. Of those three options, the best to go with is the Healer since the Healer gets to use a light damage attack that targets all enemies if a Mage is present.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metaphor: ReFantazio Review</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Knight with back row damage dealers</h2><p dir="ltr">The Knight is an excellent class that can fit into many team compositions since the Knight is a great tank. If you need to bring along multiple back-row damage dealers, like the Mage, Gunner, Healer, or Summoner, the Knight can get the attention of enemies to keep your squishy party members safe from danger. Even if the Knight's pierce damage isn't effective against the enemies you are fighting, focusing purely on defense can keep your party alive against tough enemies.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Summoner and Masked Dancer</h2><p dir="ltr">Perhaps one of the best combinations in Metaphor: ReFantazio, the Summoner and Masked Dancer duo is incredibly powerful. The Masked Dancer gains access to abilities that inflict one-time elemental weaknesses to enemies<strong>,</strong> and the Summoner has access to the largest variety of elemental attacks in the game. That means you can make all of your enemies weak to a specific element, like ice, and immediately dish out a high-damage ice attack that hits all enemies, dealing big damage and letting you take more turns. <strong>An important part of this comp is making sure you have the correct Vessels and Masks to take advantage of this. </strong>Make sure to craft these items in Akademia whenever you have the materials.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Gunner with Gunner, Faker, or Summoner</h2><p dir="ltr">Pierce physical damage is the least common of the three physical attack types, so whenever you have to deal with a dungeon featuring a large number of monsters with a weakness to Pierce, the Gunner is your best fit. If you have another Gunner, a Faker, or a Summoner present, you can use the Synthesis ability Wild Barrage, which hits all enemies with Pierce damage multiple times.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Berserker with Knight</h2><p dir="ltr">The Berserker can access two Strike damage synthesis abilities that deal massive damage, as long as a Knight is present. These two abilities, Wanton Destruction and Battlecry Tackle, have one Archetype overlap, which is the Knight. Wanton Destruction, in particular, is great, because it deals extreme physical Strike damage and it inflicts a one-time weakness to Strike. After the first use, you can continually use it every turn without losing any turn icons thanks to the weakness, making it great for tough enemies with a large amount of health.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Trickster</h2><p dir="ltr">The Trickster, the advanced version of the Faker, has access to an extreme physical Almighty attack that doesn't consume MP. Almighty damage is a special kind of damage that enemies cannot have resistance to, but they also can't be weak to. This makes it useful for enemies without weaknesses, and this special move also doesn't use MP, making it great for conserving MP in a long dungeon. To use this synthesis ability you need to have two allies in with the correct Archetypes. The first ally needs to be a Knight, Healer, or Commander, with the second ally using Thief, Faker, or Merchant.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Brawler, Merchant, Healer</h2><p dir="ltr">The Brawler, Merchant, and Healer combination gives you access to a couple of powerful Almighty attacks from the Merchant and several light attacks, as well. The Almighty attacks from the Merchant do cost money to use, but this means that they don't cost MP, a trade-off you might be willing to make late into Metaphor: ReFantazio. The powerful light attacks are great to have, since your options for high damage light attacks are fairly limited.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Whatever the information says</h2><p dir="ltr">For the majority of main and side dungeons in Metaphor: ReFantazio, you can purchase information about the monsters in each dungeon from an informant. This information usually tells you what the enemies' weaknesses are, but if you go to your requests list, it will also add a recommended Archetypes section to the description. These are always the best possible setups, especially since it usually only recommends a couple Archetypes and not a full party of four, but you will have access to most of the enemy weaknesses, making it a nice play to start if you aren't sure what party setup to go with.</p>

And while plenty of games still run like a dream on the portable PC, it’s clear that over time, more and more big new games are pushing this tiny computer to its breaking point. And it might be time for an upgrade. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195189" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: June 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="212" data-playlist="195189,196131,196358" data-current="195189"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: June 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195189/195189_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20647.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Let’s be clear about something: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507">the Steam Deck is  awesome</a></span>. Valve’s affordable and portable handheld PC launched in 2022 and has quickly inspired imitators while also making it easier than ever to play new and old PC games while chilling on your couch. I know plenty of people who didn’t play many PC games who now play a ton of stuff on their Steam Deck. It’s not a debate. The Steam Deck was a big hit and has changed the video game industry. That said, in 2024, it feels like more and more of this year’s biggest games are just not running well, or running at all, on the aging Steam Deck. </p><p>The recently released<em> Silent Hill 2</em> remaster—which is very good—is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1g0e6k3/silent_hill_2_is_officially_non_supported_on/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1g0e6k3/silent_hill_2_is_officially_non_supported_on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently marked by Valve as “Unsupported” on Steam Deck</a></span>. Though you can still install it and you’ll discover that you can play the new horror game, you’ll have to turn most settings down to low and put up with some wonky performance in certain areas. It’s pretty clear this game is pushing the Steam Deck. </p><p>And it’s not alone. Here are other games that, according to Valve’s testing, are either “Unsupported” or just “Playable” (as opposed to “Verified”) on Steam Deck:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Space Marine 2</em> - Unsupported</li><li><em>Hellblade 2 -</em> Unsupported</li><li><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2 </em>- Unsupported</li><li><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> - Unsupported</li><li><em>Frostpunk 2</em> - Unsupported</li><li><em>Final Fantasy 16</em> (PC Port) - Unsupported</li><li><em>Helldivers 2</em> - Playable</li><li><em>Tekken 8 </em>- Playable</li><li><em>WWE 2K24</em> - Playable</li><li><em>Suicide Squad </em>- Playable</li><li><em>Multiversus</em> - Playable </li></ul><p>Some of these games really struggle to run on Steam Deck. <em>Space Marine 2</em>, for example, can technically still be installed and played, but even with every setting turned down to its lowest option, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/X1uxvXEYgZc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/X1uxvXEYgZc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it struggles to reach 30 FPS</a></span>. <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II,</em> which is a very pretty game, can only <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Gl4iW-mhiSg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Gl4iW-mhiSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kind of run on the Steam Deck</a></span> after lowering the settings to the point where it looks awful. And then you have something like the massive open-world RPG that is <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>, which struggled on current-gen consoles, and unsurprisingly, plays quite poorly on Steam Deck. </p><p>Now, not all of the games above are completely unplayable. For example, with some tweaks, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Op9CoNvRiVg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Op9CoNvRiVg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can get<em> Black Myth: Wukong </em>to run mostly fine at 30ish FPS</a></span> on Steam Deck. The same is true of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/A0xkICYpog0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/A0xkICYpog0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a></span><em>. </em>But one of the best qualities of the Steam Deck is that many games are “Verified,” and just work great right out of the box on Valve’s tiny PC. Having to dig into multiple menus, tweak Steam Deck and game settings, and check online for recommendations isn’t much fun, and I imagine that for a lot of Steam Deck owners, it’s not something they want to mess with just to play a new game. </p><p>The reality is that the Steam Deck is getting old. It wasn’t the hottest or most powerful device around when it launched in 2022, so it’s not shocking that more and more games are struggling to run on the device. Sure, there are plenty of games that run perfectly on Steam Deck, so it’s still worth buying if you want to play indie games, older titles, or less demanding single-player experiences. </p><p>But the era of being able to run “most games” on Steam Deck, an early pitch Valve made with the device, has come to an end. And now the question is: When will Valve release a more powerful version of the Steam Deck that can play these bigger games without melting your battery or having to lower every setting?  </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nuketown-black-ops-6-confirmed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Treyarch has confirmed that Nuketown will arrive in Black Ops 6 one week after the game has hit the market. The legendary map, which has found a place in every Black Ops game in one way or another, will appear on November 1, 2024. The return of this fan-favourite map was confirmed with a brief teaser trailer showcasing the instantly recognisable environment.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-timeless">Timeless</h2>



<p>Nuketown has existed since 2010’s Black Ops, and since then, it has popped up in every successful game in the Black Ops series. It’s returning in Black Ops 6, but it won’t be added to the game until one week after the title has been released. That means users will have seven days to bolster their loadouts before jumping into what will assumedly be a 24/7 rotation of Nuketown.</p>



<p>From the teaser that was posted on social media, Nuketown looks similar to past iterations, which isn’t the most typical way that the map has been handled in previous games. Traditionally, each game will offer a unique spin on the map, fitting it into their part of the timeline or setting, but Black Ops 6’s Nuketown doesn’t look too ‘special’ at first blush:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>When Black Ops 6 is released, every map will be original, and the only maps that players will have any familiarity with will be the ones that cropped up in the beta that unravelled several weeks ago. It’s nice that Nuketown is making an appearance, as it’ll give players something comfortable to gravitate to.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see Nuketown confirmed for Black Ops 6? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Black Ops Story So Far Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The podcast includes an interview with Treyarch's associate creative director, Miles Leslie, who confirms Nuketown's return in Black Ops 6. The game's campaign takes place in the Gulf War, but when asked if Black Ops 6 would feature a '90s-themed variant of Nuketown, the developer was unable to confirm the map's setting.</p><p dir="ltr">However, shortly after the podcast was released, Treyarch confirmed the map is arriving on November 1 with a teaser clip that shows a small portion of the map. The design is definitely a classic 1950s-style Nuketown, but not enough of the map is shown to determine what changes could be expected.</p><p dir="ltr">The interview also discusses Black Ops 6 Zombies, revealing that another round-based map will arrive before the end of the year. The game will launch with Terminus and Liberty Falls as the first two round-based Zombies maps.</p><p dir="ltr">Liberty Falls received criticism after the map's reveal at Call of Duty: Next, with some of the community expressing that the map's design looked and felt too casual, lacking a darker, more-traditional Zombies atmosphere.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision confirms that Liberty Falls has undergone changes since the map's reveal, explaining the map shown at that time was still a work-in-progress. Liberty Falls has since received changes to visual tone for a "moodier feel." HUD elements are also being touched for the mode. However, Activision also expressed that Liberty Falls is still supposed to be a smaller and more casual map, while Terminus is a much larger map with a more traditional Zombies feel.</p><p dir="ltr">The podcast confirms more Zombies details will arrive closer to the game's launch. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-beta-and-more-leak-ahead-of-xbox-showcase/1100-6524072/" data-ref-id="1100-6524072">Black Ops 6</a> releases on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p><p dir="ltr">The game will have a campaign, multiplayer, and Zombies.

			<p>Just a few days ago,<a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/o3314a19koo147/red-dead-redemption-and-undead-nightmare-coming-to-pc-october-29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Rockstar announced</a> that the Red Dead Redemption Remaster will be arriving on <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-games-leaks-gta-6-pc-folders-and-red-dead-redemption-pc-port/">PC as of October 29</a>. In this announcement, the system requirements were mentioned, but the price of the game was not revealed. The game is set to be released on the Epic Games Store, Steam, and the RockStar Store, depending on what launcher you want to use. Today, the Epic Games Store seems to have leaked the price of the game, with it set to cost $49.99. This was shown in a <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/news/red-dead-redemption-remaster-will-be-priced-at-4999-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">screenshot by John Papadopoulos over at DSOGaming</a>.&nbsp; At the moment, the game is starkly cheaper on console, with Red Dead Redemption costing $29.99 on every other platform, not including when the game goes on sale. However, it's possible that the game is set to cost more on PC, as Red Dead Redemption is set to have PC-specific enhancements, such as native 4K resolution up to 144hz on compatible hardware.</p>
<p>The list of PC-specific features doesn't end there, though. This remaster being ported to PC was done in collaboration with Double Eleven to add monitor support for Ultrawide and Super Ultrawide monitors, as well as full keyboard and mouse functionality for those who prefer a more tactile experience rather than using a controller.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game will have NVIDIA DLSS 3.7 and AMD FSR 3.0 upscaling, as well as NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation and many graphic settings that can be tweaked, such as draw distances and shadow quality settings. Luckily, the system requirements are pretty reasonable, and most people will be able to play it on their PC, as the game requires a RTX 2070 as a recommendation, with the game being playable on even older graphics cards.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's not known whether the game will be compatible on Steam Deck, as Red Dead Redemption 2 is just about playable on a Steam Deck. Despite that, Red Dead Redemption 2 remains one of the top games played on a Steam Deck.&nbsp; Recently, Grand Theft Auto V became unsupported on a Steam Deck after being one of the top games played on the handheld console. However, due to Rockstar Games adding anti-cheat features to the game, people will only be able to play the story mode of the game on the Steam Deck, with no access to the online servers whatsoever. Compared to the second game, Red Dead Redemption is more story-focused, but the game will be released with the zombie-horror story, Undead Nightmare, allowing players to team up and fight back against the zombie horde.</p>

Making it more challenging, you’ll be playing as one of the weakest versions of Goku. Even if you lower the difficulty, you might keep struggling. The good news is that he <em>can</em> be beaten, and just like the show, you just need some more training.</p><h2 id="h5852"><a id=""></a><strong>SLIDE #1Prepare with Battle Training</strong><br></h2><figure id="" data-id="1991dcefcc8ebc83a67d62bc684d6fb3" data-recommend-id="image://1991dcefcc8ebc83a67d62bc684d6fb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan training with Piccolo for Rush High-Speed Movement." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gohan training with Piccolo for Rush High-Speed Movement." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1991dcefcc8ebc83a67d62bc684d6fb3" data-recommend-id="image://1991dcefcc8ebc83a67d62bc684d6fb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan training with Piccolo for Rush High-Speed Movement." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I completely understand the desire to just mash through stuff. A lot of the fun in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> is hitting some buttons and seeing your character do some flashy hype stuff. You might think that’s enough after the quick tutorial and the first four fights in Goku’s Episode Battle story. As it turns out, this game has quite a lot of mechanics and techniques under the hood, and you’re going to want to get involved.<br></p><p><strong>If you’re having issues with this cocky ape, I highly recommend that you go through Battle Training, which is listed under the Super Training menu.</strong> This breaks down every mechanic in the game against Piccolo. I’ll be the first to admit that it’s not the most well-made training mode, and getting through it isn’t particularly enjoyable. However, <strong>you’ll be missing out on a large chunk of gameplay mechanics when you’re only going off of the tutorial</strong>. Knowing these will help you against Great Ape Vegeta and later fights as well.</p><p>High-movement mechanics will be the main focus of this fight. Avoiding his attacks and getting behind him will help a ton. These are the mechanics to nail down along with their respective inputs for PlayStation and Xbox:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Dragon Dash</strong> - The flying dash you should be aware of from the tutorial. What’s important to recognize is how much Ki it drains while in use. Performed with R2 + Cross or RT + A. Automatically rushes forward, but moving the left stick will dictate its direction.</li><li><strong>Z-Burst Dash</strong> - This is an extension of Dragon Dash that rushes you directly behind the opponent. It uses one bar of Ki and is an important move for this boss. Performed with the same inputs, R2 + Cross or RT + A. The left stick needs to be left in a neutral position.</li><li><strong>Vanishing Assault (Close-Range)</strong> - Teleports you directly behind your opponent. It uses one bar of Ki and requires you to be in close range. Performed with Square + Cross or X + A.</li><li><strong>Rush High-Speed Movement</strong> - This is an extension from Rush Attacks, allowing you to teleport around the enemy mid-way through your Rush combo. Uses a half-bar of Ki and is dependent on what direction the left stick is pushing towards. Press up will teleport you behind them, pressing left will teleport you to their left side, etc. Performed with the left stick pushed in a direction + R1 or RB.</li><li><strong>High-Speed Evasion</strong> - A counter-like evasion that teleports you directly behind the opponent when they’re attacking. The timing is strict, but it’s a great option that doesn’t use Ki. Performed with R1 or RB right before an attack hits.</li></ul><p>As tempting as it is, using an actual counter can provide mixed results in this fight. The size of this monster makes it hard to knock him off balance in one hit. Most counters will boop him away a bit, without giving you much advantage. Prioritizing hits and dodges will be more effective.</p><h2 id="h5853"><a id=""></a><strong>SLIDE #2How to Beat Great Ape Vegeta</strong><br></h2><figure id="" data-id="f11c5392fa4c56bc105b19ed94ffe408" data-recommend-id="image://f11c5392fa4c56bc105b19ed94ffe408" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku flies in the air and punches Great Ape Vegeta in his giant arm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Goku flies in the air and punches Great Ape Vegeta in his giant arm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f11c5392fa4c56bc105b19ed94ffe408" data-recommend-id="image://f11c5392fa4c56bc105b19ed94ffe408" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku flies in the air and punches Great Ape Vegeta in his giant arm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It already seemed like <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> deserved some recognition based on people’s feelings in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746">previews and reviews</a></span>. I believe it also deserves recognition for how often it can catch you off guard. Quite a few of the Episode Battles involve fights where the opponent immediately goes on the offensive. Great Ape Vegeta here is one of the more frustrating examples, as he’ll use his Super Attacks as soon as possible. Sometimes that’s right as the match starts, and sometimes he’ll give you a second or two of leeway.<br></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> Previews Suggest That We Are So Back, Y’all</a></span></p><p><strong>You want to respond to the startup of his Super with a Z-Burst Dash.</strong> Using a Dragon Dash to the side and then following up with a Z-Burst Dash will typically get you in the clear. Alternatively, you can leave the stick alone and double-tap the Dragon Dash buttons to instantly get the Z-Burst Dash out. This works well when he starts the match with a super, but sometimes can rush you in front of him due to how he moves. This is the best you can do against an honestly pretty busted start from this jackass space ape.</p><p>Either way, the goal is to get close to him (preferably from behind) and start pummeling him with Rush attacks. You’re free to mash those Rush attacks when hitting him from behind. He can be slow to move around and only has one counter move to brush you away.</p><p><strong>If you’re attacking him in the front, I suggest going with a four-hit combo and then stepping or dashing to the side before trying again.</strong> His throw has great vertical range and can’t be countered, but it’s slow enough that a dash to the side will leave him open. I feel more comfortable using Rush High-Speed Movement because the attacks will build up the spent Ki pretty quickly. Use a Vanishing Assault instead if you’re not confident enough with those close-range side dashes. He’ll enter a hit stun state after enough hits and allow you to launch him.</p><p>Once you’ve slapped him around a couple of times and sent him flying to the ground below, it’s time to start charging your Ki. There’s a solid chance he’ll do the same until he has enough to use his supers. From this point, you have two options: keep whittling him down with close-range attacks, or try to bait out a particular super attack for big damage. Let’s go over the former first.</p><p>Using a Z-Burst dash to rush back to him is arguably the safer place to be. It’s relatively easy to dodge his supers at this range and respond with more Rush attacks or even a Kamehameha to chip more of his health away. You can also use a Kaioken skill once you have enough skill points built up. The Solar Flare skill never worked on him in my experience, while the Kaioken’s buffs were always appreciated. Keep up this routine of weaving past his attacks, hitting him until you get a launch combo, and then charging Ki before you dash in again. It will take a while, but he’ll fall sooner than later.</p><h2 id="h5854"><a id=""></a><strong>SLIDE #3How to Beat Great Ape Vegeta Quickly</strong><br></h2><figure id="" data-id="a91e28bec840b421149693965df62972" data-recommend-id="image://a91e28bec840b421149693965df62972" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku shoots off a Kamehameha in a large beam clash." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Goku shoots off a Kamehameha in a large beam clash." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a91e28bec840b421149693965df62972" data-recommend-id="image://a91e28bec840b421149693965df62972" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku shoots off a Kamehameha in a large beam clash." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I don’t like keeping distance in this fight, because Great Ape Vegeta has a deceptively quick dash that he can use to combo into his supers. Be ready to block or counter if the big guy suddenly zooms into your face. That being said, you can take his health bar down quite a bit if he attacks from afar. <strong>This other strategy is to bait out his Chou Makouhou Super and respond with your Kamehameha Super for a beam clash.</strong> You’ll know it’s the right one when he says “I’ll break you!” before firing a mouth beam.<br></p><p>A cinematic of two beams heading into each other will start to play. Then you just need to beat the minigame to win the struggle. The AI is pretty lenient here, so you should be able to do this with no problem. Winning the beam clash will take off two entire bars of his health. This is one of the most damaging things you can do, but it’s risky and left up to chance. There’s no telling which super he’ll use, or whether he’ll decide to close the gap quickly with a dash. If it works out, you’ll be a lot closer to finishing this fight.</p><p>Remember to charge up your Ki again after the beam clash concludes. You can then decide to try to bait him again with a beam clash or to mix it up with some close-range attacks. I prefer to not tempt fate twice, but he’ll be nearly finished if you can win two beam clashes.</p><hr><p>Great Ape Vegeta isn’t the toughest boss in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, but he is a major knowledge check for the game’s mechanics. Brush up on that knowledge and you’ll be fine. I don’t believe it’s outwardly said, but you shouldn’t think you can skirt around with Ability Item buffs either. Those won’t work in Episode Battles. You’ll need to solely rely on what you learn from training, which to be fair, is the Goku way.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That puts Yajirobe in the same lane as Saibaman, Frieza Soldiers, and Guldo. However, the “bean daddy” is punching way above his weight. </p><p>“Bean daddy,” which I’m going to write as many times as my editor will allow, refers to Yajirobe’s penchant for always saving the day with Korin’s magical Senzu beans. In <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, the series’ number one medic can heal himself repeatedly in matches using a renewable Senzu bean skill for three skill stocks. Combined with his ultimate, it can make him surprisingly effective despite being a back-bencher. </p><p>But the “bean daddy” is even more deadly due to the match timer. Whoever has the most health at the end of the time limit automatically wins. This means that Yajirobe players can simply land some hits and then keep running away and chowing down in order to eke out wins. It’s a cheap strategy that is also completely in keeping with the spirit of the character. And plenty of people are pissed about it. </p><p>The <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> subreddit, Discord, YouTube, and Tiktok are full of players <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/tenkaichi4/comments/1g00fat/criticism_for_ranked_so_far_from_top_ranked/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tenkaichi4/comments/1g00fat/criticism_for_ranked_so_far_from_top_ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confessing to getting wrecked in online matches</a></span> by aspiring “bean daddies.” “Those that play bean daddy and spam senzus have super size dragon balls if you think I’m not gonna find you after that match...” lamented one player on the game’s unofficial Discord. “My only loss was to a Yajirobe dude who had like 5 low dp characters,” wrote another. “He spammed senzu bean and RAN AWAY until time ran out.”</p><p>And the “bean daddy” takeover <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/439864-dragon-ball-sparking-zero/80862609&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/439864-dragon-ball-sparking-zero/80862609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">may just be beginning</a></span>. “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sCXCrqI4xg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sCXCrqI4xg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yajirobe is totally cracked</a></span>,” according to one YouTuber.

He just has to wait it out and knock you away once and boom he’s back to full health again.”</p><p>But calls for “Bean Daddy” nerfs are already getting some pushback. Unlike a lot of fighting games, the <em>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi </em>series upon which <em>Sparking Zero </em>is based was never aimed at pursuing perfect competitive fairness. They were supposed to be a celebration of the anime and the manga that it’s based on, inclusive of all its goofy absurdities and nonsensical plot developments. Some characters have more health and more powerful attacks in <em>Sparking Zero</em>, and to compensate, they take up more points on online rosters. </p><p>The new game focuses on online play and ranked leaderboards (sadly, local matches are limited to a single map), so there will be more pressure to balance characters than in the past. Even so, some want to preserve the series’ unhinged ethos. “Unpopular opinion, I want no character nerfed in<em> Sparking Zero</em>,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Rhymestyle/status/1844157348258181291&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Rhymestyle/status/1844157348258181291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> Twitch streamer rhymstyle. “Let the chaos be as it is designed to be.  this is the<em> Tenkaichi</em> law since 2007.”</p><p><strong>Order Dragon Ball: Sparking!
