<p>Cast your mind back ten years. Done? Good, you survived the hideous form of time travel known as long-term memory. Now, do you see a horrendous first-person shooter anywhere back there, full of memes and intentionally terrible font choices? Congratulations, you may have remembered 420BlazeIt, a freakish eyesore of a game developed during a 7-day game jam by one of the people behind Crossy Road, of all things. It briefly did the YouTuber rounds, back when YouTube was not yet the anxiety-inducing ad factory it is today. </p>
<p>Now I'm going to ask you to come back to the present. But prepare for a bit of a shock - there's a sequel coming to that bong huffing shooter. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/420blazeit-2">420BlazeIt 2</a> has been announced for some months, but now there's a demo you can play too.</p>

<p>It is the "long awaited sequel to the FPS hit", according to the game's irony-soaked <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2624280/420BLAZEIT_2_GAME_OF_THE_YEAR_Dank_Dreams_and_Goated_Memes_wow11_Like_and_Subscribe_Poggerz_Edition/">Steam page</a>. If I was to follow the stylization of the name with complete accuracy, I would have to call it by its full title: 420BLAZEIT 2: GAME OF THE YEAR -=Dank Dreams and Goated Memes=- [#wow/11 Like and Subscribe] Poggerz Edition. </p>
<p>"The illuminati have stolen all the world’s memes!" we're told. "You’re an ex secret-service agent turned to a peaceful life of painting, but now you’re needed one more time to fight back."</p>
<p>The first thing you do is kick a piano to pieces. There is a sign nearby that says "Live, Laugh, Illuminati". As you boot down doors and blast dudes in suits with shotgun shells and AK rounds, you will endure some pounding dubstep in your ears, and the appearance of much comic sans. An arguably sorrowful moment comes when you defeat the bargain bucket swamp ogre "Sherk" while in the clutches of an ocularly punishing multicolour trance. Sherk lays bleeding, pained, dying. The sadness of this moment is undercut somewhat by the continuous vuvuzela horns bellowing over the ogre's dying words.</p><p>So yes, an atrocity upon the optic and aural nerves. The thing is... it actually handles really good? The guns are slickly animated and have a nice sense of recoil, the forceful kick upon a door is suitably hefty, and enemy bodies react to a spray of buckshot in the right sort of way, whether that's by stumbling backwards in pain and firing in the wrong direction, or by ragdolling across the floor with fierce spasms of mortality. Make no mistake, this game is a hideous crime against the ears, eyes, and brain. But it is unusually smooth to the touch. Hmmm.</p>
<p>Perhaps this shouldn't come as a surprise. Andrew Sum, game designer and head of studio Normal Wholesome Games, has previously said he's a big fan of shooters. He also seems very aware that this is a far cry from the other game he is known for, the popular Frogger-like phone game Crossy Road. "If players are surprised, confused, or feeling strong emotions," says his studio website, "then the team can call that a success." </p>
<p>420BlazeIt 2 will also feature a meme slider, letting you presumably adjust just how dank your playthrough can get. The original game did something similar, featuring a "dubstep controller" that worked in the background to detect how many enemies were dying and placed the "drop" accordingly. If you like the sound of that, you can still <a href="https://jigxorandy.itch.io/game-of-the-year">play the original 420BlazeIt</a> today. </p>
<p>Or better yet, grab that demo of the sequel, which we have harvested along with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/wishlisted-october-2024">all the other demos from Steam Next Fest</a>. It's a bumper crop, my friends. A bumper crop.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The announcement of any classic game remake is bound to stir up mixed feelings within a fanbase, and in the case of Silent Hill 2, some were unsure whether Bloober Team had the resume to back them to update such a beloved title. I’ve always enjoyed their games, but their handling of sensitive subjects hasn’t always gone down well, and given the importance of abuse and psychological issues within the world of Silent Hill, this was my main concern for this remake. Thankfully, my worries were fully assuaged;&nbsp;moreover, Bloober has achieved the impossible and produced an update that almost entirely supersedes the classic original.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silent Hill 2 - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7f5qac5f3mE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This remake retells the story of&nbsp;James Sunderland as he returns to the mysterious town of Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his late wife. What follows is a feverish nightmare that blurs the lines between dreams and reality whilst also serving as a haunting metaphor for the longlasting effects of trauma and abuse. Unlike the deliciously pulpy storylines of Resident Evil, Silent Hill is renowned for being darker and more mature and this tone is definitely maintained by Bloober Team.</p>


<p>There’s a moment in the first cutscene where you see a closeup of James’ hand and it’s clear that his wedding ring has gone. While a relatively subtle point it serves as a perfect example of how the extra detail and graphical fidelity can actually serve to improve on a game that relied so much on atmosphere given the technical limitations of its time. This also serves as a metaphor for the game itself – while it is clearly a loving homage and recreation of the original it is also inevitably divorced from it and struggling to become its own thing. I found myself returning to that patch of lighter skin on James’ wedding finger and reflecting on the extra layer of haunting achieved here.</p>


<p>Built within Unreal Engine 5, Silent Hill 2 looks superb. The extra details in the environment, the more sophisticated fog effects (here for effect rather than to hide technical limitations), and the character models all work together to produce a game that emulates my memories of the original rather than the blockier reality. There has been some controversy over character redesigns online, but I’d argue this is unwarranted (if not just pure bad faith) as the various people you meet feel entirely in place here. The different areas you visit are also more distinct than they felt in the original and the use of lighting and shadow is incredible.</p>
<p>Even more impressive is the sound design here. There are updated versions of most of Akira Yamaoka’s iconic score and the discordant tracks still work perfectly to create and cement the uneasy atmosphere. Ambient sounds are incredibly immersive and make for a particularly intense experience when playing with good headphones – as all good horror games should be. The voice acting is also great here, with standout performances from Luke Roberts as James and Salome R. Gunnarsdottir as Mary/Maria. Supporting characters also retain their personalities which means Laura remains just as annoying as she always was, but Eddie is given an extra layer of pathos which I appreciated.</p>

<p>Revisiting the original game before the remake – specifically the Enhanced Edition update on PC – I was surprised by just how well it held up to my nostalgic memories but also by how short it was and how little challenge the combat held thanks, in part, to having an abundance of resources in my inventory.</p>
<p>Bloober Team’s creation is a very different beast.&nbsp;I died a fair amount in my playthrough, whilst also spending far more time managing a more limited amount of consumables and ammunition. Part of the latter stems from an more dynamic system whereby you loot drawers and cupboards for resources rather than there just being set drops. Ammo is far more scarce too, as the default clips of ten bullets are replaced by handfuls.</p>
<p>This limited ammunition is key to the updated combat as the enemies are far more aggressive than in the original. Whilst enemy variety is not increased, the AI of each type has been completely overhauled and many prove to be much more threatening. Perhaps the clearest example of this is the iconic mannequins who were almost passive in the original, but here will respond to your flashlight with unsettlingly jerky and deceptively fast attacks. You can turn off your light to avoid this, but navigating many areas proves impossible without illumination. The mannequins border on being overused, but&nbsp;later levels mix their behaviour up in an unexpected fashion and ensure that they remain a danger.</p>

<p>Melee is a viable approach for most of the enemies, and the updated combat mechanics make fighting far more involved than previously. James is no ninja, though, and so there is a real sense of weight and heft to things as you swing the iconic plank and pipe. Almost all of the weapons from the original return with only one notable exception – the surprise NG+ weapon is especially effective for replays.</p>
<p>In terms of narrative, this is very much the story of Silent Hill 2, but there are many twists and surprises along the way. Puzzles and environments have been revised and updated and the overall effect is wonderfully uncanny as the world feels the same but also different enough to remain unsettling. The sense of homage is maintained through Easter eggs that show memorable landmarks from the original and feed into the sense that you as the player are experiencing an uncanny version of the events just as much as James is.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Silent Hill 2 is a fantastic remake of a true classic, Bloober Team putting their own spin on the iconic horror game. That being said, enough of rough edges remain that could put some players off – ironically the same rough edges that make it so successful for me. These echoes of some of the less positive aspects of the original game, as well as some performance issues on console, are the only negatives in a game that more than does service to the legacy of Silent Hill.	</p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-rising-brings-the-sci-fi-franchise-to-mobile-thanks-to-netease.1009254/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/destiny-rising-brings-the-sci-fi-franchise-to-mobile-thanks-to-netease/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NetEase has announced Destiny: Rising, a mobile RPG shooter based on Bungie's popular sci-fi franchise. The game will be set in an alternate timeline, and its narrative unfolds in the post-Dark Age era. The premise is that, with the help of the Iron Lords, humanity has thrown off the shackles of tyranny and begun to unite against the alien forces bent on its destruction. Amid the chaos of this early age for The City, a new generation of Lightbearers, resurrected by mysterious beings known as Ghosts, set out to restore humanity's greatness and secure its future.</p>
<p>Unlike the regular Destiny games, Destiny: Rising will offer players a choice between first-person and third-person view, supporting both touchscreen and gamepad controls for those seeking greater precision. In another twist from the previous games, the game includes various playable hero characters instead of allowing users to create their own Guardian. The press release says each character will have their own story, personality, and, of course, skillset. Games modes range from campaign missions to the franchise's iconic six-player cooperative Strikes, but there will also be brand new PvE and PvP modes. There will be a strong focus on cooperative play, allowing users to create clans and customized shared spaces.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/3-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Destiny: Rising will include in-game locations like the sanctuary of Haven, a refuge for Lightbearers and survivors, the icy, ancient metro of Jiangshi, and the arid expanse of the Red Sea Rift. As you'd expect from a Destiny game, players will find plenty of loot, chiefly the powerful Exotic weapons with many different Trait combinations.</p>
<p>Ethan Wang, Senior Vice President at NetEase, stated:</p>
<p><em>With Destiny: Rising, NetEase Games is honored to partner with Bungie to deliver a Destiny-caliber experience to mobile devices. Destiny is an incredible franchise with a passionate and dedicated global fanbase. As huge fans ourselves, we are humbled and thrilled for the opportunity to bring gamers an action-packed RPG shooter set within the Destiny Universe.</em></p>
<p>Terry Redfield, Creative Lead at Bungie, added:</p>
<p><em>For over a decade, we have built this universe to contain many unique and wonderful stories, and we are excited to see mobile gamers be able to experience this new take on the Destiny universe from the creative team at NetEase.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny: Rising Developer Preview | &quot;What is Destiny: Rising?&quot;" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uQPomw5UBCU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is the first outcome we've seen from NetEase's $100+ million investment in Bungie, which was&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-gets-100-m-investment-netease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> around six years ago. Fans won't have to wait long to check it out, as a limited Closed Alpha test is scheduled for next month, and registrations are open now <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/14/24269790/destiny-rising-mobile-rpg-shooter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The rumors are true, the <em>Destiny </em>franchise is heading to mobile devices soon. <em>Destiny: Rising</em> is a new free-to-play mobile sci-fi RPG shooter that includes a number of playable hero characters, a shared world, and PvE and PvP modes all set in Bungie’s <em>Destiny </em>universe.</p><p>China-based NetEase Games has developed <em>Destiny: Rising</em>, after announcing a partnership with Bungie and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/3/17422410/bungie-netease-100-million-investment-china-destiny-business">$100 million investment</a> into the studio in 2018. <em>Destiny: Rising</em> will be set in an alternative <em>Destiny </em>timeline, exploring the post-Dark Age era of the universe and lore before the Tower existed and before the emergence of Guardians.</p><div><figcaption><em>Destiny: Rising will be set in the Destiny universe.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: NetEase</cite></p></div><p>NetEase is licensing the Destiny brand from Bungie and it has been granted creative freedom to develop its own storyline and vision for <em>Destiny: Rising</em>. “We want to capture and depict a specific time where the reins are in the hands of the players to experience, to explore, to define,” says Stone Shi, senior narrative designer, at NetEase.</p><p>Unlike <em>Destiny</em> or <em>Destiny 2</em>, you’ll be able to pick from a variety of <em>Destiny </em>hero characters instead of creating your own Guardian based on Hunter, Warlock, or Titan classes. Hero characters include ones like Ikora Rey<strong> </strong>that exists in <em>Destiny</em> and <em>Destiny 2</em>, as well as a host of new characters.</p><p>Each character will have unique abilities and stories, and will be able to access single, co-op, and competitive multiplayer modes. There will also be the usual Ghosts, Lightbearers, Iron Lords, and Warlords found in the <em>Destiny </em>universe before the Last City. In a trailer for the game we see a variety of characters and their new abilities, including a new void scythe that looks a lot like something a Warlock would use in the main <em>Destiny </em>games. There are also familiar enemies like the Hive, Fallen, and Vex.</p><p>“For over a decade, we&nbsp;have&nbsp;built this universe to contain&nbsp;many&nbsp;unique&nbsp;and wonderful&nbsp;stories,&nbsp;and&nbsp;we&nbsp;are&nbsp;excited to&nbsp;see&nbsp;mobile gamers&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;experience this&nbsp;new&nbsp;take&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Destiny&nbsp;universe&nbsp;from the creative team at&nbsp;NetEase,” says Terry&nbsp;Redfield, creative&nbsp;lead at&nbsp;Bungie, in a press release.</p><p><em>Destiny: Rising</em> players will also be able to play in first-person or even third-person view, with touchscreen controls or controllers. There will be the usual campaign missions, six-player co-op strikes, and replayable PvE and PvP modes.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Mythic loot in Destiny: Rising.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: NetEase</cite></p></div><p>Even powerful exotic weapons will be available, alongside a new Mythic weapon rarity class that includes a new weapon type, too. All of these weapons help to fight against the darkness enemies in the <em>Destiny </em>universe in new locations like Jiangshi and the Red Sea&nbsp;Rift. Part of this new <em>Destiny </em>narrative includes searching for seeds of hope that are said to “shape the future of human civilization” after its collapse in the Dark Age of <em>Destiny </em>lore.</p><p>One big question around <em>Destiny: Rising</em> is what monetization system it will use. NetEase isn’t answering that just yet, but it <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/news/20241011/41118_1186026.html">says in an FAQ</a> that a “good part of the main campaign will be available” in the alpha test next month alongside “at least one map for all game modes” so people can try out what the game has to offer.</p><p><em>Destiny: Rising </em>will be available first as a limited access closed alpha test on November 1st in the US and Canada. You can register for the test version at <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/">NetEase’s website</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I react to this news with mingled happiness and disappointment. Disappointment at the delay, and happiness, because I hadn't heard of Beyond These Stars before. To coincide with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2295060/announcements/detail/4544786458111529328">the delay announcement </a>they've released a new trailer, below, which talks us through the business of foraging on passing planets. It looks engrossing.</p><!--more-->

<p>If you missed Kaan's (RPS in Gamesradar) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/before-we-leave-devs-next-chill-city-builder-is-set-on-top-of-a-giant-space-whale">announcement post from February 2023</a>, Beyond These Stars sees you raising a hex-based settlement on the back of an enormous interstellar animal. The creature is named Kewa, and its hide is rich in resources and buildable terrain.</p>
<p>Being a literally living, breathing world, however, it will be affected by your presence. In the course of the campaign, you must decide whether to form a symbiotic partnership with your host, or treat the beast as brusquely as I treat my own allotment grow bags, and plunge it into sickness and sorrow. Myself, I would probably avoid irritating <em>the planet-sized whale</em>, if only because any other star-faring species you encounter will take note of the state of your companion, and respond to you appropriately.</p><p>Beyond These Stars is, in general, very much an eco-fable that strives to avoid any suggestion of conquering territory and stripping it raw. This extends to the choice of resourcing and building options. You'll have to think about irrigation and topsoil quality while maintaining tree populations to cultivate a healthy atmosphere.</p>
<p>All this sits atop more generic building sim questions that perhaps encourage you to play more callously, such as structure adjacency bonuses and worker travel times. I always find it interesting to read about how games such as this try to resist the build-exploit-expand rhythms of their genre. As for the visual presentation in the trailer: the vital space whale component gets a bit lost behind the menus, but it all seems rather gorgeous, with water spilling through canals and clouds foaming up over forest canopies. </p>
<p>Anything you can't find on Kewa, you might be able to find by sending a rocket to establish an outpost on a nearby planet. This isn't space colonialism, the developers insist. The planets in question once "belonged" to the ancestors of your citizens, aka Peeps. As such "the Peeps are effectively reclaiming land that used to be theirs; we took care to ensure no implication that they would be displacing any other beings in the process."</p>
<p>The townsfolk are, moreover, "strictly vegetarian", so they won't be eating any of those adorable space chickens and space cows you see on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2295060/Beyond_These_Stars/">the Steam page</a>. Nor will they be mining the planets they land on, though this is more for the sake of keeping the focus on Kewa than avoiding any historical parallels. I think there's perhaps a touch of "having your 4X empire cake and eating it" here, but I respect the commitment to themes and playstyles beyond setting up oil rigs all over.</p><p>As for the release delay into 2025, "it's very important for us that we take the time to implement everything properly for our Early Access launch, and that we do so in a way that doesn't burn out our team," the developers write. "Because of this, our initially projected 2024 release date has had to shift."

Because again, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thegamepost.com/destiny-rising-heroes-missions-strikes-pvp-bungie/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-rising-heroes-missions-strikes-pvp-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the rumors</a></span> have pointed toward it being the Chinese company which is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.threads.net/@jeffygrubbgrubb/post/C_d1YEePg7G&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.threads.net/@jeffygrubbgrubb/post/C_d1YEePg7G" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largely responsible</a></span> for <em>Destiny</em>’s mobile incarnation, rather than Bungie themselves. This is rather starkly born out by the announcement video, which includes Bungie lead producer Tritia Medrano saying, “We here at Bungie are so excited that NetEase has invited us to join them as they announce their brand new mobile game...”</p><p>It was NetEase, of course, who also co-developed <em>Diablo Immortal </em>with Blizzard.</p><p>Bungie’s role appears to have been to “support” NetEase, which backs up rumors that suggested the developer had backed off the project a few years back. The hostage video-style appearances of Bungie employees seems like an effort to appease the inevitable backlash from fans.</p><p>Very similar in conceit to <em>Destiny 2</em> on consoles and PC, <em>Rising</em> will be a third-person looter shooter, with all the PvP, strikes and storyline you’d expect, although it’s to be set in a rather convenient “alternate <em>Destiny</em> timeline,” and before the events of the previous games.</p><p>The game’s setting puts it before the establishment of hunters, titans and warlocks, so the game’s Lightbearers will have a whole new set of class archetypes. It’ll also include recognisable modes—missions, strikes, and six-player PVE—but also add new modes of its own. We don’t yet know what they are, but boy will they be “immersive.”</p><p>Perhaps the most telling line of all, that speaks to the bizarre nature of a Bungie-owned franchise being made by a totally different developer, comes when NetEase’s senior narrative designer, Caroline Wan, explains the relationship. “We’re very grateful to Bungie for their amazing support,” she begins, making me wonder if there had been a depth of collaboration. She continues, “granting us the creative freedom to develop and nurture our own vision.” Oh.</p><p>And you can bet it’ll be absolutely riddled with microtransactions. Although obviously nothing about these has been mentioned.</p><p><em>Diablo Immortal </em>has courted no small amount of controversy with its incessant nags that you spend your way to glory. Which is all the more frustrating, given <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-immortal-blizzard-review-mobile-rpg-ios-android-1849003750&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-immortal-blizzard-review-mobile-rpg-ios-android-1849003750">it’s a really good game underneath all that</a></span>, and remains one even if you never pay a penny. Although pay pennies people did, the “free” game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-immortal-earnings-1-million-blizzard-arpg-mobile-1849144951&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-immortal-earnings-1-million-blizzard-arpg-mobile-1849144951">making an eye-watering $50 million</a></span> in its first month.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24267805/neva-nomada-studio-interview-gris-devolver<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After the launch of <em>Gris</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137844/gris-review-nintendo-switch-pc-gaming">a beautiful game exploring grief</a>, the team at Nomada Studio in Barcelona needed a long break. They spent around half a year not even thinking about what was next, avoiding words like “Unity” or “sequel.” Eventually, director Conrad Roset, who became a parent during that time, came up with the idea of a similar experience that would introduce a new companion, allowing players to connect with and care for another character.</p><p>“I told him, no problem, as long as it’s not a four-legged animal, you can do whatever you want,” says lead producer Roger Mendoza, noting that animating critters with lots of legs can be “quite painful.” But the director was able to make the case for a game called <em>Neva</em> about a young woman who goes on an emotional journey with a magical fox creature. “I think it was worth it,” Mendoza admits.</p><p><em>Neva</em> launches on October 15th (it’s coming to PC, Switch, Xbox, and PS5), and like <em>Gris</em>, it’s a stunningly animated 2D adventure. Players take on the role of a young woman caring for a young fox pup named Neva, trying to usher it to safety in a world filled with dark forces that look ripped out of <em>Spirited Away</em>. It only takes around five hours to finish, but the game spans a long period of time; each chapter is a different season, and you see the fox grow over time. At first, it’s a relatively helpless pup, but by the end, it becomes your protector.</p><p><em>Neva</em> and <em>Gris</em> share a lot in common: the short length, approachable gameplay, incredible art and animation, and narrative that’s told almost entirely without words. (<em>Neva</em> does have some voice acting, but it’s multiple variations of the heroine calling out Neva’s name. “I think we recorded 500 different ways of saying Neva,” jokes Mendoza.) But the new game also introduces two major features: not only a second character but also combat.</p><div><p>“When she’s not with you, you really feel it.”</p></div><p>According to Mendoza, the latter was inspired by the former. “[The addition of Neva] was in a way where the combat came from — we thought it would be a good mechanic to bring together the fact that there’s a companion now,” he explains. Early on, you have to fight to protect the fox, but as she grows up and changes, so, too, does that dynamic. “Now she’s the one who is taking care of you,” Mendoza says. “When she’s not with you, you really feel it. Combat felt like a good way to tie everything together.”</p><p>This presented a number of design challenges, most notably in terms of accessibility. One of <em>Gris</em>’ biggest strengths was how easy it was to pick up and play; it even worked well on a smartphone touchscreen. But the added layer of complexity that comes from combat and a companion meant that <em>Neva</em> “isn’t as approachable as <em>Gris</em>,” according to Mendoza. “That’s something that we knew early on; the moment you add more controls, it becomes more difficult.” To account for this, the developers designed the game from the beginning with a story mode, where you can’t die in battle. “That was a way to try to find the right balance,” he says.</p><p>The success of <em>Gris</em> — the game <a href="https://x.com/nomadastudiobcn/status/1838963894712221984">sold more than 3 million copies to date</a> — gave the studio the confidence to both push in these more ambitious directions but also continue to pursue its strengths. One of the major learnings from that game, according to Mendoza, was that “you can do a strong narrative without the need for words. It’s something that we had no idea if it would work on <em>Gris</em>.” <em>Neva</em> takes things a step further, with a more direct storyline that covers a number of topics simultaneously — not only the evolving nature of a parental relationship but also overt themes about environmental destruction. Again, this story is conveyed almost entirely through art, sound, and animation.</p><p>The other major learning from <em>Gris</em> was more practical. One of the main reasons that game’s development was so stressful and required such a long post-launch vacation was that the team was relatively small. In fact, only two programmers worked on <em>Gris</em> at all, forcing lots of late nights and long hours. Now that many members of Nomada are a little older, with families of their own, work-life balance is a much bigger priority. And so one of the most important changes between <em>Gris</em> and <em>Neva</em> was a seemingly simple one: “we hired more programmers.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sektori promises to "transport you into another state of consciousness", but what the pulsing soundtrack initially did was transport me to Youtube so I could look up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfSndZPynQk">this scene from Spaced</a>, where Michael Smiley raves out to a boiling kettle. By elegant coincidence, that video is about the length of my longest run so far in Sektori's demo - a very busy 60 seconds or so.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>How exactly does Sektori propose to transport you to another state of consciousness? Via the holy medium of techno. And also, via the holy medium of being swamped by fleets of angry Xmas decorations. Yes, it's a twin stick shooter - a lost cousin of Bizarre's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-geometry-wars-retro-evolved">Geometry Wars series</a> in its specific combination of astral pretties, score-attack arenas and withering odds. I quite like it. Frankly, the only reason I disengaged is that when you perish, the demo takes you to a "wishlist now!" menu with a really annoying three second countdown before you can respawn. Three seconds? Why, I could die at least six times in that time. I have already wishlisted, Sektori - now please, let me get my uninterrupted fill of being murdered by triangles.</p>

<p>The full game will have a variety of modes, including a traditional arcade campaign for the purists, and a choice of ships and modifiers.  The demo gives one mode to butt heads with - Surge. This lumbers you with a peashooter and an occasionally life-saving, generally life-endangering rushdown attack that blows up anything in your path. As you harvest the stardust of slain geometry, you'll activate collectible power-ups that, once you've frantically found your way to them, briefly transform you into an absolute geyser of bullets and missiles, causing you to immediately lose track of yourself and fly into a wall. Look, I only played the demo for 10 minutes. I'm sure I'll improve. The only way is up.</p>
<p>Adding insult to injury, sometimes the arenas shapeshift. Swathes of triangular grid flicker red and fold inward, boxing you in as you strive to thread the throng and reach the power-up across the way.</p>
<p>"With Sektori I wanted to create a shoot'em up where every run feels familiar, but is still completely unique," comments developer Kimmo Lahtinen on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2105620/Sektori/">the Steam page</a>. "A game of skill, not memorization. The hand crafted attack waves, levels and even the bosses are combined and randomized and layered with the upgrade systems in a way that creates an interesting challenge for every run.</p>
<p>"The aesthetics of the game are very much inspired by techno music," he continues. "Fast, detailed, colorful, saturated, intense, aggressive." I am here for it, and I don't even like techno. Shame there's no release date yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s not really a spoiler, as the game’s reveal trailer showed this very moment off and it’s the very first thing you’ll experience when you start playing.

Like its predecessor, <em>Neva</em> has gorgeous visuals and often-delicious platforming puzzles. The sophomore title falters, however, in how it executes on its often too-familiar themes. For those who have played <em>Gris</em>, this game’s distinctive art style and animation resembling that of a hand-drawn film make it abundantly clear the same team is behind it. That pedigree isn’t always a good thing, however, as the game fails to strike out on its own, instead falling back on creative choices we’ve seen before. <em>Neva</em>’s story about our relationship with nature and the cycle of life seems ripe with potential, but it never knows how to deliver on that promise.</p><h2 id="h608378"><a id=""></a><strong>A story of seasons</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="d7d35e19ddb640eaf040286c4b73a4f0" data-recommend-id="image://d7d35e19ddb640eaf040286c4b73a4f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Devolver Digital</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d7d35e19ddb640eaf040286c4b73a4f0" data-recommend-id="image://d7d35e19ddb640eaf040286c4b73a4f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While the wolf pup gets top billing in <em>Neva</em>, that is not the part you play. Rather, you step into the shoes of Alba, a surrogate parent for the now orphaned Neva. A young woman living in a gorgeous forest inhabited by larger-than-life deer, boar, and wolves, Alba has known Neva seemingly since birth, as we see her fighting a wave of enemies made of some sort of nature-killing plague alongside the pup and their parent in the game’s opening cinematic. With the forest around them rapidly dying due to this new threat, the pair embark on a journey that’ll last a full cycle of the seasons (or roughly five hours of game time). Along the way, you’ll help guide Neva from a small, nervous pup into a colossal wolf as you fight off the now infected inhabitants of the world.<br></p><p>Before you even set out on your adventure, though, which has massive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-tears-kingdom-princess-mononoke-anime-1850333639&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-tears-kingdom-princess-mononoke-anime-1850333639"><em>Princess Mononoke</em></a></span><em> </em>vibes throughout (if you couldn’t already tell from the giant wolf in the game’s opening and its female companion), you’ll likely be dazzled by <em>Neva</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/check-out-how-beautiful-side-scrolling-platformer-neva-1851661108&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/check-out-how-beautiful-side-scrolling-platformer-neva-1851661108">gorgeous visuals</a></span>. Much like <em>Gris</em> before it, <em>Neva</em> takes a painterly approach to its presentation. An early shot of the game’s starring duo resting underneath a massive flowering tree is particularly stunning and sets the bar for every beautiful vista to come. The leaves of skyscraper-tall trees are composed of countless little colorful dots that smudge together in a way Georges Seurat would approve of. As the game begins in summer and progresses through the seasons, the color palette becomes more muted, with the growing infection killing nature also playing its part. <em>Gris</em> was a game that started in greyscale and had you bringing color into the world. <em>Neva</em> reverses that, and it’s a wonderful visual journey to go on.</p><h2 id="h608379"><a id=""></a><strong>Lone wolf and cub</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="0a7aa48dd7a0215c069bdd1c3605b584" data-recommend-id="image://0a7aa48dd7a0215c069bdd1c3605b584" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Devolver Digital</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0a7aa48dd7a0215c069bdd1c3605b584" data-recommend-id="image://0a7aa48dd7a0215c069bdd1c3605b584" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You navigate <em>Neva</em> through 2D platforming, which sees you run, jump, double jump, and dash through its lush natural environments. There are plenty of platforming puzzles, but there’s also combat, a mechanic absent in <em>Gris</em>. While I was initially concerned about how combat would be integrated into this narrative-heavy platformer, after a full playthrough I can say it’s mostly okay. You’ll slash your way through a number of enemy varieties, some of which take a little more thought to defeat than others and be on your way. As Neva grows from season to season, you’ll also unlock new ways to incorporate them into battles. Combat isn’t particularly bad, but it also isn’t good enough to make it satisfying to engage with, which makes the game’s boss battles (which come near the end of every chapter) low points of your short adventure.<br></p><p>Platforming, on the other hand, feels delightful, which becomes especially true as <em>Neva</em> introduces new challenges. Yet, just as in <em>Gris</em>, these interesting variations on the game’s standard platforming often only get brief spotlights before being thrown away entirely. One area required me to navigate invisible platforms by looking at a reflection of the level, which made it so the controls felt backwards as I leapt through the air, hoping to not fall to my death. Subsequent rooms added more reflections and different perspectives, making them even more fun to navigate, but before long I was through this particular series of levels and would never face a similar challenge again. I can’t help but think it would have been better to have a smaller assortment of innovative wrinkles to the core gameplay that each got a bigger spotlight.</p><h2 id="h608380"><a id=""></a><strong>It’s the circle of life </strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="5c1df63eba6da0386c59a0961e695280" data-recommend-id="image://5c1df63eba6da0386c59a0961e695280" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Devolver Digital</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5c1df63eba6da0386c59a0961e695280" data-recommend-id="image://5c1df63eba6da0386c59a0961e695280" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/neva-tribeca-games-demo-impressions-the-last-guardian-1851539029&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/neva-tribeca-games-demo-impressions-the-last-guardian-1851539029">previewed</a></span> <em>Neva</em> this June, I came away excited for the potential of this story. But having completed it now, I find that it’s a game of potential that is never reached. In the game’s earliest chapter, Summer, Neva’s companionship feels meaningful, in part because you must constantly be aware of the young pup. If you aren’t paying attention, they’ll run off or fall off a ledge and struggle to follow you. Calling for Neva and petting them, which you can do at any time with the press of a button, promises that forging this bond between Alba and Neva will mean something.<br></p><p>Yet that never feels true in later chapters. Eventually Neva just becomes a tool for Alba (and you) to utilize during combat or platforming, but never a true partner. The focus on an NPC companion puts this game in conversation with the likes of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/08/icos-graveyard-was-more-than-nightmare-fuel/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/08/icos-graveyard-was-more-than-nightmare-fuel/"><em>Ico</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-guardian-the-kotaku-review-1789666352&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-guardian-the-kotaku-review-1789666352"><em>The Last Guardian</em></a></span>, but unlike those games, it fails to understand the importance of allowing such a companion some level of freedom that may sometimes grate against the player’s wishes but that ultimately leads to a wonderful symbiotic relationship forged through challenges. </p><p>In theory, the game’s combat serves a thematic purpose as well, in that it allows you to actively fight for a better world. As Alba and Neva make journey on, they’re constantly waylaid by the once-thriving fauna of the forest, now infested with the same corruption poisoning the land itself, and by engaging you directly in that struggle, the game seems to assert itself as an environmentalist call to arms. Unfortunately, however, these themes never go more than skin-deep. Beyond destroying the threat, Alba and Neva can’t work to meaningfully bring life back into the world. Neva is the only animal you as the player directly have responsibility over and interact with, and even they become nothing more than another tool to wield in the context of combat. There is a lot of set-up that left me waiting for the game to say something meaningful, but it never paid off. With the game’s narrative failing to commit to the environmentalist message, the inclusion of combat feels like an afterthought whose only real purpose is to give the player some busywork in the form of enemies to cut down.<br></p><p>Instead, <em>Neva</em> prioritizes a meditation on life and loss that too often feels half-baked and pales in comparison to <em>Gris</em>’ execution of the same themes. Much of <em>Neva</em> feels propped up by its predecessor to cover its weaknesses, with familiar themes and the same platforming (flaws and all) from <em>Gris</em> encouraging fans of that game to not look too closely at this game’s faults. Ultimately, when <em>Neva</em> attempts a final narrative twist that fully leans away from the initially compelling and original themes of its story, it’s too much of a shift too late in the game, and only serves to undermine the few unique choices this experience attempts. At least it’s short.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/payday-3-felt-unfinished-developers-admit-a-year-after-disastrous-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>To say the launch of Payday 3 was bad would be an understatement. The game released with so many problems that Starbreeze CEO <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payday-3-flawed-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to publicly apologize</a>. Things only got worse at the time as updates to fix player concerns <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payday-3-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were regularly delayed</a>. </p>



<p>Now, over a year since its release, Starbreeze once again admits that the game’s launch was  “disastrous” with the game feeling “unfinished” in a lot of ways. </p>



<p>“When you have a launch like we did – a disastrous launch, where nobody is able to play the game – there is no place to hide,” Starbreeze community head Almir Listo said in a new <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/payday-3/interview-starbreeze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with PCGamesN</a>. “But it’s important that we don’t use the technical issues as an excuse because we clearly missed the mark from an experience point of view as well. </p>



<p>“The game just felt unfinished. It was a bad experience for our players.”</p>



<p>Listo added that while its hard to make video games, it’s even tougher to make a game after a successful game that lasted a decade.</p>



<p>“Andreas and myself were part of the Payday 2 development team at that time,” he said. “Not everyone, ten years on, was still there. To draw the exact right learning from a ten-year production is challenging, but also every game project is different from another one. I think a lot of small things built up.”</p>



<h2 id="h-what-happened-with-payday-3-s-launch">What Happened With Payday 3’s Launch?</h2>



<p>Lead Producer Andreas Penniger said that many of the problems came from the studio not doing their “due diligence” with what the players actually wanted from the game.</p>



<p>“It ended up being a product that people didn’t resonate with,” he said. “I think we were a bit confident from the success of Payday 2 that we ended up making decisions too quickly.”</p>



<p>With the game out for over a year and a number of updates released to players, Starbreeze is hoping that Payday 3 can have the same turnaround games like Cyberpunk 2077 had after a less-than-ideal launch.</p>



<p>“Something we’ve learned is to try and understand the community, understand what made Payday 2 successful, and then to try and translate that into a more modern context,” Penniger said. </p>



<p>“While we haven’t communicated what year two might be, for me, the game currently suffers from a split personality – trying to be too many things at once. Our focus needs to be a stronger core fantasy. Every heist needs to feel more tense, open-ended, and rewarding.”</p>

<p>Microsoft shared the news this afternoon, while adding it's also bringing Xbox Cloud Gaming support to both Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Call of Duty: Warzone for Game Pass Ultimate members.</p>
<p>This is all happening on the same day: 25th October.</p>

<p>"This is a first for the Call of Duty franchise, and a win for the community," Microsoft wrote in an accompanying <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/14/call-of-duty-coming-to-cloud-october-25/">blog post</a>. "Players will be able to access multiple Call of Duty games with Xbox Cloud Gaming for the first time, and Game Pass Ultimate members will be able to enjoy Call of Duty in more places than ever before."</p><p>This all means those members on Microsoft's Ultimate Game Pass tier will be able to experience the aforementioned Call of Duty titles on consoles and PC, as well as mobile devices and "select" Samsung TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Meta Quest devices.</p>
<p>"This opens up even more ways to play Black Ops 6 starting on day one at launch," the company proclaimed.</p>

<p>In August last year, Microsoft agreed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-sell-activision-blizzard-streaming-rights-to-ubisoft">sell the streaming rights for Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft</a>. At this time, Microsoft president Brad Smith said this change would mean Microsoft won't control the "exclusive" rights to stream <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> games.</p><p>"Under the restructured transaction, Microsoft will not be in a position either to release Activision Blizzard games exclusively on its own cloud streaming service - Xbox Cloud Gaming - or to exclusively control the licensing terms of Activision Blizzard games for rival services," Smith wrote last August.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, I have not yet seen mention of Ubisoft being involved with any Call of Duty cloud dealings.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is set to release across PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC.

<p>"Our energy was like 'we're a rock band, and we're coming onto the stage, and we've got a new album'. And the whole stage just collapsed and everyone left."</p>
<p>On its release last year, Payday 3 struggled with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-players-endure-second-consecutive-day-of-server-issues-preventing-them-from-playing">matchmaking issues</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-requires-an-always-on-online-connection">unpopular online-only requirements</a>, while its first major patch was hit with repeated delays, eventually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3s-much-delayed-first-patch-is-finally-here">arriving</a> two months after the game's troubled launch. Since then Starbreeze has released two additional major bug fixing patches <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3s-second-operation-medic-bag-patch-is-now-available">under the name Operation Medic Bag</a>, and introduced an early <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-is-finally-getting-an-offline-mode">offline mode</a>. Amid all this, the studio revealed it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-and-dragons-game-in-the-works-from-payday-developer-starbreeze">working on a Dungeons and Dragons game</a>.</p>
<p>Listo cites the launch issues as particularly problematic, but said it was "important that we don't use the technical issues as an excuse because we'd clearly missed the mark from an experience point of view as well. The game just felt unfinished".</p>
<p>Admitting that if the team had just carried on as if there was nothing wrong, the game "would be dead at this point", Listo also took time to acknowledge the importance of feedback from the Payday community.</p>
<p>"If we just put our heads in the sand and continued on, the game would be dead at this point. But even the angriest Payday fans still come from a good place. They want the game to succeed, and their anger is only a reflection of that.</p>
<p>"They're not hating on the game just to be haters - they're telling us what they want the game to have, in order for it to improve."</p>
<p>I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-review">awarded Payday 3 three out of five stars</a> last year, calling it a "shallow shooter that doesn't offer anywhere near enough bang for your ill-gotten buck."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be available on Xbox Cloud Gaming at launch. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/14/call-of-duty-coming-to-cloud-october-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft has announced</a> that Black Ops 6, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (2023), and Warzone will all be available starting October 25 on the cloud with Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>“We’ve shared our vision to deliver great gaming experiences for players across devices,” Corporate Vice President, Gaming Experiences &amp; Platforms Ashley McKissick wrote. “Today, we’re excited to continue bringing new opportunities to enjoy some of your favorite games wherever you are.”&nbsp;</p>







<p>Starting at 1pm ET/10am PT on Black Ops 6 release day, all three games will be available on the cloud for Game Pass Ultimate members.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is the first game in series history to launch day one on Game Pass. Microsoft is hoping that its availability will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-game-pass-subscriptions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lead to increased subscriptions</a> to the game service.</p>



<p>“This is a first for the Call of Duty franchise, and a win for the community,” McKissick said. “Players will be able to access multiple Call of Duty games with Xbox Cloud Gaming for the first time, and Game Pass Ultimate members will be able to enjoy Call of Duty in more places than ever before…”</p>



<p>In addition to Xbox Game Pass and Cloud Gaming, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The game features a number of changes, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-omnidirectional-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new omnimovement</a>, classic prestige, and more. It was also recently confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-campaign-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game won’t have campaign</a> early access.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-ps5-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/life-is-strange-double-exposure-ps5-preview-%E2%80%93-a-max-between-worlds.1009137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-ps5-preview/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Arcadia Bay is all but a forgotten memory for some. Washed away in a brutal storm, the town that Max Caulfield, Chloe Price, and so many others called home has simply ceased to be. Now, years after those traumatic memories have finally subsided, Max is ready to pick things back up and start a new life in Life is Strange: Double Exposure.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Life-is-Strange-DE-Chloe.png"></a></figure>

<p>Square-Enix invited us to take an early look at the first two chapters of <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure/">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a> in their entirety. This will be the same Early Access that owners of the Ultimate Edition will gain access to starting on October 15th, a full two weeks ahead of the five-chapter game's full release.</p>
<p>Max Caulfield is certainly making a name for herself as a promising student at Caledon University, having won a number of awards and a residency through the prestigious school's art programs. Take one step into the Fine Arts Building that serves as a central hub for students and faculty to bump into each other over a quick cup of coffee and you'll see Max's photos all over the place as part of an art exhibit. This version of Max Caulfield has taken her past trauma and turned it into a form of self-expression through the photos she routinely takes. This is a Max whose time-traveling and bending days are behind her, and she's simply trying to enjoy a normal life once more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/LIfe-is-Strange-DE-Moses.png"></a></figure>

<p>Normal for Max Caulfield is rarely that. She hasn't quite grown out of her snarky self-talking phase, so if you were one to mute the TV while rummaging through the various knickknacks of Max's bedroom, you'll find no quarter here. Cute double entendre have instead been replaced with banter that's practically oozing with sexual tension, whether it's with the cute bartender who Max has a crush on, the administrative assistant who, by and large, feels like a grease ball no matter how much they try to humanize him and his faults, and the various other university fellows around.</p>
<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure centers around her relationships with a couple of close friends primarily: an up-and-coming poet named Safi Llewelyn-Fayyad whose mother is the President of Caledon University and Moses, a young astronomer whose dreams are in the stars. Amidst a meteor shower and a quiet gathering on the school's roof, Safi breaks from the group for a short while. In this time, she is tragically gunned down and left in the snow for Max and Moses to discover. It's this pivotal moment that serves as the crux for Life is Strange: Double Exposure's narrative.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Life-is-Strange-DE-Amanda.png"></a></figure>

<p>Those rewind powers that served Max so well in her first story have since atrophied and can no longer be relied upon. Instead, through perhaps a gift of the meteor shower or her own sheer determination to try and change the past, Max discovers that rather than moving to a previous time, her powers have grown to allow her to tear open a rift and travel to an alternate timeline: one where Safi is still alive.</p>
<p>Much of Life is Strange: Double Exposure's gameplay hinges on this dual-world mechanic. Venturing into a timeline where Safi is still alive is not quite a perfect world either, as the relationships between the various residents of Caledon University are strained in various ways. A character who might be the nurturing type in one timeline might have a fractured home life in another. In the world where Safi has passed, many of the residents have instead turned to coping mechanics such as alcohol and the downfall that slowly builds.</p>
<figure>

<p>Early on, not much can be done with this newfound power in Life is Strange: Double Exposure. It starts initially with an ability to peer into the other world, seeing ghostly afterimages of people walking by or catching snippets of conversations on the wind. However, Max soon discovers that she can affect both timelines at once by carrying objects from one world into the other. This mechanic is largely used in the second chapters for menial items, such as keys and email printouts, but quickly grows as the demo comes to a close. While being unable to rewind loses much of its immediate potential, this world-shifting power might be the key to unraveling Safi's death in one world and preventing it in the other.</p>
<p>All in all, I left my time at Caledon University quite impressed with how they showed Max Caulfield's personal growth while giving players one more chance to go on a wild adventure with her. Even though Dontnod have already stepped away from the series early on, I have faith that Deck Nine and Square-Enix can do right by bringing Max Caulfield's story to an eventual close.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-head-retiring<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox Game Studios head Alan Hartman is retiring at the end of next month, and Rare head Craig Duncan is apparently set to take his place.</p>
<p>That's according to a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rares-craig-duncan-to-become-head-of-xbox-game-studios-as-alan-hartman-retires" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz article</a>, which cites an internal email sent to Xbox staff by studio boss Matt Booty. In that email, Booty celebrates Hartman's "innovation, dedication, and...unwavering passion for gaming".</p>
<p>As he points out, Hartman's career with Microsoft began as a contractor in 1988, and he would go on to work on franchises like&nbsp;<em>Age of Empires</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Freelancer</em>,&nbsp;as well as being included in the credits of games like&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Sea of Thieves</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forza-alan-hartman-xbox-game-studios.jpg?itok=_W6bMg1k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forza-alan-hartman-xbox-game-studios.jpg?itok=UZax8DOq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Alan Hartman's illustrious career includes work on franchises like&nbsp;<em>Forza</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Hartman was also involved in the founding of&nbsp;<em>Forza&nbsp;</em>developer Turn 10, which was established back in 2001 to steward the racing franchise.</p>
<p>He would go on to become Turn 10's studio manager in 2005, a position in which he served all the way up until 2023, when he was made the head of Xbox Game Studios (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-studios-rebranded-as-xbox-game-studios">rebranded from Microsoft Studios back in 2019</a>) after former position holder Matt Booty was promoted.</p>
<p>All told, this means Hartman will have served as Xbox Game Studios head for just over a year at the point of his retirement, which isn't a bad innings.</p>
<p>Hartman's replacement, Craig Duncan, is the current studio head of Microsoft subsidiary Rare, a position he's held since 2011. His appointment makes a lot of sense given that Rare is a Microsoft studio, as well as the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172620/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">continuing success</a> of Rare's live-service game&nbsp;<em>Sea of Thieves</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sea-of-thieves-rare-xbox-game-studios.jpg?itok=2t9-hNXG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sea-of-thieves-rare-xbox-game-studios.jpg?itok=CtC289uT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Craig Duncan has been the head of Rare since 2011, where he's overseen games like&nbsp;<em>Sea of Thieves</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether Duncan's appointment will result in any kind of concrete change in terms of Xbox Game Studios' strategy remains to be seen, but the label has a number of games on the horizon, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fable-2025">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Fable&nbsp;</em>reboot</a> and Obsidian's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/avowed">first-person RPG&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em></a>.</p>
<p>Duncan also inherits a number of subsidiary studios under the Xbox label, including&nbsp;<em>Psychonauts&nbsp;</em>developer Double Fine,&nbsp;<em>Forza&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fable&nbsp;</em>studio Playground Games, and Hartman's former stomping ground Turn 10.</p>

The change of leadership comes less than a year after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/8/23952932/microsofts-next-xbox-game-studios-chief-comes-from-turn-10">Hartman took on</a> the head of Xbox Game Studios role after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23933049/microsoft-reorg-xbox-marketing-ai-leadership-changes">Matt Booty was promoted</a> to an expanded president of game content and studios position.</p><p>In an email to Xbox employees today, seen by <em>The Verge</em>, Booty shared that Hartman is retiring at the end of November after more than 30 years at Microsoft. Hartman originally started at Microsoft inside the CD-ROM group in 1988, before working on Age of Empires, Brute Force, and studio head of Digital Anvil.

After more than 30 years at Microsoft, Alan Hartman is retiring at the end of November.&nbsp;</p><p>Alan’s career has been marked by innovation, dedication, and an unwavering passion for gaming. Starting as a contractor at Microsoft in the fledgling CD-ROM group in 1988, Alan has worked on a variety of projects in his time here, from Age of Empires, to Brute Force as the studio head of Digital Anvil, to the founding of Turn 10. Over the years, Alan, Turn 10 and Playground Games delivered 13 Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon games, building Forza into one of the top racing franchises in the world and regularly pushing the capabilities of our hardware. His work to advance accessibility in gaming has set a benchmark for the industry and under his leadership, Xbox Game Studios has shipped multiple critically acclaimed titles this year and set the stage for highly anticipated games like Avowed, South of Midnight, Fable, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>When seeking our next leader to navigate the complexities of our business and foster the creativity needed for our games to thrive, we collaborated with HR to evaluate both external and internal candidates, considering the unique demands of the XGS role.</p><p>I am pleased to announce that Craig Duncan will assume the role of Head of Xbox Game Studios. Craig brings a wealth of experience from his tenure at Codemasters, Midway Games, and Sumo Digital before joining Xbox in 2011 to lead Rare. During this time, Rare has achieved sustained business success and developed new IP, most notably the ever-evolving Sea of Thieves, a cross-platform franchise with over 40 million players.</p><p>In his new role, Craig will continue to focus on helping our studios deliver high-quality, differentiated game experiences that can grow into successful franchises and reach more players by investing in new IP. Craig will report to me and join the Game Content and Studios leadership team, working closely with Alan during the transition. The existing XGS leadership team Alan established will remain intact and report to Craig.&nbsp;</p><p>I am also pleased to announce that Joe Neate and Jim Horth will take over as co-leads of Rare. Their leadership has played a crucial role in Rare’s growth, and I am confident they will elevate the studio and its games to even greater heights.</p><p>Please join me in congratulating Alan on his retirement and welcoming Craig, Joe, and Jim into their new roles.</p><p>Matt</p></blockquote></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!--more-->
<p>As a pair of scratchy, black-and white intertitles explain, you are Sadie, an aspiring actress and stuntwoman denied a fair shot at making it in the Golden Age of Hollywood. Sadie’s solution, apparently, is just to peg it stage left, bounding through an entire weekend marathon’s worth of film sets and increasingly hazardous prop warehouses.</p>

<p>As a platformer, it’s functional and slickly animated, if only about as deep as Charlie Chaplin’s hat. Its dedication to the silent movie bit, however, is bound to raise a smile. Besides the black-and-white film look, and the fact that Sadie starts doing the Charleston if you set your controller down for a while, the big highlight is the use of sound. In place of realistic action noises, Sadie’s traversal moves are synced with little period-appropriate instrumental flourishes. Twiddly strings accompany rope grabs, their pitch playfully creeping higher with successive swings, and hard landings produce a bassy drum roll to emphasise the timeless slapstick quality of falling on one’s arse. It’s not a rhythm game but when you’re successfully stringing together jumps and slides, there is a keenly satisfying sense that you’re playing the lead in a twenties flick <em>and</em> composing the score at the same time.</p><p>There’s also an attention to detail that really helps breathe some life into these plywood gauntlets. Stagehands and set designers go to work around you, putting the finishing touches to their fake Western/pirate/farmyard scenes, while forklift drivers cart their crates through the studio backlots. Even the static environments have character, especially a series of background billboards through which their Prohibition-era renters struggle to make water sound interesting.</p>

<p>Later on, the platforming gives way to some stealthing, with mixed success. It seriously slows down the pace, completely abandoning that flowing musical platforming in favour of forcing you to hide in cupboards from lumbering patrols. Still, the introduction of a barrel disguise – like you’re a flapper Solid Snake – does reintroduce the comedy aspect, and there’s still a dash of dynamic audio cleverness, as going into sneak mode lowers the jaunty swing soundtrack to a simple, slinking piano melody.</p>
<p>There’s no release date for Silent Sadie as of yet, though I can recommend this Next Fest demo right now. Even if the actual platforming part isn’t all that groundbreaking, the strength of its presentation and the charm of its affectionate 1920s pastiche go a long way in giving it a unique and likeable character.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft has announced a new head of Xbox Game Studios. Rare studio head Craig Duncan will be leaving his position to take over as Head of Xbox Game Studios.</p>



<p>The move comes as current head of Xbox Game Studios, Alan Hartman, has announced his retirement at the end of November. He held his position as studios head since October 2023. </p>



<p>Duncan comes in after leading Rare since February 2011 where he oversaw the development of Sea of Thieves along with other titles like Battletoads, Killer Instinct, and various Kinect titles at the studio. Prior to Rare, Duncan was a director at Codemasters and studio head at Midway Games.</p>



<p>In a memo to staff via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rares-craig-duncan-to-become-head-of-xbox-game-studios-as-alan-hartman-retires" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, president of Game Content and Studios Matt Booty thanked Hartman for his years of dedication and service to the industry and Xbox. He then touched on what Duncan will focus on moving forward.</p>



<p>“In his new role, Craig will continue to focus on helping our studios deliver high-quality, differentiated game experiences that can grow into successful franchises and reach more players by investing in new IP,” Booty said.</p>



<p>Taking over for Duncan at Rare will be Joe Neate and Jim Horth. Neate has been the executive producer of Sea of Thieves while Horth has spent over 20 years at Rare.</p>



<p>Currently, Rare is still regularly developing and releasing updates for Sea of Thieves. The studio is also working on the upcoming action-adventure game Everwild.</p>

The news has led to confusion, with some buyers seeking clarification from Argos' customer support.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Reports from those who reached out to Argos have been mixed. While some customer service representatives have indicated the <a href="https://x.com/AndrewLostTime/status/1845815095021957410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancellation emails were sent in error</a>, others have confirmed that the <a href="https://x.com/Matoh543/status/1845820655742161264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancellations are legitimate</a>, leaving buyers uncertain about the status of their orders.</p><p>This isn't the first bit of trouble the PS5 30th Anniversary that customers have run into.

A second wave of preorders was made available through major retailers like Amazon, Argos, and Very on October 10, but these sold out just as quickly. Now, Argos seems to be reversing some of those orders.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Those who made preorders are unsurprisingly frustrated by the situation. <a href="https://x.com/Natty301288/status/1845807344627695996" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Natty301288 on Twitter/X</a> stating: "@ArgosHelpers is this a joke preorder made last Thursday confirmation received now can’t get this elsewhere"</p><p>The sentiment was shared by user <a href="https://x.com/Malik_Zain7/status/1845813886215164034" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Malik_Zain7</a>, exclaiming: "@Argos_Online this some kind of joke???<br>After taking payment for a limited edition console and also sending me a confirmation email, you’re now saying it’s cancelled?"</p><p>For further updates on the situation, follow our deals team at <a href="https://x.com/IGNUKDeals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@IGNUKDeals</a> on Twitter/X, who are closely monitoring the cancellations and other preorder developments.</p><p>The reason behind the cancellations remains unclear, though <a href="https://x.com/Natty301288/status/1845827645780476118" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overselling of stock is a likely explanation</a>.
