            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have announced a new difficulty mode for&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, and this one aims to test the mettle of even the most hardened Nightfarer.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-high-difficulty-expedition-mode-deep-of-night-has-appeared" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a news post</a> on the game's official website,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s Deep of Night difficulty update will arrive on September 11th (that's two weeks from now at time of writing). It's a "high-difficulty challenge mode" designed for those who have seen everything&nbsp;<em>Nightreign </em>currently has to offer.</p>

<p>Naturally, in Deep of Night, you'll face stronger enemies than you normally would. Not only that, but you won't be able to choose which Nightlord you're facing, so you won't know which of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s bosses you'll need to prepare for.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-difficulty-castle.jpg?itok=KPefjiWm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-of-night-difficulty-castle.jpg?itok=SCQaUUQW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is getting a brand new difficulty mode in two weeks' time.</figcaption></figure><p>Terrain changes in your base&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>campaign (i.e. the appearance of certain extra land features) won't be reflected in Deep of Night, so you won't be able to use the mode to pursue some of your characters' objectives, it seems.</p>

<p>If you decide to play on the new difficulty setting, you'll be able to gain special Depths Relics exclusive to the mode, as well as weapons that come with "multiple additional, but also detrimental effects".</p>

<p>What's more, difficulty increases with each "descent"; FromSoftware and Bandai Namco say that wins and losses will affect your Deep of Night rating. Presumably, the more wins you accrue, the higher the difficulty will become.</p>

<p>The real endpoint for Deep of Night is depth level 3; after that, depths 4 and 5 offer "an endless battle for those seeking even greater thrills", so they're essentially true roguelike modes for those who like to test their resolve.</p>

The game sees players teaming up to beat bosses known as Nightlords by exploring a randomized map over the course of a three-day cycle.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>may be a hit, but&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is no slouch in and of itself; according to Bandai Namco's latest numbers, the game has managed to accrue <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-nightreign-sales" rel="nofollow">over five million sales</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>You know what, I'm going to bare all: I've still yet to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> beyond the hour or so I played at a preview event, during which I approximately deemed it "a pretty tidy slice of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with some cheeky QTEs on the side", but certainly not the diamond-plated GOTY candidate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">described by Nic in his review</a>. As is my rotten nature, my desire to see what all the fuss is about is proportionately lower for knowing that they're going to make a sequel - or at least, some rather substantial-sounding DLC. Ugh, I have even more to catch up on now. Why do the gods mock me.</p><!--more-->
<p>That's according to creative director Guillaume Broche, following on from lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sandfall-have-no-plans-for-more-clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-yet-but-chances-are-good-anyway">remarks in May</a> that "chances are good" that Expedition 33 will have some kind of successor.</p>
<p>"Clair Obscur is the franchise name," said Broche to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZEP5kjw-w4">Youtuber MrMattyPlays</a> this week, as detected by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-teases-potential-sequel-dlc/">The Gamer</a>. "Expedition 33 is one of the stories that we want to tell in this franchise. Exactly what it will look like and what the concept will be is still too soon to announce, but what is sure is that this is not the end of the Clair Obscur franchise."</p>
<p>For context, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 takes place in a society that is being gradually obliterated by an all-powerful Paintress. Every year, she paints a number on her canvas, and everybody that age or older is wiped from existence. The titular expedition 33 are the latest in a series of increasingly junior warriors who set forth each year to slay the mad artiste. I don't know any of the story's endings, but I imagine there's scope, at least, for some melancholy prequel stories involving expeditions 34-75. </p><p>I know far more about the kerfuffle surrounding Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's development team size than I do the plot of the game. It's been repeatedly enshrined as evidence that smaller outfits are the magical panacea for an industry currently prone to laying thousands of people off. As Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-clair-obscur-expedition-33-wasnt-made-by-30-people">wrote last year</a>, the much-quoted figure of 30 or so core developers is rather disingenuous - it ignores an external animation team, many of the musicians who worked on the killer soundtrack, and dozens of localisation, QA and voice production staff.</p>
<p>Geez fine, I'll play it already. It's not that long, right? Brisk little 30 hour campaign, yes? Nothing I need to take time off for?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What the heck is going on with file sizes? With each passing year, we’ve seen them ballooning larger and larger to some real unreasonable levels. <em>Oblivion: Remastered</em> which released earlier this year comes in at over 120GB. No one will be shocked when <em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>doubles that. And while these game sizes keep going up, the Xbox Series X remains at a measly 1TB. So if you want to play more than just a small handful of titles without constantly deleting and redownloading your games, you’re going to need expansion storage.&nbsp; <strong>Seagate has an external drive specifically made for the Xbox Series X and Series S. </strong>Right now, it’s on sale for 19% off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/">It’s usually priced at $160, so after the $30 savings, you only need to pay $130 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><strong>You can double your Xbox Series X storage capacity with the help of this Seagate expansion drive, adding another 1TB of useable space</strong>. Now you’re working with two full terabytes, baby. It’s super easy to setup. Unlike the PlayStation 5 expansion cards, this one doesn’t require opening up the casing to get all up inside the inner bits. It’s simple plug and play. Just stick the Seagate drive into the slot on the backend of your Xbox and you’ll be able to start downloading games right to it or moving them from your internal drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Play Games Seamlessly</h2>
<p>Seagate developed this external drive in partnership with Xbox and Microsoft, officially licensing the Xbox Velocity Architecture. That technology is used in Xbox Series X allows players to utilize Quick Resume, a feature enabling Xbox games to be running simultaneously.</p>
<p>On the Xbox Series X, you can hop between different games on the fly. So if you’re mid-race in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, you can pause to go drop in with your pals for a quick Fortnite session. then continue the race when you’re done. You’ll never see a title screen again.</p>



<p>So because this architecture has been licensed from Microsoft, you can take advantage of Quick Resume and all the other benefits of Xbox’s enhanced memory and storage when playing games off of the Seagate expansion card. You’ll find no changes in performance when playing games off the expansion card versus off the Xbox’s internal drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/">For a limited time, you can pick up the Seagate expansion drive for Xbox, increasing your storage by 1TB for a discounted rate</a>. It’s down from $160 to just $130.</p>

<h2 id="h-space-marine-2-year-2-roadmap-details">Space Marine 2 – Year 2 Roadmap Details</h2>



<p>As mentioned, <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/255-take-a-look-at-the-year-2-roadmap-and-the-anniversary-update-s-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the new updates</a> will come starting on September 4 with Patch 10, the game’s largest update to date.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hell-is-us-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-hell-is-us-coming-to-xbox-game-pass.1282995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The month of September is stacked full of huge releases, with Hell Is Us among them, and in such a busy month, it pays to know which games are included in a Game Pass subscription to save you money.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hell-is-us-release-date-explained-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 4</a>, Hell Is Us is landing in a hectic period of releases, alongside the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, and the flurry of top-class games landing mere days apart will stretch anyone’s wallet.</p>



<p>In these situations, a Game Pass subscription can come in handy by reducing your gaming shopping list, and we’ve got all the details on whether Hell Is Us is joining the service.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-hell-is-us-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Hell Is Us on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No luck. Credit to Nacon</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Hell Is Us will not be available to play through an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on September 4th.</strong></p>



<p>Hell Is Us is not a first-party Xbox title, which would mean automatic inclusion in the service, and there hasn’t been any announcement of the game being added to the service.</p>



<p>While the full wave of <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Pass</a> releases for September has not been announced by Microsoft, major launches like Hell Is Us are usually given a significant fanfare if they are coming to the service well in advance of release. As we’ve not seen any such news, don’t expect to see the game in the catalog.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-hell-is-us-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Hell Is Us Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no news on whether Hell Is Us will come to the Xbox Game Pass service in the future, though it cannot be ruled out.</strong></p>



<p>Developer Rogue Factor does not have previous history of release titles, like Necromunda: Underhive Wars and Mordheim: City of the Damned, onto the Game Pass service. Therefore, it’s difficult to predict what any future approach with Hell Is Us will be.</p>



<p>Game Pass does open up titles to a wider audience, however, so the appeal for inclusion is clear, despite the heavy criticism the service as faced from some in the industry.</p>



<p>One likely thing, however, is that Hell Is Us will have a long wait before any Game Pass inclusion is considered, as big launches like this often have a significant delay before they join services like Game Pass.</p>

These special items are crafted in the workshop and provide powerful bonuses when placed around your museum, meaning bigger, better, and bolder ways to impress your guests and of course, boost donations.</p><p>Alongside the new content, the Free Update also brings new language support to Two Point Museum. In their aim to make Two Point games accessible to more players, Two Point Studios has now added Latin-American Spanish, Thai and Russian language support to the game.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/fresh-tracks-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fresh-tracks-is-a-charming-skiing-rhythm-game.1282974/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lately, every time I boot up my PC to play a game I end up playing <a href="https://www.buffalobuffalo.ca/games/freshtracks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fresh Tracks</em></a>, a fantasy skiing rhythm roguelike where you dodge obstacles, slash through bad guys, and take on bosses. The music rules. It’s stuffed with story and characters. The menus are full of lovely details and satisfying button presses. It has snow. I’m astonishingly bad at it, largely because I am wretched at rhythm games, but I’m loving it anyway.</p><p>You play as Skaii, who travels through the game’s snowy world to enlist various gods, called Mythics, to help them on their quest to defeat Mar, the god of terror, who has sucked the life out of the people of fantasy world Norwyn. The Mythics you enlist provide not just different abilities and new music tracks, but different narration that tells you more about Norwyn and its connection to music and adventure. It can be a lot to take in when you’re also focused on the rhythm game of it all, but repeated runs through levels gave me additional chances to pick up on what I missed, and there’s more lore to discover in the game’s menus.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Fresh Tracks - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FBs3r7FgJI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Fresh Tracks</em> is structured like a roguelike: you pick from a selection of songs as you go through a run, with their different difficulty levels charmingly stylized as the green circle, blue square, and black diamond of a ski slope. Each level will give you a randomized boon, like an extra jump or a damage buffer that stays with you through your run. You pick up currency called Whyspers as you travel, which can be spent on more buffs at merchant levels, as well as a permanent currency called Ekkos that you spend on practice tracks and new permanent equipment like skis. When you die, you start again without your temporary buffs and Whyspers, but you keep your Ekkos.</p><p>I only just beat the first boss last night, giving me access to a new Mythic who introduces new songs and a new, tougher version of their boss level. While you’ll hear the same songs multiple times, I found the difference between a medium and hard version of its level to feel like more than enough variety, especially when the songs cover so many different genres. I thought my favorites were the chill dance-pop numbers of my earlier runs (some of which, delightfully, feature lyrics that correspond to the moves you have to make on screen), but once I unlocked my first Mythic I started getting blazing death metal tracks that <em>now</em> I think are my favorites. There are 28 original songs, and I often find myself singing them when I’m not at my computer.&nbsp;</p><p>In the levels themselves, you dodge, duck, and jump over obstacles; lean through narrow gaps, and attack bad guys and deflect arrows with your sword. The early version of that sword, once its ability is fully filled through powerups and perfect timing, refills your health, but the new sword I earned for beating the first boss uses its ability to unleash a wave of fire. Levels can get busy; in harder levels, I found myself jumping and slashing together, or fending off enemies while frantically dodging obstacles, and on occasion I felt like I had to do way too many things at once. But this also makes each level feel like a real adventure and gives a sense of accomplishment when you overcome it, especially the much longer boss levels. Some levels throw weather into the mix; I keep returning to the practice area to play through song “The Blizzard” on repeat, the level of which features fog, water, and death metal.&nbsp;</p><p>The amount of story and special lingo–Whyspers, Ekkos, Mythics, and the like–can sometimes make things a little confusing. The game’s menu, for instance, is called the “Memory Palace;” when I was reading through the tutorials for where some more specialized difficulty options were, this lingo made me a little confused as to where to actually <em>find</em> the thing I was looking for. But not being taken out of the game’s world when I wanted to fiddle with v-sync or practice a song is a nice touch, even if it added an extra moment of “what was that again?” to my time. This might be very me praise, but the button prompts in the menus have a lovely weight to them that makes even the act of starting a run really satisfying.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Fresh Tracks - Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LNFtluWmfso?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>My biggest complaint about <em>Fresh Tracks</em> is how wildly bad at it I am, something that has kept me from writing up the game even though I’ve had it for a while. There is something about my brain that just cannot comprehend rhythm games, despite the fact that I’m a lifelong musician who can passably play five instruments and wants to learn a bunch more. I never quite understand what I’m <em>doing</em> in them, how my button presses correspond to <em>playing</em> the song; I’m not playing the melody, or the percussion, and I frequently don’t understand how my actions relate to the beat I can hear and, via <em>Fresh Tracks</em>’ visual indicator, see. This is 100% a me problem, and something I bring up here despite my fear of being laughed off the gaming internet in hopes that one of you is a musician and/or rhythm game designer who will write a trenchant comment that will resolve my long-standing mental block slash existential crisis of “but what <em>is</em> a rhythm game?” so that I can enjoy this genre that I really should not find so baffling.</p><p>So maybe it’s high praise for <em>Fresh Tracks</em> that I’m playing it so much despite the fact that I sometimes pause it to go noodle on my mandolin to remind myself that, no, I do know what <em>music</em> is. It’s an absolutely charming game from top to bottom, packed with attention and detail, stuffed with story and clever touches. It’s Canadian studio <a href="https://www.buffalobuffalo.ca/games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buffalo Buffalo’</a>s first game, and I’m excited to see what else they do. <em>Fresh Tracks</em> is out now on Steam and PS5.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ai-suffering-chatgpt"><h3>AI Can’t Suffer, But It Should Suffer For This</h3></a><p>It's the sentience of AI's creators that really matters</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grimwild-backerkit-ttrpg-rpg-designer-missing"><h3>RPG Designer Goes Missing After Crowdfunding Award-Winning Game</h3></a><p>'Fulfilment of the project appears to be on hold indefinitely until Maxwell can be located'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/fresh-tracks-impressions]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f6e57b3256915/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest boxed charts from Japan are now available thanks to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202508/50866">Famitsu</a>, and as expected, Nintendo's first-party line-up for Switch 2 is doing particularly well.</p>
<p>Specifically, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> remain unchanged at the top, selling a further 30,202 and 8,424 copies respectively. We'd like to see those lifetime sales for Bananza climb a little higher, but it's a solid performance, at least.</p>
<p>The only newcomer this week is <strong>Tetsudou Nippon! RealPro Tokyo-Kanagawa! Tokyu Dentetsu Hen</strong> at number ten, selling a total of 2,497 units on Switch. In fact, there are no games from either PlayStation or Xbox in the top ten; it's a Nintendo clean sheet!</p>

<hr>
<p>Figures are down from last time with hardware; mostly because we're looking at one week's worth of sales data instead of two. Regardless, both the Switch and the Switch 2 are absolutely dominating, with the latter sitting pretty at the top with 35,359 units sold.</p>
<p>Combining all three SKUs, Switch sold a total of 17,945 units this week, while the PS5 managed to shift a total of 6,428, which means the Switch wasn't too far off shifting <em>three times</em> as many consoles.</p>
<p>Xbox, meanwhile..? Well, look, they're trying. We can give them that.</p>
<p><em>(It goes without saying that healthy sales across the board is good for everybody; our jibes toward PlayStation and Xbox is all in good fun.)</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Konami and Virtuos have <a href="https://www.konami.com/mg/mgs3r/news/us/en/update_112">pushed a new patch</a> to Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater with update 1.1.2 that addresses several gameplay issues and issues causing game crashes, but doesn't directly address performance issues that players have been experiencing.</p>



<p>It addresses issues with the crocodile cap that caused the game to crash, problems with Snake floating in the air after rolling, and issues that soft-blocked player progression, along with a few more fixes. Here's the full patch notes:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Resolved an issue where performing consecutive survival knife attacks to secure food could cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where removing the Crocodile Cap from the Survival Viewer while equipped could cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</em></li>



<li><em>Addressed crashes that could occur when collecting food near a hungry crocodile under certain conditions.</em></li>



<li><em>Corrected an issue where transitioning from a roll into a crawl could cause the character model to float in mid-air.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where player movement could become restricted under certain conditions in areas where Intrusion View is used.</em></li>



<li><em>Resolved an issue where the game could crash under certain conditions while in Radio Window.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>These fixes are great, but it's not necessarily the patch that players are waiting for. Snake Eater is the latest Unreal Engine 5 game to launch with performance issues, and while Konami doesn't directly say anything about those issues in these patch notes, it does have a concluding line on the website saying, "<em>Please rest assured that we are actively investigating and addressing all reported concerns.</em>"</p>



<p>Hopefully, those fixes come sooner than later, though it would be nicer if we didn't have to worry about Unreal Engine 5 games launching with performance issues at all, which, according to Epic Games chief executive officer, Tim Sweeney, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-performance-issues-caused-development-process/">a problem caused by the developers and their development process, not the engine itself</a>. </p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/767156/gaming-grief</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/my-gaming-buddy.1282947/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of the most devastating parts of grief is how it can strike out of nowhere. There you are, doing a perfectly normal, everyday thing, and then that perfectly normal, everyday thing reminds you of something or someone who is no longer there. And when that presence you lost was intimately connected with your life, well, those moments happen frequently and unexpectedly.</p><p>I recently had to say goodbye to an old friend named Millie, an 18-year-old shih tzu who was a constant and steady companion for nearly my entire adult life. In an attempt to get my mind off the sadness, I decided to take a little dip into the familiar with <em>Animal Crossing</em>, a peaceful place full of simple chores that usually helps get my head right. But as I sat on the couch watching the shadows of fish dart around virtual waters, something was missing: the warm presence on my lap that I had taken for granted the last two decades.</p><p>My gaming habits are primarily solitary. When I get time to actually play something, I usually try to lose myself for a few hours in a big world, something like a <em>Zelda</em>, <em>Persona</em>, or <em>Death Stranding</em>. This typically happens in the quiet evenings when everyone else is asleep, and I’m far removed from the screams of a <em>Mario Kart</em> bout or the inane chatter of a <em>Fortnite</em> lobby. But as I realized during that <em>Animal Crossing</em> session, I was almost never <em>really</em> alone playing these games.</p><p>She may have had an adorable little face, but Millie didn’t like most people. She carried herself like a bulldog, chest puffed out to intimidate, and was a grouch even from a young age. The sound of children laughing would make her grumble, and she hated when any unknown person came into our house, which always made it fun when repairs had to be done. Few people got to see the dog I did, a fiercely protective little thing who knew who she loved, and cared about little else. No matter what I was doing she never seemed to be far away, which obviously included plenty of gaming.</p><p>The day we lost Millie, my wife and I spent much of our time digging through old photos and videos to reminisce. As I scrolled back to my very first Instagram posts, it really hit home that this dog had been there for basically every major moment in our lives; every move and heartbreak, Christmas mornings and the early childhoods of both our daughters. We always remembered her as being cold with the kids when they were little — she was no longer the center of attention, after all — but there we found videos and pics of her eating out of their hands, or sleeping on their beds when they were sick. She was always just there, a quiet source of comfort for our whole family.</p><p>There was a theme with most of the photos of Millie and myself: her just chilling in my lap while I was reading or playing a game. Scrolling through those photos I saw this same scene play out through multiple console generations: a young and scrawny Millie beside a silver PS2 controller, a slightly older and scruffier version of her face hidden behind an Xbox One gamepad. There were photos of her lying on my chest as I played <em>New Horizons</em> during the early days of the covid-19 pandemic. The one that hit me the hardest was my oldest daughter lying on our couch with a Nintendo DS, probably lost in <em>Pokémon</em>, while Millie dozed beside her.</p><p>Here was a creature I loved unconditionally, who was always quietly there when I needed her and, later, when my kids needed her, too. Console generations might seem like a silly way to measure time, but they can also be effective. Technology changes so quickly that it can become an easy visual shorthand for identifying a particular moment or era. Millie had sat alongside me through four of these generations — I even found a photo of her next to a PS5 review unit that I used to show how big the console was — and so became an indelible part of how I experienced these games.</p><p>At first I thought this connection would taint a hobby that had become important to me, turning something that had long been a source of joy and escape into one tinged with bitter memories. But as I tossed my line into the <em>Animal Crossing</em> waters, I realized I wasn’t being haunted by Millie’s presence, but reminded of it. Her warmth and presence may no longer be physical, but that doesn’t make it any less comforting.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/767156/gaming-grief#comments">2<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/767156/gaming-grief]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Some <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> players like to say that the MMORPG has a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy toward mods. While technically verboten under the strict terms of the game’s user agreement, Square Enix has mostly been content to look the other way as long as the mods aren’t interfering with the overall health and integrity of the game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/one-of-ffxivs-most-important-mods-is-shutting-down-and-people-are-losing-it-2000619228">But last week</a>, a plugin for <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> called Mare Synchronos was taken down by its creator after receiving a letter from Square Enix’s lawyers. The crackdown came as a surprise to some, while others felt like players had left Square Enix with no choice but to take action. And reading between the lines of a new blog post from <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> director Naoki “Yoshi-P” Yoshida, that’s essentially what happened.</p>

<p>It may still be a couple of years away from release, but more information regarding the PlayStation 6 (PS6) handheld console continues to come out.</p>



<p>In his latest video going over some new specs and details he’s uncovered, Moore’s Law Is Dead (MLID) says that the upcoming PS6 handheld console, codenamed “Canis”, will be dockable for connection to an external display.  </p>



<p><strong>“That’s right everybody,”</strong> he said. <strong>“Multiple documents directly call out that this thing can be docked, will be docked like the Nintendo Switch 2.” </strong></p>



<h6 id="h-more-news-many-developers-still-don-t-have-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits">More News: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/many-developers-still-dont-have-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Many Developers Still Don’t Have Nintendo Switch 2 Dev Kits</a></h6>



<p>When talking about the specs, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-A3Bl2hXoQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MLID said that the system</a> will have <strong>16 compute units of RDNA 5 at 1.20GHz</strong> while in handheld mode. When docked, that speed <strong>jumps to around 1.65GHz</strong>. </p>



<p>Other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-console-and-new-ps6-handheld-canis-specs-leak-its-claimed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously rumored specs</a> for the device include full backward compatibility with PS5 and PS4 titles, 4 x Zen 6c cores, a M.2 SSD slow, haptic vibration, 15W TBP, and more. </p>



<p>The PS6 handheld, along with the standard PS6 console, are reportedly planned to release sometime in late 2027-early 2028.</p>



<p>Sony has yet to announce or confirm any of the specs that have been revealed recently for the PS6 handheld. Until that happens, or Insider Gaming can independently verified its legitimacy, it’s important to take these claims with a grain of salt.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> will see players return to Pokemon X and Y's Kalos region, and fittingly, one of the major gameplay features of those games will make a return: Mega Evolutions. Ahead of its release next month, The Pokemon Company has shown off one of the new Mega Evolutions debuting in the game, as the Luchador-inspired Pokemon Hawlucha is getting a serious upgrade when it jumps into the ring.</p><p>A Fighting- and Flying-type Pokemon, Hawlucha's Mega Evolution sees the Pokemon transform into a creature that has even more ornate plumage, which makes it look like a Pokemon version of famed wrestler Jushin Thunder Liger. "After bathing in the energy of Mega Evolution, its whole body has grown more muscular. Its signature move is Flying Press. It spins to increase the momentum of its dive when attacking. It shows off its muscular chest--both to its opponent and to its Trainer," Hawlucha's Mega Evolution Pokedex entry reads (<a href="https://serebii.net/legendsz-a/megaevolutions.shtml">via Serebii</a>).</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pokemon Legends: Z-A | Hawlucha vs. Machamp FULL MATCH | Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Hawlucha is the third new Mega Evolution reveal so far for Pokemon Legends: Z-A. The first one was Mega Dragonite, a power-up that adds massive wings to the powerhouse Pokemon's head, and recently, we got a brief taste of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-goes-full-blair-witch-project-to-reveal-a-brand-new-mega-evolution/1100-6534163/">what a Pokemon horror movie would be like</a> with the debut of Mega Victreebel.</p><p>Pokemon Legends: Z-A launches on October 16 for Switch 2 and Switch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-shakes-up-pokemons-combat-for-the-first-time-in-decades/1100-6533977/">and it throws in some mega-changes</a> alongside the Mega Evolutions. Traditionally, Pokemon games have featured a turn-based battle system, but Pokemon Legends: Z-A flips the script with real-time fights in Lumiose City.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-getting-four-player-battles/1100-6534031/">Another interesting mode that players can take part in is the Z-A Battle Club</a>: free-for-all battles for up to four players to take part in. The trainer who manages to defeat the most Pokemon within three minutes is crowned the victor in this fast-paced match, and Mega Evolution Pokemon have the power to knock out multiple Pokemon with a single attack.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Developer Crystal Dynamics is laying off more members from the team, though not detailing the total number of people impacted. This is the second round of cuts at the Tomb Raider studio within the last six months--and the first since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/">the Perfect Dark reboot was canned</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/" rel="nofollow ">LinkedIn</a>, the official Crystal Dynamics account announced the layoffs. "This decision was not made lightly," the post reads. "It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market." The language is pretty similar to what <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-studio-crystal-dynamics-lays-off-staff/1100-6530417/">Crystal Dynamics stated after 17 people were laid off</a> in March: "We did not make this decision lightly."</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest known project at Crystal Dynamics currently is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-new-unified-design-is-the-best-of-two-timelines/1100-6521149/">the next Tomb Raider</a>. The game starring Lara Croft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-will-publish-the-next-tomb-raider-game/1100-6510083/">will be published by Amazon Games</a>, and Crystal Dynamics noted that "the future of Tomb Raider" is "unaffected by this decision."</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, the developer stated that the next Tomb Raider and Perfect Dark reboot wouldn't be affected by downsizing, either. However, Microsoft canceled Perfect Dark--a game that Crystal Dynamics was co-developing--last month. The other main studio working on the game, The Initiative, was shuttered.</p><p>Amazon was also previously working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-tv-series-reportedly-dead/1100-6530816/">a Tomb Raider show, but that's reportedly dead now</a>. Along with Tomb Raider, Crystal Dynamics is known for the Gex and Legacy of Kain video game franchises.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the team behind the Yakuza/Like A Dragon franchise, has announced it will hold an RGG Summit next month, immediately followed by an RGG Direct. The summit will bring "the latest info directly from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio," on Wednesday, September 24, at 4 a.m. PT/7 a.m. ET, and the RGG Direct following it will give "a closer look at some of the studio's latest announcements."&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for what to expect at the Summit and Direct, RGG doesn't tease anything, though it has various projects in the works like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/rgg-studios-project-century-formally-unveiled-as-stranger-than-heaven-in-new">Stranger Than Heaven</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/04/check-out-the-first-gameplay-of-the-next-virtua-fighter">a new Virtua Fighter</a>, and almost assuredly, a new Like A Dragon project. The studio also recently released <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0 Director's Cut</a>, which features new cutscenes and more, exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2, and fans are hoping the team might bring it to other platforms.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-red-strain-story-dlc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atomfall-the-red-strain-story-dlc-coming-in-september.1282905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rebellion has announced&nbsp;<em>The Red Strain</em>, a brand new DLC expansion for&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>that's launching next month, although the studio is keeping its cards close to its chest regarding what you can expect for now.</p>

<p><em>The Red Strain&nbsp;</em>was announced earlier today via a brand new teaser trailer, and "teaser" really is the word; the trailer reveals the name of the expansion, as well as a C.O.R.E. robot standing in front of some kind of red growth (presumably the Red Strain of the title).</p>

<p>What we do know is that this will be&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s second major story expansion, following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow">June's&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle</em></a>, which introduced a brand new area and other goodies to Rebellion's open-ended shooter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-the-red-strain-dlc-wicked-isle.jpg?itok=jb20XuWE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-the-red-strain-dlc-wicked-isle.jpg?itok=W7D_8oYR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Red Strain&nbsp;</em>will be&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s second story DLC, following on from&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>While Rebellion hasn't revealed exactly what will be introduced as part of&nbsp;<em>The Red Strain</em>, the studio does say you can expect "a highly confidential new location", as well as "plenty more mysteries to uncover". That sounds about right for an&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>expansion.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>itself, it's an open-ended first-person shooter developed by&nbsp;<em>Sniper Elite&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zombie Army&nbsp;</em>studio Rebellion. It's set in a 1960s England that was a lot more heavily impacted by the Windscale nuclear disaster than the one in real life was.</p>

<p>At the outset of&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>, you awaken in a bunker with amnesia, and it's up to you to explore the Windscale plant and its surroundings in order to discover the truth behind Windscale and why a mysterious voice is telling you that a being known as Oberon "must die".</p>




<p>Somewhat unusually for modern games,&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>essentially allows you freedom in how you pursue your objectives; you'll have several leads to follow at any given time, and the order in which you chase those leads is largely up to you.</p>

<p><em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801800/Atomfall/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/atomfall/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/atomfall/9NC4WDL5KZBL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and it's also a day one Game Pass title.

The two fighting-type Pokémon meet in a ring alongside their trainers, and Hawlucha plays to the crowd like a real luchador. Then in comes Machamp, who has a dramatic wrestler entrance of its own. The two clash, and it becomes clear that Hawlucha plays up the showmanship to the detriment of its performance in the battle. After Machamp teaches it a lesson in humility, Hawlucha thinks about all the training it took to get to this match and finds the strength to get back up, apologize to its trainer, and mega evolve. Mega Hawlucha gets a new mask and cape, its feathers forming a belt around its waist. It definitely heightens the luchador theme, but it feels a bit more grounded than the mega designs of Dragonite and Victreebel, which lean more fully into a kind of goofy, exaggerated charm. Machamp is no match for Hawlucha after it mega evolves, and the match is over pretty quick. Check out the full animated short below:</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="FULL MATCH: Hawlucha vs. Machamp! | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RYCOc3SiU7A?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Like Draqonite and Victreebel, Hawluche was on the list of leaked Mega Evolutions from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-new-leak-starters-1851772521"><span>back in March</span></a><span>, so that list keeps looking more and more credible as time goes on. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is coming to Switch and Switch 2 on October 16.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Draw Me A Pixel is doing something bold for their second release. After the decidedly un-game-like There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension, the studio has decided to actually make a game this time round. It’s just a damned shame that it’s all gone a bit wrong for release, the review bombing has rolled in, and now Sherlock and Watson are off to solve the mysterious case of the game-breaking missing NPC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crushed In Time (Teaser 2025)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pSSLM0QBRNo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you were to be strict about genre definitions, this would have to be called a point &amp; click adventure, but that really isn’t the half of it. It’s much more of a…. grab and slap? Pull and stretch? Slap and tickle? Probably not the last one. What I mean to say is that instead of the traditional style where you point and things and click on them to move your character over and interact or utter some witty barbs, your cursor is actually the one doing the interacting directly. And that interaction comes in the form of pulling on the elastic scenery and letting loose.</p>


<p>It’s basically the opening screen of Mario 64, shoved into a blender with a point &amp; click game&nbsp;–&nbsp;I cheekily asked if they were fans of this one specific thing and Fred Malavasi, associate producer and comms manager, replied “As a child, I spent hours [playing with] Mario’s face. So yeah, definitely!” –&nbsp;and it manifests in some truly wonderful ways through the opening scene. </p>
<p>It’s a regular day on Baker Street when a repeated pounding on the front door summons Watson to answer, but as he opens it, the presumed postman grabs him for a hug and hands him a letter. Weird, but OK. Time to deliver that to Holmes, but Watson is himself now stuck pounding on the locked door to Sherlock’s apartment. </p>


<p>Now it’s over to you to figure out how to resolve this issue. Mousing around the screen, you can click and grab any part of it, pull it and release for a little bit of enjoyable wobble, but you’re really searching for the white dots to actually interact with. This won’t necessarily be the direct solution, of course, but rather provides the framework of the puzzle you need to complete. </p>
<p>You see, the door knob won’t open the door, and instead plings down onto the floor, letting you then grab it again, pull and launch it in an arc to get across the room and slot into the hole on a drawer, which in turn will release a telephone cord for you to plug in and trigger a call to wake Holmes up. There’s all the hallmarks of a point &amp; click puzzle here, but how you’re finding and giving the solution is just so thoroughly different. </p>
<p>That persists as you go through the successive puzzles in this introduction as things start to get even more unusual. You see, that letter Watson holds suddenly defies gravity and flips up to the ceiling. How do you get it down? Well, it’s obviously some kind of combination of honey, dumb waiter and portraits of the queen, but once again, you’re grabbing things, flicking them around and seeing what works. Holmes, the rather stubborn ass, just considers all of these bizarre occurrences to be a part of his own brilliance, completely oblivious to your unknowable force and inputs. </p>

<p>Getting stuck is a natural part of the genre, as obscure solutions to strange situations stump you and hold up your progress. Fred confirms that “We have two types of hints. The first one is you just have to look around and maybe listen to what characters are saying. But the second one, we are definitely going to have a real hints system. I can’t say exactly what right now, but there will be a hints system like in every point &amp; click game.”</p>
<p>There’s three different styles of action that Draw Me A Pixel use through this into: grabbing to stretch and release, grabbing to release and eject, and grabbing and then spinning something round. I’ve no doubt that there’s more than these three, and there’s a bunch of snippets found within the teaser trailer. </p>
<p>But what was that about a buggy, review-bombed game release? Well, hopefully the actual game won’t have a troubled launch, but the narrative is that the in-game Draw Me A Pixel has released this buggy mess. As they set off from Baker Street in the Sherlock-o-motive (it’s a car), Holmes and Watson don’t realise that they’re going to be on a time-travelling adventure, of sorts, that delves back through and explores their game in different iterations. Expect to see prototypes, alpha versions and lots of other quirky stuff, likely leaning back into some of the shenanigans that were seen in There Is No Game. </p>

<p>Crushed In Time looks like a truly unique and exciting riff on the point &amp; click adventure, with its truly inventive grabbing and elastic mechanics. If you like the genre and have a barmy sense of humour, this should absolutely be on your watch list for 2026.</p>

<p>Ahhh, memories</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>XSEED Games has announced that it's bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_memoire_memories_of_celceta">Ys Memoire: Revelations in Celceta</a> to Switch in the West in early 2026.</p>
<p>In case you missed this one, Revelations in Celceta enhanced port of the PlayStation Vita game (which later came to PC and PS4) <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psvita/ys_memories_of_celceta">Ys: Memories of Celceta</a>. Can you see <em>why</em> they changed the name? Memoire: Memories is a bit of a mouthful... well, Falcom kept it for its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/ps-vitas-ys-memoire-memories-of-celceta-lands-switch-remaster-in-japan-this-may">Japanese release in May 2025</a>. So, y'know.</p>
<p>Anyway, Revelations in Celceta is actually the <em>true</em> fourth game in the Ys series; Falcom originally outsourced development of a fourth game to two seperate companies in the early '90s, which in turn gave us two different <strong>Ys IV</strong>s. Timeline wise, it takes place directly after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X</a> — which is also getting a rerelease in 2026 on Switch 2.</p>
<p>This rerelease will allow you to swap between the original soundtrack and a brand new, rearranged version. And, from the look and sound of it, that seems like the main addition.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the action RPG from XSEED, along with some screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Ys Memoire: Revelations in Celceta</em></strong> Key Features</p>
<p><strong>- Exhilarating Party-based Action:</strong> Strategic party battles challenge players to change their tactics on the fly, and allies can pick up new abilities in the midst of battle that can help them gain the advantage against powerful enemies.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Dynamic Exploration of a Dangerous Land:</strong> Celceta is a vast and mysterious land, filled with interesting people and thrilling adventures. Players can take advantage of a robust mapping system as they discover all the challenges and rewards that await.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Enhanced Musical Experience:</strong> The sweeping score guiding Adol’s journey through Celceta returns, along with a newly recorded, re-interpreted version, allowing players to choose their own auditory adventure.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>So, we don't have too long to wait. Oh, and if you want to catch up on your Ys, this is the second game in the Memoire project — which is porting the older games to Switch. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_memoire_the_oath_in_felghana">Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana</a>, which launched earlier this year, is a fantastic place to start.</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're looking forward to Revelations in Celceta in the comments</em>,</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mega Hawlucha Officially Revealed for Pokemon Legends: Z-A]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mega-hawlucha-pokemon-legends-z-a</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced a brand new Mega Evolution for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, and unlike the last two reveals, this one is a bona fide Generation VI native.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">set to launch on October 16th</a>, and the first major new Mega Evolution revealed for the game was Dragonite, with Grass/Poison-type plant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mega-victreebel-revealed-pokemon-legends-za" rel="nofollow">Victreebel following earlier this month</a>. Be sure to check out Mega Victreebel's horror-inflected announcement trailer if you haven't already.</p>

<p>Now, a brand new Mega Evolution has been revealed for the game, and it's none other than the Fighting/Flying-type luchador bird Hawlucha, which will transform into an even more magnificent form if you choose to Mega Evolve it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mega-hawlucha-announced-trailer.jpg?itok=kSFPRTR0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mega-hawlucha-announced-trailer.jpg?itok=xl4KvUbx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hawlucha is the latest Pokemon to get the Mega Evolution treatment.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer in which Mega Hawlucha is revealed is a pretty heartwarming one; the luchador steps into the ring with Machamp, and the latter proves to be a tough opponent until Hawlucha draws on its memories of its trainer and steps it up a notch.</p>

<p>I would say that I won't spoil what happens next, but given that this is a trailer specifically announcing the existence of Mega Hawlucha, I'm sure you can put two and two together. Suffice it to say Hawlucha's trainer is delighted with the outcome.</p>

<p>You can check out the full trailer announcing Mega Hawlucha below; it essentially takes the form of a full wrestling match between the two Pokemon, complete with the kind of dramatic twists and turns you'd expect from a WWE bout.</p>




<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>is set to debut on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Pokemon-Legends-Z-A-2533423.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">original Switch</a> on October 16th. Set entirely in Lumiose City in the Kalos region, the game sees players undertaking an urban redevelopment project by day and participating in an exciting battle tournament by night.</p>

<p>The game will also feature a more action-oriented battle system that will require players to physically dodge certain moves, as well as a number of new Mega Evolution forms, of which we've only seen a few. Stay tuned for more.</p>
