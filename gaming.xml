            <guid>1366441</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, Splitgate 2 launched with a pretty middling start. Players who enjoyed the first game were certainly enjoying 1047 Games' attempt at a sequel, but it wasn't the big new shooter on the block, the way the first Splitgate was in its early days. Unfortunately, an overly confident co-founder promising to "<em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">make FPS great again</a>,</em>" a poor show of bravado at Summer Game Fest, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-slashes-145-cosmetic-bundle-price-following-fan-backlash">an insanely expensive $145 cosmetic bundle</a> meant that 1047 Games really took one on the chin when it put Splitgate 2 back into beta and <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-back-to-beta-re-launch-2026-og-splitgate-servers-shutdown-1047-games-layoffs/">admitted it had been released "<em>too early</em>."</a></p>



<p>Now, five months after the fact, 1047 Games is ready to try again. The servers will be taken offline on December 4 to prepare for a proper relaunch later in the month, which technically means that it's actually relaunching sooner than 1047 Games had originally planned, since in its <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/building-the-splitgate-you-deserve">July statement</a>, it projected a return for the game in 2026.</p>



<p>"<em>Thank you to everyone who participated in the Splitgate 2 Beta! On December 4th, the Beta Season &amp; active Battle Passes will be ending, alongside your seasonal “rank” progress</em>," the studio writes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2918300/view/590662508143970096?l=english">on the game's Steam page.</a> "<em>We will also be taking the Beta servers offline on the 4th to prepare for relaunch later in December</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Thank you to everyone who participated in the Splitgate 2 Beta! On December 4th, the Beta Season &amp; active Battle Passes will be ending, alongside your seasonal “rank” progress.</p><p>We will also be taking the Beta servers offline on the 4th to prepare for relaunch later in December.…</p></div>— Splitgate 2 - Beta (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/1993028502925541517?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>When 1047 Games took Splitgate 2 back into beta, it not only 'unlaunched' the game, but took the servers offline for the original Splitgate, and laid off developers for the second time within a month, since its first layoff happened between the span of time that Splitgate 2 first launched on June 6 and when it was put back into beta on July 22.</p>



<p>It has been hosting beta tests in the months since, with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/">a few hundred players logging into Steam, helping 1047 Games further its testing</a>. But a few hundred players are not going to sustain a multiplayer studio in today's age. If Splitgate 2 has any hope of sticking around, you wouldn't be wrong to imagine that its relaunch needs to be the biggest event in Splitgate history. </p>



<p>Will it be able to pull that off? We'll see. One thing to note is that with the servers going offline on December 4, and its relaunch coming "<em>later in December</em>," it just might be the case that 1047 Games co-founder and game director Ian Proulx makes a return to a Geoff Keighley stage (sans headwear) and announces the relaunch <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">at The Game Awards</a>. It wouldn't be the strangest thing to happen at a Kieghley show.</p>

			<p><span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is definitely not lacking in content, but if you have already played through the game once and want to experience it again, but with a twist that can make</span> the game's&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-continues-to-show-incredible-combat-depth-over-one-year-after-its-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep combat</a>&nbsp;even more interesting, this mod, released earlier this month, is the one you are looking for.</p>



<p>Created by D3DNieR, the Playable Rufus Shinra mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/1598?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available on Nexus Mods</a>, introduces a playable version of the boss character, complete with all of his iconic techniques. From the gameplay videos provided by the modder, the character appears to work quite well.</p>



<p>However, one specific ability, <em>"Thread Softly,"</em> may cause certain enemies without specific animations to stop moving for the remainder of the fight. Such minor technical issues are expected with mods that radically alter gameplay, and in no way diminish the incredible work that went into making a boss character playable.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Rufus Shinra isn't the only boss that has been made playable in the PC version of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, released earlier this year. Back in April, D3DNier released a mod which made the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mods-new-playable-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turks Rude and Reno playable</a>, with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/976?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subsequent updates</a> not only improving the two characters' behavior in combat, but also adding playable Elena and Tseng.</p>



<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth combat experience is also set to be further expanded in the future by <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-zack-gameplay-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Zack gameplay overhaul </a>that will massively expand the character's moveset to better represent the power a 1st Class SOLDIER is supposed to have, as seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crisis-core-final-fantasy-vii-reunion-the-price-of-freedom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII - Reunion.</a></p>



<p>As development of the third entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy is well underway, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which is on sale on Black Friday 2025 on both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-friday-2025-playstation-5-deals-save-on-consoles-bundles-accessories-and-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, is not getting expanded with new content, so mods such as these are the perfect way to experience the game with some new twists.</p>



<p>The mods that are sure to be developed for the third and final entry in the series, however, may not be the only way the yet-to-be formally announced game will be expanded. Director Naoki Hamaguchi confirmed to us during this year's Tokyo Game Show that there's<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-tgs-2025-qa-no-dlc-rebirth-but-theres-a-chance-for-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a concrete possibility of having a DLC for the final game, or even a full title.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming laptops usually cost over $1,000 for basic performance and high-end models can easily reach $2,000 to $3,000 for complete gaming capabilities. However, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/">Asus TUF gaming F16 laptop (RTX 4050, 512GB SSD, 16GB DDR5 RAM, Intel Core 5 chip) breaks this trend with a price of $749, down from $1,099</a>. This deal on Amazon for Black Friday <strong>offers real gaming hardware at an all-time low</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best in Class GPU</h2>
<p>The <strong>Nvidia RTX 4050 laptop GPU with a maximum TGP of 115W delivers true 1080p gaming performance</strong> in modern games: It uses DLSS 3 technology to upscale images and keeps high frame rates while keeping visual quality intact. The ray tracing support creates realistic lighting effects in games like Cyberpunk 2077, Forza Motorsport and Control without slowing down frame rates, thanks to AI-assisted rendering.</p>
<p>The GPU can run esports titles such as Valorant, League of Legends and Counter-Strike <strong>at competitive frame rates over 144fps</strong>, matching the display’s refresh rate. Creative tasks like video editing, 3D modeling and AI image generation also benefit from GPU acceleration and greatly speed up rendering times compared to integrated graphics.</p>



<p>The I<strong>ntel Core 5 210H processor provides balanced power through an efficient hybrid design</strong> that includes performance and efficiency cores. This setup manages demanding tasks while conserving battery life and gaming sessions experience steady frame rates as the performance cores focus on game logic and physics, while efficiency cores handle background tasks without detracting from gameplay.</p>
<p>The <strong>16-inch FHD+ display has a 144Hz refresh rate and a 16:10 aspect ratio</strong>, and offers an immersive gaming experience through smooth motion that avoids the stuttering of standard 60Hz displays during fast actions. The taller ratio adds vertical space, which is useful for productivity tasks like coding, document editing, and web browsing, where having more vertical pixels reduces the need to scroll. The <strong>display achieves 100% sRGB color accuracy</strong> and ensures correct color representation for photo editing and other creative work beyond gaming.</p>



<p>The cooling system is equipped with <strong>Arc Flow Fans, four exhaust vents, five dedicated heat pipes, and anti-dust filters</strong> and keeps temperatures steady during long gaming sessions without too much noise. This thermal design prevents performance drops caused by overheating to ensure consistent frame rates during extended play. The <strong>anti-dust filter</strong> keeps internal dust build-up in check, which helps maintain cooling efficiency over time, extending the laptop’s lifespan compared to systems that quickly degrade in dusty conditions.</p>
<p>At $749, this Asus TUF laptop offers a great mix of true gaming performance and sturdy build, and at this price point, it offers outstanding value in the gaming laptop market.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-enters-chaos-mode-now-selling-galaxy-z-fold7-at-record-low-and-cheaper-than-old-fold6-2000648076</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung stands out with their folding smartphones and faces almost no direct competition from major manufacturers. After seven generations of improvements, the Galaxy Z Fold series has matured into a product category that Apple has yet to enter, despite ongoing rumors.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/">Currently priced at $1,657, down from $2,119, the 512GB Galaxy Z Fold7</a> is available at a record low on Amazon for Black Friday which makes this powerful productivity device more accessible than ever. The <strong>Z Flip7 also sees major discounts on Amazon</strong>&nbsp;but the Fold’s tablet-sized unfolded screen offers different use cases for users who want a pocketable alternative to laptops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Expanded Design That Balances Size and Portability</h2>
<p>The <strong>wider cover display makes the Fold7 feel more like a traditional smartphone</strong> when closed and addresses past complaints that earlier models were too narrow for one-handed use. This increased width is closer to standard flagship phone dimensions and makes typing, browsing and using apps more comfortable without needing to unfold the device for simple tasks. The improved design encourages users to rely on the cover display for quick tasks instead of treating it as a backup when unfolding is inconvenient.</p>
<p>When unfolded, <strong>the 8-inch internal display creates a tablet-sized screen</strong> that allows for real multitasking with three apps visible at once. You can run email, a web browser, and messaging apps side-by-side, watch YouTube while browsing Twitter and responding to texts or follow recipe videos while taking notes and setting timers. This multitasking ability changes how tasks are completed by reducing the constant app switching that can disrupt workflow on traditional phones.</p>



<p>The <strong>200MP main camera is Samsung’s most ambitious camera</strong> technology to date on a folding phone, competing with flagship models that don’t have to deal with the challenges of hinges. The large sensor captures incredible detail, allowing for significant cropping while keeping clarity, so you can capture far-off subjects as clear close-ups without the limitations of optical zoom. The <em>Pro-Visual Engine</em> processes images using advanced computational photography techniques to analyze scenes, optimize exposure for different lighting conditions and apply smart enhancements that keep the natural look while increasing quality.</p>
<p>The customized <strong>Snapdragon 8 Elite processor</strong> (from Qualcomm) is designed specifically for Galaxy devices and delivers top performance with improved speeds and optimizations that enhance efficiency. This powerful processor can handle demanding games, 4K video editing, and heavy multitasking without overheating or draining the battery like lesser models. What’s more, with 512GB of storage, you can manage a large library of apps and professional content creation tasks without constant worry about storage space.</p>



<p>Durability is boosted with advanced <strong>armor aluminum framing and Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 protection</strong>&nbsp;which help ease concerns about the fragility of folding phones that once discouraged early adopters. The reinforced hinge can handle hundreds of thousands of folds thanks to precise engineering that ensures smooth operation over years of daily use. The <strong>displays are more resistant to scratches than earlier models</strong> and still maintains the flexibility needed for folding, achieving durability that rivals traditional slab phones. <strong>Water resistance</strong> allows you to use the device in light rain or near water without worry.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life lasts through full days</strong> of mixed use despite the demands of dual displays and powerful processors, achieving longevity that matches or exceeds single-screen flagship devices. Samsung’s smart power management adjusts display refresh rates, processor speeds, and background activities based on how you use the device, maximizing battery life without requiring manual adjustments.</p>
<p>At $1,657, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 with 512GB offers an 8-inch folding display, a 200MP camera and Snapdragon 8 Elite processing at 22% less than its retail price this Black Friday. Samsung’s seven generations of refining folding phones have created technology that Apple has yet to match, despite its resources and engineering expertise.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/keep-all-your-crap-fully-charged-with-the-anker-prime-usb-c-charger-at-its-lowest-price-ever-2000647672</link>
            <guid>1366417</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="627">With Black Friday weekend just around the corner, we’re only a couple of days away from one of the biggest shopping events of the year. While the official start of Black Friday may still be a little ways off, many popular items on Amazon are already seeing some substantial discounts. If you’re getting a head start on holiday shopping, or maybe treating yourself to something special, now is a fantastic time to snag a deal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/">Right now, Amazon is offering the Anker Prime Charger at 33% off.</a> Normally priced at $150, this high-tech USB-C compatible charging block is available for just $100—a savings of $50—for a limited time.</p>
<p data-start="629" data-end="1269">Nowadays, we carry a lot of devices with us that need to stay charged. It’s not just our smartphones that need to be plugged in at the end of the day anymore. If you’re someone who likes to listen to music or podcasts while on the go, your earbuds or wireless headphones also need to be juiced up. If you’re using a smartwatch to track your fitness or health, keeping that battery full is essential for getting the most out of its capabilities. And that barely scratches the surface. Tablets, laptops, even portable gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch 2, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, or the Steam Deck all need to be regularly charged to stay powered throughout the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="629" data-end="1269">Support for Multiple Devices</h2>
<p data-start="1271" data-end="1839">The Anker Prime Charger is designed to make charging all of these devices easier. Equipped with three USB-C ports, this compact charging block can handle any device that uses USB-C for charging. Each of the three ports can deliver up to 140W of power, which means you can quickly charge even larger devices like a 16-inch MacBook Pro. In fact, the Anker Prime Charger can take your MacBook Pro from zero to 50% battery in just 25 minutes. All three of its USB-C ports can charge at that max speed simultaneously, so it doesn’t matter which port you use.</p>
<p data-start="1841" data-end="2380">When all three ports are in use, the charger adjusts to distribute power efficiently. One port can charge at the full 140W, while the other two can each provide 35W of power. This makes it easy to charge multiple devices at once, whether you’re on a trip or just need to power up your devices at home. For example, if you’re traveling with a MacBook Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, and an iPad Pro, the Anker Prime Charger can deliver the same amount of power to each device as their individual chargers would.</p>


<p data-start="2382" data-end="2791">The Anker Prime Charger has a smart touch display, located on top of the device. This LED display offers helpful information about your connected devices, allowing you to check the power status of each port when a device is plugged in. You can also customize charging modes via the app.</p>
<p data-start="2793" data-end="3256">Measuring only 2.56 inches by 2.05 inches by 1.38 inches, it’s small enough to easily fit into your bag or pocket. The prongs even fold into the block, preventing them from catching on anything while you carry it around. For folks on the go, whether you’re working remotely or just want to reduce the number of chargers you carry, the Anker Prime Charger is a travel-friendly solution to your charging needs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Steam continues to be one of the best places to play games in 2025, and there’s an almost endless list of titles to enjoy, making it hard to find the best games.</p>



<p>Whether you’re on the hunt for your next source of multiplayer mayhem, an expansive single-player adventure, or a little bit of everything, Insider Gaming has listed the best games to buy on Steam, or gift to loved ones, in 2025.</p>



<p>Don’t forget to check out our other <a href="http://also, there should always be a link near before getting into the lists to the Holiday 2025&quot; tag hub: https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Holiday 2025</a> gift guides here!</p>







<h2 id="h-best-pc-games-to-buy-on-steam-2025">Best PC Games to Buy on Steam 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-dispatch">Dispatch</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The episode superhero adventure is arguably one of the best titles to release in a generation, putting you right in the mix of an Invincible-like story. Taking control of Robert Robertson, leading a pack of wannabe supervillain-turned-heroes seeking to be reformed, Dispatch’s eight-episode arc initially released weekly, but is perfect for playing in bulk, just like a binge watch of your favorite series.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re yet to join the fight to defend democracy, where have you been? Helldivers 2 continues to shine as one of the best titles available on Steam, and the fact Xbox players joined the fight earlier this year means there’s even more crossplay fun to be had. While the game has regular updates like other live-service titles, the huge benefit is there’s no expiration to the Battle Passes, and plenty of ways to earn free credits.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The extraction shooter has made a quick impression since its release last month, standing as one of the best-reviewed games this week. Playable solo, or in teams up to three, one of ARC Raiders’ biggest strengths is the unpredictability every time you jump into the game, as you never know who you will come across. With ongoing support, ARC Raiders is here for the long haul.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>After the much-maligned Battlefield 2042, EA has come back swinging with Battlefield 6, arguably the most successful title to release this year. While the solo campaign is entertaining, nothing beats the huge multiplayer battles on the ground and in the air, with naval combat expected in the future. If there’s any year to skip Call of Duty for something else, it’s this one.</p>

<h3 id="h-red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s been seven years since Red Dead Redemption 2 was released on consoles and while it took a while longer to get to Steam, it still stands as one of the best games money can buy, and the current price has been slashed. Winner of over 175 Game of the Year awards, Red Dead Redemption 2 is the perfect game to tide you over until the release of Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-baldur-s-gate-3">Baldur’s Gate 3</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 set the gaming world alight when it initially launched in 2023, clinching a well-deserved Game of the Year award, and the Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure is rated five stars on Steam to this day. Your choices along the way shape your adventure, meaning you’ll have a different experience on every run.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-palworld">Palworld</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Initially released in January 2024, Palworld caught the eye. and the ire of Nintendo, with its release, and has received several updates since, including some big collabs. With an array of Pals to capture, expansive base-building mechanics, and the ability to permanently trap humans in a small sphere for eternity, what’s not to love?</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Despite turning four this year, Forza Horizon 5 still stands as the best racing game on the market, a title likely to be held onto until the release of Forza Horizon 6 next year. While racing is the name of the game, there’s plenty of other things to do, including exploration, stunt jumps, and listening to one of the best soundtracks available on any game on the market.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Black Ops 7 undoubtedly has its issues, but there are some major perks to the game. The biggest among them is Zombies, which is just as good, if not better, than Black Ops 6, with an expansive easter egg to complete on the initial map, along with more content on the way. There’s also intense multiplayer action and a frankly bizarre campaign to complete, which can be done solo with up to three other players.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Celebrating its tenth birthday next year, Stardew Valley continues to be one of the most-played titles on Steam and retains a five-star rating on the platform after a decade. Put in control of a run-down farm, players are tasked with bringing it back to life, growing crops and rearing animals. There’s also a mine to farm resources, a host of romance options, and plenty more secrets hidden away.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24243639/world-of-warcraft-midnighttm-goes-live-march-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Blizzard announced</a> that World of Warcraft: Midnight will be released worldwide on March 2, 2026, at 3 PM PST—which means that for some players in the world, the release date will be in the morning of March 3.</p>



<p>While there is still a little while to wait to enjoy everything that Midnight has to offer, players who have purchased any edition of the expansion can secure Housing Early Access next week, from December 2.</p>



<p>With the release of ‘The Warning’ Midnight Prologue content update, players who have purchased the Midnight expansion can join a neighborhood, choose a house, and begin customizing their new home during Housing Early Access.</p>



<p>Those without Midnight purchased can begin to add to their Housing collection through activities and achievements, however, which will be waiting for when you pull the trigger on the expansion and are ready to settle down into a humble abode.</p>



<p>Housing Early Access won’t provide everything there is to offer, however, with the available items described as a “limited selection before the full suite of options arrives with the launch of the expansion.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/innoview-portable-monitor-15-6-inch-2000647776</link>
            <guid>1366375</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you need extra screen space on the go, adding a portable monitor to your setup makes sense. These screens are bigger than tablets, connect to laptops, phones, and other devices using a cable, plus offer multiple viewing options for different needs.</p>
<p>Most solid options with basic functionality out there sit around $100, but you can treat yourself to one for less today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4950/">Right now, Amazon is offering the 15.6-inch InnoView portable monitor for just $57, after taking 42% off its retail price.</a> It’s an early Black Friday deal, but there’s a catch. At the time of writing, the deal is only available to Prime members. Non-Prime members can grab it at a modest 5% drop, for $94. Prime members will also enjoy free delivery with their purchase.</p>
<p>That said, now is a good time to grab a Prime subscription if you’ve been wanting to try it out. Black Friday is tomorrow, and just like this early deal, you can expect plenty of member-exclusive discounts. These are usually much steeper than the regular ones. Prime subscription costs $10 per month or $100 a year, and new users can enjoy a 30-day free trial before committing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4950/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Portable, But Powerful</h2>
<p>For a little over $50, you’re getting a 15.6-inch portable screen. The size matches that of most standard laptops out there, so you’re getting the same experience, just without the bulk.</p>
<p>This screen pushes a 1920×1080 resolution for clear, bright visuals, plus features an IPL panel for superior color accuracy. The 178-degree viewing angle makes it easy to enjoy consistent visuals from all angles, meaning you won’t always have to sit right in front of the monitor to see what’s being displayed. It’s great for when you’re sharing the screen with multiple users, as everyone can see clearly without trying to squeeze in. Additionally, low blue light support keeps it easier on the eyes by reducing the blue light radiation damage. You’ll be able to keep using the screen for longer hours without the usual eye strain.</p>



<p>Exceptional compatibility comes from 2 fully functional Type-C ports and 1 HDMI port that let you connect the monitor to a range of devices. Your device should just support Thunderbolt 3.0/4.0 or USB 3.1 Type-C DP ALT-mode. The setup is plug-and-play, meaning you only need a single USB-C cable to get started. If your device does not support a USB-C connection, you can still connect it through HDMI, but you’ll need both an HDMI cable and a separate power cable to proceed. There’s no single way to use it; you can expand your laptop’s display to work on the go, pair the monitor with your smartphone to stream on a bigger screen, and even use it with a console to play better. There are multiple display modes to choose from. We’re talking an Extend mode for a large desktop that spans across both screens, a Second screen mode to use both the screens for different tasks, and a Duplicate mode that mirrors your primary display.</p>
<p>The monitor comes with a scratch-resistant smart protective. Beyond protection, it can be used to prop the screen up. Two grooves let you find the right angle, so you can set it up literally anywhere you want, from a desk to even your couch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4950/">The InnoView portable monitor is now down to just $57, all thanks to Black Friday.</a> It not only offers you a large screen, but also delivers stunning visuals, plus lets you choose between multiple viewing modes and even comes with a durable case. It’s great for freelancers, work professionals, students and even gamers.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Chapter 7 Will be Released Earlier Than Thought, It’s Claimed]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite is gearing up for this weekend’s huge end-of-chapter event, bringing an end to The Simpsons mini-season with a huge battle featuring collabs from throughout Chapter 6, and it seems downtime could end sooner than expected.</p>



<p>The Zero Point event in Fortnite takes place on Saturday at 2 PM PT, with Chapter 7 expected to kick off the following day, November 30. However, it’s claimed that the start date will be earlier.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-7-reportedly-releasing-november-29">Fortnite Chapter 7 Reportedly Releasing November 29</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big deal. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>While the standard practice for major Fortnite updates is downtime beginning at 2 AM ET, which was expected to be the case with Chapter 7’s launch on November 30, players could be back in significantly earlier than that date.</p>



<p>Reliable leaker <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1993774545241858172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a> states Chapter 7 will be released on November 29, “just a few hours after the live event.” While there’s no specific time mentioned, that could mean as much as 12 hours before downtime was expected to begin.</p>



<p>There are, however, some caveats to this, and even if the information is accurate, it would all depend on everything running smoothly in the deployment of Chapter 7.</p>



<p>Downtime for a new Chapter is often longer than the usual turnover for seasonal updates in Fortnite, and there’s a larger amount to deploy—including an entirely new map and POIs, NPCs, weapons, vehicles, and more.</p>



<p>That means there are even more things that could go wrong and extend downtime, and even if Epic Games were to publicly announce a release time, it would still be subject to change.</p>



<p>What is known, however, is that content creators have already gotten their hands on Chapter 7 during an early access event, with full details set to be shared ahead of the launch—which could become a standard approach for Epic Games, with a similar early access event ahead of The Simpsons mini-season.</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p>Very few headlines have sent a shiver down our spines quite like this one, but yes, you read that correctly. Over 20 years after the release of <strong>Kill Bill Vol. 2</strong>, Quentin Tarantino has returned to write and direct one final chapter in the film's chronology... and it's premiering in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>"Quentin Tarantino had a dream of a Kill Bill chapter that never made it to the silver screen, a chapter known as 'Yuki’s Revenge'," the caption to the newly-released teaser trailer above reads. "Over 20 years later, Tarantino and Epic have come together to bring the story to life in Fortnite".</p>
<p>You'll be able to watch the short film, fully animated in the Fortnite engine and starring Uma Thurman (yes, <em>the</em> Uma Thurman), in Fortnite on <strong>30th November</strong> at <strong>7pm GMT / 8pm CET / 2pm, ET / 11am PT</strong>. Alternatively, you can catch it in cinemas during the upcoming screenings of <strong>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</strong> from 5th December.</p>
<p>Those who purchase a ticket to the film's opening weekend will receive a code for Yuki's Gogo Yubari outfit, which can also be unlocked in-game from 27th Nov - 1st Dec.</p>

<p>Fortnite has played host to all kinds of big music events over the years, but the premiere of a new Quentin Tarantino joint (albeit an animated short)? That's <em>wild</em>.</p>
<p>Those who have watched <strong>Kill Bill</strong> will know that it's no family-friendly affair, and while the teaser for the Fortnite short looks like things will be toned down a little (there's only so much peril and gore you can show with an anthropomorphised banana in the background), there's something about the combination of <em>this</em> film and <em>this</em> game that just feels... <em>eeeehh</em>.</p>
<p>Either way, for the Tarantino completionists who want to get in on his latest project early, we'll see you on the Battle Bus. Gosh, what a world we live in.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Paradox Announces $37 Million Write-Down After Bloodlines 2 Fails to Meet Sales Estimates, But the DLCs Are Still Happening]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/paradox-announces-37-million-writedown-bloodlines-2-fails-meet-sales-estimates/</link>
            <guid>1366345</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In a press release shared late yesterday evening, Swedish publisher Paradox Interactive announced that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 failed to meet its sales estimates. Due to the game's underperformance, the publisher has been forced to make a non-cash write-down of around $37 million in 'capitalized development costs'.</p>



<p>Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester said that the company is proud of the work done by The Chinese Room (which replaced the original developer, Hardsuit Labs), but also admitted that the sales will not match the projections. In a refreshing move, the executive took the blame on the publisher's side instead of blaming the developers as so often happens nowadays, adding that Paradox's lack of expertise in the action RPG genre made it challenging to gauge the game's sales properly.</p>



<p>In the future, Wester vowed to return to the publisher's core market, which has always been in the grand strategy genre. Paradox's most accomplished games are, after all, Imperator: Rome, the Crusader Kings series, the Europa Universalis series (which has just received <a href="https://wccftech.com/europa-universalis-v-announced-by-paradox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its fifth main installment</a>), the Victoria series, the Hearts of Iron series, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellaris-out-of-this-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellaris</a>. This isn't surprising, as Deputy CEO Mattias Lilja already <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-tentatively-slated-for-first-half-of-2025-but-paradox-intends-to-license-out-a-potential-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> last year that another Bloodlines title would be licensed out instead of developed internally.</p>



<p>Indeed, Fredrik Wester said:</p>



<p><em>We’ll evaluate how we best develop World of Darkness’ strong brand catalogue in the future.</em></p>



<p>That said, Paradox confirmed that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is still getting its two DLCs as planned, as well as other free post-launch updates. In the DLCs, players will find themselves in the shoes of different characters: Loose Cannon is focused on the former Sheriff of the Seattle Court, Benny Muldoon, whereas The Flower &amp; the Flame lets you play as the Toreador vampire Ysabella. The first DLC will be available in Q2 2026, with the second DLC following in Q3.</p>



<p>Recently, former The Chinese Room Creative Director Dan Pinchbeck <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-bloodlines-2-creative-director-wanted-to-call-the-game-differently/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that he attempted to persuade Paradox to change the game's name because the studio lacked the time and resources to create a proper Bloodlines game. Alas, the publisher did not relent, and the result is abysmal sales and mixed reviews.</p>



<p>I somewhat enjoyed my time with Bloodlines 2, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-greatly-uneven-but-still-worth-a-look/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted in the review</a> that its several flaws only warranted purchase at a much lower price, and even then, only for fans of Vampire: The Masquerade. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2</a>'s dev team is set to grow substantially over the next couple of years, as CD Projekt ramp up development. While most of their ranks right now are on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, a game that's at least made some public cameos even if it's still sans release date, once 2027 rolls around, Cyberpunk 2 looks like it won't be too far behind.</p>
<p>This info comes from the company's latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2025.pdf">financial report</a>, covering the time running from July 1st to September 30th this year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In their presentation, CD Projekt interrupted some shouting about the original Cyberpunk continuing to sell well by showing off a developer headcount graph forecasting how they plan to continue "laying the foundations for Cyberpunk 2" across 2026 and 2027. These efforts follow lessons CD Projekt have said they learned from the first Cyberpunk's infamous launch, with <a href="https://www.gamepressure.com/newsroom/cyberpunk-2077-was-a-valuable-lesson-adam-kicinski-on-work-organi/zb3a43">understaffing around the pandemic</a> contributing to in the run up to crunch and more game-centric foibles like the RPG's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cdpr-says-its-new-boston-studio-means-cyberpunk-2-will-be-more-authentically-american/">European-style manhole covers</a> being a symptom of some struggles for a Europe-based dev team to really nail the nuances of an American dystopian city.</p>
<p>As of October 31st this year, the studio says 135 devs are working on Cyberpunk 2. The graph shows Cyberpunk 2's development is split across teams in Warsaw and Vancouver, as well as a bigger group at the newer Boston studio CD Projekt set up specially to work on the sequel. As of these financials, the 135 cited look to mainly be in Boston, with CD Projekt joint-CEO Michał Nowakowski <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">noting</a> that team's around 80 people strong and mostly senior level staff.</p><p>"Having accomplished our goal of building a strong leadership team at its core, we are now shifting to hiring more mid-entry level roles to carry on with pre-production works," he explained. "We plan to expand the Boston-based Cyberpunk team as the project progresses, and double it in the next two years." So, that'd bring the team to about 160-ish people by 2027. Meanwhile, the Canada and Poland-based teams are set to grow, too, so the entire ensemble will swell to just over 300 staff in the same timespan.</p>
<p>The graph doesn't give exact numbers for these planned future headcounts and Nowakowski alluded to wanting to "shift the split" between the two sets of devs to "around 50%" in the same time, making it a bit harder to compare these numbers to the 447 devs currently working on The Witcher 4. As of writing, it looks like the 2027 headcount will fall short of that Witchery number by about 100 devs. One thing Nowakowski added is that the company still strongly believe all the investment they have made and plan to make in adding the Boston studio will "pay off in the future, bringing the next Cyberpunk experience to a new level."</p>
<p>We'll have to see if that means the teams working on it will eventually come to surpass the number of people CD Projekt chucked at the original, which a <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2021/04/fy-2020-presentation.pdf">presentation</a> about the company's 2020 financial results I've gone back and dug up cites as having been the work of 530 developers. Cyberpunk 2077 was famously plagued with bugs at launch, so hopefully all this investment will see its sequel avoid the same fate. That might not mean lobbing more devs at it, though, especially given a lot of CD Projekt's spending has been with the goal of just being able to work on Cyberpunk and The Witcher simultaneously, rather than switching back and forth.</p>
<p>Either way, with a more deliberate build-up over these next two years, one would hope the result in a smoother road once the game really starts to gather speed. For now, Nowakowski's "happy with the progress the CP2 team has made so far", but warned "it’s for sure too early to talk about entering any next stage or phase of this project".</p><p>Numbers, eh? For now, The Witcher 4's the thing to keep an eye on release-wise as it's far further along in the pipeline, though Nowakowski has <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1993732049044128043">tweeted</a> that it won't be popping up at this year's Game Awards following its reveal at least year's iteration.</p>

            <guid>1366333</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="318">As game sizes continue to grow with new releases sometimes topping 100GB, it’s becoming harder to make room to play them all. You have two options: either delete games after you finish them or expand your storage. The simpler and more permanent solution? Upgrading to a larger solid-state drive. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5983/">Currently, the Samsung 9100 Pro SSD is on sale at Amazon, offering discounts up to 33%.&nbsp;</a>This SSD is available in several storage sizes, including 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, and an enormous 8TB option. With the sale, you can save anywhere from $60 to $250 depending on the version you choose. The 1TB model is now $135 (down from $200), the 2TB version is $220 (down from $280), the 4TB model is priced at $370 (down from $470), and the 8TB version is available for $750 (down from $1,000).</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="318">Instead of constantly juggling downloads, you can switch between games whenever you feel like jumping back into an old favorite. This convenience extends to other large applications as well, whether you’re editing 4K footage from large files or storing extensive media collections.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5983/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1136" data-end="1568">Beyond just giving you all that extra storage space, the Samsung 9100 Pro will deliver solid performance. With read speeds reaching 14,700 MB/s and write speeds of up to 13,300 MB/s, this SSD offers blazing-fast data transfers while remaining power-efficient. Whether you’re gaming, editing videos, working with large datasets, or whatever else it is you do at your computer, the Samsung 9100 Pro provides the performance you need without putting unnecessary strain on your system’s power usage.</p>
<h2 data-start="1136" data-end="1568">PlayStation 5 Compatible</h2>
<p data-start="1570" data-end="2047">If you’re a PlayStation 5 owner, you’ve probably noticed that storage can be tight. The PS5 comes with only 825GB of internal storage, and with the growing size of AAA games, you’ll find yourself deleting and reinstalling games just to make room for new ones. Fortunately, the PS5 allows you to expand its storage with a compatible M.2 SSD, and the Samsung 9100 Pro is one such option. However, if you want to avoid overheating, it’s crucial to get the version with a heatsink. These are small metal casings that sit around the SSD which allow heat to dissipate.</p>


<p data-start="2049" data-end="2267">Installing the SSD in your PS5 is a straightforward process that you can follow along with watching any number of YouTube tutorials. Right now, the 2TB version with a heatsink is priced at $209, the 4TB version is $399, and the big 8TB version is $800. The 1TB with heatsink option is currently out of stock.</p>
<p data-start="2049" data-end="2267">Heatsinks on their own go for about $10 to $20. Now when you compare each of the Samsung 9100 Pro SSDs here, with and without heatsink, there’s definitely a drop off in value. The 2TB option with a heatsink is actually cheaper than without so there’s not reason not to pick up that one (where you end up using the heatsink or not). The 4TB model is about $20 more with a heatsink. That isn’t bad but you might be able to pick up the standard version and find a different heatsink for less. Then the 8TB price difference is laughable. It’s $50 more to get it with the heatsink. Don’t do that. Get yourself another one for far less.</p>

<p>There are probably a few collectors around the world who are keen to buy and own every piece of Fortnite media in existence. One of the most lucrative and desirable pieces of memorabilia is the game itself, and a physical copy of Fortnite has become the most expensive ever.</p>



<p>It’s hard to imagine there’s a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-to-feature-quentin-tarantinos-dream-kill-bill-chapter-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> collectible that hasn’t been manufactured. Epic Games continues to sit on one of the richest and phattest cash cows in gaming. While more unorthodox merchandise is out there, including Fortnite Crocs—because even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-special-edition-crocs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox is doing Crocs</a> now—the physical game itself in perfect condition is where it’s at.</p>

<figure><figcaption>The smell of money. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/xbox/fortnite-wata-10-a-sealed-storm-master-weapon-pack-xbox-one-gearbox-2017-usa/a/7428-28105.s?ic4=ListView-ShortDescription-071515#auction-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Heritage Auctions</a> oversaw the sale of a sealed “Fortnite – Wata 10 A++.” This means the box is in perfect condition, sealed, and has achieved the highest grade possible in terms of its quality, condition, and other factors.</p>







<p>It’s also a 2017 original physical copy, too. With all this in mind, it’s sort of no surprise to see the prized possession sell for <strong>$42,500!</strong></p>



<p>Some would argue this might be too much for a sealed video game that no one has the intention of opening. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Wow. Credit to Heritage Auctions</figcaption></figure>



<p>The beauty of Fortnite is that it’s a free-to-play digital title, so the user can still easily play Fortnite anyway, but have a desirable collectible on display to marvel at in between hard-earned dubs.</p>



<p>How much would you be prepared to pay for a collectible? Is this a great purchase given that it’s likely to appreciate more as the years go by? As usual, the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> is the perfect place to tell all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New job listings have revealed that Sledgehammer Games is currently hiring developers who have past experience with the Nintendo Switch, suggesting that their next Call of Duty title could be coming to the platform.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4347622051/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">job listing</a> for a Senior Technical Artist was found on LinkedIn and states that someone with “AAA mobile or Switch experience” would receive “bonus XP” with their application.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-finally-heading-to-switch">Call of Duty Finally Heading to Switch</h2>



<p>For those out of the loop of Call of Duty, the series hasn’t been released on Nintendo platforms since 2013, with the last in the series on Nintendo being Call of Duty: Ghosts.</p>



<p>However, as a part of the Microsoft acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which was finalized in October 2023, it was ruled that Microsoft must release Call of Duty on Nintendo platforms for 10 years. At the time of writing, that agreement has not yet started as Call of Duty has remained to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p>



<p>Presumably, Call of Duty hasn’t been released on Nintendo platforms due to hardware limitations, a concern raised by regulatory bodies during the proposed acquisition. However, since the Nintendo Switch 2’s release earlier this year, it has proven that it can release games of similar hardware demands, suggesting that the Switch 2 could easily run Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Whether or not Sledgehammer Games’ next title, believed to be released in 2027, will be the first in the series to release on the Nintendo Switch 2 remains to be seen, as Infinity Ward is set to release Modern Warfare 4 in 2026, set in Korea.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Sundays are everything. Developer Sparrow Night's newspaper management game gives the player one week to report out, print, and distribute the weekly paper—and do everything in between, be it decorating the office with plants, managing power struggles across the city, or optimizing workstations. It all matters in determining what role your newspaper will play in a fictional '30s version of New York City.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though Sparrow Night was formed in 2019 by Jan-Maarten Nachtegeller and Stefan Rijsmus, Nachtegeller found the inspiration for&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;in 2016 after reading a&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://mashable.com/feature/making-the-new-york-times">Mashable photo feature</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;on the New York Times in the '40s, in which dozens of black-and-white photos showcased the news-making process from the time. Reporters smoke cigarettes at messy desks in a crowded newsroom. People at typewriters record messages received over wires from around the world. Paper falls from printers and onto the floor, which is no longer visible under the white sheets. Typersetters build out molds to create newspaper plates for printing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a complicated process—and perfect to translate into a video game. It wasn't until 2017, though, when Nachtegeller started to conceptualize what a game could look like, after playing Weappy Studio's&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>This Is The Police</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "I instantly thought about the newspaper project," he said.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/creating-the-card-based-rpg-battle-suit-aces-game-developer-podcast-ep-59" target="_self" data-discover="true">Creating the card-based RPG Battle Suit Aces - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 59</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rijsmus and Nachtegeller began working on&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;in late 2018 into 2019. Bart van de Sande joined the team in 2020, contributing as both a developer and the composer behind &nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s music. More team members joined later in the process, including support from publisher Twin Sails Interactive. Over the past six years, Sparrow Night has been iterating on the core idea of the game—based on the newspaper processes of companies like the New York Times—to create a compelling management game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What appeals to me about&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;is that it's a little bit of everything," van de Sande said. "If you're really a history freak, you will like the game. But if you like managing a conveyor belt, so to speak, that's what it boils down to."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the player takes over a struggling newspaper and rebuilds it nearly from scratch. They must renovate both the office and the ethical standards of the newspaper—balancing the need to publish accurate, newsworthy stories about world events with salacious pieces that bring in tons of eyeballs. Then there's advertising—which takes up precious space in the paper—and different groups lobbying for good coverage. You need to keep your employees, readers, and the looming mafia happy to succeed. It's quite the highwire act, which makes it a compelling management simulator.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/finding-smart-shortcuts-in-a-short-hike-postmortem-unlocking-the-vault-4" target="_self" data-discover="true">Finding smart shortcuts in A Short Hike postmortem - Unlocking the Vault #4</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;We're just a couple of guys goofing around.

We will get a bit more structured for the next projects, more streamlined, but we shouldn't lose our looseness"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sparrow Night spent a lot of time balancing the real process of newspaper-making during that time with compelling gameplay mechanics.&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;needed to be fairly accurate, but some accuracy got in the way of simple, clear cut gameplay. Nachtgeller pointed to the role of editors in the process as something that needed to be cut. "The editor normally has a way bigger role, and that's something we always struggled with," he said. It made the game too much in the weeds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over the course of development,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;went through several iterations. "We've done many iterations on different concepts in the game," van de Sande said. "We're making a game about running a newspaper. But how do you actually translate that to a game? It's a very difficult subject to make concrete rules."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;was originally released as an early access title in February 2024, which let Sparrow Night keep iterating while receiving feedback from the playerbase. Van de Sande said that process was as much a financial decision as a creative one.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/marvel-rivals-introduced-a-pve-mode-to-reduce-the-pressure-of-competition" target="_self" data-discover="true">Marvel Zombies was built to give Marvel Rivals players a breather</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team had already been toiling away on its own for years, tweaking systems and cutting and removing content. Nachtgeller said the news items system is one of those pieces of the game that went through a lot of changes before they eventually landed on "an elegant solution.", But it meant removing some of the complexities they originally fleshed out. Van de Sande said there were six or seven versions of that system.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Something we had at the beginning was that the newspaper was almost a&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tetris</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;game in itself, like you had to fit stuff in," Nachtgeller said. "You had to fit stuff, and there was too much emphasis on being an arcade element. That got taken out. We also had a fully functional power system with cords that you had to bring all the way to the tower, but that took away too much from the newspaper making."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But early access was a chance to recoup some costs and get direct feedback from more players. It was a way to ease into the release of a new game, which Nachtgeller explained can be quite daunting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I don't know how people do it without the community test," he said. "Without having the feedback, it's even scarier to release a game. It already feels very scary, but you at least know that quite a lot of people had fun in the early access, so you can bank on that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now, Sparrow Night will spend some time monitoring&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s release and fixing any bugs and issues that arise. When they're ready to move onto a new project, there are some learnings the team will take with them. The first thing that they'll do, Nachtgeller said, is hone into the core gameplay early on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There's almost no project that's exactly like how it started, but having more strict boundaries does help," Nachtgeller said, while noting thatSparrow Night wants to keep its development structure loose enough to allow for experimentation. "It's been quite loose, and that's one of our strengths," van de Sande said. "We're just a couple of guys goofing around. We will get a bit more structured for the next projects, more streamlined, but we shouldn't lose our looseness, because it's also what makes it fun, and what makes&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;stand out, because we're not your ordinary game development studio."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Columnist, Game Developer</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nicole Carpenter is a veteran reporter who has been covering the video game industry for over a decade.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/news-tower-is-designed-to-nourish-your-inner-history-freak-]]></content:encoded>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has received a patch this morning, fixing an exploit that allowed players to shoot quicker than intended with the help of quick-use items, which was allowing some to dominate fights with other players.</p>
<p>This was best used with the El Toro shotgun, a close-ranged powerhouse balanced with its low rate of fire. With this exploit, players were unloading multiple shells in quick succession, causing havoc on live servers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AdOeQ96Ecg">Here's an excellent video by Gravez that shows it in action</a>. This was dubbed "double pumping" by some members of the community, as you could often knock out a light-shield user with two well placed shots with the El Toro. Stop laughing.</p>
<p>The way it worked was simple: you would shoot, which initiates the re-chambering animation, and then quickly press the quick use button during this animation, followed by the button for the weapon slot of your weapon mid-animation. This would cancel the animation early with a new round ready to go, slicing down the reload time significantly.</p>

</figure>
<p>There are other fixes included in the patch that deserve their flowers. All locked rooms across the game have exploit mitigation mechanics added, following weeks of players finding inventive ways to break in without keycards. Players can also no longer push other people around by jumping on each other's backs, so no more funny business.</p>
<p>There are also some more minor fixes, such as main menu texture problems going the way of the dodo, lighting artifacts upon entering a map being removed, and the correct voice options actually being reflected on restarting the game.</p>
<p>It's not the most bombastic patch, but it is one with a massive impact on the experience for high-end players. PvP is now fairer, and you'll actually need keycards to get the best loot. Stellar Montis should now be a safer place for raiders, minus all the Arc still <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-patch-nerfs-one-of-its-most-devastating-weapons-floods-your-room-with-ducks">hunting for your rubber ducks</a> of course. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-its-pc-record-yet-again-as-it-inches-towards-half-a-million-concurrent-players">A nice location for the still-absurd number of players to dive into</a>, relatively worry free.</p>
