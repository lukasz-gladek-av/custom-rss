			<p>During a recent press event, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went hands-on with Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, the upcoming survival horror game based on a brand new IP created by Polish developer Bloober Team. Following the demo session, we interviewed Bloober's Lead Level Designer, Piotr Tylus, to learn more about this intriguing game, which is currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-set-to-launch-in-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to launch sometime in the Fall season</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>The setting here is very much close to home for you and the development team. First and foremost, what made you guys pick this specific city to focus on for Kronos?</strong></p>



<p>Well, it's part of history for at least part of the Bloober team, which has made games in Poland before. It's a formula that works better every time. In here, it's on a grander scale. For one of our developers, it's really, like, personal. He lives some ten minutes from the location that inspired the game. It's just pretty cool to put a part of you and a part of history in there, and also, it gives you this advantage that it's pretty exotic in terms of setting. Not that many people have exposure to this brutalist socialist stuff. So for us, it's just important and also exciting and hopefully gonna be exciting for other people.</p>



<p>I don't have a connection to Nowa Huta or Krakow. I don't live there, but it was a great opportunity to do my craft, do the research, being there, I can be on a trip, like moving through the streets, and it's always a fun part of the job just being on the location. For me, it was the first time to actually recreate something real, so yeah, it was a fun process. You want to take the atmosphere in, but you also have to gamify to some degree, right? You can't take it 1-to-1 and call it a day.</p>



<p><strong>Yeah, I think the last thing players want is to have to actually walk through entire city blocks while they're being chased by some of these anomalies.</strong> <strong>Anyway, it feels like there's a combination of very intimate encounters within hallways and expansive, open arenas. How do you balance the two to keep the narrative interesting while still flowing for Cronos?</strong></p>



<p>It's always a balancing act. We start the process by basically setting up the base of what we want to achieve at the moment and then picking the proper place to build around it. Those locations are not random. We try to understand what's the best fit for the encounter we want to make and the game's mechanics to keep things fresh. Also, the merging mechanic comes in handy because it's a really flexible framework to work with. You can do a lot of cool stuff. You probably saw some of the setups, and it grows more and more into the game. Hopefully that answers your question.</p>



<p><strong>Yeah. When you're building out these levels, do you have a specific objective in mind where you want the player to kind of backtrack more than in earlier sections?</strong></p>



<p>For sure, it's really important to give this idea. Backtracking is a thing in our game. There's optional routes in our game. Also, exploration is a huge part of Cronos and it also plays to the difficulty. If you won't explore, you're probably gonna have a hard time, but that's a challenge that you're imposing on yourself. We want to make players curious but also give them a reason behind all this exploration. It's part story, part actual thing that will help them push through all the challenges they face.</p>



<p><strong>I came across a couple of collectibles during my playthrough, such as comic books. We also discovered one cat by going off the beaten path. What other side objectives or collectibles have you tucked away in the game's levels?</strong></p>



<p>I believe that in the demo, we have a pretty representative part of what you can expect later. Of course, there's also just small side stories related to places, actually. There's a couple of narrative bits that maybe you don't need to collect them to understand the story, but if you want to feel what those people feel, it's probably wise to do that, but yeah, mostly, it's those collectibles that you mentioned and also just valuables, like energy, how we call it in our game, to make yourself stronger.</p>



<p><strong>How much will players be able to backtrack and return to much earlier areas in Cronos: The New Dawn?</strong></p>



<p>I need to bite my tongue. I cannot really share anything, but I will only say that it opens up. I'll put it that way.</p>



<p><strong>One of the things that you hinted at before we got into the demo was that there would be different survivors to recruit, and we could choose whether we wanted to save them or not. Will these decisions impact either the levels that you go into or how you can proceed?</strong></p>



<p>To some degree, those decisions matter in terms of both, what you have around, what you experience. Also, there's the gameplay element to that. There are those perks that we mentioned in the presentation. You couldn't see that in the demo. Also, let's say those souls go through the journey with you, let's put it that way. Who you're gonna choose, who you're gonna save, affects the experience overall.</p>



<p><strong>How permanent are those choices in Cronos?</strong></p>



<p>That's a good one. Let's put it that way: there's no coming back after you make a choice. Of course, if you want to replay the game with different choices, you are free to do so.</p>



<p><strong>Are you considering including a New Game Plus mode for Cronos: The New Dawn?</strong></p>



<p>There is a New Game Plus, and there's difficulty modifiers as well.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cronos_Nest-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Resource management is very much a central pillar to survival horror, and here you had to make a lot of interesting choices as you're gathering these resources, gathering whether it's energy or the chemicals and the metal scraps to choose whether you want to create ammunition or health. How do you kind of balance it by having the scarcity but also ensuring that players never run out of options?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, there are some mechanics in the game that support that. Enemies are dropping stuff so that there is a way for you to survive even if you're in a pinch, but it requires a little bit more work for the player. Other than that, it's just playtesting and what we feel like the experience we want to give you is, because you probably noticed that there are some areas or some, let's say, challenges, which are designed in a certain way that you need to survive to pull through. We wanted to have those difficulty spikes to keep it fresh.</p>



<p><strong>The boss fight that bookended our demo session was pretty much a battle of attrition where we wound up using just about every resource we had on hand, whether it was the healing sprays, the shotgun ammo, or the handgun ammo. If players find themselves backed into a wall during one of these boss fights where they run out of ammo, do you generate new ammo throughout the encounters that players can still pick up to finish the fight?</strong></p>



<p>As I mentioned, if there are other enemies, there is a way to replenish resources, especially if you're low, but with those encounters, there's a fixed way. You can always come back and explore more because you probably missed something if you feel like you're not well-equipped. But as you mentioned, we want the player to use all the tools available. That's important for us. That's why there are some challenges you need to overcome to learn that this works that way, and you need to keep using it in order to go through.</p>



<p><strong>One of the fascinating mechanics we haven't seen before in survival games is the merge system for Cronos: The New Dawn. When introducing new enemy types, do you onboard the player by introducing them on their own, or do you give them a trial by fire by throwing this new enemy type into something that can merge with them right away?</strong></p>



<p>Well, it differs in terms of what enemy we're talking about. Sometimes it's like that, other times it's more in an intimate scenario.</p>



<p><strong>A lot of times, these encounters feel fair. You might not be able to see something on screen, but you can definitely hear it coming up behind you. On the other hand, in the apartments, it was very claustrophobic and there you introduce exploding enemies that players had never seen before, so they will go around the corner and randomly just explode in a shower of acid on them. What's your mindset for shocking the players with moments like this?</strong></p>



<p>Well, with those little ones... We don't really want players to feel like they are invincible. Sometimes you need to slow down. The world is dangerous, right? So, it's wise to look around, so yeah, there are some enemies like that, like traps. That's the reason behind it. Of course, as you can imagine, they reappear in a different context later on.</p>



<p><strong>You guys introduced the torch fuel more as a defensive mechanic to drop down since it burns enemies around you and allows you to escape. But at the same time, you use it to essentially solve environmental puzzles, burn away blockades in your path, et cetera. What was behind the conscious decision to make that a core traversal mechanic?</strong></p>



<p>In those moments, you need to pick your path. Sometimes, the main path is closed, and it's just a learning experience, more or less, but there are a lot of optional paths that you can take. You might be in trouble there, but you can always come back later if you're more confident with that.</p>



<p>The reason behind it is to put a little bit more decision-making because our combat is all about you being prepared. You decide what you want to do and how to approach.</p>



<p><strong>Cronos: The New Dawn is a project that's been in development at Bloober Team for at least four years. During this time, you released the Silent Hill 2 remake to the public. How did your development with Silent Hill 2 influence how you designed levels for this game?</strong></p>



<p>We are sharing our experiences for sure. We provide each other with feedback, so we try to learn our lessons. During development, as you can imagine, there's a lot of iteration going around. You play test and iterate and so on and so on. But we also wanted to make our own thing. I like the analogy from the presentation, that pizzas have different toppings and there is no superior pizza. We want to cook a little bit differently, just to separate ourselves from the other projects we're doing.</p>



<p><strong>The city setting here is something that Western players might not be very familiar with in terms of Poland. Is there one piece of media, whether a movie or book, that you feel represents the city and the time period seen in the story?</strong></p>



<p>That's a good question. There's a lot of old Polish socialist era stuff. Something specific for Krakow... It's hard to commit to one thing, at least from my perspective, because actually being there is probably the best way, to just visit, if you want to feel this atmosphere.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Cronos-The-New-Dawn-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Fair enough. During my demo playthrough, I ran into one enemy wearing a shirt that was obviously modeled from The Medium. What sort of other Easter eggs have you tossed in there from previous Bloober games?</strong></p>



<p>If you look closely enough, some comic books can be familiar, let's put it that way. But there are a couple more Easter eggs later on, and I will leave them for you to discover.</p>



<p><strong>You've surely played through a lot of Cronos yourself. What do you think is the most effective way to survive?</strong></p>



<p>You mentioned that you used the flamethrower as a defensive tool. I actually rather use it offensively or in a set-up situation, like, oh, maybe I will use merge to my advantage to bait one of those. Perhaps that's the tip I will share on how to overcome some challenges—use some situation to your benefit that might not be as obvious.</p>



<p><strong>In closing, is there one type of encounter or level you feel most passionate about, like you think it's your best work in the game?</strong></p>



<p>I can't really share what's ahead of you, but yeah, there's for sure something that puts your pressure up. There are a couple of places, but I can't really spoil it.</p>



<p><strong>Understandable. Thank you for your time!</strong></p>

There’s a crossover event on the way.

Fans have taken to social media to point out what look to be telltale signs of slop, and the evidence is pretty convincing. But here’s the thing: even if this isn’t AI, or wasn’t produced entirely by AI, the fact that we’re reflexively scanning the minutiae of various images speaks to the state of fear this rampant technology is instilling in us.

To play the contrarian that I am for a brief moment, I’ve spent enough time in Photoshop to know that quick comp work that’s often done on a tight deadline due to corporate demands <em>can</em> produce similar effects. Assets get borrowed from previous work, and how layers intersect with one another isn’t always paid direct attention to. </p><p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Blizzard to verify whether or not the image is AI, but did not hear back prior to publication.</p><p>When humans produce similarly weird things, it’s usually an oversight, and in marketing, that does happen more often than you probably think. When AI does it, it’s because it doesn’t understand the image it’s creating. It’s just using patterns of pixels it’s digested from gobbling up other people’s art. </p><p>As many folks have pointed out, another reason why it’s highly likely that this is produced by AI is that Microsoft owns Blizzard by way of its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-cma-uk-xbox-1850864469&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-cma-uk-xbox-1850864469">Activision purchase a couple of years ago</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/news/713715/microsoft-copilot-appearance-feature-age-mustafa-suleyman-interview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/713715/microsoft-copilot-appearance-feature-age-mustafa-suleyman-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft <em>loves</em> AI</a></span>. And it’s particularly sucky, as <em>Hearthstone</em> fans have highlighted, that the game “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/comment/n4f4y77/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/comment/n4f4y77/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prides itself on its artwork</a></span>.” </p><p>Swim around in this same Reddit comment thread or elsewhere on the internet, and you’ll find some pushback to fans’ concerns. These people’s counterarguments essentially boil down to “Who cares?” Or the assertion that some people just always need something to complain about, and AI is just another thing for folks to score virtue-signaling points on the internet with. </p><p>To that, I’d say not so fast. </p><p>It’s so obvious that AI has been created and deployed specifically to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/20TAkcy3aBY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/20TAkcy3aBY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>eliminate</em> labor</a></span> (and with seemingly zero concern for the potentially irreversible energy impact on our dying planet, Cloud), that the deep concerns so many feel are not just about weird melty hands and odd ear physiology. They’re about what those things <em>represent</em>, what message this medium is communicating to those of us who value humanity in the artistic process or desire to become masters of art forms ourselves, and the fact that companies with massive power are doing what they can to restrict our abilities to sustain our lives, emotionally or financially, with said art. </p><p>This art, if it is indeed created by AI, tells us that our creations don’t have value and that those who make them are no longer needed. You can be indifferent to that, but it is what’s being said, and it is <em>not</em> the world many of us wish to live in.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hearthstone-diablo-ai-art-blizzard-microsoft-1851787162]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately for The Thing, the ability's usefulness depends on the person playing Human Torch, as they are essentially the driver of the ability and in full control. That's leading to some annoying (but admittedly funny) scenarios where Human Torch players are trolling Thing players by encouraging them to team-up and then swiftly sending them flying off the map to their death. You can see some terrible (or great) examples of that below.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, First Steps (when used normally) is a decent team-up ability that's great for locking down an objective or diving onto enemy players. That's more than can be said of some team-up abilities, which run the gamut between extremely powerful and largely useless. An example of a less-than-great team-up is Hulk and Wolverine's Fastball Special, which is similar to First Steps in that it lets Hulk pick up Logan and hurl him through the air.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-battle-pass-season-3-all-skins-emotes-and-other-rewards/2900-6762/" data-ref-id="2900-6762">Marvel Rivals Season 3</a> launched July 11 and added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-3-adds-phoenix-and-blade-introduces-new-villain/1100-6532891/" data-ref-id="1100-6532891">Jean Grey (aka Phoenix)</a> to the game's ever expanding roster, with Blade set to be added later in the season.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-horror-game-vile-exhumed-banned-from-steam-due-to-sexual-content.1255383/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Solo game dev Cara Cadaver has revealed that her indie horror game&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>has been banned from Steam, and having played the game myself, I can tell you the reason is...a little strange.</p>

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/dirtlord77/status/1949867514797707531" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media</a>, Cadaver says that <i>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</i>was banned from Steam for "sexual content with depictions of real people". As she points out, the game wasn't banned for "its use of gore in storytelling, or the violent themes".</p>

<p>The twist? As Cadaver says in her post, the sexual content for which the game was taken off Steam is "all implied". There's no explicit depiction of any kind of sexual act within the game; there are plenty of shocking and disturbing images, and the narrative is pretty unsettling, but that's about it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-steam-banned-emails.jpg?itok=uotDK6lT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-steam-banned-emails.jpg?itok=5CF3h4y2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>isn't coming to Steam anytime soon, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>Cadaver says she doesn't want to censor&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>or make changes to it; she says she "will not retell a story about these topics in a way to make people who don't understand it more comfortable".</p>

<p>Together with publisher DreadXP, Cadaver says she's currently looking into alternate ways to release&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>, and you can expect to hear "specific details" next week. Make sure to check out Cadaver's X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/dirtlord77" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">account</a> or <a href="https://x.com/dreadxpgames" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">that of DreadXP</a> for further info.</p>

<p>For context, Steam delisted a bunch of adult games from its platform earlier this month, citing concern from payment processors regarding the explicit content present in those games. Indie platform Itch.io <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itch-io-deindexes-adult-pages" rel="nofollow">quickly followed suit</a>&nbsp;(although the original version of&nbsp;<em>Vile&nbsp;</em><a href="https://final-girl-games.itch.io/vile" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">remains intact</a> on that site, ironically).</p>

<p>It all stems from a <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">campaign</a> started by activist group Collective Shout regarding a game by the name of&nbsp;<em>No Mercy</em>, an explicit title the group says "fl[ies] in the face of efforts to address violence against women".</p>




<p>The decision to remove Cadaver's game from Steam is, frankly, bizarre. If the point, as Collective Shout sees it, is to "address violence against women", then removing a game that directly tackles this theme in a frank and open way seems like a big mistake to me.</p>

<p>Of course, it's entirely likely that Steam simply panicked and pulled the plug on any game that might stand even the slightest chance of upsetting its payment processors, even if that game is about as far from "fl[ying] in the face of efforts to address violence against women" as it's possible to be.</p>

<p>Hopefully, Cadaver and DreadXP can find a way to release&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>somewhere else. In the meantime, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer" rel="nofollow">read my review</a> to find out why it's not only an important game from a message standpoint, but also a great experience in its own right.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> Secret Lair Chaos Vault drops. This otherwise random subset of Secret Lair drops all appear to be sci-fi themed, thematically connecting them to the newest set, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-new-commanders-in-mtg-edge-of-eternities" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Edge of Eternities</em></a>.</p>



<p>On the official <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/en/chaosvault#filter-product-1246458|sort-availability_wotc,featured" rel="nofollow">Secret Lair website</a>, there are eight new Chaos Vault drops. Four of those drops contain five cards taken from the <em>Edge of Eternities</em> set. The other four, called Commander Reinforcements, include an <em>Edge of Eternities</em> Commander deck.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-chaos-vault-alien-auroras-promo-image.jpg?itok=A4moVVNN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-chaos-vault-alien-auroras-promo-image.jpg?itok=KpsIRvFe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first two drops are titled <em>Alien Auroras</em>. This drop features, in both foil and non-foil, five cards with evocative artwork by Ian Permana. The drop contains the following cards:</p>

<ul><li><em>Reprocess</em></li>
	<li><em>Aggressive Mining</em></li>
	<li><em>Sylvan Safekeeper</em></li>
	<li><em>Crucible of Worlds</em></li>
	<li><em>Zuran Orb</em></li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-chaos-vault-featuring-deathburger-promo-art.jpg?itok=iin6Yq-W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-chaos-vault-featuring-deathburger-promo-art.jpg?itok=lBiLxBb4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those who appreciate the elegance of machinery over flesh, the second drop, <em>Featuring: Deathburger</em> may be for you. As the name implies, this foil and non-foil drop features Josan Gonzales aka Deathburger's, provocative cyberpunk artwork. The cards he has reinterpreted are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Ethersworn Canonist</em></li>
	<li><em>Goblin Engineer</em></li>
	<li><em>Dance of the Manse&nbsp;</em></li>
	<li><em>Arcbound Ravager</em></li>
	<li><em>Foundry Inspector</em></li>
</ul><p>The second half of the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Secret Lair Chaos Vault drops are mostly for those with deep pockets and a love for Commander. The <em>Commander Reinforcements: World Shaper</em> drop contains everything from the Alien Auroras drop as well as the World Shaper Commander Deck.</p>

<p>Similarly, <em>Commander Reinforcements: Counter Intelligence</em> includes everything from the <em>Featuring: Deathbringer&nbsp;</em>drop and the Counter Intelligence Commander deck.</p>

<p>The <em>Alien Auroras</em> and <em>Featuring: Deathburger</em> drops are being sold at MSRPs of $29.99 (non-foil) and $59.99 (foil), respectively. The <em>Commander Reinforcements</em> drops are being sold at MSRPs of $74.98 (non-foil) and $104.98 (foil). These drops will only be available while supplies last. If you are interested in any of these drops, and have the cash to spare, it is better to secure yours now.</p>

The prompts will be shown to Xbox players who indicate they’re over the age of 18 and will be shown when you sign into an Xbox account in the UK. Microsoft says it’s also exploring bringing similar age verification tools to other countries in the future.</p><p>To power the age verification in the UK, Microsoft is partnering with Yoti, which is one of the services that hasn’t fallen victim to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord"><em>Death Stranding</em> photo mode bypass</a>. While the age verification checks are optional right now, they will become a requirement to access a variety of Xbox services in early 2026, when additional parts of the UK’s Online Safety Act <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/important-dates-for-online-safety-compliance">come into force</a>.</p><p>“Starting early next year, age verification will be required for these players in the UK to retain full access to social features on Xbox, such as voice or text communication and game invites,”<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-age-verification-uk/"> explains Kim Kunes</a>, vice president of gaming trust and safety at Xbox. If you don’t verify your age between now and early next year, social features “will become limited to friends only” until the age verification process has been completed.</p><p>“Whether a player verifies their age will not affect any previous purchases, entitlements, gameplay history, achievements, or the ability to play and purchase games, however we encourage players to verify their age via this one-time process now to avoid uninterrupted use of social features on Xbox in the future,” Kunes says.</p><p>While this is limited to Xbox players in the UK right now, Kunes says, “We expect to roll out age verification processes to more regions in the future.” Microsoft isn’t revealing which other regions will get similar age verification requirements, but Kunes does note that “these methods may look different across regions and experiences.”</p><p>If you’re in the UK, then you can verify your age for your Xbox account <a href="https://aka.ms/XboxUKAgeVerification">online through Microsoft</a>, where you can use a selfie, a scan of your passport or driver’s license, a credit card check, or a mobile number.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/714458/microsoft-xbox-age-verification-uk-social-features]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Last week, Itch.io <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">delisted thousands of games featuring various kinds of "NSFW" material</a>, rendering them invisible to anybody searching or browsing the site. Other developers reported that their games had been taken offline entirely. Among the games delisted was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mouthwashing">Mouthwashing</a>, Rock Paper Shotgun's game of the year 2024. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In a statement, Itch.io explained that they had delisted or removed NSFW games in response to pressure from payment processors and a campaign from Australian activist organisation Collective Shout, who broadly want games that glorify sexual violence and the sexualisation of girls removed from sale, but who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">also have connections</a> to certain right-wing Christian groups that aim to abolish legal sex work and punish queer sexual expression.</p>
<p>Collective Shout had previously succeeded in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">forcing Valve to change their Steam policies</a> to give banks and payment processors control over the definition of "adult" content on Steam. A number of Steam games have been delisted or removed from sale as a consequence, though nothing like the deluge of de-indexification we've seen on Itch.io.</p>
<p>Many of Itch.io's delistings may be temporary. The platform holders may re-index them following "a comprehensive audit of content to ensure we can meet the requirements of our payment processors". Once the audit is done, they'll implement "new compliance measures" whereby NSFW game creators "must confirm that their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account".
</p>
<p>
Ahead of announcing any new regulations, Itch.io have <a href="https://itch.io/docs/creators/faq#is-adult-content-allowed">silently updated their developer terms and conditions</a> with "a non-exhaustive list of prohibited themes present in card processing networks". Devs will need to comply with that list in order to publish their work on Itch.io. It's rather open-ended, even without the caveat that it is "non-exhaustive". Here you go:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-consensual content (real or implied)</li>
<li>Underage or "barely legal" themes</li>
<li>Incest or pseudo-incest content</li>
<li>Bestiality or animal-related</li>
<li>Rape, coercion, or force-related</li>
<li>Sex trafficking implications</li>
<li>Revenge porn / voyeur / hidden cam</li>
<li>Fetish involving bodily waste or extreme harm (e.g., "scat," "vomit")</li>
</ul>
<p>
To continue my thoughts on Collective Shout's arguments from last week, I don't think games that glorify rape and actively contribute to a culture of would-be or actual rapists deserve exposure on storefronts like Itch.io or Steam. Still, there's nothing in this list to distinguish such a game from a game that tells a story about rape without endorsing it, or from a BDSM fantasy that stresses the importance of consent in real-life sex. "Sexual trafficking implications" is similarly ambiguous as to whether a game is allowed to feature trafficking as a plot theme without advocating for it.</p>
<p>Still, I can say with some confidence that Mouthwashing infringes on some of these prohibitions. So, I would argue, do <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>: Ground Zeroes, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>, Sonic The Hedgehog 2006, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crush-house">The Crush House</a>, Mortal Kombat, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</a>, and Viva Pinata. Itch claim that they are reviewing games case by case, but still, if your work is remotely NSFW, perhaps it would be safest to avoid releasing games on Itch.io for the time being.
</p>
<p>Collective Shout have now confirmed that they "called on Itch.io to remove rape and incest games that we argued normalised violence and abuse of women". They have also, interestingly, distanced themselves from many of the Itch delistings, arguing that they didn't demand that the platform remove "all" NSFW content, and that they are now receiving additional abuse and threats online as a consequence.</p>
<p>"We called on Itch.io to remove rape and incest games that we argued normalised violence and abuse of women," Collective Shout <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/steam_campaign_history">write</a>. "Itch.io made the decision to remove all NSFW content. Our objections were to content that involved sexualised violence and torture of women." They also cite an article in The Australian from 26th July in which founder Melinda Tankard Reist claims (in the paper's paraphrase) that Itch have gone "far beyond her request to ban sexually violent games".</p>
<p>As with the Steam delistings, Collective Shout's case might be stronger if they published full details of the individual games they've asked Itch.io to delist, and why they consider them harmful - particularly given their track record for mischaracterising other games they've tried to have removed from sale, like GTA 5 and Detroit: Beyond Human. It might also help if they voiced their support for the many queer creators who've been swept up by Itch.io's mass-delisting, in keeping with their <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/festival_campaign">previous condemnations of homophobia</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itch-post-new-list-of-banned-nsfw-content-that-would-rule-out-certain-kojima-games-plus-goty-2024-mouthwashing]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-review.1255347/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The most devastating part about Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game is just how short it falls of fulfilling such an insanely promising premise. I mean, which Tolkien nerd among us hasn’t daydreamed about living a relaxing life as a halfling? But instead of the warmth and comfort of the Shire, I spent 25 hours feeling like I was marching through the Dead Marshes in this cozy misadventure. It’s regrettably dull from start to finish, and runs so badly I wasn’t even allowed to be bored out of my mind in peace. The barebones life sim mechanics offer some of the most shallow versions of classic activities like fishing and farming that we’ve seen done much better in dozens of other games, and building social links with the inhabitants of Bywater is monotonous, repetitive, and never worth the effort. There’s at least some humorous writing and fun moments here and there, and the cooking minigame that serves as the main progression activity thankfully has slightly more depth than the other chores you do, but the few bright spots that exist are drowned out by one of the most disappointing cozy games I played since the Second Age. I went into Tales of the Shire thinking I’d be as happy as Denethor seeing Boromir, but I got Faramir instead.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though it rarely succeeds in the attempt, Tales of the Shire mostly follows the blueprint of games like Animal Crossing and Disney Dreamlight Valley, with stress-free slice of life activities in a quiet village as the main draw. You’ll try your hand at lesser versions of the usual fishing, gardening, and cooking minigames as you improve your relationships with your fellow townsfolk – all wrapped in a Tolkien skin that plays with the characters and locations found in The Lord of the Rings. The minimalistic story puts you in the hairy feet of a hobbit who’s recently moved to Bywater and begins to establish themself in the community, all while fixing up the rundown hobbit hole you’re given. You’ll meet some recognizable characters like Gandalf and Rosie Cotton and run samey errands for your neighbors in an attempt to get Bywater officially recognized as a village. As is often the case with games like this, it’s not much of a story, but has some likeable characters and amusing moments here and there as the goofy cast of hobbits bicker and squabble over trivial things that only a hobbit would bother caring about. Unfortunately, a complete absence of voice acting inhibits this high point; it just never quite felt right for such colorful and well-known characters to be completely silent throughout the story’s roughly 15-hour runtime.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Tales lacks those hidden layers of depth to get completely lost in.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the great things about the life sim genre is that, although they can appear fairly superficial at first, the longer you play, the more you discover hidden layers of depth to get completely lost in. Unfortunately, Tales lacks this essential component. At the point where I’d usually expect to enter an impossible-to-put-down chain of easygoing activities as I build out a quiet, virtual life for myself, it instead had me scratching my head as to what the point of all the monotonous busywork they’d saddled me with even was. That’s mainly because, despite featuring lots of cooking, Tales has very little meat on the bones for the vast majority of its mechanics, like how the best way to make money is to slowly walk back and forth across the very small map, picking up the same very small handful of foragable goods, then selling them so you can buy a single cut of bacon to use in cooking. The only time anything changes is when the seasons shift every dozen or so in-game days and you get a few new ingredients to find and crops to plant, but there’s a whole heck of a lot of tiresome grinding in between those shifts, which ultimately only alter the ingredients you’re collecting and the look of the village anyway.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Cozy Games</h3><p>If you're looking for a game that pairs well with a warm blanket and a hot cup of tea, look no further than these TieGuyTravis-approved recommendations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly every activity you’re expected to grind, from fishing to gardening, suffers from this same infuriating lack of depth. For example, you can only fish in a few spots around the map, and doing so yields the same very small handful of fish with little to augment or evolve your angling over time. When I unlocked my first fishing rod upgrade after completing numerous fishing-based quests, I was hopeful this would expand the number of fishing holes accessible to me or let me catch a whole new roster of sea creatures, but only moments later those hopes were dashed as I returned to the same places and caught the exact same fish I’d been reeling in for hours. And since you’re given tons of humdrum quests that require quite a lot of fishing to complete, you’re subjected to a whole lot of tedious repetition with very little in the way of payoff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Really the only exception is the cooking minigame, which serves as the main activity that all the others seem built to support and is much more substantial as a result. Fishing, foraging, gardening, taking care of chickens, and buying ingredients are all just a means to an end for your ever-hungry hobbit, and all of the components you gather are brought back to your home to combine into a dish you’ll then use to curry favor with other hobbits. You’re able to invite a few of your neighbors to share a meal with you once per in-game day, and after learning their preferences and cravings, you’ll have to mix together the right combination of flavors to maximize how much your cooking causes them to like you. Doing so levels up your social links, which awards ingredients and new recipes that open up new possibilities, and even occasionally result in a short conversation between you and whichever hobbit you’ve charmed – a decent payoff to your investment in a game that doesn’t respect your time in most other areas. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You’re subjected to a lot of tedious repetition with very little payoff.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, Tales still doesn’t really nail this minigame either, as the actual game part isn’t very good and is overly simplistic, especially in the first dozen or so hours before you unlock additional cooking tools that add a tad more nuance to the process. For example, unlocking the sauce pan allows you to stir different seasonings into your dishes that augment the flavor profile. Plus, you’re required to take on a ton of very boring chores just to get the ingredients you need, and then there’s a good chance you’ll just be waiting around for the next day to come before you can invite new people, since there are so few things to do aside from the time-gated meals. But cooking and the social elements it triggers are at least a relative highlight in a life sim that is so consistently underwhelming, and it does evolve over time in a way that the other activities don’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the grind of gathering ingredients, cooking meals, and feeding them to the residents of Bywater, you’ll also improve and decorate your little slice of the Shire. The home you’re given is pretty rundown at the outset, but is expanded and fixed up as you complete activities, the most important of which is the ability to raise chickens that generate eggs and gain access to more farm space. Unfortunately, although it’s nice to have more room and other small improvements like an actual working front door that takes way too long to unlock, there’s not a lot of interesting things to do with the additional space you’re given indoors. You gradually unlock decorations by completing quests, but there isn’t a ton of variety to them, zero functionality to adding things like new shelves and whatnot, and the entire layout of your home is static, so you have to just work around an existing floorplan that doesn’t offer much room for expression. This means that yet another component that’s usually a major draw in life sim games feels like only the minimum amount of effort was put into it. The good news is that the home you’re given definitely nails the Shire aesthetic when it’s fully upgraded, and even if there’s not many exciting options for personalization, it at least gets the job done when it comes to fulfilling part of the hobbit fantasy.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if Tales of the Shire were a more interesting game than it is, it would still be pretty hard to play purely by how unacceptably bad it runs. With constant framerate hitches, pop-in, aliasing, hard crashes, and other wonky stuff that suddenly broke, I never went more than a few minutes without something going terribly wrong. The worst of it was the consistent and repeated crashes throughout my play time that forced me back to my desktop, resulting in half an hour of lost progress as I had to start the entire day over. This often happened right after I completed sharing a meal with my halfling homeys, which requires quite a bit of prep work and planning, making it just about the worst time for a crash to happen. At one point I repeated a single day five times (totaling several hours of game time), with a crash happening at the end of the day each time, to the point where I wondered if I’d permanently broken something and wouldn’t be able to progress any further. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the issues, like how inconsistent the framerate is and how objects pop up right in front of your face, are more confusing than anything else – I mean, this does not seem like a particularly demanding game and I played on a high-end PC. It’s such a bummer, specifically because the painterly art style and iconic setting of the Shire has so much potential, and almost none of that comes through when you’re seeing shrubbery pop up right in front of you as you walk around town. Then there’s the one-off bugs, like one time where my fishing line stayed in the water when I was done fishing, and it wouldn’t let me put away my rod, so I walked around Bywater with a hilariously long fishing line stretching across the entire map. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also tried out a little bit of the Switch version and, well, let’s just say that I’d have to write a whole separate review to talk about how especially awful of an experience that was. It’s worth mentioning that near the tailend of my time with Tales of the Shire, there was an update that did improve some of the framerate issues slightly, so there’s at least hope that it will run better in the future after some patching up. But even after the most recent update, it still doesn’t run great.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game is the Grima Wormtongue of games: it whispered many wonderful promises into my ear, but by the end I was left a wretched shadow of my former self. I had a lot of hope that this could be the perfect mix of a genre I love and the Tolkien world I’ve spent much of my life nerding out about, but those hopes were cast into the fires from whence they came. With life sim mechanics that are shallow as they come, terrible technical performance, and almost nothing original to say, Tales of the Shire disappoints every step of the way. There’s hints of a better game to be found in its slightly more robust cooking mechanics, as well as the occasionally amusing writing and dialogue that prove this setting was indeed ripe for a life sim if executed better – but like a Silmaril, those dreams have vanished deep in the depths of Angband.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The people yearn to hike and porter, according to newly released Death Stranding 2 statistics. Director Hideo Kojima has reported that just under 80% percent of players (called "someones" by Kojima) who finished the game continued past the credits. He did not report how many players this represents, but did share a variety of other statistics concerning player behavior.</p><p dir="ltr">Kojima tweeted these details out as part of a post celebrating the game's one-month anniversary. It might not surprise you that the assault rifle was Death Stranding 2's most equipped weapon or the ladder its most equipped tool. But the statistics do include some of Death Stranding 2's sillier features. Out of all the animals players could rescue, they saved kangaroos the most (followed by emus and wombats). Via signage, players placed the "speed up" sign the most often. The post doesn't list any player count statistics, but Death Stranding 2 is popular. The game topped <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/death-stranding-2-and-rematch-top-the-ps5-charts-in-june-2025/2900-6742/">the PS5 charts in June</a>. The statistics also emphasize the game's <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-on-the-beach-community-build/1100-6533237/">asynchronous multiplayer</a>, where players build structures and place tips to help each other.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1949010026699350142" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Death Stranding 2.<br>It’s been a month since release. It seems many players have already reached the ending. Since all the “Someones” around the world are connected through SSS, we’re able to gather a variety of data.

He wrote, "To everyone who has reached the ending: The world today is in a difficult state. It might be hard to hold on to hope for tomorrow. But know that there is someone out there who would risk their life to protect you—Even if you don’t notice, someone is connected to you, watching over you."</p><p dir="ltr">If you are one of the "someones" who completed Death Stranding 2, check out GameSpot's <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/death-stranding-2-ending-new-game-plus-post-credits/2900-6733/">ending explained guide</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-is-suing-tencent-for-alleged-%E2%80%9Cslavish-clone%E2%80%9D-of-its-horizon-series-light-of-motiram.1255317/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has launched a lawsuit for copyright and trademark infringement against Tencent over what it calls a "<em>slavish clone</em>" of its Horizon game series, Light of Motiram.</p>



<p>Light of Motiram was first announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/">November 2024</a>, and it was immediately obvious to anyone even remotely familiar with the Horizon series that Motiram was at the very least drawing inspiration from Horizon, and that's being extremely generous with the comparisons. Being more appropriate and less generous, Motiram looked like a flat-out copy-paste job with a few changes in details and a new name.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Tencent debuted a <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-shown-in-new-gameplay-trailer/">gameplay trailer for Light of Motiram</a>, which did very little to show that Motiram was its own unique game compared to Horizon. Now, a report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/sony-sues-tencent-allegedly-ripping-off-horizon-video-games-2025-07-28/">Reuters</a> reveals that Sony was paying attention to Light of Motiram, and to how media pegged it as a Horizon copy. According to Reuters report, Sony's complaint includes how the media described it as a "<em>knock-off</em>," even including the phrase "<em>Horizon Zero Originality</em>."</p>



<p>We, as outsiders looking at Light of Motiram, might have seen it as a copycat of Horizon, but that's ultimately a public opinion. Proving it in court is a different matter entirely, as Nintendo is finding out with its attempt at suing <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/">Palworld makers PocketPair</a>. Needless to say, it'll be interesting to see how the case goes, and the kind of precedent it sets for the future of the industry.</p>

Veterans will know this is a feature that gives players special rewards. This can be in an item drop or an event, but it’s also how Game Freak sometimes delivers special Pokémon to players.<em> Legends: Z-A</em> will give early adopters a Ralts holding a Gardevoirite so it can Mega Evolve when it reaches its final form. The Publisher Information description explains how the player can acquire this gift, and notes that they will have to get about an hour-and-a-half into the game to access something called the “Link Play” menu.<em> Legends: Arceus</em> didn’t have this menu, even when it let players trade critters, and the term “link” has a specific connotation in the <em>Pokémon </em>franchise, as the original <em>Red</em> and <em>Green</em> games allowed you to play against other players with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Game_Link_Cable&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Game_Link_Cable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Link Cable</a></span>.

If you scroll down a little further, you’ll see it specified that <em>Legends: Z-A </em>only supports one player. At least, that’s what it says on the North American store. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000094233&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000094233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Japanese eShop</a></span> mentions that it will confirm online and local player numbers at a later time. We’ve reached out to Nintendo for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</p><p><em>Legends: Z-A</em> just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-za-champions-friends-concierge-1851786682&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-za-champions-friends-concierge-1851786682">had a big showcase during the Pokémon Presents stream</a></span> last week where no mention of any multiplayer functionality was made, but the Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim are set to take place from August 15 to 17. It’s entirely possible we hear more about the game then, and given that the competitive community will have its eyes locked on the show, that seems as good a time as any to announce multiplayer if it exists. For now, however, we’re left with more questions. <em>Legends: Z-A </em>launches on Switch and Switch 2 on October 16.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-link-play-multiplayer-switch-2-1851787158]]></content:encoded>

While the game is still a few months off, special Black Ops 7-themed cans are now appearing in stores.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1949559165476896948" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a>, Black Ops 7 cans are already available for purchase in convenience stores across the United States. In addition to Call of Duty colors and aesthetics, the cans also boast QR codes that will likely take purchasers to a website to input a special code hidden on the can.</p><p>Right now, the QR code simply takes you to the landing page for the old promo for Black Ops 6, suggesting that these cans are getting out into the wild a bit earlier than anticipated. Chances are good that you'll be able to snag some Double XP for the new game if you get your hands on one of these.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches later this year, and it will mark the first-ever back-to-back releases for a Call of Duty sub-series. It's in co-development at Treyarch and Raven Software, and it'll star Milo Ventimiglia (This is Us, Gilmore Girls) as David Mason, Kiernan Shipka (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) as Emma Kagan, and Michael Rooker (Guardians of the Galaxy) as Mike Harper.</p><p>Besides these details and a short teaser trailer that Microsoft showed off at Summer Game Fest, we don't know much about the game--but that'll change soon. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-reveal-set-for-gamescom-in-august/1100-6533147/" data-ref-id="1100-6533147">Black Ops 7 will have a full reveal at Gamescom</a> in mid-August. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-continues-franchises-obsession-with-weed/1100-6533294/" data-ref-id="1100-6533294">There may also be a big Call of Duty event in September</a>, although Microsoft has yet to confirm this.</p>

                <p>Due to pressure from payment processors and right-wing advocacy groups, the marketplaces Itch.io and Steam recently announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/" data-ref-id="1100-6533423">they would be delisting or de-indexing games that were perceived as "Not Safe For Work."</a> While apparently intended to disrupt the production and marketing of adult-content games, this move has already had a much broader impact: The critically acclaimed horror game Mouthwashing has been de-indexed from Itch.io as part of this sweep. </p><p>Martin Halldin, who works on audio and music for Mouthwashing developer Wrong Organ, posted on Bluesky that the title had been de-indexed from Itch.io. Halldin wrote that the game is currently still accessible if you have the link--it hasn't been fully removed yet--but not showing up in search results can still have a devastating impact on indie titles.  </p><p>After its launch in 2024, Mouthwashing racked up extensive acclaim and a number of end-of-year accolades. Its Steam reviews are sitting at Overwhelmingly Positive with over 28,000 user reviews submitted--a remarkable total for a game created by a small and previously unknown team. It is a psychological horror game, and the developer itself even warns on the product page that Mouthwashing contains "extreme violence, gore, mutilation and worse on PSX-style characters." </p><p>Despite its obviously mature content and themes, Mouthwashing does not contain pornography and is not sexually explicit--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/" data-ref-id="1100-6533423">which was ostensibly the main target of the campaign organized by advocacy group Collective Shout.</a> Despite the group's declared focus on preventing the depiction of "sexual abuse" in games, the campaign's impact has been to seemingly induce a much broader push to "de-risk" from <em>all </em>adult content, no matter its subject. As a result, horror games and other titles depicting subjects far afield from anything sexual have also been affected. <span><br></span></p><p>Developers and fans of affected games have been attempting <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sjklapecki.itch.io/post/3luohh5kf4s2d" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">to organize counter-pressure</a> to encourage payment processors to reverse their stance. Civil liberties NGOs like the ACLU have already joined the fight, too; the ACLU, for instance, <a href="https://action.aclu.org/petition/mastercard-sex-work-work-end-your-unjust-policy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">is currently soliciting signatures for a petition against Mastercard</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Witchfire, a dark fantasy FPS roguelite, launched in Early Access on the Epic Games Store in 2023, and then made its way to Steam Early Access a year later. Since then, it's received a number of updates, and today's Webgrave update is the latest, bringing new gear, new spells, a new region to explore, and some progression changes. You can watch the update trailer below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xxAzz-Iug2w"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xxAzz-Iug2w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The new area is an abandoned, twisted village swarming with monstrous human-like creatures, like giant spider people with humanoid heads. "Velmorne was once a town like any other, until its residents were twisted by witchcraft," a press release reads. "Disfigured and unformed, they roam deserted corners and squares, and ambush any foolish enough to wander down its forgotten roads."</p><p>The update also adds Rosary Beads, which can customize the player's abilities, overhauls the workshop system and player stats to make them easier to understand, and adds a new difficulty level: Gnosis IV.</p><p>You can read the full patch notes for yourself <a href="https://www.theastronauts.com/2023/09/witchfire-patch-notes/">on the game's website</a>. Witchfire is the current project of developer The Astronauts, known for The Vanishing of Ethan Carter – <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/the_vanishing_of_ethan_carter/b/pc/archive/2014/10/02/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-game-informer-review.aspx">you can read our review of that game here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/28/witchfires-webgrave-update-launches-today]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> with wacky character intro videos so good I have to watch each of them at least once every six months, got its 2025 summer update late last week. There are a host of new community-made maps, items, and taunts, in addition to a fair few bug fixes from Valve themselves.</p>
<p>Cool to see, though one vocal group of players are keen to see the developers delve back in and make some changes to matchmaking, having penned an open letter to the Steamy company outlining hopes for the revised system that melds the very old old one with the slightly less old one the game's had since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-fortress-2-matchmaking-update">2016's Meet Your Match update</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, the summer update. You can read the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/440/view/526475421347217633">full notes here</a>, but the highlights as follows. There are 10 new community maps, dubbed (clears throat) Citadel, Aquarius, Fulgur, Cargo, Conifer, Boardwalk, Blowout, Mannhole, Demolition, and Pressure. You can add 23 new community-made items and 14 unusual effects to that, with the latter being split seven-seven between hats and taunts.</p>
<p>Closing out the additions are four new taunts: The Final Score, Bear Hug, Texan Trickshot, and Flying Colours. I can guess exactly what two of those'll look like if done by a Heavy, the others are a bit more mysterious. Among the bug fixes are tweaks to outdated in-game tips, the Heavy's model being updated to add a fittingly-named "bullets bodygroup for cosmetics", and "the Texas Half-Pants not fully using rimlight". That last one's probably fairly boring in practice, but it made me snigger.</p>
<p>So, that's the update - nice and beefy for a game that's slowly inching closer to its 20th birthday (sorry if that's made you feel old).</p>
<p>Now, onto the letter. A group of TF2 players dubbed BringBackQuickplay and YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxOVl9a1KCU">Megascatterbomb</a> have penned <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1maoyoh/an_open_letter_to_valve_from_the_team_fortress_2/">an open letter</a> they say they're planning to send off to Valve, calling for the reintroduction of several features from TF2's pre-2016 quickplay matchmaking system. The central goal is a move away from skill-based matchmaking, back to a system that puts community-run servers at the forefront and allows team switching at will. As of writing, despite the letter being cited as from the entire Team Fortress 2 community, those behind it say its recommendations are based on a survey that got about 3.5k responses.</p>
<p>This also isn't the first time in recent history that Team Fortress 2 players have decided to crack open a word processor and write to Gabe Newell like he's their MP. Earlier this year, a group that looks to have included at least some of the same folks put together <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1jbwptw/unmutef2ps_an_open_letter_to_valve_from_the_tf2/">another letter to Valve</a> (in the exact same font) about giving players who've not upgraded to a premium account back the ability to use comms tools like text and voice chat. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-fortress-2s-latest-strike-against-bots-is-silencing-new-players">That change</a> debuted in 2020 as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-fortress-2-is-cracking-down-on-racist-bot-invasions">Valve's efforts to combat bots</a>, something Team Fortress players came together under <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-update-team-fortress-2-in-reaction-to-grassroots-savetf2-campaign">the #SaveTF2 moniker</a> to call for action on.</p>
<p>Basically, the game with the spy that goes boink hasn't been short on campaign groups over the past half decade. We'll have to see if this latest letter goes anywhere, or just remains a thing that's garnered some thumbs up from some Team Fortressers who frequent Reddit. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-fortress-2s-summer-update-is-here-and-a-group-of-players-have-penned-an-open-letter-to-valve-about-matchmaking]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Having been announced under the codename Project Defiant, Sony has now revealed more about the FlexStrike wireless fight stick. The stick is still in development, but will be viewable at Evo 2025 in Las Vegas, building up to a release in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="FlexStrike Wireless Fight Stick - Features Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TTGmg6uYXKc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The FlexStrike is compatible with both PS5 and PC, using either a wired connection or their ultra-low latency PlayStation Link USB dongle. The fight stick has mechanical switch buttons with toolless swappable restrictor gates – there are square, circle, and octagon restrictor gates that can be kept within storage compartments for the gates and the USB adapter. Additionally, the stick will come with a handy sling carry case, so you can take it wherever you need to get some fighting done. Digitally.</p>
<p>There’s some good quality of life features around all of this. That PlayStation Link dongle is an updated version of the one that shipped with the Pule Elite and Pule Explore headset and earbuds, now with USB-C – it’s not entirely clear if the original dongle will get a firmware update, but we’d expect it to. One dongle allows for simultaneous fight stick and audio use, and on PS5, one dongle will let two fight sticks connect for couch multiplayer.</p>
<p>The control inputs can be customised with a built-in lever mode switch for directional input tweaks, and a lock button to prevent accidental inputs and layout changes in a match.</p>

<p>While the FlexStrike has got many of the same game inputs as found on the DualSense controller, and has a touchpad, there will be software support to let it run at the same time as a DualSense controller, if you’d rather use the gamepad for menu navigation.</p>

			<p>One of PlayStation's announcements during its Summer Game Fest-timed State of Play was the introduction of a new wireless fight stick from the company, announced at the time under the name "<em><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-announces-project-defiant-a-wireless-fight-stick-for-ps5-and-pc/">Project Defiant</a></em>." Today, in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/28/new-details-on-playstations-first-wireless-fight-stick-flexstrike/">PlayStation Blog</a> post, the official name for the fight stick, FlexStrike, was revealed, along with a new trailer showcasing its features and the news that it'll be out sometime next year. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Compatible with PS5 or PC via a wired connection or wirelessly with PlayStation Link, our innovative ultra-low latency wireless technology, FlexStrike wireless fight stick features mechanical switch buttons and toolless swappable restrictor gates,"</em> writes Edwin Foo, vice president of product development at Sony. "<em>These include square, circle, and octagon restrictor gates that fit into the fight stick’s built-in storage compartments alongside the included PS Link USB adapter."</em></p>



<p>You'll be able to use it wirelessly with a USB-A dongle in the front or back of your PS5 or PC, or use it with a wired USB-C connection. You can have a DualSense controller connected to your PS5 simultaneously with the FlexStrike, to help navigate menus better, and as the trailer shows off, its wireless connection is Sony's new PlayStation Link, which is how all its most recent wireless peripherals connect to PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles. </p>



<p>It'll be at EVO 2025, but if you're at the event, you won't be able to try it. PlayStation says it'll be there "<em>on display only</em>," so you can get a look at it and the carrying case it comes with when visiting the Arc System Works booth. More details on when players will actually be able to get their hands on it will probably arrive closer to its actual release date, sometime in 2026. </p>



<p>PlayStation has had a firm hand in the fighting game community for years, but this is the first time it is making its own fight stick for players to use. Whenever players do get their hands on it, especially the pros that might consider bringing it to EVO, it'll be interesting to see if it can usurp the fight sticks and gamepads they already prefer.</p>

Itch.io quietly updated its list of banned content over the weekend with the following section on adult games:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The following is a non-exhaustive list of prohibited themes present in card processing networks. We are unable to support the sale of any works containing these topics:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Non-consensual content (real or implied)</li><li>Underage or “barely legal” themes</li><li>Incest or pseudo-incest content</li><li>Bestiality or animal-related</li><li>Rape, coercion, or force-related</li><li>Sex trafficking implications</li><li>Revenge porn / voyeur / hidden cam</li><li>Fetish involving bodily waste or extreme harm (e.g., “scat,” “vomit”)</li></ul></blockquote><p>Developers can appeal individual bans, but with thousands of listings removed and someone needing to actually play each individual title to adjudicate claims, that process seems all but unworkable in the short term. “It’s almost impossible to come up with an exhaustive list of unacceptable products to sell, so often we have to take content reviews one at a time,” Itchi.io writes on the site. “If an issue arises with your account that isn’t already covered by our policy, then we will contact you and share what options you may have.”<br></p><p>While Steam has also banned hundreds of games revolving around rape or incest in response to pressure from Visa, Mastercard, and other payment processors.
