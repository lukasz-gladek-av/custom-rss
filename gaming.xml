  <p id="XIrYTo">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This story contains spoilers for <em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2 episodes 3 and 4.]</p>
<p id="PY3SUF"><em>House of the Dragon</em> is no stranger to the supernatural. Not only does the HBO fantasy drama series boast plenty of low-key magic — not to mention, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23381183/house-dragon-all-dragons-riders-vhagar">y’know, <em>dragons</em></a> — but it’s also the prequel to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/24157742/game-thrones-finale-anniversary-next-show-like"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a>, a show loaded with snow zombies and smoke monster babies. Clearly, this is a universe where otherworldly forces are at play. Even so, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24176417/house-dragon-dunk-egg-game-thrones-connections">Daemon Targaryen’s (Matt Smith) unsettling stopover</a> at Harrenhal in season 2 arguably marks <em>House of the Dragon</em>’s most overtly supernatural subplot to date.</p>
<p id="nZ15rX">Everyone’s favorite sassy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23310439/house-of-the-dragon-sex-scenes-matt-smith-interview">sadboy prince</a> sets up shop at the supposedly cursed castle in episode 3, and strange goings-on start stacking up soon after. It certainly seems like he’s caught up in Westeros’ answer to <em>Ghost Hunters</em>, but is he (and everyone else) just jumping at shadows? Just how cursed is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/house-of-the-dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a>’s Harrenhal, really?</p>
<h2 id="tftgxE"><strong>Why does everyone think Harrenhal is cursed?</strong></h2>

<p id="d1hqgl">One of the few things Westeros’ high- and lowborn folk seemingly agree on is that there’s been a curse upon Harrenhal since its foundations were laid. Why? <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24178649/house-dragon-season-2-daemon-assassins-prince-blood-cheese">George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire<em> </em>books</a>, <em>House of the Dragon</em>, and <em>Game of Thrones</em> chalk up Harrenhal’s dubious reputation to two main factors.</p>
<p id="NijYJh">The first is the Olympic-level arrogance of Harrenhal’s founder, King Harren Hoare, in the lead-up to the castle’s ribbon-cutting ceremony. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/2019/5/13/18617829/game-of-thrones-scorpions-dragons-strategy-aegon-harrenhal">Harren made a big deal of how invincible</a> his generations-in-the-making fortress was going to be — and, on paper, his boasting made sense. Harrenhal is almost comically supersized, and its battlements (allegedly made from mortar mixed with Harren’s blood) can theoretically shrug off any conventional attack.</p>
<p id="7VYSc4">The bad news for ol’ Harren was that dragons are decidedly unconventional. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23668840/game-thrones-hbo-spinoff-house-dragon-aegon-conqueror">King Aegon I Targaryen and his sisters</a> swooped into Westeros literally the day Harren moved into Harrenhal and promptly torched the joint. The Targaryens’ dragons barbequed Harren and his sons during the assault, and Harrenhal itself was never the same again. Unsurprisingly, rumors that Harrenhal was cursed, haunted, or both sprung up soon after.</p>
<p id="Nj1ekJ">The second factor contributing to Harrenhal’s shady rep is that almost everyone who succeeded Harren as lord of the castle didn’t fare much better. We saw some of this misfortune in <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ eight-season run: Tywin Lannister, Janos Slynt, and Petyr “Littlefinger” Baelish wind up shot dead on the toilet, exiled and then beheaded, and Pez dispenser-ed, respectively. <em>House of the Dragon </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23365909/larys-strong-house-of-the-dragon-character-explained">season 1 adds Lyonel Strong and his boy Harwin to the Harrenhal curse’s supposed victims</a> as well.</p>
<p id="O18i0G">Frankly, it’s hard to blame folks for believing the place is jinxed!</p>
<h2 id="xzwmdW"><strong>What happens at Harrenhal in the Game of Thrones books?</strong></h2>

<p id="SYesBR">Both the core A Song of Ice and Fire<em> </em>novels and <em>House of the Dragon</em>’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23292279/house-of-the-dragon-mushroom-canon">source text, <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em></a>, stop short of showing any outright paranormal activity at Harrenhal. Sure, we hear legends of the fortress’s various horrors, such as the flaming phantoms of Harren and his kids, a child-eating ghoul named Mad Lady Lothston, rafters full of raven spirits, and household staff crumbling to ashes in their sleep. We never actually <em>see</em> any of this stuff, though.</p>
<p id="0QX6xs">At one point, Littlefinger complains about Harrenhal’s ghostly lodgers; however, this is probably just the ex-Master of Coin’s signature snark. Similarly, while various characters (including Jaime Lannister and Arya Stark) acknowledge that apparitions of Harren and his sons supposedly roam the castle’s corridors, nobody actually witnesses this phenomenon firsthand. What’s more, Westerosi rumblings that Harren’s ghost bumped off a pair of Lannister-affiliated lowlifes in <em>A Clash of Kings</em> are flat-out wrong; Arya’s mentor, Jaqen H’ghar, is the one actually responsible. There’s a similarly prosaic explanation for the eerie shrieks that emanate from Harrenhal’s aptly named Wailing Tower: It’s just wind blowing through cracks in the walls.</p>
<p id="neEO4K">Even so, <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> also details other, less easily hand-waved supernatural chicanery on Harrenhal’s grounds. Notably, the castle’s Heart Tree not only has a scary-looking face, but also “bleeds” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23415231/house-dragon-green-blacks-dance-dragons-explained">from dragon claw marks</a> in its trunk every spring. Admittedly, Heart Trees are a whole separate branch (pun fully intended) of magic in A Song of Ice and Fire<em> </em>lore, and don’t necessarily fall under the curse umbrella. Yet this definitely fits the definition of “spooky” — and arguably confirms there’s something fouler afoot at Harrenhal.</p>
<h2 id="jOu5ae"><strong>So, is Harrenhal really cursed? Or is that just Westerosi superstition? </strong></h2>

<p id="DvdmOQ">Honestly? No one knows for sure. Ambiguity is a key part of Martin’s take on magic, the supernatural, and religion in A Song of Ice and Fire. As such, the specifics around all three — including curses, real or imagined — is intentionally fuzzy. Harrenhal <em>could</em> be haunted by a malevolent force out to destroy Daemon, but don’t hold your breath expecting <em>House of the Dragon</em> showrunner Ryan Condal to say for sure.</p>
<p id="aMFVe9">Certainly, nothing in episode 3 or 4 categorically confirms or rules out Harrenhal’s curse. Yes, Daemon sees his bedchamber door shaken by unseen forces; however, Harrenhal is drafty as fuck. Our guy’s (admittedly messed-up) visions of younger Rhaenyra aren’t exactly reason to call an exorcist, either. For one thing, Rhaenyra’s still alive (so this <em>ain’t</em> a ghost), and for another, season 2 is littered with clues Daemon is losing his grip. It’s the classic “Is this all in his head?” trope.</p>

<p id="ggfd2a">But even though Harrenhal’s curse remains up for debate in <em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2, one thing’s clear: Haunted or not, the castle is Westeros’ least desirable vacation spot. </p>

<p id="fX1Rt0">As we can see, unlike with the season 2 battles between the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24182763/house-dragon-king-aegon-2-joffrey-game-thrones">Lannisters in King’s Landing</a> and the Starks in Winterfell in <em>Game of Thrones</em>, there isn’t much distance at all between <em>House of the Dragon</em>’s two Targaryen factions. In fact, all that lies between them is Blackwater Bay on one side and the Riverlands on the other. And the Riverlands practically surround the small islands of Dragonstone and Driftmark, where Rhaenyra and her allies currently reside. </p>
<p id="9fhNsc">Another important facet to understanding the Riverlands is understanding the Tullys. House Tully are the lords of Riverrun, and are traditionally the stabilizing force in the region. However, as Jason Lannister points out in the King’s Landing small council meeting, the Tullys are led at this moment by Grover Tully, an old man incapable of holding his own house together, let alone the rest of the Riverlands as they progress toward open war. This means the region is almost entirely up for grabs, and in very open conflict — as we see at the beginning of the episode with the Blackwoods and the Brackens.</p>
<p id="iddq9a">This power vacuum is exactly what leads Ser Criston Cole, the newly promoted Hand of the King, to the conclusion that he should embark with a small team to the Riverlands by force, bringing the different castles and their lords in line under the crown. To cap off his plan, Criston says that he’ll take Harrenhal, rendering the region completely in King Aegon’s control. </p>
<p id="oLa6cu"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24178649/house-dragon-season-2-daemon-assassins-prince-blood-cheese">Daemon</a>, on the other hand, simply flies straight to Harrenhal, deciding that he and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23381183/house-dragon-all-dragons-riders-vhagar">his dragon Caraxes</a> were likely enough to take the castle by surrender. When he arrives, he learns that he was both entirely right and maybe wasting his time. The dark, damp corridors of Harrenhal are just as ruined as they’ve been since the death of Harren the Black, and the castle doesn’t seem to offer much martial strength at all. </p>
<p id="H2uaPg">Harrenhal’s general lack of strength means that Criston is marching toward an essentially worthless prize, but the allies he picks up along the way are what really matters here. As you can see if you look back at the map, controlling the Riverlands for the Greens would essentially mean cutting the Blacks’ stronghold at Dragonstone off from the rest of Westeros. Sure, they can reach allies by sea, but the only port nearby for Rhaenyra is at Rook’s Rest — which could be another potential Riverlands prize for Criston to win. But without those few cities in the region, the Blacks would be quarantined to their tiny islands and hard-pressed to survive for long. </p>
<p id="qFOiwR">If all this is sounding rather dire for the Blacks, that’s because technically it is. Their side has the strongest navy, which is why Ser Corlys Velaryon is running a blockade at the entrance to Blackwater Bay, effectively stopping shipments from entering King’s Landing. But that’s their only real strength. Of course, if Daemon is able to somehow muster an army at Harrenhal, or bring his massive dragon to bear on Criston’s force, their fortunes could certainly start to shift. </p>
<p id="XTCoJv">But wars are very complicated things, both in real life and in the world of Game of Thrones, and very few of them ever go exactly according to either side’s plan. So, no matter how dire things may seem, there are likely to be a few twists in the near future to keep the conflict close. </p>

<p>On Friday, Twitter users were treated to <em><a href="https://x.com/K_A_N_D_E_L/status/1806687243819790723">The Bear The Game</a></em>, a comedy sketch in the form of a first person cooking/life simulation game. It’s also a shooter. It’s also kind of like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>. It’s also like <em>Shenmue</em>. At least I see <em>Shenmue</em>. I think most things can be traced back to <em>Shenmue</em>.</p>



<p>Anyway.</p>



<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">the bear video game actually looks pretty cool <a href="https://t.co/pijrftMFDr">pic.twitter.com/pijrftMFDr</a></p>
— Michael Kandel (@K_A_N_D_E_L) <a href="https://twitter.com/K_A_N_D_E_L/status/1806687243819790723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2024</a></blockquote>




<p>Something I love very deeply about the modern internet are interpretations and expressions of game design tropes from people who aren’t dyed in the wool game developers or games media figures. Fashion TikTokers doing <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lemonxde80s/video/7369623269978410286?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7318443315601622558">“Choose Your Fighter”</a> style videos. Elaborate <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@panterbanter/video/7150745454437977349?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7318443315601622558">physics-bending death</a> animations from <em>Fallout</em> and <em>Elder Scrolls.</em> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CmzvcztPoa5/">Point-and-click adventure horror</a> (a real game came out of her stuff, although she eventually dropped out and <a href="https://airdorf.itch.io/excuse-me-sir">only the demo remains</a>).</p>



<p><em>The Bear The Game</em> is just the latest, and <a href="https://vgbees.com/the-bear-the-game-a-review/">perhaps most elaborate</a>, version of this trend. Michael Kandel and Joe Miciak make sketch comedy together as Hotel Art Thief, but the 3D animation seen in <em>The Bear The Game</em> hasn’t always been part of the process.</p>



<p>“We both were unemployed/underemployed and started writing sketches together to pass the time,” Miciak told VGBees via Twitter DM about Hotel Art Thief’s genesis. It wasn’t until 2022 when Miciak began experimenting with Blender, a free 3D modeling tool, for a sketch called “Drench.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">user:Brian(box) <a href="https://t.co/M6qP9BLbZu">pic.twitter.com/M6qP9BLbZu</a></p>
— Michael Kandel (@K_A_N_D_E_L) <a href="https://twitter.com/K_A_N_D_E_L/status/1687461636012158976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2023</a></blockquote>




<p>“It was really half-baked,” said Miciak of this first attempt at creating 3D animated faces. It wasn’t until “user:Brian(box)” in 2023 that Miciak got comfortable crafting 3D heads and placing facial textures. “It’s a chatroom sketch Mike (Kandel) wrote during (the Covid) shutdown,” Miciak recalled, which originally was envisioned in 2D with ASCII art — “I eventually learned how to make the heads, and decided to make it more of an N64 aesthetic.”</p>



<p>You might recognize some of the environmental art from the sketch, as well, which was lifted directly from Nintendo 64 classic <em>Perfect Dark</em>. Even though Miciak has gotten comfortable and confident enough to make sketches using Blender, he’s not a big fan of the software itself.</p>



<p>“Mike will sometimes come up with an idea for a sketch involving 3D objects, and can see me debating with myself whether I want to subject myself to it,” he admitted, “But I break pretty easily.” For <em>The Bear The Game</em> and other sketches with 3D heads featuring facial textures, Miciak uses FaceBuilder, a popular add-on for Blender.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“Mike helped out by taking a bunch of screenshots from <em>The Bear</em>,” he explained, “and I did some photoshopping to make sure all the angles were roughly the same color temperature and in the same outfit.” That process of plastering the different-angled photos to the models is fairly automatic, though it’s not perfect by any stretch. “I did some texture painting in Blender to fix any glaring issues,” he noted, “but as you can see in the video, I kind of like when the faces look a little fucked up/asymmetrical.”</p>



<p>Once the faces are (mostly) in place, the animation process can begin. Animation is all about keyframes, anchors in time where all the parts of an image have to be to create movement. Fortunately, tools exist that facilitate this often painstaking task. One of those powerful tools is Live Link Face, a mobile app created by Epic that records video then sends keyframe data back to a program like Blender.</p>



<p>“So Mike recorded all the <a href="https://x.com/K_A_N_D_E_L/status/1806710629840851362">actors’ audio</a>, and I got my Andy Serkis on and read all their lines to my iPhone,” said Miciak. In case you’re envisioning elaborate and expensive motion capture equipment on a sprawling Hollywood soundstage, Miciak quickly dispelled the notion. “I was running out of time at the end, so I was on the subway taking these weird videos of myself.” The whole thing came together in about three weeks and was timed perfectly for the Season 3 premiere of the show.</p>



<p>Clearly the duo understand <em>The Bear</em> and cooking tropes enough to create an incisive and thorough parody of one of television’s most lauded shows, all the way down to the much-discussed needle drops like the <a href="https://on4word.bandcamp.com/track/let-down-the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">cover of Radiohead’s “Let Down”</a> that hits toward the end of the sketch.</p>



<p>Even in the music choices are a signpost to the games and moments that inspired the aesthetic and mechanical qualities of <em>The Bear The Game</em>. Both major tracks in the “demo” are covers of 90s songs with Nintendo 64 soundboards by artist on4world — the aforementioned Radiohead song as well as the super ambient <a href="https://on4word.bandcamp.com/track/rhubarb">“Rhubarb” by Aphex Twin</a>.</p>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption><em>Spider-Man 2</em> (2004)</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption><em>Enter the Matrix</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption><em>Batman Begins</em></figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Miciak mentioned licensed games from the PlayStation 2 era as strong influences on this style, listing <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, <em>Enter the Matrix</em>, and the <em>Batman Begins</em> movie tie-in as major contributors. This era represents “games that really try to lazily shoe-horn plot from the movie into the game, to the point where it gets distracting” to Miciak. Arguably the most interesting of these inspirations is <em>Enter the Matrix</em>, a game happening parallel to the events of <em>The Matrix Reloaded</em>, which struck a chord with Miciak.</p>



<p>He recalled that “you only get to play a vague, random character <em>[editor’s note: I know Jada Pinkett Smith’s Niobe isn’t random but I get this 100%] </em>and you’re sort of like ‘But… I just want to play as the main character?'” Playing around the events of the popular film released simultaneously was an ingenious and, often in hindsight, deeply interesting move, but it was also a big swing! And this was part of what inspired the character select screen of <em>The Bear The Game</em>, which has you inhabiting original characters that will interact with the ones you’re far more familiar with from the show’s story. This creates a tension from the outset by putting yourself in a place you don’t really feel like you belong.</p>



<p>I think these specific examples serving as a reflection of what could have been if television and film tie-ins continued with this trajectory is fascinating. I also love learning about what people latched onto that aren’t in our specific bubble; often too close to every new release and cultural moment that we lose sight of what millions of people who come in contact with games actually remember and hold onto.</p>



<p>“I have a long history of watching my friends play video games because I was so bad at them,” Miciak concluded. “Maybe that’s why I like making fake ones so much.”</p>

            <p>Listen up, Tarnished - Elden Ring worldbuilding writer George R. R. Martin has given his strongest hint yet that the critically acclaimed game may be getting its own "feature film or TV" spin-off.</p>
<p>Whilst Hidetaka Miyazaki has only teased that he and FromSoftware would be open to a live-action adaptation, Martin goes just that little bit further courtesy of his the-lady-doth-protest-too-much-me-thinks protestations he recently shared on his <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/">personal blog</a>.</p>

<p>"Oh, and about those rumours you may have heard about a feature film or television series based on Elden Ring…" Martin wrote.</p>

<p>Is it concrete proof an Elden Ring movie or show is on the way? Not even slightly. But it's hard to imagine someone as prolific and revered as George R. R. Martin would put <em>anything</em> in his blog that he didn't expect ravenous fans to dissect and overanalyse, so make of that what you will.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-hits-5m-sales">Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree has reached 5m sales worldwide</a>, in just three days of release.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-shipped-25m-units-worldwide">Elden Ring had shipped 25m units</a>, meaning 20 percent of all players have already jumped back in for the DLC in its opening weekend.</p>
<p>"To the many who tread the path left by Kindly Miquella, we extend our heartfelt gratitude," FromSoft said in a celebratory social media.</p>
<p>Earlier today, we reported that one savvy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> player believes they've found a way to find enough <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-player-shares-how-to-level-up-scadutree-blessings-without-fighting-a-single-boss">Scadutree Fragments to reach level 14 without taking on a single boss</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/anime/24189436/demon-slayer-infinity-castle-final-arc-movies-trailer-trilogy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="l5lIXr"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/22933948/demon-slayer-entertainment-district-arc-history"><em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em></a> just wrapped its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23979916/demon-slayer-season-4-everything-we-know">Hashira Training arc</a> but the (Mugen) train isn’t slowing down: on the heels of the finale, Crunchyroll that <em>Demon Slayer</em>’s next arc, Infinity Castle, will roll out in theaters as an “epic trilogy of films.” In a news release, Crunchyroll notes that “the three-part cinematic movies represents the final arc and culmination of the hugely popular award-winning anime shonen series.”</p>

<p id="YPPM2c">Based on the manga series by Koyoharu Gotoge, published under Shueisha’s Jump Comics, <em>Demon Slayer</em> currently consists of 23 volumes that have sole upward of 150 million copies, a number that turned it into one of the most popular anime on the planet. For Crunchyroll, nabbing the worldwide distribution rights (excluding a few Asian territories) to <em>three</em> additional Demon Slayer films is a major boon; the 2020 film <em>Mugen Train</em> remains the highest-grossing anime movie of all time, the highest-grossing Japanese film at the global box office of all time, and the second-highest grossing anime film in U.S. box office history (having earned $49.5 million, more than <em>Madame Web </em>made in 2024!). Sony’s recent acquisition of the Alamo Drafthouse theater chain <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24177134/sony-alamo-drafthouse-theaters-purchase-crunchyroll-anime">expressly for the purpose of platforming anime films in America</a> makes the trilogy a major milestone in Crunchyroll’s campaign to be a one-stop shop for all things anime in the U.S..</p>

<p id="IXncEa">After training with the Hashira in the previous arc, <em>Demon Slayer</em>’s majin protagonist Tanjiro is off to the Infinity Castle to take on Muzan Kibutsuji, the Demon King. A teaser for the movie trilogy is light on footage from any of the Infinity Train films — it’s light on animation in general — but it gives fans who only know the anime a taste for what’s next.</p>
<p id="A6GqgG">The untitled first Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle movie is currently undated. All of <em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em> is streaming on Crunchyroll.</p>

            <p>Arrowhead's fantastic alien-shooter Helldivers 2 is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever</a>, but despite its initial success, Steam numbers continue to dwindle, plummeting to around 10 per cent of its all-time concurrent Steam peak of 458,709 players.</p>
<p>As Victoria reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-sees-huge-drop-in-player-numbers-since-release">at the end of May</a>, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/#3m">SteamDB</a> showed Helldivers 2's peak at that time had dropped 64 percent to 166,305.</p>
<p>Today, that has dropped to 35 percent again, falling to a 30-day average of 41,860 concurrent players on Steam (thanks, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/06/29/after-initial-success-helldivers-2-has-lost-90-of-its-players-with-no-signs-of-recovery/">Forbes</a>).</p>

<p>Of course, that number only represents players on Steam, and – as it's published by Sony – there's plenty more Helldivers saving the world on PS5.</p>
<p>However, a litany of errors from Sony – starting with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">infamous PSN debacle that kicked off earlier this year</a> – not only resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">swathes of negative reviews from a very disappointed community</a>, but also saw the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">pulled from sale in 177 countries where PSN was not available</a>, forcing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony to backtrack on its plans</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-accidentally-leaks-unannounced-helldivers-2-strategem">unannounced Helldivers 2 stratagem leaked online</a>, seemingly by a Sony email. The unforced error – which came via an official marketing email sent out to Helldivers – proudly introduces the Airburst Rocket Launcher players unlocked after they successfully liberated Penta during Operation Legitimate Undertaking.</p>
<p>The other problem was, the weapon in the image accompanying the email, however, wasn't the Airburst… or, indeed, any weapon known in the game at that time.</p>

			<p>Today, LukeYui has updated his <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring Seamless Co-Op mod</a> to work with the newly released Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. Here's the changelog shared by the modder:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compatibility with Elden Ring App Version 1.12, including Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</li>
<li>Completely rewritten code; some old bugs (e.g., enemies falling through the floor) do not occur anymore * Items gained in conversations are now given to all players</li>
<li>Event flags are properly synchronized now</li>
<li>Enemy scaling options have been added</li>
<li>Player death count is now a player banner option</li>
<li>Have the option to view the current session password in-game</li>
<li>ModEngine 2 compatibility</li>
<li>Matchmaking verification: only people with the same mods will be able to connect to each other</li>
<li>Added invasions (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>The modder also clarified there are currently some bugs still:</p>
<p><em>While not perfect, it has reached a state where it can be used to play Elden Ring and the DLC in coop. I'm aware of some bugs still present in it, and will continue working on it past the initial release - the next few days will be crucial so that I can work on fixing any problematic issues quickly should they arise.</em></p>
<p>The Seamless Co-Op mod was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-creator-says-seamless-co-op-mod-may-be-added-as-a-feature-in-a-future-fromsoftware-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> by none other than Elden Ring creator Hidetaka Miyazaki, who said that such a freeform cooperative system could well be implemented in future games made by FromSoftware.</p>
<p>For more on the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion (which already <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-sold-5-million-units-in-3-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> 5 million copies), read <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>:</p>
<p><em>With open-world fatigue setting in earlier this year due to the many open-world games released in 2024—like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Rise of the Ronin, and the PC versions of Horizon Forbidden West and Ghost of Tsushima—Shadow of the Erdtree's open-world design stands out as a testament to how the Elden Ring experience still surpasses anything else on the market.</em></p>

            <p>Scadutree Fragments are critical for levelling in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a>, but one savvy player believes they've found a way to find enough fragments to reach level 14 without taking on a single boss.</p>
<p>Redditor Galdiuz2 posted their method to the Elden Ring subreddit earlier this week, including an image depicting where, exactly, Tarnished can locate Scadutree Fragments without encountering any bosses.</p>

<p>Interestingly, u/Galdiuz2's post says you could use this map to get to level 12, but u/gilgabroVII points out that you can actually get to 14 – "17, before any remembrance boss" – as there's at least one more fragment in the starting zone not indicated on the map, "two more in the Scadu Altus, and two in the [Cerulean Coast]."</p>
<p>Later, Galdiuz22 returned to the post to acknowledge that there were "even three accessible in the south, for a total of six extra not on [the] map".</p>
<p>Be careful if you choose this route, however; doing this may mean you'll end up perma-skipping interesting NPC quests.</p>

<p>Another commenter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dodp8f/comment/lab38tv/">added</a> that you could get 20 Fragments without fighting anything or entering a legacy dungeon, 34 without killing a boss, and 44 Fragments by taking down just three main bosses and one remembrance (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-level-14-no-bosses/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>ICYMI, a patch for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree has been released that revises the scaling of the Shadow Realm Blessings. The DLC includes this new scaling system to boost the attack and defence of both your character and your spirit summons, by collecting Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes respectively.</p>
<p>Now the scaling has been revised so that the effects are greater for the first few levels, before becoming more gradual later.</p>

More than two decades, in fact. But there's a new ray of light on the Nosgoth horizon in the form of a graphic novel called Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver – The Dead Shall Rise.</p><p>As the first new Legacy of Kain content since 2003's Legacy of Kain: Defiance, The Dead Shall Rise serves as a prequel to the Soul Reaver games. The book flashes back to Raziel's human past as a Sarafan warrior and reveals how he came to be a vampire serving under Kain. The goal is to answer some long-running questions about the Legacy of Kain/Soul Reaver mythos while also introducing a major new vampire character with close ties to both Raziel and Kain.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/30/placeholder-logo-1719713665411.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image Credit: Crystal Dynamics/Bit Bot Media</figcaption></figure></output><p>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver – The Dead Shall Rise is a collaboration between Crystal Dynamics and Bit Bot Media. The book is written by Joshua Viola (True Believers, It Came From the Multiplex) and Angie Hodapp (Unioverse, Shadow Atlas), with interior art by Juan Samu (Star Wars, Godzilla), letters by Jeremiah Lambert (Masters of the Universe, Transformers), covers by Dave Rapoza (Destiny, Magic: The Gathering) and Aaron Lovett (Monster Train, Inkbound). The book features additional art by Jonny Bush (Rob Zombie, Ghost) and Ninja Jo (Star Wars, Stranger Things), with Brent Friedman (Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Call of Duty) providing narrative guidance, and Crystal Dynamics has also provided creative direction based on unreleased elements of Soul Reaver lore.</p><p>“In college, I created a Soul Reaver poster for a class project, never imagining I would one day officially contribute to the franchise,” said Viola in a statement. "Even today, Raziel graces my tattoo sleeve—a testament to my deep connection with this universe. Fans can expect a project infused with that same passion. Working directly with creatives from Crystal Dynamics and reuniting with former collaborators makes this a truly special endeavor."</p><p>The Dead Shall Rise will be crowdfunded on Kickstarter. <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/ec6d71d7-3906-45d4-aaab-40fc1a372416/landing?preview_mode=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans can sign up on BackerKit</a> to be notified by email when the campaign launches later this year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>With any luck, this won't be the only new Legacy of Kain content fans can look forward to in the years ahead.

					<p>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard finally heading toward its long-awaited release, this article will bring you up to speed on every facet of the action RPG, from its troubled development to its confirmed features, story beats, and setting.</p>
<p>The project has had multiple iterations over time. Shortly after the successful release of Dragon Age: Inquisition in late 2014, BioWare's Game Director Mike Laidlaw outlined plans for a new installment codenamed Joplin. This would have been a smaller game focused on a 'heist' in the region of the Tevinter Imperium magocracy. This iteration was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mike-laidlaw-bioware-departure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> in late 2017 (with Laidlaw leaving the company around the same time) as Electronic Arts attempted to pivot the game to a live service design. Back then, this new Dragon Age (codenamed Morrison) was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-anthem-tech-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described</a> as 'Anthem with dragons'.</p>
<p>That wasn't the last major change in direction. Following the massive failure of Anthem and the success of Respawn's single player game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, EA eventually reconsidered its own stance and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-will-be-a-single-player-only-rpg-multiplayer-has-been-dropped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowed BioWare to ditch live service elements</a>, resuming development as a single player only title.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-more-info-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously known as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a>, but the team has recently decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-veilguard-is-the-new-name-of-dreadwolf-reveal-scheduled-for-june-11-with-15-minutes-of-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change the name</a> to reflect the game's focus on the player's companions rather than on one of the (supposed) villains.</p>
<h2>Release date, platforms, pricing, editions</h2>
<p>BioWare and Electronic Arts have not announced a definitive launch date (nor pricing or the available editions) yet. However, they confirmed the game will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X this Fall.</p>
<p>The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-is-officially-in-alpha-playable-from-beginning-to-end/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached the Alpha milestone</a> nearly two years ago, allowing a far longer time for polishing than any previous BioWare game. Between that fact and Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows already securing a November 15 date (which would have been near the 10-year anniversary of Inquisition), there's speculation that the developers may be targeting a launch in late September or early October. More official information may be released in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>As with all EA games, Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be playable right away (probably even ahead of the official release) with the EA Play Pro subscription.</p>

<h2>Genre, setting, and story premise</h2>
<p>The new Dragon Age installment is a single player third-person action roleplaying game. Unlike Inquisition, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-mission-based-rather-than-open-world-sex-scenes-will-have-nudity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it won't feature open world-like zones</a>. BioWare said it is a highly curated and handcrafted experience to better serve the needs of the narrative, which has been central to this project. That said, they also <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-opens-up-dramatically-after-a-certain-point-says-bioware-rpg-skill-tree-is-enormous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the game would 'open up dramatically' after a certain point, allowing exploration off the beaten path within some 'fairly wide spaces.'</p>
<p>The setting may be the only leftover from earlier stages of the project. For the first time in the franchise, players will head to the Tevinter Imperium; in fact, the very beginning of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-first-gameplay-and-details-tremendous-amount-of-handcrafted-side-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as shown in the 15-minute gameplay</a>, takes place in the capital of Minrathous. However, players can expect to visit a greater amount of the continent of Thedas than ever before, including locations like Weisshaupt (the fortress of the Grey Wardens, located in Anderfels), Rivain, the Arlathan Forest, and the Deep Roads.</p>
<p>The story of Dragon Age: The Veilguard picks up around eight years after the events seen in the Trespasser DLC for Dragon Age: Inquisition. Solas, now fully unmasked as the elven trickster god known as Dreadwolf, is hellbent on tearing the Veil to restore immortality to the elves, no matter the consequences for the world. The player character named Rook (the surname will vary depending on the race, selected between Qunari, Dwarf, Elf, and Human) gets wind of the situation and rushes alongside Varric, Harding (the female Dwarf scout from the previous game), and a Mage detective called Neve to stop Solas. Rook successfully disrupts the magic ritual but, in so doing, frees two extremely dangerous elven deities previously stuck behind the Veil: Elgar'nan and Ghilan'nain. It will be up to Rook and their Veilguard (composed of seven companions: Harding, Neve, Lucanis, Bellara, Davrin, Taash, and Emmrich) to protect Thedas from the aftermath.</p>
<p>In Dragon Age: Inquisition, players imported save states from previous games via the dedicated Dragon Age Keep software, allowing them to maintain the world states spawned by their choices and consequences. For Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare opted for a different approach. Players will build key choices from previous games directly in the new character creator, with tarot cards providing context for each decision. They'll even get to recreate their own Inquisitor (the main character in the third installment), who will appear in the game in some capacity. The character creator itself was described as the most powerful ever made by BioWare, featuring extensive body customization options (including 40 different skin complexions and as many Qunari horn types, as well as more than 30 makeup styles), the ability to choose pronouns separately from gender, and one of four voices out of English masculine, English feminine, American masculine, or American feminine. Character creation also includes background roleplaying options such as the faction, with six available options: Grey Wardens, Antivan Crows, Shadow Dragons, Lords of Fortune, Mourn Watch, and Veil Jumpers.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>The combat system is more action-focused than in previous Dragon Age games, and the developers have <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-lets-you-switch-between-2-weapons-mid-combat-is-about-being-in-control-of-every-single-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed</a> the goal of letting players feel in control of every action, be it parrying, dodging, or blocking.</p>
<p>Players will select three active abilities per character to bring in their weapon loadouts (two can be swapped mid-combat), in addition to Ultimates (which change based on specialization) and runes. However, some skills have been baked into the core moveset for all classes. Each class now has light and heavy attacks, which can be used strategically depending on the situation, and some abilities can be charged. Moreover, there are combo opportunities between certain abilities, and combos can be 'paused' to dash away when needed and resumed afterward.</p>
<p>Players will select their main character's class between three options: Warrior, Rogue and Mage. Each of the classes comes with its own set of specializations. Warriors can become either Reapers, who use night blades to siphon health from foes, risking death to gain supernatural abilities; Slayers, who wield two-handed weapons for straightforward but strong attacks that deal increased damage; or Champions, who are equipped with one-handed weapons and shields, focusing on tactical defense and taking hits from enemies on the group's behalf.</p>
<p>Rogues can pick between Duelists, who dual wield blades for rapid strikes and have the fastest movement with a focus on dodges and parries, Saboteurs, who use a mix of traps and tricks to control the battlefield, and Veil Rangers, a more classic ranged style of combat to hit enemies from afar with a bow. Lastly, Mages can be either Death Callers (basically, necromancers), Spellblades (warrior mages who infuse their melee attacks with magic), or&nbsp;Evokers, masters of elemental fire, ice, and lightning magic. Blood Magic won't be available in Dragon Age: The Veilguard for a narrative reason, according to BioWare.</p>
<p>Players can customize their character to their heart's content thanks to the 'enormous' skill trees that the developers said were inspired by Final Fantasy X's Sphere Grid. With every level up (the max level is 50), the game will provide a skill point that can be used in the tree to unlock active abilities, traits, minor passives, and major passives, which can include jump attacks and guaranteed critical hits after specific triggers. BioWare also said that players would be able to branch out of their chosen specialization around mid-game to pick other stuff from the skill trees to complement their playstyle.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard has reduced the group from four to three characters due to the increased action focus. You also won't be able to control companions directly, but you can issue them orders to execute specific abilities against specific targets via the ability wheel, pausing the action. The companions can act on their own, but at harder difficulties, strategic play of the whole party is recommended.</p>
<p>Speaking of the main character's allies, they will gather at a social hub called Lighthouse (located in the Fade). It's here that most of the conversations between them and the player character will occur. Each companion can be romanced regardless of gender and race, and if you won't romance them yourself, they may find their match elsewhere in the group.</p>
<p>Lastly, crafting and transmogrification (the ability to wield some gear and show a cosmetic skin instead) are confirmed to be in the game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dragon-Age-The-Veilguard_Screenshot_04_RookWarrior_3840x2160_v4-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Technology &amp; Specs</h2>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is powered by the Frostbite engine, like Dragon Age: Inquisition, Mass Effect: Andromeda, and Anthem. BioWare said this is the first game in which they've felt in control of the engine. On consoles, the game will offer performance and quality mode options.</p>
<p>We don't have any details on the PC version yet, including system requirements. However, BioWare's Mike Gamble has <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1800665572042236364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> that PC-related announcements are coming soon, hinting at a collaboration with either Intel, NVIDIA, or AMD.</p>

            <p>Final Fantasy 14 director Naoki "Youshi P" Yoshida offered his "sincere apologies" for "issues" identified in the early access build of its highly-anticipated expansion, Dawntrail.</p>
<p>In a blog post published on the <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/09598d1b4efffdc7cdc3360d32bf2086026761b6">official website</a>, Yoshida thanked players for playing and assured them that the team was "investigating" the causes of the most pressing issues, including transition freezes on Xbox, and broken animations across all platforms.</p>

<p>"We have confirmed an issue in the Xbox version where the game client may become unresponsive when transitioning between locations, such as field areas and cities," Yoshida explained. "Our preliminary investigation suggests that this issue is likely due to a phenomenon known as memory fragmentation.</p>
<p>"We are currently conducting a comprehensive investigation into the matter, which we have prioritised to ensure a swift resolution. However, rectifying this issue requires the deployment of a patch to update the client. This process involves rigorous checks by our QA team, among other procedures, which means it may take several days to address."</p>
<p>Yoshida said that the team was working to expedite a patch to address this, but as "this process will take some time", he "apologised for the inconvenience caused".</p>
<p>Similarly, issues in the Dragonsong’s Reprise (Ultimate), the Minstrel’s Ballad: Shinryu’s Domain, and Delubrum Reginae (Savage) where "mechanics related to freezing are not functioning correctly" will be resolved via a "client patch", although it's not yet clear when that will be deployed.</p>
<p>"The aforementioned issues are being classified as a high priority," Yoshida added. "They are under investigation on our development server and are being addressed in a systematic manner. We are considering the release of a hot fix, which is likely to occur sometime this week, which would be accompanied by a brief maintenance period.</p>
<p>"I would like to extend my apologies once again for the occurrence of these issues. Rest assured, we are committed to addressing issues such as these that occur after the release of an expansion and will continue to promptly correct any urgent issues that may arise."</p>
<p>"So far, Tural's environments feel rich and warm, existing in a perpetual summer haze," Ed wrote in his wonderful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dawntrail-is-final-fantasy-14-at-its-most-colourful">Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail preview</a>. </p>
<p>"Zoom in close, though, and the real difference from the graphical update is apparent. The texture work on armour and weapons is a vast improvement, while animal races - like the new female Hrothgar - seem more realistically furry."</p>
<p>In 2015, the MMO had four million players for the Heavensward expansion; this has grown to 30 million registered accounts by 2024's Tokyo Fan Fest. Even by 2021 it had become <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-xiv-the-most-profitable-game-in-the-series">the most profitable game in the long-running series</a> and that will only have increased since, not to mention the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-purchases-on-xbox-require-an-extra-currency">game's release this year on Xbox</a> and the likely boost to sales Dawntrail will provide.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knockout-city-to-shutdown-in-june-private-server-version-incoming">Velan Studios may have shuttered its competitive "dodgebrawl" game, Knockout City, a year ago</a>, but it still "loves that world and can't imagine not going back to it at some point".</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.velanstudios.com/post/a-big-week">update</a> primarily focussed on the reveal of Midnight Murder Club – described as a blend of "hide-and-seek in the dark with shooter gameplay to make a truly thrilling playground" – and new VR pinball game Bounce Arcade, Velan founders Karthik and Guha Bala insisted they still "love Knockout City as much as you do and want to bring it back".</p>

<p>"We know that some of you are waiting for Knockout City to return and are disappointed that we didn’t announce any news about that this week," the brothers said.</p>
<p>"As an indie studio, we love our ability to lean into ideas that excite us, and rest assured we love [Knockout] City as much as you do and want to bring it back, *just not yet*.</p>
<p>"We spent over four years crafting Knockout City the first time around, and we don’t want to rush the process for the next game in that universe," the statement continued. "We love that world and can’t imagine not going back to it at some point, when the time is right."</p>
<p>Knockout City, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knockout-city-has-officially-gone-free-to-play">free-to-play</a> "dodgebrawl" game, shutdown in June 2024.</p>
<p>"This was an extremely difficult decision for us, but a necessary and important one for our studio," game director at developer Velan Studios, Jeremy Russo, said at the time.</p>
<p>It was initially published on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC last May under the EA Originals label, but Velan announced it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-published-knockout-city-going-free-to-play-this-spring-without-ea">assume publishing duties</a> and shift to a free-to-play model just a few months after it launched.</p>

Zero, and it included a look at such newly announced characters in action like Mr. Satan and Future Trunks as well as a glimpse of the story mode.</p><p>This preview followed a new Sword vs. Fist trailer that showcased just some of the 160 characters that will be part of this latest entry in the beloved Budokai Tenkaichi series, including Super Vegito, Jiren, Roasie, Ribrianne, Yajirobe, Spopovich, Dabura, Anilaza, Goku (Super) Ultra Instinct - Sign-, and Goku Black Super Saiyan Rose.</p><p>In our new look, which you can see below, we get to see more of the Battle Mode that lets you practice against CPU or jump online to take on others around the world. Gameplay also took center stage and we got to see some of the unique abilities each character has, including Majin Vegeta's Final Explosion that deals a ton of damage but leaves the player with 1 HP for a chance to fight on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While we didn't get to learn a ton more about the story mode and its branching paths - you can alter parts of the canon Dragon Ball story with your decisions - we did get to see certain scenes like the battle against Raditz. For those unfamiliar, Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero will take players through both Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super and star eight characters, including Goku and Vegeta. </p><p>Bandai Namco revealed to us that Goku has the largest number of stages, beginning with his fight with Raditz and going all the way through the Tournament of Power Saga. </p><p>If that wasn't enough, Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero will have a ton of support post-launch in the form of 3 DLC packs that will add more than 20 playable characters from the Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero movie and Dragon Ball Daima series.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>For more, check out<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-is-like-controlling-a-battle-from-the-anime"> our hands-on preview of Dragon Ball: Sparking!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/between-us-weve-spent-14bn-on-steam-games-weve-never-played<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Steam users have collectively amassed £14bn ($19bn) worth of unplayed games.</p>
<p>That's according to new research from <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/steam/pile-of-shame">PCGN</a> and SteamIDFinder, which has put the full cost of the number of unplayed games sitting in our Steam libraries as "about the same as the gross domestic product of Nicaragua".</p>

<p>Admittedly, the research hasn't polled every single one of the millions of us who have a Steam account, but the numbers were calcuated by anaylsing the 73m  accounts in the SteamIDFinder database that are set to public.</p>
<p>By using the data from those public accounts, the research opines we've spent £1.4bn on games we haven't played even once. Presuming that figure is representative of all Steam accounts, scale that figure up and it's estimated that across the whole Steam user community, that equates to a staggering £14bn of unplayed games.</p>
<p>If you want to know exactly how much cash is tied up in your pile of shame, head on over to <a href="https://www.steamidfinder.com/#pileofshame">SteamIDFinder</a>.</p>
<p>Valve recently revealed it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-launches-new-background-gameplay-recording-and-sharing-feature-into-beta">expanding Steam's already teetering tower of built-in features with a new background gameplay recording and sharing system</a> that's available in beta now.</p>
<p>As detailed on Valve's Game Recording beta page, Steam's new suite of console-like video features begin with two distinct recording modes. A Background Recording mode continuously saves gameplay to a preferred drive - users can set duration and storage limits - while an On Demand Recording mode enables users to start and stop recording as they choose.</p>
<p>A new timeline feature and player-added event markers are intended to make it easier to find key moments (achievements, screenshots, and in-game events in supported games can also auto-generate markers if desired) and recordings can be clipped using new "lightweight" tools.</p>

<p><em>We know this is disappointing news for some of you. As a thank you to those interested in participating, players who registered via the online signup before June 28, 2024, midnight Paris Time, will receive the limited Bolt Pistol skin.</em></p>
<p>The development team also recapped the main modes available in Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, revealing that the campaign is around 12 hours long. Playable either solo or in co-op, it features Lieutenant Titus fighting alongside his Battle-Brothers Chairon and Gadriel against swarms of Tyranids and Chaos.</p>
<p>In the co-op Operations mode, players may also play solo or with two friends in an endlessly replayable PvE action where they face swarms of Tyranids on six different maps to defend the Imperium. Finally, in the PvP Eternal War mode, players will fight in 6v6 matches in three different classic game modes: Annihilation, Seize Ground, Capture &amp; Control).</p>
<ul>
<li>Annihilation is a Team Deathmatch mode in which two teams compete against each other. Each takedown earns your team 1 point. The first team to reach 50 points wins the match.</li>
<li>Seize Ground is a Domination mode where two teams compete to keep control of one zone that’s moving throughout the match. Keeping control of the zone grants your team points. The winner is the team that reaches the total amount of points given.</li>
<li>Capture &amp; Control is a King of the Hill mode with three specific zones in the arena. Each team fights to control them. Gaining and keeping control of a zone grants your team points. Be the first to obtain a certain amount of points to win the match.</li>
</ul>
<p>Saber also confirmed that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 will run its online modes on dedicated servers across the North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Oceania regions, allowing for optimal multiplayer experiences. Ahead of the game's launch in early September, eager fans across North America can get their hands on a game demo at expos in Denver (July 4-7), Indianapolis (August 1-4), Chicago (August 16-18), and Toronto (August 22-25).</p>
