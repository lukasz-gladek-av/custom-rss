The specific section of the manual uploaded discusses the AV-8B and TAV-8B Harriers, two aircraft used by the United States' Navy and Marine Corps. Once this document was posted, War Thunder's community managed removed the post and temporarily banned the user.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4519984-warthunderleak.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519984" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4519984-warthunderleak.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519984"></a><figcaption>An in-game image of the AV-8B Harrier, one of the aircraft in this latest leak.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4519984-warthunderleak.jpg"></figure><p>Leaks like this are not unheard of within War Thunder's community. It's a free-to-play multiplayer military game that allows players to use real-life military aircraft, naval vessels, and vehicles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Popular gaming peripheral manufacturer Dbrand has acknowledged a defect affecting a small number of its Project Killswitch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2?page=2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> cases.</p>
<p>This defect impacts the lip attaching the joycons to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> screen, disconnecting when the console is held up by a singular joycon. Speaking to influencer Nintendo Prime, the company has stated it's in the process of fixing the issue.</p>
<p>"Yep, we're definitely working on it. Ultimately, this is a manufacturing tolerance issue on the small lip keeping the Joy-Con Grips attached to the Joy-Cons (some were a hair too thick)," Dbrand told Nintendo Prime. "We've got a replacement program set up already, where anyone who is affected is able to email robots@dbrand.com with 'July Joy-Cons' in the subject to be added to the list for replacement stock in July."</p>

<p>According to Nintendo Prime, Dbrand also acknowledged this problem was replicable among a "small number of units from their run". Nintendo Prime didn't share the exact number he was told, but reemphasised any defective Killswitch cases could be replaced for free in July.</p>
<p>There are plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-accessories-deals-third-party-jsaux">great third-party accessories for the Nintendo Switch 2</a> - Dbrand's Killswitch included!

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/project-motor-racing-will-speed-onto-xbox-series-x-s-ps5-and-pc-in-fall-2025/">Project Motor Racing</a> developer Straight4 Studios and publisher GIANTS Software have announced that the upcoming sim racing game will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on <strong>November 25, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>A new trailer showcases Project Motor Racing's career mode and the intricacies involved in how Straight4 Studios is simulating the career of a professional racer, where winning isn't always the most important thing. It's being able to afford the next race, win or lose.</p>
<p>"<em>We wanted to capture the harsh reality of pro motorsport</em>," said the game design director at Straight4 Studios, Austin Ogonoski, in a press release.</p>
<p>"<em>Budgets, repairs, sponsors. Failed overtakes that don't just wreck your car but your whole season. Your career in Project Motor Racing is motorsport with consequences</em>."</p>
<p>The career mode will have you negotiating sponsorships, what you can afford to build out your car, and the choice between giving it your all in each race versus making sure you'll have a car to race with for the next one.</p>
<p><iframe title="Single Player Reveal: Your Career Starts November 25, 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-TcJHeA_3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Along with the release date and the introduction of the career mode, publisher GIANTS Software also confirms that the game will launch with full modding support on day one.</p>
<p>The game is being built with the GIANTS Engine, and as the company's head of publisher, Boris Stefan put it in a press release, "<em>Project Motor Racing taps into the same powerhouse modding ecosystem as Farming Simulator. Racing modders will be able to tweak, tune, and transform their experience however they like.</em>"</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now available for Project Motor Racing on all platforms.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-skipped-every-death-stranding-cutscene-and-i%E2%80%99ll-do-it-again.1226898/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I beat the original <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima">Death Stranding</a></em>, but please don’t ask me what happened in it. There was a cataclysm — not quite a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/664492/clair-obscur-expedition-33-twist-spoilers">Gommage</a> — that made the US more divided than ever, and you play as a babysitter-meets-delivery-guy who has special awareness of invisible, hostile creatures called BTs that are “beached,” which isn’t as relaxing as it sounds. There are grenades filled with pee, poop, and blood, and everyone who’s anyone was motion-captured to be in the game. There are whales, Guillermo del Toro (in appearance but not in voice), huge pools of tar, and Geoff Keighley is there, too.</p><p>Sounds like a silly game, right? It is, especially if you skip all of the cutscenes in the game, like I did. And I plan on doing the exact same thing now that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5">the sequel is here</a>.</p><p><em>Death Stranding</em>’s long cutscenes repelled me from playing through it, and I say that as a longtime fan of the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> games. After five or so failed attempts at getting past the first episode since the game’s 2019 launch on the PS4, due to trying to play it “right” — which I thought required close examination of every word and frame of this bizarrely written story — I just said “screw it.” I finally beat the game on my Steam Deck (runs great!) just a couple months ago.</p><p>It’s not that the cutscenes are bad, but their plodding, cinematic pacing feels at odds with the game’s overarching design, which is a glorified physics sandbox stuffed with just as much humor as there is desolation. Plus, the gameplay is so good that I didn’t want to wait for my reward of just getting to run around again and deliver stuff. Anything that helps me more quickly get to the ridiculous mid-to-late-game Sam-versus-Higgs boxing match is worth it.</p><p><em>Death Stranding</em>, even when played as an exposition-light adventure, still holds up because the game is good at doling out meaningful upgrades to how you traverse the fractured land. Aside from missions that require speed (such as pizza delivery) or the utmost care (such as nuke delivery), its design embraces open-ended exploration.</p><p>Similar to <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, some early environmental obstacles might prove overwhelming enough to put you on a staid, critical path from time to time, but it rarely forces you to choose one method over another. Put a ladder here, a rope or bridge there, or drift down a mountain on a floating carrier. It’s fun enough just getting to tough-to-reach markings strewn about the world where fellow Porters have… peed. Experimentation breathes levity into a game world that really needs more of it.</p><div><p><cite>GIF: Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Skipping cutscenes allowed me to fully sink my teeth into a game that I would have otherwise missed out on. And you’d better believe that I’ll be playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5"><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> </a>the same way. Despite the allure of some seriously quirky characters and the potential of this being the last game in the series for a while (perhaps <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24057536/physint-is-the-working-title-of-hideo-kojimas-new-not-a-metal-gear-game">Physint</a></em> will be next from Kojima Productions), I’m holding fast to my playstyle. I’m most interested to see how the sequel evolves traversal, and the interplay of the environment and player choice. Cutscenes are just another obstacle.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/690231/death-stranding-cutscenes-skip]]></content:encoded>

A promise that the company will begin slapping the Xbox logo on anything that is capable of streaming Game Pass. Smart TVs are now Xboxes. PC gaming handhelds are, too. Why not bundle a limited-edition Xbox controller with a Meta Quest 3S and call it an Xbox too?</p><p>The entry-level Meta Quest 3S 128GB is currently $300. The Xbox version will be $400 but comes with a limited-edition Xbox controller in addition to the standard Touch Plus controllers and three months of Game Pass Ultimate. This is, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/24/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/24/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in Microsoft’s words</a></span>, “everything you need to start gaming on a massive virtual display the moment you open the box.”</p><p>That’s primarily because the Meta Quest 3S can stream a selection of Game Pass games that support cloud gaming like <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em>. The pitch from Microsoft is: “start a game on your Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition, pick up where you left off on your console, and continue the adventure with Xbox on PC without ever losing your achievements or saved data.” That’s a cool idea in theory, but the caveat is that it’s  limited to streaming and games that already support Play Anywhere.</p><p>This is the same Achilles’ heel that impacts the upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000">Xbox Ally ROG PC gaming handheld</a></span>. It’s a custom Windows experience designed to feel like playing on an Xbox, but it can’t play existing Xbox-only releases. Lots of big games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Elden Ring</em>, and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>don’t support Play Anywhere, meaning you still need to purchase the game twice. I’d love it if that weren’t the case, but for now it is. Until those gaps are filled in, it’s hard to see more Xbox-branded devices as anything other than niche collectors’ items for enthusiasts. </p><p>Meta has never released sales numbers for the Quest 3, but estimates a year ago were that it had sold at least 1 million units. Microsoft probably isn’t lying when it stresses how “limited” the Xbox Edition Quest 3S is, but it raises the question of why the partnership exists if it’s going to stop short of making the headset double as an official accessory for existing Xbox consoles that can stream native games remotely as a second display. </p><p>Maybe because VR is an even tougher sell than PC gaming handhelds. PlayStation VR 2 is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mixed-news.com/en/psvr-2-sales-figures-estimation-toast-interactive/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mixed-news.com/en/psvr-2-sales-figures-estimation-toast-interactive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumored</a></span> to have sold only about half as many units as Steam Deck. That might be why Meta is ending <em>Beat Saber</em> support for the Sony peripheral. Coincidentally, the reduced price of Sony’s headset makes it cost the same as the Xbox Quest 3S. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/meta-quest-3s-xbox-vr-game-pass-price-handheld-1851784984]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Flash in the pan.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a new Chicken Run video game in development, and its voice cast is sure to ruffle some feathers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/chicken-run-eggstraction">Chicken Run: Eggstraction</a>, from Outright Games, is described as an “action-stealth” video game that is of course based on the Chicken Run franchise. It’s a top-down, heist game that picks up where Aardman's 2023 film Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget left off. Expect a launch this fall on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s interesting here is Chicken Run: Eggstraction’s voice cast. It sees Bella Ramsey, who plays Ellie in HBO’s The Last of Us adaptation, and Josie Sedgwick-Davies return to voice Molly and Frizzle from Dawn of the Nugget. But it’s also got Chicken Shop Date creator Amelia Dimoldenberg, too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/24/gettyimages-2203000182-1750769939753.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Amelia Dimoldenberg not on a date in a chicken shop. Photo by Cindy Ord/VF25/Getty Images for Vanity Fair.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see why Dimoldenberg is involved, given the nature of her YouTube interview show. Dimoldenberg has seen a meteoric rise to fame in recent years as ever more famous celebrities agree to a spot of fried chicken on a first date. The question is, will Spider-Man star Andrew Garfield join her on the cast?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to the game! Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Chicken Run: Eggstraction follows the film Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget, with an exciting new story that continues the adventures of its feathered heroes as they work to save chickens from the evil nugget industry, where chicken-kind is still in danger! Take control of the Chicken Run characters, and embark on a mission to infiltrate five fortified farms and liberate the captive chickens. But beware, there are plenty of eggstra security measures in place that players will need to overcome to lead these fowl to freedom. From avoiding watchful security cameras and hawkeyed humans to hiding in traffic cones, players will be tested on their stealth, skills and strategy. Equipped for up to two players in local co-op, players can tackle this high-octane adventure alone, or team up with a friend to hatch a plan for success.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://youtu.be/eFS5vxYlfY8?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Amelia Dimoldenberg / YouTube</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">On the surface, Grave Seasons might look like any other nice, cozy farming sim like Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon: you’re a stranger who’s come into a farm in the small town of Ashenridge, full of seemingly friendly people. You plant and harvest crops, craft items, and make friends. But there’s a mysterious, unnerving sense that tugged at the back of my neck during my half-hour playing Blumhouse Games and Perfect Garbage’s not-so-cozy farming sim. One that kept me much more engaged than your garden-variety farming game, with its impressively intriguing threads that added a little drop of poison to the well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a brief intro to the player character, who’s escaped a prison sentence in search of a new beginning, things start getting weird. Hari, a neighborly caretaker who’s maintained the property since falling into ruin, greeted me with an incredulous (but charming) hello, which doubles as a quick tutorial. At first glance, the stuff he introduced me to wasn’t that strange. I had the standard tool wheel, complete with a shovel, pickaxe, watering can, and so on. But I also had a crowbar?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s because Grave Seasons isn’t just a grim or slightly spooky take on farming: it’s also a mystery game. And while I didn’t have a chance to use a crowbar during the early section I played, it sounds like you’ll need to use it to break open locked doors later on in the story. But given the mysterious circumstances under which my character came into their new home, I’m curious to learn about their motives and means.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Grave Seasons isn’t just a grim or slightly spooky take on farming: it’s also a mystery game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After working my new land, picking some chilis, cabbage, and tomatoes that Hari so neatly planted – and doing a little planting of my own, burying some carrot seeds my new friend offered as a welcoming gift – I did some exploring. To my shock, I found a severed hand and a bloodied ring amidst the weeds and garbage littering the far reaches of the property. I tugged at this new thread immediately, taking it to Hari to see what he had to say about it, rendering shock and horror from my musclebound, tutorial-dispensing neighbor.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nothing really came from this interaction, beyond that reaction, and the revelation that I could talk to Hari about other stuff, and even offer them a gift. Obviously, I’m sure there are opportunities to spend more time with them (or any character, as I met later) and figure out what he might actually want. But a half-hour demo isn’t exactly designed for that kind of long-game mindset. So I gave them the chocolate ice cream cone in my inventory as a sign of friendship (and maybe more). Unfortunately, he reacted to the frozen treat about as well as he did to the hand… I didn’t get another chance to try my hand (no pun intended) at offering them something else, but given Grave Seasons’ dark, slightly comedic tone, I’m curious to see what winds up tickling their fancy in the full game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then I retreated to my shed, where I found a pickling and fermenting station a while earlier to put my chilis and cabbage to good use by making some kimchi. This highlighted one of my favorite parts of Grave Seasons. Although it’s decidedly horror-focused, Grave Seasons doesn’t skimp on the stuff that makes farming games great in the first place. With a diverse menu, well-realized in a sharp, pixelated art style, this demo made me hungry as I marveled at the pixel art of garlic, hummus, pickles, and salads. Kimchi in hand, I set back out to my house to find a new character sitting on the edge of the well in my yard.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/04-1750722909801.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Pilar, a fashion designer with a passion for vintage clothing, greeted me with another warm welcome before telling me about their plans to forage for some rare herbs that night. After agreeing to explore my new home a bit, I tried talking to them more, again about the hand, getting another shocked response. I gave them my fresh kimchi to see what they thought about it, but just like Hari, no dice.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pilar and Hari's dialogue was consistently engaging, funny, and distinct in a way that conveyed loads of personality and life.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Here was another favorite part of the demo: just talking to Pilar and Hari. Their dialogue was consistently engaging, funny, and distinct in a way that conveyed loads of personality and life. I would’ve sat there for the entire demo just gifting them every last radish, head of lettuce, and cigarette in my inventory if I could. Based on the trailer and other materials Perfect Garbage has shared, I’m excited to see what other characters I get to meet. And I’m eager to watch them play out their roles in this mystery, which deepened at night.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/03-1750722932949.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After cleaning up some trash, mining for some minerals and iron, watering my carrots, and putting some crops into storage to be sold, it was time to take a walk in the woods with Pilar. Upon walking into the gulley, something was immediately off. Then, a pair of bright red eyes opened behind them, claws emerging at Pilar’s ankles, illuminated by their lantern. In the blink of an eye, some kind of eldritch beast mangled Pilar. It took me about a minute to refix my dropped jaw after seeing that… I can’t believe how expressively gory Grave Seasons would get, or that they just killed off Pilar like that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was the end of the demo, but it absolutely left me wanting more. Setting up a story that blends in all sorts of seemingly disparate threads like this – from small-town murders to bloodthirsty creatures beyond comprehension lurking in dark woods – created just the right kind of intrigue. I’m sure I’ll wind up investigating my now-dead friend’s witchy ways, make more friends (and enemies), and grow crops to make tasty food while doing it.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/02-1750722948942.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve had a lot of trouble sticking with most farming sims because they lacked a certain sense of intrigue; that hook to keep me looking forward to the next day for something other than fresh crops. This is exactly what the developers at Perfect Garbage are looking to remedy with Grave Seasons; I’m sure this first day was a condensed version of the kind of pacing we’ll see in the full release, but I love the balance of visual novel-like mystery with the more relaxing pace of farming gameplay, ensuring that fresh crops grow in time with the narrative and dramatic tension.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grave Seasons promises to inject something sinister into the farming sim genre with a compelling horror-mystery that seems on track to deliver personality, fright, and charm in spades. I’m interested to see and learn more about Grave Seasons’ community of charming townsfolk and the secrets lurking underneath Ashenridge’s small-town veneer when it ships on PC and consoles sometime next year.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/grave-seasons-is-a-cozy-farming-sim-with-a-dark-side]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Video game development veteran Masahiro Sakurai, who is best known for creating the Kirby franchise and for his work on the Super Smash Bros. series, has said the current model of large-scale game development is "becoming unsustainable."</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/business/articles/2504/18/news061.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ITMedia </a>as translated by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-on-his-working-style-the-changing-industry-and-unsustainable-aaa-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, "I think it is becoming unsustainable to continue producing large games on the scale that companies currently do, as it requires too much work."</p><p>Sakurai added that independent game developers are facing challenges, too. He said indie developers "need a lot of luck, effort, polish, and stand-out elements to succeed in the market."</p><p>The developer went on to say that he sees generative AI as a possible solution to help developers, especially teams that make large-scale games.</p><p>"The only effective breakthrough I can think of at the moment is generative AI. I think we are getting to the point where (AAA studios) have to change their way of working by using gen AI to improve work efficiency. I think we are in an era where only the companies that successfully respond to these changes will be able to survive," he said.</p><p>Sakurai mainly makes games for Nintendo, but his company, Sora Ltd., is not owned by the gaming giant. Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser has said he believes AI will play a role in the future of gaming, but the "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-boss-talks-ai-amid-concerns-of-job-cuts-there-will-always-be-a-human-touch/1100-6530667/" data-ref-id="1100-6530667">"human touch" will always be necessary to make great games.</a></p><p>Bowser is basically echoing what Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said back in 2023. At the time, the executive said Nintendo would consider leveraging AI like it would any new technology, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-sees-potential-in-generative-ai-but-wont-make-games-created-by-technology-alone/1100-6524707/" data-ref-id="1100-6524707">games will not be made by "technology alone."</a> Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, meanwhile, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-creator-shigeru-miyamoto-talks-ai-says-nintendo-wants-to-go-in-a-different-direction/1100-6526727/" data-ref-id="1100-6526727">Nintendo won't necessarily rush to utilize AI</a> just because other companies may be doing so.</p><p>Sakurai is not the first person to question the sustainability of the AAA landscape, as former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-talks-about-the-collapse-of-creativity-in-aaa-game-development/1100-6527223/" data-ref-id="1100-6527223">beating that drum for years.</a> As for the role new AI systems can play in the future of game development, it remains to be seen how it will shake out, but developers are already using such tools to speed up development. EA Sports said this week that it created a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-26/news/cfb26-campus-huddle-presentation?cid=84496&amp;ts=1750691127277" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"newly upgraded machine- learning-based pipeline"</a> to speed up development on CFB 26. In 2024, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">majority of video game developers worldwide were using AI tools to make games</a>, despite ongoing concerns from workers.</p><p>Kingdom Come director Daniel Vavra previously spoke positively about his hope that an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-2-director-hopeful-ai-revolution-can-help-him-make-games-faster/1100-6531008/" data-ref-id="1100-6531008">"AI revolution" will help his studio make games faster and more efficiently.</a> Not everyone is so enthusiastic about the role of AI in gaming going forward, as enigmatic game developer Yoko Taro recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nier-director-yoko-taro-says-ai-will-make-all-game-creators-unemployed/1100-6531185/" data-ref-id="1100-6531185">"AI will make all game creators unemployed."</a> It remains to be seen how companies adopting AI systems might impact employment. Larian Studios' Swen Vincke has embraced AI to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">automate tedious tasks</a> no one wants to do.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Initially, I didn’t have <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/atomfall">Atomfall</a> pegged as one of my must-play games and yet, when it launched, something about the action-packed gameplay trailers spoke to me. There was the freedom of choice aspect that appealed, of course: the ability to help, hinder, or kill the first person you meet is indictive of the games free-form structure throughout. Then there’s the delightful 1960’s Cumbrian countryside setting, which visually and atmospherically sets Atomfall apart from the myriad other post-apocalyptic video games out there. But it was the real-life influenced mystery at the heart of the game that truly got my buy-in. Discovering what had happened at the Windscale Power Plant and learning what the obtuse Oberon actually is, these became obsessions of mine during the delightfully achievable twenty-odd hours it took me to play through the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall - Pre-Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OCRyzkMdF-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/atomfall-review/">Atomfall review</a></p>


<p>I was blown away to later learn that the nuclear disaster portrayed in the game was based on an actual event in British history, the 1957 fire at the Windscale Power Plant. Now, I don’t know lots of things. Who is Charlie XCX? How does TikTok work? Why does my son keep demanding that I ‘POV’? I can accept my ignorance on these topics; I’m 43 and my back hurts. But I was befuddled how the worst nuclear accident in the UK’s history, indeed, one of the worst in the entire world – ranked in potential nastiness of level 5 out of 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale no less – had completely escaped my attention.</p>
<p>A big aspect of the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playing-with-history">Playing with History</a> series has always been about learning through the medium of video games. So, what better way to learn about the Windscale Fire, and the development of Atomfall, than by interviewing Ryan Greene, Art Director at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/rebellion">Rebellion</a>? Sure, I could Wikipedia it, but where’s the fun in that?</p>

<p>“First and foremost, Jason Kingsley, our CEO, has always been fascinated by historical flashpoints.” Ryan explained about Rebellion’s decision to base a videogame around the infamous Windscale Fire, “Alongside this, we noticed that, although there are many “nuclear quarantine” games, none were based around the Windscale Incident, which was the world’s first major nuclear disaster. Additionally, the vast majority of these games are set in post-apocalyptic urban locations or irradiated waste lands. Whereas the Windscale Incident enabled us to create a lush and green setting in the rural British countryside, which immediately sets Atomfall out from the crowd. “</p>
<p>Now, without trying to freak anyone out, the Windscale Fire could have gone very differently. Without the concerted bravery of those diligently fighting the fire over several panic-stricken days, much of the UK could now be irradiated. How did those real-life and incredibly dramatic events surrounding the Windscale fire influence the development of Atomfall?</p>

<p>“Although it’s not widely talked about nowadays,” whispered Ryan, perhaps concerned that the ghost of Harold Macmillan could well be on to us, “the Windscale Incident could have become a defining moment in modern British history had things gone differently. However, it’s important to handle historic events like this with care and so the cause behind Atomfall’s in-game Windscale fire and the resulting fallout is completely fictional. So, it’s more a case of using the incident as a jumping off point for us explore a ‘what if’ alternative history that also draws influence from 50s and 60s British speculative fiction and British folklore.”</p>
<p>This decorum absolutely makes sense, as it’s estimated, even with the fire being contained, that the resulting radiation leak may have caused up to an additional 240 cancer cases. Rather shockingly, the reactor that was the cause of all the shenanigans is still sealed with fifteen tons of uranium wedged inside. Due to the fear that opening the reactor could cause the fuel to reignite, it isn’t due for decommission until 2037. So, you know, it’s just sat there.</p>
<p>Anyhow, on that cheery note, it’s time to find out how Atomfall being set in the infancy of the Cold War, an era of secrecy, influenced the cover-ups and conspiracies that are the beating heart of the game’s engaging storyline.</p>
<p>“The pulp culture of the 1950s and 1960s was a major influence on Atomfall,” said Ryan. “This is steeped in Cold War themes like paranoia, unease, distrust of the government, uncertainty about urbanisation, loss of tradition, keeping calm in the face of a grand threat. All of this filtered into the world of Atomfall, and you can see this represented in the setting, the characters, and the tasks and activities people ask you to do for them. However, it is probably best reflected by the fact that everyone in the game has their own take on events, but who you trust and what version of the ‘truth’ you accept, is up to you.”</p>
<p>Totally, which links into the many brilliant multiple endings of the game, each feeding into the player’s actions and decisions. I’m still making my way through all of them, though I can’t quite bring myself to side with the druids, a measure of how the game’s lore and ethics have buried their razor-sharp teeth into me. Atomfall’s reconstruction of 1960’s Cumbria is absolutely spot on too. I found myself wondering, how did the developers go about delivering such an authentic feeling Lake District slice of life? And what role did historical research play in this? Ryan did not disappoint in his answer:</p>
<p>“To ensure that the game accurately captured the look and feel of rural Cumbria in the late 1950s, members of the Art and Design teams undertook several photogrammetry expeditions to the area. During these trips, we captured images of historic structures and architecture (i.e. the Lake District’s iconic drystone walls) that were then used as sources of design for the game. Some older buildings that were constructed prior to Atomfall’s setting, were also mapped into the game. As a consequence, Atomfall’s quarantine zone represents a concentrated slice of Northern England that is true to the real-world location. Importantly, Atomfall’s quarantine zone has been walled off from the outside world since 1957. Therefore, the world players explore is in effect a time capsule, and we were careful to ensure that items littered around the in-game map accurately reflected the period. So, time appropriate gadgets include radios and phonographs, as well as vehicles like period trucks and bicycles. The team also leaned into small details, such as 1950s dimpled pint glasses to ensure that players can have an authentic pint in Grendell’s Head, the local village pub. This care even extended beyond everyday items to aspects like the fonts used on the in-game road signage, as those used in 1950s Britain were much more decorative compared with today.”</p>

<p>I adore a dimpled pint glass – one with a handle – surely the greatest drinking implement of all time. Indeed, a distinctive sense of ‘Britishness’ suffuses every aspect of Atomfall. Take the incorporation of folk-horror elements, which provide a brilliantly moody atmosphere that permeates every location the player explores. Which folk tales, I pondered, influenced Rebellion the most in developing the game?</p>
<p>Scarily, Ryan responded, even though I’m pretty sure I didn’t ask my question out loud: “The folk horror elements behind the game are eclectic. The classic British 1973 folk horror The Wicker Man is a major inspiration – as you can probably guess from the fact we have our own in-game wicker man! In addition to this, lesser-known British folk horror The Blood on Satan’s Claw and the 1980s kids TV show Moondial also served as references points when we were creating areas like Casterfell Woods. “</p>
<p>But, of course, it’s not just folk horror, there’s also a hefty dose of sci-fi to be found, with the B.A.R.D robots in particular having a distinctive Dalek vibe. Did 1960s Doctor Who influence the developers work?</p>
<p>“Absolutely!”, exclaimed Ryan, “Our art team drew on Doctor Who as well as Day of the Triffids, The Quatermass Experiment, and The Prisoner when creating designs for B.A.R.D, the fictional research organisation responsible for Atomfall’s unique brand of retro-futurist technology and machinery. As such, the towering atomic battery powered robots that players will need to tackle and the underground secret laboratories that are begging to be explored have a look that is very much reminiscent of classic 1960s science fiction. Beyond this, the audio team created scores driven by heavy piano lines and frenetic rhythms reminiscent of 1960s science fiction. These scores are used to convey a sense of chaos when encountering robots and eeriness when exploring abandoned scientific laboratories. As well as music, the sci-fi influences have also worked their way into the sound effects when players interact with the world through pushing buttons, and pulling levers. For instance, the machinery in Atomfall is powered by a type of sci-fi inspired, retro-futurist technology, the distinctive sound of which is punctuated by radiophonic-style electronic sounds typical of classic Doctor Who.”</p>
<p>With all this Doctor Who inspired tech talk, it could be easy to forget about the many British influenced weapons, tools, food and drink in the game, from the cricket bat (a personal fave) to health-restoring Cornish pasties and energy-providing cups of tea. How did the team go about selecting this quintessential British line up?</p>
<p>“By the time the player wakes up, Atomfall’s quarantine zone has been cut off from the land of plenty for five years” mused Ryan, “As such, resources within the zone are scarce. With weapons, the melee weapons are mostly improvised cudgels and blades that could feasibly be scavenged from the landscape. Then, in terms of ranged weapons, it’s a motley collection of worn-out weaponry that may have been on farms and estates during that time, alongside those that the military brought in when the quarantine zone went into effect.”</p>
<p>But what about items that almost made the cut but weren’t included in the end? Was there ever the possibility of us cudgelling a bandit with Queen Victoria’s stony bust?</p>
<p>Ryan politely ignored my poor attempt at a pun and concluded, “in terms of what made the cut, we wanted Atomfall to have a quintessentially British feel, and so it was about including those iconic items that may feasibly have been laying around the house when this disaster happens. This is where the cricket bat comes in… what English house in the 50s didn’t have a cricket bat!?” That’s very true, I might have to get one to stick in my garage, just for apocalypse preparation purposes.</p>

<p>“We did tinker with even more rudimentary weapons such as a wooden plank” considered Ryan, “but found this just confused players as environmental content such as wooden floors, and banisters are so common throughout the game. So, we ended up avoiding such mundane items, and made sure our weapons were clearly designed for utilitarian combat and ideally had some nice retro British styling.”</p>
<p>As we prepared to wrap up the interview, I admitted my sordid little secret to Ryan: that, despite being really into history, prior to playing Atomfall, I hadn’t even heard of the Windscale fire. I figured I couldn’t be the only one clueless in this respect – at least, I hoped I wasn’t the only one – what has the response been from Atomfall’s player base in discovering this almost forgotten event?</p>
<p>“Interestingly, despite it being the world’s first major nuclear incident, not many people today know about the 1957 Windscale fire” said Ryan, which was a relief for my delicate yet inflated ego, let me tell you. “This is largely because the severity of the situation was played down and many details were suppressed by the government of the time. The response from the community has been phenomenal – again with many people not knowing that the game was based, albeit loosely, on a real-world event. In particular, Cumbrians have been thrilled to see their local environment so accurately depicted in a video game for the first time. It has been fun to see people learning about Cumbrian history via playing our game and hopefully we give insights into the regional industries and local culture.”</p>
<p>Absolutely, the team at Rebellion unequivocally achieved this goal. As someone who loves to visit the lakes, Atomfall just feels right. From the cute little cottages, to rolling green fields, ancient walls, and stone circles; it’s all a sumptuous treat for a fell-walker’s eyeballs. Plus, playing Atomfall results in far fewer blisters than a real life outing in the Lakes. Right Ryan, let’s wrap things up with a plug to sell some stuff, just as all children of latter stage capitalism must do. So, as someone eager to return to Wyndham Village for further misadventures, what, if anything, can you tell me about your DLC plans?</p>

<p>“We have just launched our first DLC, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/29/atomfalls-wicked-isle-story-dlc-launches-on-june-3rd/">the Wicked Isle</a>. This draws heavily on the folk horror elements of the game for inspiration – the DLC’s location, Midsummer Island, is actually a nod to the movie Midsummar, “Summerisle” from Wicker man, and “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. So hopefully that gives an idea of where we are trying to go with that! We also have another DLC in the works too. We don’t have much to announce on this front yet, but it will lean more into Atomfall’s sci-fi influences.” Frankly Ryan, I cannot wait. Now, time to go hit some more bandits with my cricket bat and finally try to force myself to help out the druids and be nice to Oberon, just to see what happens!</p>

<p>Limited Run Games has dropped a patch today that fixes previous compatibility issues which prevented the game from working properly on the new console.</p>
<p>"The day has arrived, and GEX Trilogy's Switch 2 compatibility patch has finally been approved!" The company posted <a href="https://x.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1937488404796604537">on social media</a>. All you have to do is download the update and you should be able to jump into Crystal Dynamics' classic gecko-starring trilogy.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rxnwiy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>For anyone holding out for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/gex-trilogy-lands-june-release-special-edition-with-blow-up-doll-revealed">physical release</a> — which includes some special artwork from <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> artist Yoshitaka Amano, of all people — the patch will be included on the cartridge. Phew!</p>
<p>The physical games publisher has been having a number of issues with its Carbon Engine games on the Switch 2 since the console's launch. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-20-1-5-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">last week's firmware update</a> from Nintendo seems to have <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/limitedrungames.com/post/3lrxtpyclnj2s">fixed a bunch of them</a>, but problems with Gex did for LRG to ask Nintendo to pull the game from the Switch 2 eShop.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there's no need for that to happen now! We're meant to be getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/gex-trilogy-adding-pal-versions-and-voices-in-its-next-update">the PAL versions in a future update</a>, alongside the iconic UK voice acting, too, so there's never been a better time to play Gex.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's Tuesday, so <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has gotten a fresh patch. This one makes the Illuminate's flying death slugs easier to battle and looks like it might have laid the groundwork for the game's long-awaited review bomb cape.</p>
<p>Those Leviathan balancing tweaks have come after players continued to struggle to beat the airborne enemy, despite Arrowhead having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-delivers-a-free-cape-and-lets-you-rock-the-spotlight-before-getting-zapped-by-a-leviathan">previously added a spotlight effect</a> to the attack it can use to one-shot your bottom into oblivion.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So, in response to that feedback, as outlined in the notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516339151333753417?l=english">patch 01.003.104</a>, Helldivers 2's devs have made four tweaks aimed at making Leviathan fights "more manageable".</p>
<p>The flying squids "no longer cause ragdolling and deal less impulse damage to vehicles". You'll also run into fewer of them per mission thanks to spawn rate tweaks, and there's an extra second delay between their shots to give you more opportunity to dodge. What's more, you can destroy their cannons.</p>
<p>The early response from players has been something along the lines of '<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1lj6ban/another_victory_for_the_right_side_of_history/">thank you</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1lj6ruw/finally_we_can_destroy_leviathan_cannons/">thank you</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1lj6w41/it_was_a_needed_change_thank_you_ah/">thank youuuuuuu</a>'.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the patch, it's just handy bug fixes, including ones for "weapons being unable to fire after stimming while using a mounted weapon" and the Warrant pistol's bullets penetrating on ricochet in a fashion they're not supposed to.</p>
<p>Right, be warned, I'm now moving into leaky/dataminey territory, so take what you read from here with a pinch of salt. Not long after today's patch dropped, Helldivers 2 leaker IronS1ghts, who's got a good track record when it comes to <a href="https://x.com/Iron_S1ghts/status/1932367095699841042">spotting stuff</a> in the game's files that then ends up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-just-rolled-out-mega-city-battles-against-the-terminids-kicking-off-an-unprecedented-assault-of-bug-fascism">being deployed</a>, <a href="https://x.com/Iron_S1ghts/status/1937447724095246618">shared an image</a> of a cape dubbed "Pillars of Freedom".</p>
<p>To my eye, and the eyes of several folks in the replies, it looks to be the review bomb cape Arrowhead have been teasing adding to the game as an inside joke since that whole PSN account linking controversy last year, and studio CEO Shams Jorjani <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-ceo-review-bomb-cape-comment-region-locking-lifted">recently chatted about releasing</a>. Here's <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1789406952243577164">a teaser</a> of the cape Arrowhead CCO Johan Pilestedt posted a while ago if you want to play spot the difference for yourself.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-nerfs-leviathans-and-might-have-snuck-that-review-bomb-cape-in-behind-the-scenes]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Firaxis and 2K are committed to reversing the fortunes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii"><u>Civilization 7</u></a> with an all-new update, much of which has been "influenced by the community."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This month's "hefty" <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Update 1.2.2</u></a> brings a raft of long-awaited features like Large and Huge Maps, expanded Advanced Game Options, and a community favorite: Steam Workshop support. There's also new Town Specializations, City-State Bonuses, Beliefs, balance changes, UI improvements, and — best of all, of course — "a very pettable Scout dog."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can also finish their current save under a previous version by using the legacy Steam beta branch. Backwards compatibility for existing saves is also available, although you should note that "some new abilities or effects may not appear until you start a new game or advance to the next Age in your current campaign."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For the best experience, we recommend starting a new game, or continuing your current game into the next Age," Firaxis said. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Large and Huge map sizes — which I'm afraid aren't available on Switch, along with Standard — default to 10 players, but multiplayer campaigns max out at eight people, inclusive of AI companions. The team hopes to expand Huge to accommodate 12 players eventually, but right now it "needs a bit more time to make sure increased player counts won't compromise game stability or performance." That said, because of the size, these maps have been spruced up with Pantheons (and two new ones have been added to Antiquity), Religious Beliefs, Discoveries, and City-State bonuses to "ensure there’s enough content for all the players in a game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"One of the best things about Civilization is how many ways there are to play," the update added. "Some players are happy to peacefully build the biggest, best Cities while others want to ignore all that and go conquer the world ('Yes, your amazing City does look great in my empire'). With 1.2.2, we’ve added several new advanced game setup options to give you even more control over how you play."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means you can now decide whether to enable, disable (or turn off entirely) Legacy Paths per Page, specific Crises, as well as disable Score Victory. AI difficulty can be amended, too, and you can bypass Civ Unlocks On Age Transitions now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’ve had a lot of fun playing with different Legacy Paths on or off in each Age. While Legacy Paths that don’t lead to a Victory are always optional, sometimes it’s nice to just tune them out entirely and focus on playing into the unique strengths of your leader and civ," Firaxis added. "For a fun sandbox game we’ve been playing in the office, try turning off Legacy Paths for Antiquity and Exploration, and setting the game to Abbreviated Ages. If you want to lean into the sandbox feel even more, try turning off Legacy Paths in Modern and the Score Victory, too."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Feedback from fans about Religion has necessitated changes, too, with the team now adding new Beliefs and updating existing ones to give bonus incentives for converting your own Settlements. There are "bigger and bolder changes" also on the horizon for Religion, but we'll find out more about those at a later date. You can also expect Town focus bonuses to help them feel more "impactful."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Urban Centers in particular have received a glow-up, and now gain access to many of the Buildings that were otherwise only available in Cities (like Libraries and Monuments in Antiquity)," the update explained. "Fort Towns gain the ability to purchase multiple walls so they can really lock down strategic chokepoints. We also introduced a new type of Town Focus: the Resort Town. These relaxing scenic retreats gain extra Gold and Happiness on Rural tiles with Happiness and increased Yields on Natural Wonders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Lastly, we felt massed Hub Towns were overshadowing some of the other options and gave them a slight nerf from +2 Influence per connected Settlement to +1 Influence. We’re going to keep our eye on them to see how they compare against the other newly buffed Towns."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players will also now be able to find and install mods from Steam Workshop. Oh, and there's even a new loading screen, with rewritten and re-recorded narration from Gwendoline Christie.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also an absolute smorgasbord of tweaks and fixes, but if I wrote all those out here, we'd be here until Christmas. You can head on over to the <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official website</u></a> to see it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Civilization 7 has had a rough launch on Steam — that much is clear. The strategy sequel has struggled for players on Valve’s platform ever since its launch in February. Despite a number of patches issued by developer Firaxis to reverse things, Civilization 7 finds itself in the unenviable situation of having fewer players on Steam than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi"><u>Civilization 6</u></a> and even the 15-year-old <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-v"><u>Civilization 5</u></a>. According to Steam user reviews the game is 'mixed,' although the last 1,500 or so reviews has it falling to a 'mostly negative' rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Update 1.2.2 is out now, although Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 players will have to wait a little longer as the team works "diligently to get these updates through the additional Switch submission requirements." Players still experiencing issues or bugs are encouraged to disable mods and make the team aware. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We thought Civilization 7 was 'good,' <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-review"><u>awarding it a fitting 7/10</u></a>, writing: "Civilization 7's improved warfare and added bits of narrative flair give me reasons to keep clicking one more turn late into the night, but the desire to streamline and simplify this legendary 4X series feels like it has also gone a bit too far, particularly when it comes to the interface."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

    <ul>
        </ul>

    
    <p><span>Negotiations currently underway with several companies.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Pole To Win Holdings will sell off <a title="Companies > AQUAPLUS [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/hike/aquaplus">AQUAPLUS</a>, a subsidiary of its media contents company <a title="Companies > HIKE [214 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/hike">HIKE</a>, to a company outside of its group, the holdings company <a href="https://pdf.irpocket.com/C3657/OtX6/lS55/Od7e.pdf" target="_blank">announced</a>. <span id="more-975710"></span></p><p>Negotiations are currently underway with several companies, but a decision has not yet been made. An announcement will be made as soon as the details have been finalized.</p><p>Here is the group’s reasoning for selling off AQUAPLUS:</p><blockquote><p>Our Group provides quality consulting, game debugging, software testing, environment-building and transition support, monitoring, customer support, anti-fraud measures, and BPR support in the process of planning, developing, releasing, operating, and improving the lifecycle of customers’ services and products. This business is divided into three operations: Domestic Solutions, Overseas Solutions, and Media Contents.</p><p>Media Contents business is a new business that follows the core businesses of Domestic Solutions and Overseas Solutions. Our group has acquired subsidiaries such as SARUGAKUCHO Inc. in March 2010, QBIST Inc. in January 2015, <a title="Companies > CREST [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crest">CREST</a> Inc. in November 2019, colorful Inc. in October 2020, Panda Graphics Inc. and Delfi Sound Inc. in August 2021, SANETTY Produce Co., Ltd. in November 2022, and AQUAPLUS Co., Ltd in December 2022. These well-known companies in the entertainment industry were integrated as HIKE Inc. (hereinafter referred to as HIKE) from February 2023, and ShiiTAKE DiGiTAL Ltd. was acquired as a subsidiary in January 2024.</p><p>AQUAPLUS is promoting to develop and sell games as a subsidiary of Media Contents’s core company, HIKE. The company’s remake version of <em><a title="Games > ToHeart (2025) [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/toheart-2025">ToHeart</a></em> (PC / Nintendo Switch), which is scheduled to be released on June 26, 2025, has steadily increased its reservations. However, in line with the today’s announcement of “Notice of Changes (Transfer of Shares and Receivables) in Consolidated Subsidiaries (Specified Subsidiaries) and Occurrence of Extraordinary Profits and Extraordinary Losses,” in Media Contents business, including HIKE, in order to secure competitive positions in the growing industry and intensifying competition in the content industry, we recognize that we are in a business environment where we must continue to make more upfront investments than in the past, so we have resolved for a management buyout (MBO) by HIKE’s founder and current president and for the same reason, we have resolved to transfer shares outside of our group for AQUAPLUS.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>AQUAPLUS was previously a subsidiary of HIKE, but rather than considering a transfer including HIKE that promotes 360-degree entertainment services for both business-to-consumer and business-to-business with a focus on intellectual properties, it was determined that a wider range of counterparties could consider the transfer of shares as a stand-alone game developer, which in turn would increase the possibility of transferring shares to a counterparty with prospects for greater synergy with AQUAPLUS. Accordingly, the Company has decided to make AQUAPLUS a direct subsidiary of the Company and to consider transferring shares of the company on a stand-alone basis. With regard to the transfer of AQUAPLUS shares, we are currently in the process of negotiating with a number of companies, but in order to expand the company’s business in the future, we will proceed with the transfer of shares to counterparties with more synergies.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/pole-to-win-holdings-to-sell-off-aquaplus]]></content:encoded>
