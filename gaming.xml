		<p>The Fuga: Melodies of Steel series is coming to an end this year with Fuga: Melodies of Steel 3 set to release on 29th May 2025, concluding its epic tale.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fuga: Melodies of Steel 3 Teaser Trailer #Fuga3 #FugaMelodiesOfSteel3" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-U57GugkGCQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The end of the trilogy will naturally continue in the same vein as the first two, with furry felineko characters going to war against a tyrannical enemy, the Berman Imperial Army. The crew of the Taranis are just completing training and improvements to convert their tank into a flying wonder when a transmission summons them to… the Moon? And there’s a load of laser satellites all set to blow up the world?</p>
<p>Fuga: Melodies of Steel 3 is coming to all the usual platforms: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC.</p>

<p>We’ve really enjoyed the series so far, with Reu saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/08/fuga-melodies-of-steel-2-review/">our review of Fuga 2</a>, “There’s a lot to love with Fuga 2, and the game is incredibly rewarding if you commit to the experience. It’s an improvement in every possible way on the original and provides an impactful and heart wrenching story with engaging gameplay throughout. If you played and loved the original game, this is an absolutely essential purchase, and even if you didn’t, this is turn-based strategy done very right. Just don’t you dare let Boron get loaded into the Soul Cannon, you monster.”</p>

That’s the question I’ve been pondering since playing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/star-wars-episode-i-jedi-power-battles&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/star-wars-episode-i-jedi-power-battles"><em>Star Wars: Episode 1: Jedi Power Battles</em></a></span><em>.</em></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,195371,195386" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Launched 25 years ago on the original PlayStation, <em>Jedi Power Battles</em> is a beat ‘em up that includes co-op, platforming, and vehicle segments. As you slice and dice droids and criminals, you experience a condensed retelling of 1999's <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311?_gl=1*1dp6uhr*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzY0ODc5NC4xNDguMS4xNzM3NjUxNzg3LjE5LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311?_gl=1*1dp6uhr*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzY0ODc5NC4xNDguMS4xNzM3NjUxNzg3LjE5LjAuMA.."><em>The Phantom Menace</em></a></span>. And uh, the game wasn’t very good, with clunky combat and bad platforming segments. But, that hasn’t stopped<em> Jedi Power Battles </em>from returning in 2025 via a newly released remaster. </p><p>Developed by Aspyr, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-bounty-hunter-remaster-review-is-it-good-ps5-1851610382&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-bounty-hunter-remaster-review-is-it-good-ps5-1851610382">the same studio behind last year’s <em>Star Wars Bounty Hunter</em> remaster</a></span>, this new and improved version of <em>Jedi Power Battles</em> is out now on basically every platform under the sun. And like the original it includes local co-op as well as multiple characters (include non-Jedi ones) to play as, and 10 levels to work through. </p><p>As you would expect, Aspyr has visually upgraded <em>Jedi Power Battles</em>, too. So you get improved textures, better looking menus, and increased performance, which is much appreciated as the original PlayStation game looked rough and played poorly. (I should know, last year I streamed and beat the original.) This spiffy port also includes new characters to play as and all the original unlockable characters now included right from the get go.</p><p>And all the remastered aspects of this new port are great. In fact, this is a perfect version of <em>Jedi Power Battles</em>. It includes everything, looks great, runs well, and also features <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-episode-i-jedi-power-battles-announce&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-episode-i-jedi-power-battles-announce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nice bonus features</a></span> that will make super<em> Star Wars</em> nerds (like me) happy. For example, you can swap Mace Windu’s lightsaber color from the original, inaccurate blue seen in the game to a perfect purple. If you want to play <em>Jedi Power Battles</em> in 2025, this is the way to do so. No question about it.</p><p>However, I would point out that I’m not sure anyone really wanted to replay <em>Jedi Power Battles </em>25 years later. I mean, sure, there are probably people who grew up with this game and have nostalgia for it. I was one of those kids who played hours and hours of this game back in 2000. But whenever I return to it, most recently to play this remaster, I find a bad, clunky game. Combat feels stiff and unresponsive; enemies take way too many hits; levels, like the section on Coruscant, go on forever and feel miserable. Playing in co-op is a bit more fun and some boss fights are entertaining, but overall <em>Jedi Power Battles </em>is a bad game that would have been forgotten if it weren’t connected to <em>Star Wars. </em></p><p>So where does that leave the remaster of <em>Jedi Power Battles?</em> Well, if you are really desperate for a new couch co-op<em> Star Wars </em>game—which there aren’t many of—then you might have a fine time. For everyone else, well, I’d recommend only buying and playing this remaster if you are super nostalgic for the original game. Just be warned: You likely won’t enjoy <em>Star Wars: Episode 1: Jedi Power Battles</em> as much in 2025 as you did in 2000.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It’s pretty strange to think that it’s been almost half a decade since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/12/03/assassins-creed-valhalla-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</a>. Sure, there was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/04/assassins-creed-mirage-review/">Assassin’s Creed Mirage</a> as a back-to-its-roots palette cleanser, but Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the first ‘full’ new game in the modern action-RPG style since 2020, though with Ubisoft Quebec as lead developer, it’s more a successor to Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. With such a passage of time, you’d hope for some big changes to the formula, shifting the focus point and tone of how the game plays. We’ve been hands-on with a few hours of the game, its prologue and a more open mission from later in the story.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows Preview – Strike from the shadows, kick from the rooftops" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3JumaCsHXcI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Running through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> are its two contrasting characters – Naoe a female shinobi assassin, and Yasuke, an African samurai based on the real historical figure. The opening of the game introduces them separately, with Yasuke coming to Japan as an enslaved bodyguard to a Jesuit missionary who rescued him from drowning, and who is in Japan to try and receive Oda Nobunaga’s favour. Nobunaga, much like the historical account, is fascinated by seeing a black man for the first time, but also spots the potential in him as a warrior and breaks him from his servitude to fight for him, giving him the name Yasuke – he’s called Diogo prior to this. The prologue skips around his timeline, jumping ahead to a siege by Nobunaga’s army, with Yasuke able to charge through in the hunt for the enemy leader as the castle burns around him and the battle rages.</p>


<p>On the other side of this fight is Naoe, whose path to becoming a member of the Assassins is much more straightforward and obvious, but also significantly more tragic. There’s a great Tarantino-esque reveal of the cabal of bad guys at the end of the prologue – apt when considering how heavily inspired by Westerns he has been through his filmmaking career, and some of the crossover and blending of ideas they had with Japanese cinema.</p>


<p>Eventually, the pair are united in their cause, to track down this cabal one by one, unravel their nefarious plot and retrieve whatever mystical macguffin they plan to use to enact it. Following the prologue you can play as either of them, pretty much whenever you want. During open-ended sections you can switch between Yasuke and Naoe from the pause menu, and through narrative missions you’re regularly given the choice to choose which character you’ll play as through the next 5-10 minute section. Both approaches are equally valid because of this, but there’s a thematic style that I feel will dictate most players through the game’s story –&nbsp;you also have an option to have the canonical story auto-pick for you at any narrative decision points, which is a nice touch.</p>
<p>The pair of them provide great contrast in their approach. Naoe is all about stealth and striking from the shadows, much like the original core fantasy of the Assassin’s Creed series, while Yasuke is more of a brawler, able to wade into the fight. Both are more than capable of clambering around the world or holding their own in combat against many enemies, but their abilities skew one way or the other. Naoe has a grappling hook so she’s much more able to reach high up vantage points and scope out the world, while Yasuke has mighty kicks and attacks that bring to mind the 300-esque kicking frenzy that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/10/01/assassins-creed-odyssey-review/">Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</a>.</p>

<p>Combat is naturally related to the action RPG stylings of Valhalla, Odyssey and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/26/assassins-creed-origins-review/">Origins</a>, and it’s satisfyingly punchy, though you do have to gradually whittle away enemy armour and health bars. It strikes a good balance between feeling like 1-on-1 fights where all the other enemies watch before taking their turn, and allowing multiple enemies to gang up on you together, leaving you to dish out counter attacks in that Batman: Arkham style.</p>
<p>Yasuke can wield large katanas, yari spears and brutal looking kanabō war clubs – he’s also capable of what’s branded as a brutal assassination, which really lives up to the name as you barrel into combat. At range, you can pull out a bow and arrow or an arquebus, one of the earliest firearms. Naoe, by contrast, is much more traditional as a shinobi, coming with smaller blades, throwable shuriken and kunai. Both then have special attacks on a cooldown, whether it’s a quick samurai strike to dash and slash forward, or the aforementioned kick that can send smaller enemies flying.</p>
<p>You can also call upon allies recruited to your network of spies and contacts. This helps maintain your concealment in stealth, as an NPC shinobi dashes in, attacks a target and then smoke bombs their way outta there, or can just give you some backup when battling.</p>

<p>Coming back to the vantage points, while these serve a similar function to previous games, letting you get up high, spot nearby points of interest and then leap from a ludicrous height into a hay bail. The key difference here is that, instead of a quick pan around of the camera that immediately marks and highlights everything for you on the map, telling you exactly what’s in each location, you’re instead presented with a big bunch of question marks. You now have to manually look at and mark each one, where you’re given a coloured highlight that suggests what it might be –&nbsp;a location, an activity –&nbsp;and from that you’re given a bit more agency in the adventure you’re undertaking. Chasing down a marker is more engaging when you don’t know exactly what’s at the other end, and when you’ve chosen this particular rabbit hole to venture down.</p>
<p>Something similar is true for the missions and quests in the game, which can feel much more like an active investigation than a string of waypoints that you need to sprint between. Trying to piece together the events that led to an attack on a group of nobles and the kidnap of a child that threatens an alliance, you have to follow various leads, but they’re not all as specific as “go and talk to the trader by the docks”, and even when they are, the next step isn’t necessarily as clear cut. Instead you’re often directed to a particular area, like the west or south of a city, and told to look for a particular person’s home, a shrine or temple, and the like. Here you’ll often have the choice of fighting your way in to find the person or next clue that you need, or be able to take a stealthier approach.</p>

<p>It’s a great change that feels less clear cut and guided, but as Ubisoft toe this delicate line, they point their feet toward still presenting you with a quick solution. When looking at your next objective, the three clues quickly make it very clear what you need to do and are presented all at once instead of being doled out as you might need them. More fundamentally, as soon as your character sees the objective, they talk about it and they can be immediately highlighted, or a location can be found and marked well before you actually need it. It means that means if you’re looking for a particular guard in an area that doesn’t quite fit in, this crucial final step to solving the puzzle feels like it’s being handed to you on a platter instead of actually testing you to spot the character that’s acting funny.</p>
<p>This is, admittedly, a very difficult thing to get right, and we’ve seen various games take quite different approaches – most recently, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> drew plaudits for its use of the camera to give hints as players request them, and Sony Santa Monica added a hint timer setting for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-review/">God of War: Ragnarok</a>. I hope that Ubisoft Quebec can tweak things just a little bit in this regard to really follow through on this philosophical shift.</p>
<p>Visiting Japan in any time period has been high on pretty much every series fan’s wishlist, and Assassin’s Creed Shadows is going to fulfil that dream for many. We’re still riding the cultural tidal wave that is so keen to explore Japanese history, whether it’s with the Shogun TV series or the handful of major video games that have beaten Ubisoft to the punch. It certainly isn’t the first to get here, but I’m very encouraged by my time with Assassin’s Creed Shadows that Ubisoft are going to strike a lot of the right notes with this long-awaited game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/assassins-creed-shadows-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey" rel="nofollow"><em>Assassin's Creed Origins</em></a> came out eight years ago, it revolutionized the formula. But it was also a massive departure from its stealthier roots, with a more pointed focus on action-oriented combat. <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>feels like the closest the series has gotten to marrying both halves of its identity, perhaps in the most interesting way yet.</p>

<p>Naoe plays a lot like your classic <em>Assassin's Creed</em>. She's nimble and swift, effortlessly flipping off ledges. In open combat, she's fragile and falls after just a few hits. And as you'd expect, she can scale any wall, manmade or otherwise.</p>

<p>Yasuke, on the other hand, leans way more into the action of the more recent games, doubling down on combat. He's tanky, and his finishing blows are violently satisfying. However, he can't really climb much—and that changes the game more than I thought it would.</p>



<h2><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>-&nbsp;Verticality Isn't a Given Anymore</h2>

<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> is the 13th mainline entry in this long-running series, which means it's had nearly two decades to cement one thing in me: Up is always an option. It was one of the first games to feature dynamic climbing in a 3D open world, a core part of the series' identity.</p>

<p>It's so intrinsic, in fact, that I didn't think about it until I played as Yasuke. He's big and beefy, much like Connor from <em>Assassin's Creed III</em>. However, he can't move like Connor; he feels like a tank.</p>

<p>When he sprints into walls or fences, he smashes right through them. His attacks look and feel absolutely deadly; he sells every gruesome decapitation animation. His special attacks just have a lot of oomph and muscle to them.</p>

<p>But he can't parkour.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-finisher.jpg?itok=TmSPC9eS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-finisher.jpg?itok=UaDCtagH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The next second is about as satisfying gas you're imagining.</figcaption></figure><p>This felt the most apparent to me during the last mission of my play session, which had a series of checkpoints where I could choose between Yasuke and Naoe. I did the final approach with Yasuke, which led to what felt like a claustrophobic mini dungeon.</p>

<p>He climbed ladders—not random walls—inside Himeji Castle, tearing down enemies on each floor. It reminded me of dungeons from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/like-dragon-infinite-wealth" rel="nofollow">the <em>Yakuza </em>series</a>, but make no mistake: This is still an <em>Assassin's Creed</em> game.</p>

<p>I didn't have the freedom to step outside and scale the tower. When he fast travels to a viewpoint, he doesn't perch—he's about to fall off, like Sonic the Hedgehog on a ledge. Then he blunders onto the haystack, screaming for dear life.</p>

<p>I specify "fast travels" because he can't climb up those towers himself. The quintessential, belabored&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em> mechanic, climbing towers, is rendered impossible for Yasuke.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-falling-into-haystack.jpg?itok=nZBFm5Ea 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-falling-into-haystack.jpg?itok=BoDthyZl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes, you have to take the leap of faith butt first.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Two Protagonists, One Story</h2>

<p>Yasuke represents a real mood shift for the series. He's so drastically different from Naoe that it makes me rethink how I approach each mission.</p>

<p>It seems like most missions' narratives will play out similarly regardless of your character. However, how you accomplish them is dictated by your actions.</p>

<p>For example, there was a mission where I had to confront some thugs who were pretending to make a deal with a merchant. As Naoe, I instinctively climbed a nearby rooftop, assassinated a few from the air, and dealt with the rest in quick combat.</p>



<p>As Yasuke, though, I decided to approach them head on—what did I have to fear? And I found that they don't attack on sight. Instead, I could talk to them. The dialog still led to a fight, and overall, the result was the same.</p>



<p>In retrospect, I'm sure I could've done the same thing as Naoe, but the drastic change in mindset really stuck with me. My journey and thought process felt meaningfully different between them.</p>

<p>That final mission of the preview, where I fought through Himeji Castle, featured multiple checkpoints where I could swap between the heroes. I was told that there was a Yasuke-specific segment, which I played, that led to a mini boss fight. On the other hand, picking Naoe would've led to a segment specific to her playstyle.</p>

<p>I imagine for big story missions, those sorts of pronounced differences would be more apparent, but for run-of-the-mill open-world fare, it likely just comes down to which character you prefer playing.</p>

<p>You can swap between them any time in the open world as long as you're not in combat, though for most of my time exploring, I imagine myself sticking to Naoe. While Yasuke's lack of parkour is fascinating for quest design, it handicaps him severely for anything not accessible by horseback.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-map.jpg?itok=Px-owkib 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-map.jpg?itok=KHqbsc4B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We only got to see Harima, and with how huge this map is, no parkour would make things difficult.</figcaption></figure><p>A worry I have with the dual protagonist system, though, is loot management. I found myself pretty over the amount of loot I gathered in <em>Odyssey</em>, and in my nearly 4 hours with <em>Shadows</em>, I already picked up a handful of items. Having to manage two sets of equipment does feel like it could get cumbersome across dozens of hours.</p>

<p>On top of that, each character gets multiple weapons. Naoe has the katana, kusarigama, and tanto, with tools like kunai and smoke bombs too. Yasuke gets the long katana, kanabo, naginata, a bow, and a musket. It's a lot of options, but also a lot to keep track of when each item has different rarities, special effects, and damage numbers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-inventory.jpg?itok=3kTMNqLU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-inventory.jpg?itok=-osP_O8V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The tanto acts like a fast dagger, and the kusarigama is a stylish way to deal with multiple enemies.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> - Exploring Feudal Japan</h2>

<p>We were restricted to one region of the map in our <em>Shadows </em>preview session, which had a recommended level of 25. The overall game design will let players explore wherever they'd like, but if you're not at a comparable level, you'll run into some difficulty.</p>

<p>I explored the countryside outside of Himeji Castle once I finished the story missions, and the landscape was picturesque and beautiful. The sun and morning fog created a scenic pink-orange sky as I rode through some rice paddies. Any time I perched atop a viewpoint, the land around me unfurled like a rich tapestry.</p>

<p>Say what you will about the franchise, but historically, the series has done a great job at bringing historic places to life, and this small vertical slice I've seen of Feudal Japan has me eager to see more.</p>

<p><em>Shadows </em>will have seasons—but not like battle passes (as far as I know). After a certain amount of time has passed, spring will give way to summer, and so on. I only experienced spring in my preview, but being able to explore this virtual recreation of Japan in the snow or with cherry blossoms sounds pretty exciting.</p>



<p>Much like <em>Odyssey </em>before it, the mission structure encourages exploration. Instead of specific waypoints, you're given directions (e.g. "it's southeast of this landmark"). If you're in a rush though, you can use a scout to explore a part of the map, and they'll give you a radius to narrow your search down a bit.</p>

<p>Those scouts play into the larger hideout and brotherhood mechanics that I only got a little bit of time to interface with. In game, I could call in an assassin or tank scout to help with a fight. These scouts are upgradeable, too; for example, the assassin could take down an extra target when I called him in.</p>

<p>I could also purchase hideouts across the map to strengthen my network and have spots to restock essentials. In the introductory video of the session, I also saw that you could eventually build out a larger hideout, sort of like build mode in <em>The Sims</em>. I imagine that will take resources, which your scouts can harvest after the passing of every season.</p>



<h2><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> - History Is Written by Ubisoft</h2>

<p><em>Shadows </em>is set during the great unification of Japan in the Sengoku era. Oda Nobunaga shows up, and I wouldn't be surprised if Hideyoshi and Ieyasu appear, too. Meanwhile, Naoe is the fictional insert into the story, acting as the avatar for all the capital-A Assassins lore.</p>

<p>I can't claim to know enough about Japanese history to know how accurate the story will be, nor can I really say which of the characters I met were fictional or historical aside from Nobunaga.</p>

<p>But what I found interesting is that <em>Shadows </em>comes with a "canon" mode. I played it normally, so I could choose dialog choices for Yasuke and Naoe, and by the end of the preview's quest, I could choose to kill or spare a noble. Canon mode would take that choice away and make one for me.</p>

<p>I'm unsure how big of a ramifications his death would have on the larger story (or its potential implications on historical accuracy), but canon mode implies that there's an intended "correct" choice there, in Ubisoft's eyes. Whether it'll tell a good story—regardless of player agency—is yet to be determined.</p>



<p>However, I will say, in the small slice I played, I did find myself paying less and less attention to cutscenes. The voice acting in general just fell flat to me, especially for the two leads. They were stiff, awkward, and lacked charisma.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maybe things will play out differently in the full game when there's time to build a connection with them. But as of now, I'm a little worried about their ability to carry the whole story, especially if it's even half as long as <em>Odyssey</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-kick.jpg?itok=5P4nc7iA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-kick.jpg?itok=W4oMfxO9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This kick sends enemies flying, and it's so satisfying to use every time. It reminded me a little of the kick in&nbsp;<em>Bulletstorm</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> Hands-on Preview – Final Thoughts&nbsp;</h2>

<p>We're now two months out from <em>Shadows</em>' release on March 20. Granted, it used to be one month away until they delayed it (again). The delays made me raise an eyebrow, considering the larger implications of Ubisoft's current status in the market. I've written a lot about it <a href="https://magic.beehiiv.com/v1/271d2405-1f1f-4b77-938c-abc0f26d7327?email={{email}}" rel="nofollow">in our newsletter, if you haven't subscribed already</a>.</p>

<p>But I was pretty impressed with my 4 hours with Yasuke and Naoe. It felt like the best <em>Assassin's Creed</em> game I played in years, and aside from two visual/collision bugs, it ran pretty smoothly, despite being streamed across the internet (worth noting it was still a work-in-progress build, too). The setting is interesting, and the dichotomy between the two characters makes me rethink how to play these games.</p>

<p>However, I also walked away with one other conclusion: On the whole, this still feels like an <em>Assassin's Creed</em> game. I slotted into most of the gameplay loop easily, and while the new additions are nice quality-of-life changes, it still felt like a fairly known quantity—albeit a more refined version of it.</p>

Surgent Studios was founded by video game voice performer and on-screen actor Abubakar Salim. After launching <em>Tales of Kenzera</em>, an afro-futuristic metroidvania, the company was forced <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/takes-of-kenzera-zau-dev-surgent-studios-puts-entire-games-team-on-hiatus-due-to-lack-of-funding">to furlough its games division</a> due to lack of funding — a common occurrence that’s become endemic over the last two years.</p><p>The indie game space has not been insulated from the effects of the layoff crisis that’s plagued the game industry.

And even the publishers known for supporting quality indie games, like Annapurna Games, are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/9/12/24243317/annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-resigns">having a hard time staying in operation</a>. </p><p>However, Pocketpair Publishing joins a group of new companies that have entered the indie games space via non-traditional means.

Like Outersloth and Bigmode, Pocketpair Publishing is seeking to parlay its commercial success into an avenue for more indie games like <em>Palworld </em>to get made.</p><p>“Game development comes with many challenges,” said Pocketpair Publishing head John Buckley. “But we want to ease that process as much as possible and provide an environment where creators can pursue their dreams.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Where were you on October 11th last year? If you were Edwin, Brendy, or myself - which, statistically, you are not - you were writing news articles about one of three aspirant spiritual successors to detective <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>. It was an "I'm Spartacus"-ass day of press releases, culminating in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sure-why-not-third-group-of-former-disco-elysium-devs-announce-revolutionary-new-rpg-studio">announcement of a project</a> from former ZA/UM writers Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">Before that</a> came sci-fi RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/xxx-nightshift">XXX Nightshift</a>, and before <em>that</em> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">an unnamed "psychogeographic RPG"</a> from newly formed Longdue. We now know that it's called Hopetown, and Longdue are set to launch a crowdfunding campaign which you can "pre-register" for <a href="https://www.longduegames.com/">here</a>, should you wish. Here's the sell:</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote><p>Merging the raw emotional depth and psychological intricacy of Disco Elysium with the philosophical richness and narrative complexity of Planescape: Torment, this new psychological RPG invites players into an unforgettable world where stories are weapons, choices ripple through the environment, and light and darkness collide—not just between its denizens, but within them too.</p></blockquote>
<p>Contributors to the project include Piotr Sobolewsk, who worked on Disco Elysium's system design as part of support studio <a href="https://theknightsofu.com/projects/disco-elysium/">Knights Of Unity</a>. Longdue promise "more extraordinary talent set to be unveiled as part of the crowdfunding launch," having previously teased the contributions of mystery alumni from Bungie, Rockstar, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yes-your-grace">Yes, Your Grace</a>’s Brave At Night.</p><p>You'll be playing as a rogue journalist: "a chaotic, self-destructive provocateur who sees humanity as inherently selfish and cruel". Well, I <em>do</em> love to be told how I see humanity before making a single dialogue choice. "Unapologetically cynical and dangerously unhinged, you thrive on poking at bruises, pulling at loose threads, and watching what unravels."</p>
<p>So, how does old Funter S. Tedious here stand out from H.D.B? Here's a bit more on that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Meanwhile, a new journalism-based RPG system gives you the tools to craft stories that shape the world—and yourself. Will you embrace chaos as a gonzo journalist, spinning wild, attention-grabbing narratives? Will you twist reality as a conspiracist, bending events to suit your worldview? Or will you dig deep as a calculated investigator, exposing brutal truths to spark rebellion—or sow complacency?</p></blockquote>
<p>Is there a word for being interested but unenthusiastic at the same time? I should probably know one, but I'm afraid I'm simply too much of a cynical unhinged rogue gonzo bruise-poking provocateur to work on my vocabulary.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report">little primer</a> if you're looking to get up to speed on the messy events that transpired in the fallout of Disco Elysium's release. It's got everything: People being dicks to each other. People being cosmic megadicks to each other. People being ensorceled turbodicks to each other. The works.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Again</a></span>.</p><p>It’s clear that Ubisoft really needs a big win here and is betting a lot on <em>Shadows</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-release-date-star-wars-1851657285?_gl=1*we5t6x*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzU2OTE0NS4zMTQuMS4xNzM3NTgxOTgxLjU0LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-release-date-star-wars-1851657285?_gl=1*we5t6x*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzU2OTE0NS4zMTQuMS4xNzM3NTgxOTgxLjU0LjAuMA..">giving the devs as much time as possible</a></span> to make a great game that it hopes sells really, really well. So yeah, there’s a lot riding on this game. And while I can’t say, after my hands-on demo, whether or not the full game is going to be enough to help turn things around for Ubisoft, I’m at least convinced  that <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> could be a very good game. In fact, it might be <em>two </em>good games smashed into one package. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-red-release-date-trailer-1851479039?_gl=1*iv8elb*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQzODI0NS4xMjcuMS4xNzM2NDQzMzczLjQ0LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-red-release-date-trailer-1851479039?_gl=1*iv8elb*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQzODI0NS4xMjcuMS4xNzM2NDQzMzczLjQ0LjAuMA.."><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span><em> </em>is set in Japan during the 16th century, toward the end of the Sengoku period. During this time, Japan was rife with civil war and guns were becoming more common on the battlefield. As with many past <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games, <em>Shadows </em>features members of the Assassin Brotherhood fighting the Templars and their various proxies. </p><p>However, rather than the series’ ongoing, interconnected lore, my demo was focused mostly on the two main characters—Yasuke and Naoe—and their involvement in a war between clans and family. And after four hours of playing <em>Shadows </em>over a mostly stable livestream connection under the watchful eye of a Ubisoft representative, those two characters really stood out to me, not least because they offer two drastically different ways to play.</p><h2 id="h6066"><a id=""></a>A tale of two assassins</h2><p>First up, there’s Yasuke, a Black man who has made his way to Japan via Christian missionaries. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-who-is-yasuke-black-samurai-1851482754?_gl=1*6ey1xx*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQ0MTIzMS4yNTkuMC4xNzM2NDQxMjM5LjUyLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-who-is-yasuke-black-samurai-1851482754?_gl=1*6ey1xx*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQ0MTIzMS4yNTkuMC4xNzM2NDQxMjM5LjUyLjAuMA..">This character is based on a real person</a></span> from history, though the exact details have been changed to better fit the world of <em>Shadows</em>. And yeah, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/this-was-never-about-anything-other-than-hate-1851602820?_gl=1*158so5*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzU2OTE0NS4zMTQuMS4xNzM3NTgyNTE1LjUzLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/this-was-never-about-anything-other-than-hate-1851602820?_gl=1*158so5*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzU2OTE0NS4zMTQuMS4xNzM3NTgyNTE1LjUzLjAuMA..">a corner of the internet is angry about a black man being in <em>Shadows</em></a></span>. Who cares! Anyway, Yasuke is a tough, combat-focused character who plays a lot like the heroes from<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-origins-the-kotaku-review-1819862017&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-origins-the-kotaku-review-1819862017"><em>Assassin’s Creed Origins</em></a></span><em>, Odyssey, </em>and <em>Valhalla.</em> Yasuke can kick people across a room, break down doors, and wield large weapons against crowds of enemies. And while he can sneak around a bit and do some parkour, he’s slower and less effective at stealth than his counterpart. </p><p>On the flipside, you have Naoe, a ninja-like Assassin who plays a lot more like the heroes of older <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-assassins-creed-games-worst-to-best-1844019813?_gl=1*158so5*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzU2OTE0NS4zMTQuMS4xNzM3NTgyNTE1LjUzLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-assassins-creed-games-worst-to-best-1844019813?_gl=1*158so5*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzU2OTE0NS4zMTQuMS4xNzM3NTgyNTE1LjUzLjAuMA.."><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games</a></span>—stuff like <em>AC2, Rogue, </em>and <em>Unity. </em>Naoe is skilled at sneaking in an out of places and taking out people without anyone noticing. She’s also really fast and can easily scale walls and roofs in seconds. </p><p>In my time with <em>Shadows</em>, what surprised me the most was just how different the game felt depending on who you selected.</p><p>As Yasuke, I could do a bit of stealth to get into a base and then fight my way through using a big sword and abilities like a charge attack. He played a lot like a walking samurai tank; able to destroy enemies easily while taking a lot of damage. Naoe is the opposite.  Returning as Naoe to the small enemy base I’d previously ransacked as Yasuke was interesting. I could take advantage of all the shadows around the base more easily, hiding from enemies and taking them out with my hidden blade. I could escape quickly with smoke bombs, too. </p><p>As I bounced between the two characters, I got the sense that Ubisoft really wants this<em> Assassin’s Creed </em>entry to appeal to all of the franchise’s fans. Ever since <em>Origins</em>, which was a more RPG-focused action game compared to past titles, a split has developed between fans. There are those who like that type of action-focused game and others who miss the stealth gameplay of the older installments. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175">2023's <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em></a></span> was Ubisoft’s attempt to provide  those older fans with something that would make them happy, and it worked.  But <em>Mirage </em>might have scared away the players who want a big new open-world, RPG-style <em>Assassin’s Creed. </em></p><p>With <em>Shadows </em>and its two characters, Ubisoft is trying to merge both playstyles and fanbases into one big package. You love sneaking around and using a hidden blade? Play as Naoe! Prefer a big sword and large fights? Good news, you can play as Yasuke.</p><p> It’s a smart approach that worked shockingly well in my four-hour preview. At times I’d force myself to play as one or the other, and I was always able to  make progress regardless of the situation. And while there will be parts that force you to switch to one or the other, Ubisoft seems dedicated to mostly leaving the option of who to play as in the hands of players.</p><p>For those who want to frequently swap between both and enjoy everything the game has to offer, Ubisoft has your back. Every mission I played featured numerous points where I could swap between characters. And outside of quests, I was able to freely swap between Yasuke and Naoe as long as I wasn’t in combat. Ubisoft really, really wants everyone to be happy, and while that approach can sometimes lead to games that feel bland or sanded down, my admittedly limited demo left me with the feeling that in <em>Shadows</em>, it could work really well. </p><h2 id="h6067"><a id=""></a>Exploration, questing, and the open world</h2><p>Beyond the two-character approach, Ubisoft is also trying to encourage more exploration and a slower pace in <em>Shadows</em>.</p><p> Quests aren’t automatically marked on your map, for example, with the game instead encouraging you to read clues, explore the area, and find your next objective yourself. If that doesn’t sound like your cup of tea, however, you can also use scouts to find places to go, so there’s a way to skip the searching and get to the killing. Another example of Ubisoft trying to satisfy everyone. </p><p>Between those quests, I found a gorgeous world packed with a ton of detail. I came across some deer fighting in the woods, sneaked close to them, and was reward with some XP and a short cutscene of my character drawing the animals. Later, I cut my way through some bushes and discovered that a lot of stuff can be cut and destroyed in <em>Shadows</em>. Trees, bushes, paper doors, crates, and more are all dynamic and can be broken or sliced. Fighting some guards near a bush I was hiding in led to the bush getting cut up and me losing my sneaky spot. Oops! </p><p>Sadly, I was only granted access to a small section of what looks like a really big map to explore. But even so, there was some neat stuff to experience. I spent a lot of my time riding a horse, though you can walk around the map if you prefer. At one point I stumbled upon a challenge to hit targets with my bow while on horseback. Another time, I prayed at a small temple. Nothing mind-blowingly cool, but in general, I got the sense that <em>Shadows </em>wants you to slow down and poke around the world more than past <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>games. </p><p>My only major disappointment with the demo was that a lot of the quests boiled down to go somewhere, kill some stuff or sneak in, and then leave. Sprinkled between these moments were cutscenes that featured dialogue choices and I did enjoy these moments as I got to better define Yasuke and Naoe. But the quests weren’t that memorable, and I worry that trying to support two very different characters might prove tricky when it comes to designing engaging and varied missions. </p><p>We’ll have to wait and see if the rest of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-base-building-rpg-settlement-1851655892&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-base-building-rpg-settlement-1851655892"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span> has more interesting missions and if the slower pace and dual-character approach works in the long run. I’m not sure<em> Shadows </em>is the game that will save Ubisoft, mainly because I’m not sure one single game can do that. But it might be the game that finally unites the <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>fanbase, and that would be impressive, too.</p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 20. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-ac-shadows-ps4-xbox-one-next-gen-only-1851479764&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-ac-shadows-ps4-xbox-one-next-gen-only-1851479764">It will be the first game in the franchise to skip PS4 in over a decade.</a></span></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gray-zone-warfare-turned-heads-in-2024-%E2%80%93-what%E2%80%99s-next-for-the-tactical-shooter.1090059/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-whats-next/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Gray Zone Warfare was released in April 2024, and while the launch was ‘far from flawless’ (as the dev says), it made a splash in the tactical shooter scene and attracted stacks of players. It stormed up the charts on streaming platforms, and as 2024 unravelled, MADFINGER Games coaxed the game into a better space.</p>



<p>Today, Gray Zone Warfare has sold more than 1.5 million units, and at the peak, 322,600 players were concurrently exploring this open-world, intense game. In a recent press release, MADFINGER doubled back to look at the game’s performance in 2024 before dipping into what comes next for Gray Zone Warfare.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-build-the-game-with-them">‘Build the Game with Them’</h2>



<p>In a recent press release, MADFINGER Games said they invite ‘you to build the game with them’. In the months ahead, Gray Zone Warfare will receive two major updates, introducing key elements like deeper and richer PvP content and a dynamic weather system.</p>



<p>It was just weeks ago that MADFINGER rolled out the Night Ops update, which was a pivotal point for the game that pushed it into new territory in terms of review sentiment on Steam.</p>



<p>Through 2024, MADFINGER Games fixed 2163 bugs, according to data revealed in the aforementioned press release. Many of these fixes were spread across the 19 releases pushed throughout the year.</p>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare isn’t your average tactical shooter. It blends a few genres, offering players a unique ‘extraction shooter’ feel in a wide, open world that isn’t bound by a raid timer. It has survival elements, including health mechanics, weight management,  and the need to stay fed and watered.</p>



<p>Players are invited to join factions, spawning at a starting base that they’ll use to get kitted, call in a helicopter, and jet off across the map – a fictional, sprawling world called Lamang. It’s visually sumptuous and intense, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I had the chance to play it</a> before it landed in early access last year. I loved every minute.</p>



<p>If you want to give Gray Zone Warfare a try, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2479810/Gray_Zone_Warfare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pick up a copy on Steam</a>.

A crowdfunding campaign is planned, with a limited number of registrations for its pre-launch now available via the studio’s <a href="https://longduegames.com/" target="_blank">official website</a>. <span id="more-939677"></span></p><p>“Having overseen the team of 15 that was credited with ‘saving’ <em>Disco Elysium</em> and which worked on it for nearly six years, pre- and post-release, I’m excited to work with the Longdue team to create a rich RPG experience to serve fans of the genre,” said contributor Piotr Sobolewsk in a press release.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Merging the raw emotional depth and psychological intricacy of <em>Disco Elysium</em> with the philosophical richness and narrative complexity of <em>Planescape: Torment</em>, this new psychological RPG invites players into an unforgettable world where stories are weapons, choices ripple through the environment, and light and darkness collide—not just between its denizens, but within them too.</p><p>Contributors include Piotr Sobolewsk, who previously oversaw pivotal contributions to the core systems that defined <em>Disco Elysium</em>. These groundbreaking mechanics, celebrated for their depth and ingenuity, reimagined how <a title="Genres > RPG [16,943 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a> handle narrative, choice, and player agency.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Now, Piotr is building on those foundations, applying the lessons learned from <em>Disco Elysium</em> to help the Longdue team craft bold, innovative designs at the heart of <em>Hopetown</em>—shaping a new vision for what narrative-driven RPGs can achieve.</p><p>In <em>Hopetown</em>, words are your deadliest weapon, and every choice leaves its mark. Set in a mining town caught between decay and transformation, shaped by ambition, exploitation, and the fragile systems that bind society together, you step into the role of a rogue journalist—a chaotic, self-destructive provocateur who sees humanity as inherently selfish and cruel. Unapologetically cynical and dangerously unhinged, you thrive on poking at bruises, pulling at loose threads, and watching what unravels.</p><p><strong>A Town of Contrasts</strong></p><p>The town itself is an arena of extremes. The suffocating darkness of the mine’s depths mirrors the buried truths of its inhabitants, while the surface world—glittering with the promise of progress—is steeped in corruption and power plays. It’s a place where <a title="Genres > Survival [370 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> depends on who controls the story, and where every decision ripples outward, reshaping not just the world, but yourself.</p><p><strong>Groundbreaking Mechanics</strong></p><p>Building on the legacies of <em>Disco Elysium</em> and <em>Planescape: Torment</em>, <em>Hopetown</em> introduces systems that redefine player agency. The psychogeography system transforms how players interact with the game world: emotions, memories, and conversations replace traditional mechanics like keys and levers, becoming the tools that unlock doors, alter landscapes, and reshape relationships. Progress isn’t just about solving puzzles or finding items—it’s about navigating the protagonist’s fractured psyche and the ripples it creates in the environment.</p><p>Meanwhile, a new journalism-based RPG system gives you the tools to craft stories that shape the world—and yourself. Will you embrace chaos as a gonzo journalist, spinning wild, attention-grabbing narratives? Will you twist reality as a conspiracist, bending events to suit your worldview? Or will you dig deep as a calculated investigator, exposing brutal truths to spark rebellion—or sow complacency?</p><p><strong>A Crucible of Choices</strong></p><p>The mining town is more than a setting—it’s a crucible. What truths will you reveal? What lies will you tell? Will your words inspire hope or destruction? Will you reshape the systems of power, or will they consume you?</p><p><strong>Every Word Matters</strong></p><p>This is a game where everything transforms everything else. Every word you choose matters. Every decision carries weight. And every story you tell changes the world—and the fragile systems that hold it together.</p><p><strong>Why Back <em>Hopetown</em>?</strong></p><p>Backing Hopetown isn’t just about funding—it’s about building a community, backing a vision and casting a vote. Longdue is an independent studio daring to create the kinds of games bigger studios won’t or can’t make—games that challenge their players and let players challenge the games back. With Hopetown, Longdue is building a movement for <em>Disco Elysidum</em>-like narrative-driven RPGs that don’t shy away from complexity, emotion, or ambition.</p><p>Those who register in time for the pre-launch crowdfunding campaign via <a href="https://longduegames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Longdue’s website</a> will gain first access to a limited number of rewards that will be available privately shortly before the crowdfunding campaign goes public.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Contributors from <em>Disco Elysium</em></strong> – Seven people who worked on Disco Elysium across production, narrative and writing, world design, sound, audio, and technical design have contributed to <em>Hopetown</em> to date, bringing their expertise, learnings, and knowledge to this bold new project.</li><li><strong>An All-Star Team of RPG Talent</strong> – Supported by industry veterans with credits on <em><a title="Games > Cult of the Lamb [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/cult-of-the-lamb">Cult of the Lamb</a></em>, <em>The Witcher</em> universe, <em>Yes, Your Grace</em>, and more, Longdue is combining the raw creative energy of <em>Disco Elysium</em> with the best talent in the RPG space to deliver something truly extraordinary.</li><li><strong>A Spiritual <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [97 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>or</strong> – Drawing inspiration from the narrative depth of <em>Disco Elysium</em> and the philosophical complexity of <em>Planescape: Torment</em>, <em>Hopetown</em> redefines what a psychological RPG can achieve.</li><li><strong>Groundbreaking Mechanics</strong> – Introducing innovative systems like psychogeography, where emotions and memories reshape the world, and a journalism RPG system, which empowers players to craft stories that influence perception, inspire rebellion, or enforce complacency.</li></ul></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Independent studio Longdue has shed more light on its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> spiritual successor, now officially known as Hopetown.</p>
<p>Londue comprises former staff from Disco Elysium, as well as industry veterans with credits on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cult-of-the-lamb">Cult of the Lamb</a> and The Witcher universe. The studio's debut project was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-in-development-from-leads-of-cancelled-sequel">first teased towards the end of last year</a>, although details remained scant.</p>
<p>Now, Longdue has announced the crowdfunding pre-launch for Hopetown, a game it says will redefine "the psychological RPG genre with groundbreaking mechanics and a world shaped by your words".</p>

<p>Want to know more? Well, words are your "deadliest weapon" in Hopetown, and the choices you make will leave their mark.</p>
<p>"Set in a mining town caught between decay and transformation, shaped by ambition, exploitation, and the fragile systems that bind society together, you step into the role of a rogue journalist - a chaotic, self-destructive provocateur who sees humanity as inherently selfish and cruel," reads the official blurb. "Unapologetically cynical and dangerously unhinged, you thrive on poking at bruises, pulling at loose threads, and watching what unravels."</p>
<p>As far as those aforementioned and groundbreaking mechanics, these have been built on those from Disco Elysium and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planescape-torment">Planescape: Torment</a>. In Hopetown, there will be systems that the developer stated will "redefine player agency".</p>
<p>"The psychogeography system transforms how players interact with the game world: emotions, memories, and conversations replace traditional mechanics like keys and levers, becoming the tools that unlock doors, alter landscapes, and reshape relationships," Longdue explained. "Progress isn't just about solving puzzles or finding items - it's about navigating the protagonist's fractured psyche and the ripples it creates in the environment."</p>
<p>Hopetown will also have a new journalism-based RPG system in place. This system will give you the "tools to craft stories that shape the world - and yourself".</p>
<p>As shared by Longdue, there are currently a limited number of registrations for the pre-launch available at <a href="http://www.longduegames.com/">www.longduegames.com</a>. Those that register early will be able to get first access to a limited set of backer rewards when the campaign goes live.</p>

Ubisoft has detailed the various steps it took to improve <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> during the game's high-profile four-month delay from last October to (after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">further date change</a>) its now-final release on 20th March. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer's Katharine Castle in Quebec, members of Shadows' development team confirmed the game's narrative had not seen any adjustments, with improvements focused on systems and gameplay.
</p>
<p>
"There's a lot of things across the board," game director Charles Benoit told Eurogamer, "the progression, how we tweak the systems, tutorials, the feeling of hitting with the sword, FX camera. So a lot of small details, but overall makes the experience better."

<p>
Benoit went on to give a clear example of one such change, which involved parkour atop the game's Japanese roof architecture. 
</p>
<p>
"The roofs [have] so much detail with a lot of different parts here and there," Benoit said. "Before the push [into 2025] the parkour worked, but going on a beam stance and then transition[ing], it didn't feel fluid enough. So we did a lot of tweaking on how we create the collision and everything. The parkour is a lot more fluid, the transition is faster."
</p>
<p>
Asked if any story elements in Shadows had changed based on feedback to the game's early marketing, associate narrative director Brooke Davies confirmed they had not.
</p>
<p>
"No, we did not [change anything]," Davies said. "The extra time was used for polish on gameplay."

Read on for our thoughts of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">how Assassin's Creed Shadows is shaping up to be the series' biggest shake-up in years</a>, plus deeper dives into its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-turned-my-assassins-creed-shadows-hideout-into-a-personal-cat-and-tanuki-sanctuary-human-allies-be-damned">all-new base-building gameplay</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animus-hub-revealed-ubisofts-new-assassins-creed-start-screen-and-modern-day-story-wrapper-thats-definitely-not-just-another-launcher">mysterious Animus Hub</a>.
</p><p>Last year, Assassin's Creed franchise boss Marc-Alexis Coté said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality">the delay to Shadows had been necessary to  change the "narrative" of Ubisoft's "inconsistency in quality"</a>. Speaking at an event attended by Eurogamer, Coté acknowledged his team had "only... one shot" at ensuring the game was successful from launch.</p>

But it’s not just layoffs–it’s a pivot, which as CNN heads have laid it out might sound familiar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/business/media/cnn-layoffs-mark-thompson.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a> with Ben Mullin of The New York Times, CNN boss Mark Thompson said that “If we do not follow the audiences to the new platforms with real conviction and scale, our future prospects will not be good.” What are those new platforms? A new streaming service that I guess is <em>not</em> the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-arts-and-entertainment-david-zaslav-031d6ae5e126c196ee09668f9b83502d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brief-lived</a> CNN+. A soon-to-be-revealed “lifestyle” product that Mullin wrote will focus on “food and fitness,” following along after <a href="https://digiday.com/media/how-publishers-are-strategizing-for-a-second-trump-administration-softer-news-and-more-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other outlets</a> who seem to have suddenly realized that audiences are real human beings with lives outside of the news.</p><p>Mullin wrote that CNN has also been prioritizing vertical video and “eventually plans to publish 50 to 100 of these videos per day.” Mullin wrote that CNN has</p><blockquote><p>also been prototyping a new video news service that allows users to swipe through vertical videos as they do on apps like TikTok and Instagram. Mr. Thompson said it’s not clear yet whether that will exist as a stand-alone product or as a section of CNN’s mobile app.</p><p>“You can use your thumb to flick from a CNN news story to a CNN anchor to a reporter,” Mr. Thompson said. “That’s a really interesting experiment.”</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Calling the format every floundering legacy outlet is chasing “an interesting experiment” made me scream and run circles around my apartment. It feels to me like every outlet with an aging audience gets as far as “young people are always on their phones” and decides to pilfer the aesthetics of short-form video without ever being able to crack exactly <em>why</em> so many people get their news in those formats. It is, at least in part, the strong perspective of video personalities that audiences come for, for better and worse; outlets brain-pilled by <a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/a-test-of-the-news-wesley-lowery-objectivity.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the myth of journalistic objectivity</a> aren’t going to rack up the views by putting their same out-of-touch content in 9:16.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/cnn-layoffs-cuts-hundreds-jobs-major-restructuring-1236068690/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memo to staff</a>, Thompson mentioned a “further major pivot to digital video,” inclusive of the lifestyle product, “working with News to innovate in our multimedia storytelling capabilities,” and changes to ads. “Pivot to video” is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_to_video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">phrase</a> that strikes fear into the heart of anyone who’s worked in digital media in the last 10 years, one that saw all of us chasing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/facebook-knew-ad-metrics-were-inflated-but-ignored-the-problem-lawsuit-claims.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflated</a> Facebook video numbers that ultimately crumbled and cost countless journalists their jobs. Thompson has, to his credit, innovated on making the same mistake as so many outlets before him by throwing the words "major" and “digital” into the phrase. </p><p>And of course, all of this is requiring layoffs, the oldest play in the media book. CNN projects to cut around 200 roles while also, in another classic move, looking to hire. All of us have been here before, so many times, our livelihoods in the hands of bosses who seem to have no idea what audiences really want, who only know how to chase after tired trends while costing journalists their jobs. As CNN’s Brian Stelter wrote in today’s “<a href="https://view.newsletters.cnn.com/messages/1737637981000fd2c87f5e074/raw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reliable Sources</a>” newsletter, “it's the names you don't know – producers and technicians and editors – who really power news networks. CNN staffers have been expecting layoffs for months, so today is going to be an emotional day.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/youtube-inspiration-tab-ai-slop"><h3>YouTube’s New AI Is Inspiring Content Creators To Make Their Videos Boring</h3></a><p>Once again asking, begging, perhaps even pleading the question "Who is this for"</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-stepping-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros. Games head David Haddad is to leave his position after 12 years, according to a new report. His successor has not yet been appointed.</p>

<p>According to a Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Haddad plans to stay on with Warner Bros. Games for a three-month period while the company searches for a successor. He'll also be helping to oversee the transition to said successor, which is pretty standard behavior for departing corporate execs.</p>

<p>Streaming and games head JB Perrette says Haddad's departure comes at a time when the company's "release schedule is lighter", which, Perrette says, will help "minimize disruption" and allow the WB Games team to "smoothly prepare for its next record-breaking title".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-suicide-squad.jpg?itok=8nNMI2tm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-suicide-squad.jpg?itok=cOthYWxV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>David Haddad, who oversaw the release of games like&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>during his tenure, is leaving Warner Bros. Games.</figcaption></figure><p>Later today, Perrette and Haddad will hold a town hall meeting to brief WB Games employees on Haddad's decision and provide additional information.</p>

<p>Variety, citing a source "close to the situation", says that there aren't any plans for the wider Warner Bros. to sell off its gaming division, and that the goal is to focus on finding a replacement for Haddad.</p>

<p>Unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/plaion-koch-media-ceo-stepping-down" rel="nofollow">other execs</a> who have recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insomniac-ceo-founder-ted-price-steps-down" rel="nofollow">departed their companies</a>, Haddad won't be retiring full stop; he says he's looking forward to the "next chapter" of his career and that he will continue to enthusiastically support the studio's future work.</p>

<p>While Haddad's departure may have been voluntary, he and WB Games haven't had the best year on the whole. February's&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>served as the company's flagship title for the year, but it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">performed disastrously</a>, contributing to a massive writedown for Warner Bros.</p>

<p><em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>wasn't the only failure for Warner Bros. this year, either; the full release of fighting game&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">proved a disastrous flop</a>, costing the company $100 million.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-warner-bros-games-david-haddad.jpg?itok=f9_zYjwX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-warner-bros-games-david-haddad.jpg?itok=XxdEgnYI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Haddad also oversaw successes like&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Suicide Squad</em> and&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>&nbsp;may have been a failure (and one that reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow">contributed to layoffs</a> at developer Rocksteady), but Haddad also oversaw massive successes at WB Games during his tenure.</p>

<p>Wizarding World RPG&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>has proven an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">enduring commercial hit</a> for the company, and it was also revealed recently that fighting game&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-sales" rel="nofollow">passed the five million sales mark</a>.</p>

Perennial favorites like <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> (2013) and <em>Minecraft </em>(2011) always show up on these lists, but single-player RPGs like <em>Elden Ring</em> (2022) and <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> (2023) are now too. In fact if you remove the EA Sports MVP Bundle, which includes <em>Madden 25 </em>and <em>Sports FC 25</em>,  games already on the list elsewhere, then over a third of the top-20 list includes old games:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></li><li><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em></li><li><em>Helldivers II </em></li><li><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero </em></li><li><em>NBA 2K25 </em></li><li><em>Madden NFL 25</em></li><li><strong><em> Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III (2023) </em></strong></li><li><em>EA Sports FC 25 </em></li><li><strong><em>Elden Ring </em></strong></li><li><em>EA Sports MVP Bundle </em></li><li><strong><em>Hogwarts Legacy </em></strong></li><li><em>Dragon’s Dogma II </em></li><li><em>WWE 2K24 </em></li><li><em>MLB: The Show 24 </em></li><li><strong><em>Grand Theft Auto V </em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Minecraft </em></strong></li><li><em>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth </em></li><li><em>Tekken 8 </em></li><li><strong><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 </em></strong></li><li><strong><em>NBA2K24</em></strong>﻿</li></ol></blockquote><p>It’s hard to come up with any unifying theory of why these seven games (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-20-best-selling-games-of-2023-in-the-us.816495/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-20-best-selling-games-of-2023-in-the-us.816495/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three more than 2023</a></span>) remained such huge sellers last year. Annual sports games like <em>NBA 2K24</em> and <em>Call of Duty</em>’s unparalleled popularity have historically helped them stick around months after release. <em>GTA V</em> is required to play<em> GTA Online</em>, which continues to be one of the most popular multiplayer games, and the launch of <em>GTA VI </em>is closer than ever. And every year there’s a new generation of kids getting hooked on <em>Minecraft</em>. </p><p><em>Elden Ring</em> was no doubt helped by its GOTY contender expansion,<em> Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, coming out in 2024. And <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>? Well, who knows. It hit Switch in late 2023 and finally started getting its price slashed in half during recent sales. <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, meanwhile, seems like people’s go-to game when they upgrade to a PS5 for the first time.</p><p>Other notable takeaways from last year’s best-selling games are that not a single Nintendo first-party game charted, a testament to what a week year overall it was for the console despite a late breakout in <em>Mario Party Jamboree</em>. <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> didn’t chart at all either. In fact a Ubisoft game hasn’t charted in the top 10 since 2020's <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em>, no doubt part of its calculous in delaying <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> a second time for extra polish as the family-owned publisher battles for survival. </p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> was another high-profile absence. In addition to not making the list despite its predecessor eventually selling over 10 million, it wasn’t a top-20 best-selling game for December 2024 either, less than two months after it launched. Publisher EA <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released its preliminary financial early pointing</a></span> to the action-RPG coming in severely under expectations with 1.5 million players for the quarter, 50 percent below its forecast. Whether that was an unrealistic goal to make up for the game’s notoriously long and difficult development cycle is another matter. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nvidia is releasing its new GeForce RTX 5090 graphics cards on January 30, and with it comes the release of the next generation of Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS). On Thursday, CD Projekt Red released a new update for Cyberpunk 2077 to account for the new technology, making it the first game to officially support DLSS 4.</p>



<p>With support for DLSS 4 being added, Cyberpunk 2077 will allow the use of Nvidia’s new multi-frame generation technology that is launching exclusively for the next-gen RTX 50 series graphics cards. This technology helps with overall performance using AI to generate more frames while you play.</p>



<p>In addition to Cyberpunk 2077, DLSS 4 will be available with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dlss-4-to-launch-with-support-for-75-games-and-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at least 75 games</a> when it launches.</p>



<p>You can check out the PC-specific notes from CD Projekt Red below.</p>



<ul>
<li>Added support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards, which boosts FPS by using AI to generate up to three times per traditionally rendered frame – enabled with GeForce RTX 50 Series on January 30th. DLSS 4 also introduces faster single Frame Generation with reduced memory usage for RTX 50 and 40 Series. Additionally, you can now choose between the CNN model or the new Transformer model for DLSS Ray Reconstruction, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLAA on all GeForce RTX graphics cards today. The new Transformer model enhances stability, lighting, and detail in motion.</li>



<li>Fixed artifacts and smudging on in-game screens when using DLSS Ray Reconstruction.</li>



<li>The Frame Generation field in Graphics settings will now properly reset after switching Resolution Scaling to OFF.</li>
</ul>



<p>Are you going to pick up a new RTX 50 series GPU when they launch to take advantage of the new features in games like Cyberpunk 2077?&nbsp;Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1336/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Like many of you, I don’t have much time these days to invest hundreds of hours into a single game. I usually run through a new release, play the campaign once, and enjoy multiplayer wherever possible. But when it comes to role-playing games, I can’t help myself. I collect them, leaving many in my backlog for a rainy day. Well, 2025 will be another big year for RPGs, with titles such as Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and The First Berserker: Khazan on the way!</p>



<h2 id="h-upcoming-rpgs-in-2025-with-release-dates">Upcoming RPGs in 2025 – With Release Dates!</h2>



<p>First and foremost, it’s important to note that we don’t have official release dates for every RPG mentioned here. As such, many of them may be pushed out of 2025 to 2026 and beyond. For titles like The Elder Scrolls VI and The Witcher 4, we’re not even going to bother mentioning them past this point, as there’s no way they’ll realistically launch this year.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tales of Grace f Remastered – January 17</strong></li>



<li><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth – January 23</strong></li>



<li><strong>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector – January 23</strong></li>



<li><strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 – February 4</strong></li>



<li><strong>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II – February 14</strong></li>



<li><strong>Avowed – February 18</strong></li>



<li><strong>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii – February 21</strong></li>



<li><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds – February 28</strong></li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows – March 20</strong></li>



<li><strong>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land – March 21</strong></li>



<li><strong>The First Berserker: Khazan – March 27</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma – May 30</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-upcoming-rpgs-without-release-dates">Upcoming RPGs Without Release Dates</h2>



<p>Several upcoming role-playing games are rumored to be released in 2025, though there are no specific release dates yet. It’s still early in the year, so fingers crossed!</p>



<ul>
<li>ArcheAge Chronicles</li>



<li>Borderlands 4</li>



<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li>



<li>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</li>



<li>Fable</li>



<li>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</li>



<li>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</li>



<li>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</li>



<li>Wuchang: Fallen Fathers</li>
</ul>



<p>Oh, and here’s hoping we see Black Myth: Wukong on Xbox Series X|S this year, too!</p>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Warner Bros. Games [641 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> president David Hadddad will step down after 12 years of leading the company’s interactive entertainment division, the company announced. <span id="more-940031"></span></p><p>Haddad will stay on board with the company for the next three months as parent company Warner Bros. Discovery seeks his replacement and to help oversee the transition.</p><p>“David has thoughtfully and purposefully chosen a time when our release schedule is lighter which will help minimize disruption to our ongoing projects and strategic plans and allow this team to smoothly prepare for its next record-breaking title,” Warner Bros. Discovery global streaming and games CEO and president JB Perrette said, via <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Variety</a>.</p><p>Haddad commented, “I am so proud of everything we’ve accomplished together at Warner Bros. Games during my time with the company. It has been an absolute pleasure working on and building our iconic gaming franchises, and I will continue to be an enthusiastic supporter of this talented team’s future endeavors. I look forward to working on the next chapter of my career and will always be grateful for my time with Warner Bros. Games.”</p><p>Here is the full internal note sent to staff from Perrette announcing Haddad’s exit:</p><blockquote><p>Global Games Team,</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>I wanted to share with you the news that after 12 incredible years leading [Warner Bros. Discovery] Games, David Haddad has decided to depart the company.</p><p>On behalf of David Zaslav and all of us at WBD, I want to express my deepest gratitude to David for his phenomenal work and passion during his time here. With the support and incredible efforts of this whole team, David has led WB Games to numerous accomplishments over the years, both creatively and commercially. His vision, talent and passion have helped build one of the most successful and admired gaming companies in the industry and navigated some of the biggest changes and challenges as well.</p><p>From transitioning a physical software company into a digital-first gaming operation to organically building a successful <a title="Genres > Free-to-Play [360 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/free-to-play">free-to-play</a> mobile business to developing and publishing multiple billion-dollar games and franchises—including <em><a title="Games > Hogwarts Legacy [25 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a></em>, <em>Game of Thrones Conquest</em>, and <em>Golf Clash</em>—to delighting more Mortal Kombat fans than any time in the franchise’s 30+ year history, the journey has been nothing short of extraordinary.</p><p>David has thoughtfully and purposefully chosen a time when our release schedule is lighter which will help minimize disruption to our ongoing projects and strategic plans and allow this team to smoothly prepare for its next record-breaking title. David has also graciously agreed to stay on through the next three months as we kick-off a search to fill this important leadership role and will help ensure a smooth transition. This transition period will also provide me with additional opportunities to engage directly with the Games leadership, and I look forward to getting even more immersed with all of you and in this incredible business.</p><p>I fully appreciate that particularly after 12 years with the same leader and boss, change can be hard and uncomfortable (in our industry and at WBD we have certainly had our fair share). But it also brings opportunity, a chance for healthy new perspectives, and the ability to create the next incredible chapter for our fans and business… and I’m excited to embark on that with you.</p><p>I’m sure you have many questions due to this news, so David and I will be gathering with you at the scheduled Town Hall shortly. You may have more questions than we have answers right now, but we want to respond to what we can.</p><p>Thankfully we will have some more time to celebrate and thank David, but I know you’ll join me in this initial congratulations and thank you for this remarkable chapter he has led.</p><p>—JB</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/criticdb-announced-beyond-traditional-aggregation</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-aggregation-platform-criticdb-wants-to-go-beyond-traditional-aggregation.1089954/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/criticdb-announced-beyond-traditional-aggregation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TechRaptor's very own Rutledge Daugette, along with several other members of the editorial team at our lovely little site, have announced CriticDB, a brand new review aggregator site that plans to "go beyond" traditional aggregation.</p>

<p>Rutledge describes <a href="https://criticdb.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CriticDB</a> as a "new video game review aggregation and game discovery platform". As you've probably guessed from that, it'll aim not only to aggregate professional reviews, but also to help you find games you might have missed.</p>

<p>At launch, the site will aggregate over 75 outlets' reviews (and that includes us here at TechRaptor, of course), and the team anticipates it will launch with more than 20,000 reviews across over 2,000 game pages.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/criticdb-game-page-lies-of-p.jpg?itok=quPyEsCI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/criticdb-game-page-lies-of-p.jpg?itok=sepylObG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll be able to check out over 2,000 game pages at launch on CriticDB.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Rutledge's brief, CriticDB puts three pillars at the center of its mission:</p>

<ul><li>Collecting reviews and previews from around the web</li>
	<li>Connecting gamers with games they might have missed</li>
	<li>Helping outlets and PR to connect more easily</li>
</ul><p>Rutledge also says he wants the site to be a "positive force in the industry", highlighting "great work and games" that may otherwise go unnoticed. The site is also geared towards its users; the point is to create a "community-driven" platform.</p>

<p>On CriticDB, you'll be able to browse professional and user reviews (although Rutledge says user reviews will only be submittable by those who subscribe to the paid Pro user tier), follow outlets and creators, and create lists with various different parameters.</p>

<p>Those lists include favorites, wishlists, and even played and beaten games, so it looks like CriticDB might also be gunning for the crowns of the likes of Backloggd.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/criticdb-search-function-insert.jpg?itok=69Dilk6P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/criticdb-search-function-insert.jpg?itok=Gk88Z9KE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>CriticDB will feature a robust search function as well as plenty of user-centric features.</figcaption></figure><p>CriticDB users can create game pages for titles that are missing from the site's database, and they can also create links between similar games, helping other users to find games in their niche. Leaderboards will be available for users who create and link the most games, too.</p>

<p>Game pages consist of info like game release dates, listings for developers and publishers, and genres, as well as which platforms you can play the game on. Naturally, you'll also find CriticDB's signature "similar games" list, which will, if all goes well, have been at least partially curated by the site's community.</p>

<p>If you've ever found yourself wanting to find certain outlets, such as minority-owned platforms or independent sites, CriticDB will feature outlet tags to let you search for specific terms as well.</p>

<p>When it comes to the platform's future, Rutledge says the new site has a "robust roadmap" through which it will "expand...its features" throughout 2025. Some of the features coming to the platform include the following:</p>

<ul><li>An XP system and&nbsp;badges for profiles</li>
	<li>Outlet and&nbsp;author following</li>
	<li>On-site notifications for new releases of your wishlisted games and&nbsp;more</li>
</ul><p>If you're an outlet or a creator, you can also apply to be included on the platform when the <a href="https://criticdb.com/" rel="nofollow">review aggregation platform</a> launches on January 30th, so make sure you add it to your bookmarks for then.</p>
