            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>God of War&nbsp;</em>TV series showrunner Ronald D. Moore has revealed some more info about what we can expect from the upcoming video game adaptation, but it's probably going to be a while before you can watch it.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ronald-d-moore-discusses-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-the-tone-of-the-show-is-trying-to-emulate-the-tone-of-the-game-sdcc-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, Moore confirmed that the show will adapt the Norse stories featured in 2018's&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>and 2021's&nbsp;<em>Ragnarok</em>, since Kratos and his son Atreus will form the core duo at the heart of the show.</p>

<p>Moore says the tone of the show will "emulate the tone of the game", depicting an "epic journey" that's also a "heartfelt story of...two men" setting out to "honor the memory of [Kratos'] wife, Atreus' mother". It sounds, then, like the first season will be a pretty direct adaptation of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/god-of-war-2018" rel="nofollow">the 2018 title</a>.</p>

<p>Moore refused to be drawn on how many seasons the&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>TV show would span, however. He says he's focusing on the task at hand rather than looking too far into the future, so we don't know how long the show will run.</p>

<p>He does, however, confirm that filming hasn't yet started on&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>, and that the process is unlikely to begin until next year at the very earliest. Sounds like it's going to be quite a while before&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>comes to Prime Video, then.</p>

No third game in the Norse series has been confirmed, and it was reported back in January that Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow">had canceled</a> an in-development live-service&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>spinoff.</p>

<p>Ronald D. Moore's&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>show is set to debut on Prime Video at some point in the future. Here's hoping Kratos' companions <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-please-shut-up-mod" rel="nofollow">are a little more muted</a> than they are in 2021's&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>.</p>

We’re halfway through now, though, and things feel dramatically different.

The company is hiring for a senior director of multiplatform and account management, which is a fancy way of saying someone who will help Sony profit from bringing its games to more storefronts. This person will be in charge of “global commercial strategy for PlayStation Studios software titles across all digital platforms beyond PlayStation hardware, including Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox, Nintendo, and mobile.”</p><p>Fans are already treating this as a window into Sony’s thinking moving forward, including the possibility of it bringing more of its own first-party exclusives to other platforms, something that seemed unthinkable even just a few months ago. The job listing for the multiplatform leadership role goes on to say, “Oversee the out-of-year (mid-range) commercial strategy for PlayStation Studios titles across all non-PlayStation platforms, driving long-term revenue growth and audience reach.” It also lists direct reports that include people overseeing sales on both Xbox &amp; PC.</p><p>Sony’s multiplatform approach began small with bringing big single-player exclusives like <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> and<em> Days Gone </em>to PC years after they were out on console. <em>MLB: The Show</em> is also on Xbox Series X/S and Switch, though it’s published by MLB on those platforms. Upcoming Bungie shooter<em> Marathon</em> is also multiplatform. Then last fall, Sony announced the <em>Horizon </em>Lego spin-off, <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>, for both PS5 and Switch. And just this month, Sony revealed it will <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573?_gl=1*q9wu73*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3MDQ1NzEkbzEyOSRnMSR0MTc1MzcwOTY4NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573?_gl=1*q9wu73*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3MDQ1NzEkbzEyOSRnMSR0MTc1MzcwOTY4NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">publish <em>Helldivers 2</em> on Xbox Series X/S</a></span>. The new job listing, however, suggests things won’t stop there, and that this may be a reaction to more than just Microsoft bailing on the hardware race. </p><p>The tech giant has been on an accelerated course due to the struggling sales of Xbox this generation. Its multiplatform strategy began with  reversing course on taking games exclusive and announcing ports of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-exclusivity-business-update-ps5-hi-fi-rush-1851261518?_gl=1*q9wu73*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3MDQ1NzEkbzEyOSRnMSR0MTc1MzcwOTY4NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-exclusivity-business-update-ps5-hi-fi-rush-1851261518?_gl=1*q9wu73*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3MDQ1NzEkbzEyOSRnMSR0MTc1MzcwOTY4NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA."><em>Grounded</em>, <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, and <em>Pentiment</em></a></span> as trial balloons to test the response from prospective players on PS5 and Nintendo Switch. A year later, <em>Forza Horizon 5 </em>has made the jump, and <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> will bring the Locust-chain-sawing  shooter franchise to Sony’s platform almost 20 years after it became synonymous with Xbox. What’s more, monthly sales charts show these ported exclusives, including <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, are selling great on its long-time rival’s platform. </p><p>One way to view rumblings that Sony will look to bring more of its games to other platforms is as a direct reaction to Microsoft essentially throwing in the towel on exclusivity. But ballooning blockbuster development budgets and stagnating console sales—PS5 isn’t surging past PS4, thanks to lost ground by Xbox—suggests Sony is looking for more ways to profit off its games regardless of what competitors do. <em>Helldivers 2</em> makes it easy to draw the current line at just multiplayer live service games, but if Sony really does see Xbox as becoming indistinguishable from a gaming PC in the future (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000">complete with access to Steam</a></span>), it’s not hard to see it replicating its single-player blockbuster strategy on Xbox as well.</p><figure id="" data-id="8f2e1b334f891fdb36d4956d7f66c905" data-recommend-id="image://8f2e1b334f891fdb36d4956d7f66c905" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Helldivers fight below Xbox logos.

But another might simply be that people don’t buy consoles that way anymore. “People who buy a hardware system these days, they’re doing it because of the ecosystem, because of their friends list,” Circna gaming research director Mat Piscatella <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/bringing-your-games-to-other-platforms&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/bringing-your-games-to-other-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>The Game Business</em></a></span> last week. “You’re not going to get people to transition consoles because of exclusives anymore. We’re way beyond that point.”</p><p>It was a version of what Phil Spencer admitted in 2023 at what now appears to have been an important inflection point for Xbox. “There is no world where <em>Starfield </em>is an 11/10 and people start selling their PS5s,” he told<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446"> the<em> Kinda Funny </em>podcast</a></span> at the time. “That’s not going to happen.” He went on to say that many players are locked into wherever their digital libraries are now, calling the Xbox One/PS4 battle the “worst generation” to lose from the perspective of fighting over market share. </p><p>I’ve been skeptical of this view and think it undercounts Microsoft’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732">persistent struggle to consistently ship high-quality exclusive games</a></span> that everyone wants to play. But it also seems undeniable that players, especially younger ones, are less attached to where they play games than ever as long as they can play what they want. Does this mean we’ll see <em>God of War Ragnarök</em> on Xbox Series X/S next year? Almost certainly not. But exclusivity increasingly feels less like a promise binding all Sony first-party games, and more like a ticking clock competing platforms bake into their long-tail sales strategy. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122]]></content:encoded>

Every Nintendo Direct or Xbox Games Showcase, rumors start to swirl that this time—<em>this time</em>—the game is going to appear, and we’ll see it moving, and there will be a release date. And none of that ever happens. One of my favorite ever headlines on <em>Kotaku</em> was this one from Willa  after it didn’t show in April 2024's Direct: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-world-showcase-no-show-1851416028&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-world-showcase-no-show-1851416028"><em>Silksong</em> Fans Won’t Survive Another Round of Disappointment.</a></span></p><p>Then today, looking through the impossible avalanche of industry emails that pour in, I noticed Microsoft had sent over its itinerary for this year’s Gamescom. Germany’s Gamescom is the biggest gaming show in the world, and every August features its own Geoff Keighley-hosted night of trailers during which <em>Silksong</em> also doesn’t appear. But what’s this? Hidden in the list of games Microsoft will have playable in its booths at this year’s event, tucked between <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> and <em>Borderlands 4...</em>it’s <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</p><p>In fact, the email even specifies, “This includes the first ever public opportunity to go hands on with the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, including a new playable demo for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.</em>”</p><p>Rumors spread earlier this year that there might be some sort of strange deal between the ROG Xbox Ally and <em>Silksong</em>, after the logo for the game appeared <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000">in the launch trailer for the handheld console</a></span>.</p><p>However, Team Cherry’s Matthew “Leth” Griffin then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1l6k3vt/thank_you_leth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1l6k3vt/thank_you_leth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jumped on the game’s Discord</a></span> to confirm a previous vague suggestion the game would come out before Christmas 2025, and to add “we are not tied to a console release.”</p><p>Still, this Gamescom tie-in suggests there’s <em>something</em> going on there. Could it turn out to be pre-loaded on the ROG Xbox Ally, as well as being sold separately elsewhere? It’d sure be a cool incentive.</p><p>But more importantly, it seems <em>Silksong</em> actually exists so much that there’s at the very least a playable demo of the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Glen Schofield, who co-created <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-space-2008"><u>Dead Space</u></a>, co-founded Sledgehammer Games, and most recently directed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-callisto-protocol"><u>The Callisto Protocol</u></a>, said "it's tough out there" in the games industry, and admitted he had potentially "directed my last game" after failing to secure financial support for his latest prototype. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a candid post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_game-industry-its-tough-out-there-activity-7354611327878774785-mvzk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>LinkedIn</u></a>, Schofield said he'd been working with his "great artist" daughter, Nicole, who went to him with an idea for a new horror game — maybe even a new horror sub-genre, although he didn't specify what — and had been working on the idea for the last eight months. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside a "small, talented crew" of six U.S. devs and a "full crew" in the UK, Schofield said he started talking to people, most of whom "loved the concept." Initially surmising he'd need around $17 million, the director was advised to lower the budget to "get it to $10 million," before being told to further streamline the project to come in at around "$2-5 million."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"So last month, we decided to walk away. Some ideas are better left untouched than done cheap," Schofield wrote. "We had a team of six here in the States and a full crew in the UK. Now, everyone’s looking for work. They’re all talented folks — if you’re hiring, let me know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As for me — I’ve worked on games of every size. From two of us to over 300 devs. Spent the last 15–20 years making big AAA titles with great teams. That’s what I do. That’s what I love. But with the industry on pause, AAA feels like it’s a long ways away." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Schofield says he's "back to [his] art," but admits he misses AAA development. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I miss it all; the team, the chaos, the joy of building something for fans. I’m still around, making art, writing stories and ideas, and still cheering the industry on. But maybe I’ve directed my last game. Who knows? If so, thank you [for] playing my games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Striking Distance was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/26/dead-space-creators-new-studio-to-develop-pubgs-narrative-experience"><u>founded over six years ago</u></a> by Schofield. The studio is a subsidiary of Krafton, the parent company that owns the rights to the widely popular battle royale game PUBG. The studio was initially formed to create a narrative-driven game set in the PUBG universe, but ultimately released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-creator-reveals-new-sci-fi-survival-horror-the-callisto-protocol"><u>The Callisto Protocol</u></a>, a third-person survival horror separate from PUBG that released in December 2022.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Callisto Protocol was met with mixed reviews and plagued with problems, from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-callisto-protocols-steam-reviews-suffer-following-reports-of-poor-performance"><u>performance issues</u></a> to reports of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-former-striking-distance-developers-say-key-folks-were-left-out-of-credits"><u>studio crunch</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-striking-distance-reportedly-left-several-developers-off-credits"><u>issues with crediting people</u></a> who contributed to the development. Roughly a month after release, it was reported that the game failed to meet Krafton's sales expectations, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-leaves-the-callisto-protocols-striking-distance-studios"><u>Schofield eventually left the company in September 2023</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We thought The Callisto Protocol was 'Good,' <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-review"><u>awarding it a 7/10 in our review</u></a>, writing: "The Callisto Protocol is a satisfyingly gory spiritual successor to the Dead Space series, but it’s ultimately more of a striking modern mimic than a scary new mutation."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Both Black Bolt and White Flare have made a huge impact since launching together on July 18, 2025. Celebrating the full Unova roster, these <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon TCG</a> sets stand out not just for gameplay but also for their pure focus on the beloved Gen V. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While every card in the expansion has an Illustration Rare or better, a few have emerged as both highly collectable and competitively viable. As a result, some cards have been selling out more over at dedicated card marketplace <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/search/pokemon/sv-black-bolt?productLineName=pokemon&amp;setName=sv-black-bolt&amp;productTypeName=Cards&amp;page=1&amp;view=grid" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCGPlayer</a> than others. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s dive into the standout cards and the artwork that have collectors scrambling for singles.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR – The 10 Most Popular Cards From Black Bolt</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Bolt’s top sellers blend power, nostalgia, and jaw-dropping art, also sharing some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/most-expensive-black-bolt-white-flare-pokemon-cards-right-now">most expensive cards in White Flare and Black Bolt</a> too. N’s Plan leads the Trainer hype with a serene illustration. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Zekrom ex shows up three times, with the coveted Black White Rare version being the most in-demand — and expensive — of them all. Air Balloon’s reprint is a clean, functional favourite, and Genesect ex is a collector and/or competitive player’s dream with three sleek variations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seismitoad’s psychedelic Round set-up adds both charm and synergy. And then, further down, Victini’s bold Black White Rare print rounds out the list as a fiery sleeper hit. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">N’s Plan – 170/086</h2><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225973"><div id="225973" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>N's Plan - 170/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Illustrated with a striking close-up, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJP31?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">N’s Plan</a> is a simple but impactful Supporter card that lets you move up to two Energy from your Benched Pokémon to your Active. It’s already seeing experimental play for energy manipulation combos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real reason collectors are eyeing it, however, is the artwork. Featuring N against a glowing night fairground, this is one of the most beautiful Trainer cards in the set. It captures a rare moment of peace and nostalgia for its deeply tied scene in the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-black-version">Pokémon Black</a><em> &amp; </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-white-version/walkthroughs">White</a> games — set on that same ferris wheel in the background, with N revealing that he is actually the king of Team Plasma.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">N’s plan is also available as an <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmnWXy?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Uncommon and Secret Rare</u></a>, but this is the version everyone wants in their collections.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Zekrom ex – 034/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225972"><div id="225972" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zekrom ex - 034/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the three varities of <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBgXAM?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zekrom ex</a> on this list, this one might be the most aggressive-looking of the bunch. It shares the same stats and moveset but showcases Zekrom mid-roar, bolts of lightning wrapping around its frame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a card that goes all-in on intensity — the pose, the expression, the thunder. It’s easy to see why it’s become a standout for players who want their decks to look as powerful as they play. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Air Balloon – 079/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225971"><div id="225971" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Air Balloon - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A reprint of a beloved Tool card, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgPjw?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Air Balloon</a> reduces a Pokémon’s retreat cost by two Energy. It sees regular play in many decks thanks to its versatility, but this version’s value is bumped by its clean and nostalgic look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The illustration is simple but effective, with a bright red balloon floating in an airy green background. It evokes early Pokémon art styles with its softness and clarity, and longtime fans are snapping it up fast.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Genesect ex – 169/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225970"><div id="225970" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Genesect ex - 169/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The most expensive take on <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJPRY?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesect ex</a> in the set, this Special Illustration Rare version leans darker with a more industrial setting. Framed by black and crimson tones, the artwork gives the impression of a covert mission or even a monster movie scenario. It still offers Metallic Signal and Protect Charge, but the mood here is more intense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is arguably the most atmospheric of the Genesect trio. It’s one of those cards that gives hints of a chilling story, as well their being a stylish addition to their decks. On the other hand, with there being cheaper options, it’s good to keep this pricey card at least in a top loader if you want to retain its value. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Genesect ex – 161/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225969"><div id="225969" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Genesect ex - 161/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmnWpK?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesect ex</a> appears again as a radiant, glossy Secret Rare. All the same play value from its ability and attack, but now clad in reflective armour with dynamic camera angles — looking like a pure weapon ready to fire.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes this one desirable is its futuristic sheen. It’s mechanical but elegant, and some collectors seem to prefer the balance between high-tech precision, bold colour use, and being slightly more budget-friendly than the Special Illustration Rare.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Zekrom ex – 166/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225968"><div id="225968" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zekrom ex - 166/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Special Illustration Rare <a href="https://zdcs.link/a03ZGE?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zekrom ex</a> shares the same devastating Voltage Burst attack and utility-focused Slash of the earlier Double Rare, but is elevated by its the thunderstorm backdrop. Lightning crackles around Zekrom in a dynamic battle pose that sells its raw, storm-born power.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to the below Black White version, this one is all about motion and energy. It’s a favourite among players who want a flashy yet functional attacker, and it stands as a reminder that good art can enhance competitive cards without compromising on impact. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although its current $200+ market price may make you want to get this one PSA-graded instead.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Genesect ex – 067/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225967"><div id="225967" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Genesect ex - 067/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q47dOd?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesect ex</a> is function-first, but its standard foil still makes it pop. What makes this card playable is the featured Metallic Signal Ability, searching for two Evolution Metal Pokémon every turn — and Protect Charge, which hits for 150 and reduces incoming damage by 30 next turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it’s not the flashiest version of Genesect, the vibrant swirls of metallic pink and white light that frame the Pokémon give this card a sense of speed and energy. Most importantly, it’s the most affordable for those who want to slot this into a deck.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Seismitoad – 105/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225966"><div id="225966" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Seismitoad - 105/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Illustration Rare of <a href="https://seismitoad/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seismitoad</a> is not only one of the most psychedelic prints in White Flare, but it also has real deck-building potential. Its Round attack does 70 damage for each Pokémon you control with the same attack, meaning it scales dangerously with board set-up. Add in Hyper Voice at 160 damage and you’ve got a hefty Stage 2 option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the artwork certainly has a wow factor too. With swirling, trippy patterns and an oddly serene expression, Seismitoad looks like it wandered into a Beatles album cover. It’s colourful, weird, and unforgettable. With it being #3 among Black Bolt’s best sellers on TCG Player, that aesthetic flair has pushed this card into top-tier collector territory.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Victini – 172/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225965"><div id="225965" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Victini - 171/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Victini’s White Flare Black White Rare edition has become a surprise high roller. At first glance, it’s easy to underestimate. After all, 80 HP on a Basic doesn’t scream value. But a real kicker is its attack, V-Force, which hits for 120 damage with just two Fire Energy; if you have five or more Benched Pokémon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Fire swarm decks, that’s not hard to hit, making this a shockingly good closer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, this <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAk6b?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Victini’s</a> is cemented most of all by its unique presentation. This Black White Rare treatment uses deep reds and a minimalist embossed foil that makes Victini feel like a mythic figure, despite its size. It radiates heat, charm, and just enough menace to make you look twice. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Zekrom ex – 172/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225964"><div id="225964" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zekrom ex - 172/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The top seller among TCG Player Pokémon cards in Black Bolt, this Black White Rare <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GD22?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zekrom ex</a> combines raw power with prestige. Like the others Zekroms in this list, Voltage Burst attack starts at 130 damage and gains +50 for each Prize card your opponent has taken, creating late-game knockout potential. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 30 recoil damage is offset by Zekrom’s chunky 230 HP and synergy with Lightning acceleration like Miraidon or Flaaffy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The monochrome foil art makes it one of the most imposing cards in the set, alongside the above Victini. Rendered in elegant grayscale on an imposing pure-black background, Zekrom’s jagged lines and fierce pose turn it into a poster-worthy collectable. It’s a card that hits hard in play and even harder in your binder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="article-base-contributors"><div data-component="contributors"><p><a data-testid="contributor-name" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/author/chris-kerr" data-discover="true">Chris Kerr</a><span data-testid="contributor-title">, <!-- -->Senior Editor, News</span><span data-testid="contributor-title">, <!-- -->GameDeveloper.com</span></p><p data-testid="contributors-date">July 28, 2025</p></div><p><span data-component="icon" data-name="Clock"></span><span>5 Min<!-- --> <!-- -->Read</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How can developers in Latin America successfully court investors? That was the question a panel of experts set out to answer at Gamescom Latam 2025 in May—and while their advice might have been geared towards creators in the South American region, we suspect it could prove useful for people making games beyond those borders.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">DealMaker managing partner Arnaldo Rocha kicked off the session by explaining he'll analyze a company's investment potential by assessing numerous variable such as whether a team has the experience and band width to deliver and adapt when new opportunities and problems arise.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He suggests the game industry is ripe with companies that are able to achieve initial success—but delivering consistent wins remains a challenge.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We sometimes find incredible teams and incredible products, but without developing a sustainable vision for the business and how the company will face down its competitors," he explains.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The team might have thought about that subconsciously but cannot communicate it effectively. If they seem unsure or cannot explain that [aspect of the business] well, nobody is going to to invest." He also advises teams seeking investment to back up their words with hard data without "over communicating" their business plan.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/subnautica-2-publisher-krafton-acquires-last-epoch-developer-eleventh-hour-games" target="_self" data-discover="true">Subnautica 2 publisher Krafton acquires Last Epoch developer Eleventh Hour Games</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rocha believes company founders can become fixated on communicating unnecessary details that aren't relevant to investors today—such as where the industry or their product might be in five years. Instead, he advises teams to focus on demonstrating where their income will come from to underline the "financial robustness" of their proposition.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You need to be able to demonstrate where your income will come from," he says. "Is it because of retention or sales or clients? Adequately describing your 'wealth creation engine.' You need to have a product—but this can be an initial product that can be developed and changed over time."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He also tells developers in Brazil specifically to foster ambitions of going global. Don't just settle for success on home soil, because potential investors will likely want to know their partners are eager to deliver results on a larger scale.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;What are you trying to build and why does this matter to you?&quot;">"What are you trying to build and why does this matter to you?"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sandsoft CEO David Fernandez Remesal largely agrees with Rocha's assessment. He explains the mobile publisher chooses its partners based on how they're building their games—which means analyzing the technology they're using and the commercial viability of their project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Mostly as a publisher we are looking at the synergies these studios will have with our company. We're more focused on acquisitions so we're concerned about how we can retain talent and build long-term opportunities," he added.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-15-zenimax-workers-denounce-inhumane-layoffs-1047-games-boss-admits-to-making-many-mistakes-and-xbox-quashes-the-80-game-for-now-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Patch Notes #15: ZeniMax workers denounce 'inhumane' layoffs, 1047 Games boss admits to making 'many mistakes,' and Xbox quashes the $80 game (for now)</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He claims the most common mistake developers make when pitching Sandsoft is spending too much time talking financials as opposed to spotlighting the game itself. Pitches, he says, must answer some fundamental questions: What are you trying to build and why does this matter to you? What are the capabilities you have right now that will allow you to deliver on that vision? And finally, is this going to be a commercially viable concept?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Remesal implores developers to approach investors having already identified their target audience. He feels devs often fall into the trap of making a video game that appeals to them. That might work on occasion, but he says investors will want to know how you're going to attract a large consumer audience—and whether that playerbase actually exists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, he warns pitches can crumble when developers overexpose their KPIs instead of communicating their business case in a way that feels focused and digestible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Specifically, he tells developers to tailor their pitch down to focus on "needs" and "risks" to avoid creating a deck that feels scattershot. Ignoring the need for marketing is another cardinal sin in the eyes of Remesal. "[I often see] teams thinking they can develop games that are commercially successful without the right marketing abilities," he adds. "They think about the title, but not how they can commercialize afterwords."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-acquires-16-million-shares-in-elden-ring-publisher-bandai-namco" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony acquires 16 million shares in Elden Ring publisher Bandai Namco</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;You need to have a coherent story with a product at the center&quot;">"You need to have a coherent story with a product at the center"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Samuel Veloso, an early stage investor at Maya Capital, picks up that thread and explains it's vital for a company's growth journey to be "defendable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You need to have a coherent story with a product at the center, and be capable of explaining why people want this product to exist," he says. "Have the numbers to prove it so we can check and backtest your vision. That vision needs to reflect the present—the story you've written so far—and the future. We need to buy into your vision and understand why it's going to materialize."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Much like Remesal, he says there are some fundamental questions a pitch should answer including "Why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>this</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team?" and "How are you going to develop a business around this product?". Considering the former is particularly vital because it's imperative to understanding why potential investors will want to back you as creatives.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Veloso claims the most impactful pitches he's seen have been "shameful" in terms of the quantity of information they contained—and that's a wonderful thing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[Those pitches] were very simple," he explains. "They used simple everyday analogies so everybody could connect with that. I've never seen a full, complex pitch during a first meeting. That's for later on. What happens is that you'll have too much to cover and you'll lose depth. You have to leave room for the team to shine. Financial issues will be discussed later if those early conversations go well."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer was invited to Gamescom Latam by event partner Abragames, which covered flights and accommodation.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

<p>"This year, the Xbox booth will be full of fantastic upcoming games from Xbox and our incredible third-party partners coming to Xbox, PC, and Game Pass this Holiday and beyond – and yes, that includes Hollow Knight: Silksong," the post reads. "On top of that, there will be the first ever public opportunity to go hands-on with the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, as well as other fun activities and photo opportunities."</p>

<p>It has now been six years and a bit since Hollow Knight: Silksong was first announced, and many have been eagerly waiting ever since.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>It’s taken Killing Floor sixteen years to reach its third mainline entry, and with Killing Floor 2 now nearly a decade old, hopes and expectations for this long-awaited sequel were understandably high. Personally, I only dipped into the second game briefly—thanks, PS Plus—but I know <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/08/killing-floor-3-delayed-until-later-in-2025-just-weeks-before-launch/">fans weren’t exactly thrilled</a> after February’s closed beta with Tripwire Interactive pushing back release to address some of their complaints. So, what exactly have they delivered after all this time?</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YUiT0fAExKU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Let’s start with the plot, or rather, the lack of one. There’s no introduction, no cinematic, not even a text crawl to set the scene of the techno zombie apocalypse you’re facing. You’re simply dropped into a home base for a quick tutorial, and then it’s straight into the action. The core gameplay loop remains unchanged: pick from one of six character classes—Commando, Sharpshooter, Firebug, Medic, Engineer, and a stereotypical Japanese ninja—and then fight through five waves of increasingly aggressive “Zeds” on one of eight maps, culminating in a boss battle.</p>


<p>Between waves, there’s a short break—maybe the Zeds are having a KitKat?—and during this time you can spend any dosh you’ve earned on new guns, ammo, and supplies. As you progress, you’ll automatically collect items like brain matter and eyeballs, which can be used to modify weapons. Don’t think too hard about it, but somehow an eyeball gives you a better magazine, and brain matter improves your gun grip. It is complete nonsense.</p>
<p data-start="1840" data-end="2131">Zed Time, the signature slow-motion combat mechanic, is still here, triggered when your team racks up enough kills. It’s a double-edged sword: it looks great and lets you line up stylish shots, but if it activates while you’re reloading, you’ll burn half the slo-mo watching your character load a new magazine rather than do anything useful. The game attempts to inject a bit of narrative by issuing mid-battle objectives (“Go here,” “Find this”), but it’s largely lost in the chaos of combat.</p>


<p>The maps are all slight variations on the same theme of futuristic apocalyptic ruin, but they are all structured differently. There’s Convoy with its long tunnels and turret placements, and another leans into verticality, but while layouts differ, the visual design is samey, somewhat drab. Environmental destruction is minimal: coffee mugs shrug off shotgun blasts like they a cool summer breeze, though you’ll get to destroy the odd security camera.</p>
<p>And… that’s about it. There’s eight maps to run about and shoot enemies over fives waves and then one of three final bosses, you’ll slowly grind through upgrades to weapons and skills, and repeat.</p>
<p>You can play Killing Floor 3 solo or with up to six players. I tried solo first, and it was about as fun as being repeatedly slapped with a frozen haddock. The game simply isn’t designed for lone wolves. Maps lack safe zones, and enemies attack from every angle. With no one to watch your back, it quickly devolves into frustration. Multiplayer, however, is where the game shines.</p>

<p data-start="3211" data-end="3723">Teaming up with a mix of classes transforms the experience. You don’t even need voice chat as the matchmaking usually ensures a balanced squad. With just a mildly competent team, the Normal difficulty becomes a joyful romp of bullets, blood, and teamwork. The gunplay is excellent, with satisfying heft to larger weapons, and the visual feedback is spot-on; headshots trigger geysers of gore, leg shots trip enemies, and dismemberment remains as gloriously grisly as ever. Zeds move fast, vaulting over obstacles and swarming with intent, but the pacing is tuned just right—you feel under pressure without being overwhelmed.</p>
<p data-start="3211" data-end="3723">After a few sessions, you’ll have gathered enough crafting components to start customising weapons. This adds a new layer of gameplay which allows you to work on your play style. I went with a freezing grenade launcher which let me immobilise the enemy so my team mates could smash the frozen Zeds at their leisure. Fully upgrading a weapon can actually make it more effective than some shop options, so the grind actually feels worthwhile.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Killing Floor 3 is riddled with strange interface decisions. On the Skills screen, you’re prompted to press Square to upgrade, but that only takes you to another menu where you then press X to actually do it. The Supply Pass is also awkward to navigate and you can scroll the focus off the screen and lose it, and while some items are labelled “Free,” they still require a token to unlock. It’s very confusing,</p>

<p>Priced between £25 and £35 depending on your platform, Killing Floor 3 is half the cost of a typical AAA release, and that price point sets expectations and allowances. There are no flashy CGI cutscenes, no celebrity voice cast, and some glaringly rough parts: enemies vanish mid-death and bosses clip through walls so they can barrel down corridors that are clearly to small for them. Sure, they have added new elements such as mantling, but it is 2025 and this is running on PS5. Enemies should not just vanish before your eyes like a PS2 game. Even the map names are telling. One is literally just called Office. That’s it.<em> Office</em>. It’s perfunctory and basic, and that sums up Killing Floor 3.</p>

Sure, it's more of an addendum to 2024's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, but we consider the original the best entry in the entire series, and Jamboree TV only adds cherries on top of that cake.</p>
<p>PJ gave the updated game a sparkling 9/10 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">in his review</a> last week. In fact, the silly title is pretty much the only thing we're not quite on board with. We would have loved to hear the folks on the old Nintendo Power podcast saying "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a>" <em>every single time</em> it's mentioned. Rumours that the unwieldy NS2 Edition names are the reason they stopped the 'cast are entirely spurious. Probably.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, it's sitting on a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2/critic-reviews/">"Generally Favorable" Metascore of 78</a>, so not everybody enjoyed it <em>quite</em> as much as PJ - and we're keen to hear what you think.</p>
<p>If you haven't gotten around to it just yet (hey, we get it, it's been a busy — and <em>expensive</em> — couple of months!), no sweat. Remember, you can come back at any time and score the game from 1-10 as you see fit, either here on Jamboree TV's game page, and it'll count towards the poll.</p>
<p>If you've already rated the game in our database, you're a <em>particularly</em> lovely person and we salute you. If not, we still think you're lovely - feel free to drop your mark below. You know, if you like.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has debuted its Gamescom 2025 lineup, which includes more than 20 games featured across what will be two days of broadcasts, and for those in attendance at the show, the first opportunity to go hands-on with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-prices-leaked/">ROG Xbox Ally/ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, and Hollow Knight Silksong, which will be at the show with a playable demo.</p>



<p>It's the first major chance players have had to try out Hollow Knight Silksong, which is due to release sometime this year after having been announced in 2019. Developer Team Cherry isn't exactly a giant outfit, so it has <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed-as-development-is-still-continuing/">taken the studio some time</a> to get the game ready to release. Even now, at the time of this writing, it is without a release date, though it looks like it should be ready to go this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/you-can-play-hollow-knight-silksong-in-september-2025-at-a-museum-in-australia-that-is/">since a playable build of it will also be stored in an Australian museum this coming September</a>.</p>



<p>Xbox will also have games from its first-party studios featured at its booth, including a demo of the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-dlc-announced-launches-in-september-2025/">Order of Giants DLC</a> for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle that's coming on September 4, 2025. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will also have a demo for its new city update, and Grounded 2 will also have hands-on demos on the show floor. Though in the case of Grounded 2, Xbox Game Pass subscribers can just <a href="https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-wuchang-fallen-feathers-robocop-xbox-game-pass/">check it out at home as of tomorrow</a>, if you're not making the trip to Cologne.</p>



<p>There will be two days of Xbox broadcasts, the first on Wednesday, August 20, starting at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST / 3pm CEST, with the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X handhelds, Grounded 2, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and others being the highlight for the day's broadcast. Then on Thursday, August 21, beginning at the same time as the day before, Xbox will showcase Ninja Gaiden 4, Overwatch 2, and The Outer Worlds 2. </p>



<p>Here's the full list of games Xbox will have featured at Gamescom 2025 in its booth and during its broadcasts, per<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-gamescom-2025/"> Xbox Wire</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Grounded 2</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo-coming-as-release-window-looms.1255011/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has revealed its plans for this August's Gamescom show, and among them is a playable demo of&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, although unfortunately, the demo is only for show attendees.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-gamescom-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a> on Xbox Wire, Xbox reveals it will be giving Gamescom ticket holders a chance to check out <i>Silksong</i>&nbsp;on either PC or the new ROG Xbox Ally X handheld, which was revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">this summer's Xbox showcase</a>.</p>

<p><em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game attendees will be able to play, either; they'll also be able to check out upcoming games like&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>,&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo-hornet.jpg?itok=F4A3aIM1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo-hornet.jpg?itok=YgPj0Snu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>will be playable at this year's Gamescom event.</figcaption></figure><p>Xbox is also promising a new "theater presentation" for its upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, which, it turns out, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-outer-worlds-2-70-dollars-xbox" rel="nofollow">won't cost $80 as previously announced</a>, but a far more sensible $70. That's alongside "a couple more surprises at the show".</p>

<p>If you're somehow not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, it's the long-awaited followup to Team Cherry's acclaimed 2017 Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>. This sequel will focus on Hornet, a character who featured prominently in the original game, as she explores a brand new kingdom.</p>

<p><em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>has become something of a meme in the gaming community; it was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-is-hollow-knight-sequel-youve-been-waiting-for" rel="nofollow">all the way back in 2019</a>, and since then, Team Cherry has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-still-tba" rel="nofollow">evasive</a> regarding the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed" rel="nofollow">release date</a>, as well as further details about its story or specifics for its gameplay.</p>

<p>However, during the aforementioned Xbox summer showcase this year, Team Cherry's Matt Griffin confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>was due to release sometime before Christmas this year. Hooray!</p>




<p>If&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>doesn't get a release date in the next couple of weeks, I'll be very surprised indeed. Far more pertinent is the question of whether Team Cherry's next game will have been worth the six-year wait. We'll have to wait (a little longer) and see, I suppose.</p>

                <p>After several years of development, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war/">God of War</a> TV series at Amazon is starting to gain momentum. This live-action adaptation of the iconic PlayStation IP won't be a remake of the games, but like other projects based on popular video game IP, you can expect it to cherry-pick the best elements from its source material and remix them into a new adventure.</p><p>At San Diego Comic-Con, series showrunner Ronald D. Moore spoke about how Sony Santa Monica's 2018 God of War game is serving as the primary inspiration for the series. "This world and this universe are really rich, and it's interesting, and it's really been fun to adapt," Moore said to <a href="https://collider.com/god-of-war-series-adaptation-prime-video-update-ron-moore/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Collider</a>. "It's an adaptation, so it's an adaptation-slash-interpretation as you go into live-action, and it's been really fun to sort of go, 'Wow, there's a lot here we can play with. Okay, we want to keep the story. We want to keep the characters and the spirit of it'. There's all this stuff that you can keep turning to for inspiration."</p>

<p>Moore added that God of War game director Cory Barlog is also actively involved with the series, and he referred to the developer as having an impressive and encyclopedic knowledge for all things God of War-related. "I usually pride myself about, as a showrunner, I can hold the season in my head," Moore said. "I know what the 10 episodes are, and I can tell you about them. Cory can tell you the whole thing in every possible way--all the mythology, how it connects one to the other, what the puzzles were, why they did this, and what that artifact did. It's really impressive."</p><p>God of War is just one of several video game adaptations under development at Amazon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-tv-show-already-has-two-seasons-in-the-works-apparently/1100-6530165/" data-ref-id="1100-6530165">and it could run for two seasons</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-has-officially-wrapped-production/1100-6531410/" data-ref-id="1100-6531410">A second season of Fallout</a> is on the way and it was recently announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolfenstein-tv-series-in-the-works-from-same-company-behind-fallout-show/1100-6533457/" data-ref-id="1100-6533457">Wolfenstein is also in the early stages</a> of being adapted for TV. On top of that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-fallout-tv-show-writers-room-board-the-andromeda-for-mass-effect-show/1100-6533296/" data-ref-id="1100-6533296">Mass Effect</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazons-warhammer-series-with-henry-cavill-could-finally-be-entering-development/1100-6528340/" data-ref-id="1100-6528340">Warhammer 40K TV series</a> are also in the works. As for God of War, the last game in the series was 2022's God of War Ragnarök, which brought the story of Kratos to a satisfying end.</p><p>Sony Santa Monica is currently working <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-studios-next-game-reportedly-going-well-may-not-be-a-sci-fi-new-ip/1100-6533167/" data-ref-id="1100-6533167">on its next big project</a>, and similar to 2018's God of War, it sounds like the studio might be busy putting a fresh spin on a familiar IP.</p>

                <p>No, there's still no proper release date in sight for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, but European players will soon get the opportunity to find out for themselves if the elusive Metroidvania is actually real or not. Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-gamescom-2025/" rel="nofollow ">released its lineup</a> for games it will be showing off during this year's Gamescom, held between August 20-24, where it shared that attendees will be able to try out the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. While the handhelds will include games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox/" data-ref-id="5005-152">Roblox</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sea-of-thieves/" data-ref-id="5000-438508">Sea of Thieves</a> to try out, a demo for Hollow Knight: Silksong is the big one here that will likely draw in some big queues.</p><p dir="ltr">There's no more details about the demo outside of that, but if you do get to try it out, don't expect a particularly long one given how busy the event can be. Notably, it's also the first time it will be playable publicly since 2019. Silksong is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-in-september-at-this-one-location/1100-6531268/" data-ref-id="1100-6531268">also slated to be playable</a> at Australia's National Museum of Screen Culture in September.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Glen Schofield - known for Dead Space and more recently as founder of Striking Distance Studios and its debut title,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> - has suggested he could be done with game development after struggling to secure funding for his latest project.</p>
<p>"Game industry, it's tough out there," Schofield wrote on<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_game-industry-its-tough-out-there-activity-7354611327878774785-mvzk/?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAABcgUKYBbJX-MSb5OokNbeoXtezYCmgR3EM"> LinkedIn</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/maybe-ive-directed-my-last-game-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-says-a-new-aaa-game-feels-a-long-ways-away/">VGC</a>), revealing over the last eight months he had been working with his daughter on a new game idea. "She came to me with it, and I immediately loved the idea. Something I hadn't seen before. We've been calling it a new sub-genre of horror - not just horror, but something more," Schofield wrote. </p>
<p>However, the duo failed to obtain the financial backing which would have allowed them to continue with their project.</p>

<p>"We pulled the budget down to $17m, built a prototype with a small, talented crew, and started taking meetings. People loved the concept. We got a lot of second and third meetings. But early feedback was 'get it to $10m'. Lately, that number's dropped to $2-5m," Schofield continued, stating he and his daughter had ultimately decided to "walk away" from the project.</p>
<p>"Some ideas are better left untouched than done cheap. We had a team of six here in the States and a full crew in the UK. Now, everyone's looking for work. They're all talented folks - if you're hiring, let me know," the game developer wrote. "As for me - I've worked on games of every size. From two of us to over 300 devs. Spent the last 15-20 years making big AAA titles with great teams. That's what I do. That's what I love.</p>
<p>"But with the industry on pause, AAA feels like it's a long ways away."</p>
<p>Wrapping up his post, Schofield wrote: "I miss it all; the team, the chaos, the joy of building something for fans. I'm still around, making art, writing stories and ideas and still cheering the industry on. But maybe I've directed my last game. Who knows? If so, thank you for playing my games."</p>

And yes, you’re right, those figures are all <em>incredibly</em> close.</p><p>$218 million for <em>Fantastic Four </em>to <em>Superman</em>’s $217 million means both Marvel and DC can be feeling pretty good about things right now. It also does put a lot of the last couple of weeks of handwringing about Supe’s international performance in a different perspective</p><p>Post <em>Superman</em>’s release, James Gunn has given a bunch of comments about why the film may not have performed as well overseas as hoped, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/james-gunn-superman-woke-anti-america-box-office-1236465776/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/james-gunn-superman-woke-anti-america-box-office-1236465776/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most recently claiming</a></span> that “anti-American sentiment around the world” could be behind the discrepancy, as well as suggesting Superman isn’t as well known in some foreign territories as names like Batman. But given both superhero flicks have made almost identical amounts, it seems that it could be a lot less about Superman specifically, and perhaps more about superheroes themselves.</p><p>Things are still going well for <em>Superman</em>. After three weekends of release, it’s now crossed the half-billion point, with a reported total of $502,701,478, with percent of that domestic. In contrast, 54 percent of <em>Fantastic Four</em>’s opening total is from the U.S. So, again, rounding errors, but the same pattern.</p><figure id="" data-id="69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-recommend-id="image://69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1380" data-height="776" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="HERBIE the robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="HERBIE the robot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-recommend-id="image://69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1380" data-height="776" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="HERBIE the robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The reason anyone cares about this is the implication that the perceived lack of overseas sales means these films might not be making as much money as they “should.” Looking through this years’s biggest movies, the normal proportion of total box office to come in domestically is between 32 and 50 percent. <em>F1: The Movie</em>, the extraordinary advertising feature starring Brad Pitt, made just 32 percent of its $510 million in the U.S. <em>Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning</em> is on $592 million, with 33 percent coming in from American audiences. Even <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> got more than 50 percent abroad, and the same for <em>Thunderbolts*</em>.</p><p><em>A Minecraft Movie</em> teeters shy of the big one billion at $995 million, 44.4 percent domestic, while the biggest American movie of the year so far, <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em>, got 42 percent of its $1 billion from home shores. (The biggest movie of 2025, the Chinese animated film <em>Ne Zha II </em>which has pulled in an eye-watering $1.9 billion, got just one percent of that in the U.S.!)</p><p>So, given all this, producers and distributors will be wondering why international audiences aren’t showing up to skew the stats in a similar way for these two superhero movies. While sitting on thrones made of diamond-encrusted gold bullion.</p><p>It’ll be interesting to see if <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> has the same legs as <em>Superman</em>, especially given it’s a somewhat more obscure property among the non-comics-reading public. Still, it’s already the 13th biggest film of the year after just a couple of days.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-opening-weekend-superman-1851787100]]></content:encoded>

                <p>As announced yesterday during the Middle-earth: The Adventure Ahead panel at San Diego Comic Con, the survival crafting game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria/" data-ref-id="5000-566000">The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</a> is getting a brand new expansion. This new expansion, titled Durin's Folk, is very light on details though. It's currently slated for release in Q4, 2025, and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2933130/view/545615719765639778?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam post</a> explains that you'll "continue the fight to restore Moria with an expanded end-game story, exciting new game mechanics, plus many unrevealed secrets!"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dR3nlac_v90" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dR3nlac_v90" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A small teaser trailer was also released, showing off a big empty hallway with a massive door being opened by a group of dwarves. Various characters speak over the trailer too, with one notably saying "Khazad-dum is the home of Durin's Folk." For some context, Khazad-dum is another name for Moria, so it sounds like this end-game focused expansion might actually be living up to the base game's subtitles. Durin is also one of the seven fathers of the dwarves, the original group of dwarves that founded the dwarven race, for any non-Lord of the Rings loreheads out there.</p><p dir="ltr">Return to Moria didn't receive an outstanding reception when it launched back in 2023, averaging a critics' score of 59 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria/">Metacritic</a>, and a user score of 6.8. The game appears to be doing better on Steam these days, with a very positive rating across all of its reviews.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria is available to play now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

<p>Total Digital Eclipse of the heart</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/18dac4deea960/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Digital Eclipse</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've been eagerly anticipating more news on Digital Eclipse's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> since it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-comes-to-switch-and-switch-2-in-2025">revealed</a> last month with a 2025 release window, and while nothing has been <em>officially</em> shared, it looks like a more specific release date might have accidentally leaked — via the Xbox App, no less (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-release-date-looks-like-its-been-leaked-early-by-xbox">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>As noted on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</a> Reddit forum, the Xbox App briefly had the upcoming collection listed for <strong>29th/30th September</strong> (thanks to the magic of time zones) over the weekend, though there was no official word from Digital Eclipse. The app listing has since reverted back to the 31st December 2025 placeholder that we so often see deployed for titles awaiting a specific date, but not before more than a handful of people clocked the change.</p>
<p>Speculation quickly ensued on the Reddit thread, with folks theorising that the devs might formally reveal the release date at EVO 2025 next weekend, or perhaps even that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">rumoured Nintendo Direct</a>. Either way, the specification of the app's date and its subsequent removal has made us a little less sceptical of this leak than we normally would be — even if we are still treating things with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>For those who missed the Legacy Kollection reveal in last month's State of Play, this one sees Digital Eclipse hit up the "interactive documentary" format once again, with interviews, commentaries and interesting materials about some of the biggest games in MK history. That accompanies "over 20 different versions" of iconic Mortal Kombat titles, with the current lineup including the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mortal_kombat_ii">Mortal Kombat II</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/ultimate_mortal_kombat_3">Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mortal_kombat_advance">Mortal Kombat Advance</a> and many more.</p>

			<p>Not every game, but some games, like Tripwire Interactive's Killing Floor 3, deliver exactly what you'd expect by looking at the cover. You shoot Zeds (read: zombies), and when you're done shooting Zeds in one level, there are more Zeds for you to shoot on another. In between the shooting, you'll level up your weapons, refill on ammo and gear, and then go back to shooting Zeds. Oh, and there are also a few narrative-driven tasks to complete, but the main course is shooting Zeds.</p>



<p>That's fine, really. I love a strong narrative, but I can just as easily get behind a game where the story is nothing more than a reason for the gameplay to happen. Or at least it would be, if shooting Zeds was worth the rest of the game's failings. It's not a bad thing for a game to be streamlined against everything else, but it's bad for those games to not even get their core pitch right.</p>



<p>Which is the unfortunate case Killing Floor 3 finds itself in. It's not about much more than shooting Zeds, and the shooting, along with the Zeds and everything else, is fresh from the 'just fine' section on the shelves of video game stores.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>In some ways, it's not a bad shooter. There's a solid amount of Zeds that chase after you each wave, and their heads pop with enough satisfying zeal. Zeds are also varied enough, and present an interesting enough challenge as you try to deal with the different variants that'll shoot you, charge you, and jump you from every direction. Also, it's not the only issue I have with the sound mixing, but these have to be the quietest zombies I've ever not heard the way I've been caught off guard. Maybe that's just a me problem, and I have to get my ears checked, but it's come up enough times and like I said, it's not the only problem with how the game sounds.</p>



<p>There's a good deal of weapon variety, you can run around each map half-decently, and I appreciate that in a game so focused on bodily mutilation, you can drop the firearms and flamethrowers altogether and just enter the fray with a couple of swords. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>It's a solid mix, and can help make the gameplay feel a little more engaging than it does when you stick to more tried-and-true combos, with my preference being a classic assault rifle/shotgun loadout.</p>



<p>There's also a good amount of synergy to be found with the six currently available classes to choose from. Between weapon, build and special ability coordination, there's a lot that you can combo up between teammates with a little communication and preparation. Unsurprisingly, it's better to hop into matches with others instead of try to run through any of these maps on your own. Playing solo is an option, but it's a huge grind to get anywhere compared to playing with others.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Killing Floor 3 boss Queen Crawler</figcaption></figure>



<p>And a grind is the only thing more plentiful than Zeds in Killing Floor 3. The amount of objectives there is to grind for is perfectly set up for new players to make Killing Floor 3 their new forever-game. Or at least that's clearly Tripwire Interactive's hope with how everything is already set up for it.</p>



<p>Not narrative objectives - there's only 10 main story-focused missions, through which Nightfall's director, Cordelia Clamely, narrates your way through as you jump back and forth between the Army Depot, R&amp;D Lab, Horzine Factory, Radar Station, Convoy, City Streets, and Offices. When they're done? </p>



<figure><figcaption>Killing Floor 3</figcaption></figure>



<p>Head back to all those same maps, plus one more (Sewers), and kill some more Zeds and the same three 'just fine' bosses, chasing after daily and weekly challenges, along with a random new challenge each week to mix things up a bit more if you are already getting tired of the base challenge the game's only core mode offers. Hear each of the characters rattle off their one-liners, and of course, there's also a battle pass with cosmetics for your character and weapons to work through. And then ramp up the difficulty when you get bored of running through each of the maps on the default 'Normal' setting.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Which, again, there's nothing inherently wrong with. I like a zone-out game as much as the next person, but Killing Floor 3 doesn't just feel like a surface-level game that you can zone out to. It feels like a game that's not totally there. That's not exactly complete, almost like the early access version of Killing Floor 3 before it's packed to the brim with DLC and actually chock-full of stuff to do and see. That's all on its way, of course. There's a<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1430190/view/517468222093525040"> first-year roadmap</a> already laid out, with a new specialist, new map, new Zed type to mow down, new bosses, weapons, mods, and more campaign-focused missions coming before the end of the year. In 2026, there's another map coming, more weapons, mods, a new Perk, which is what the classes are called, and then whatever is unannounced as part of the second year roadmap.</p>



<p>It all feels as hollow as the weapons unfortunately do, which is my other problem with the sound mixing and quality. Weapons don't sound satisfying on the trigger pull, and getting weapons to sound satisfying to fire is pretty much the whole game in shooters. Sure, there's a bunch of window dressing around that one aspect of the game, but how a gun sounds is the key element to how much fun it is to press the trigger. When that's lacking, practically nothing in the window dressing can make up for it.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are more weapons, maps, specialists, perks, and everything else coming, but how much is tomorrow's promise worth today? In a game like Killing Floor 3, not much, thanks to the fact that you'll run out of things to do before the day is done, and then tomorrow the new content that's promised won't be out yet.</p>



<p>It's been nearly a full decade since <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/killing-floor-2-review-zombie-killing-never-looked-so-good/">Killing Floor 2</a>, which has been supported with a lot of content to work through in that time. Now, after some <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-has-a-july-release-date-after-unexpected-march-delay/">delay</a>, Killing Floor 3 has arrived, asking a full-price entry fee with nowhere near the kind of content Killing Floor 2 has. If you're brand new to the series, then it's easy to get in now on the ground floor (pun intended), but it's difficult to think that anyone who wasn't bored of Killing Floor 2 wouldn't just keep playing that instead of jumping into the third act of this trilogy.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>And there's all of this before mentioning the fact that the game does not run particularly well at the moment. Tripwire Interactive is surely going to be putting out patch after patch to fix things, but its 'Mixed' review rating on Steam, with a good chunk of the 4,000+ reviews that players have left citing technical problems and a game that runs poorly, which it does, is another sign of a game released in an unfinished state.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Killing Floor 3 isn't a bad game, but at launch, it's a shell of the game that it's promised to be, a promise made by the fact that its predecessor is filled to the brim and then some with DLC. In the meantime, what we have is a game that doesn't fulfill the one ask I have of every shooter, where you can see everything you need to see in an afternoon, and where the rest of the time you're spent running around chasing giant objective lists that boil down to busy work. It's all just fine, and even knowing that the technical issues will hopefully be the first ones to get sorted, the bar is on the floor with Killing Floor 3. With the technical issues, you could say that it's not even hitting that minimum. Come back in a year and/or when it goes on sale to see if anything has changed.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Killing Floor 3 isn't a bad game in a lot of ways. The base pitch of killing Zeds can be fun, and when you get some friends together to properly line up different Perks, it can be a good time to pull different abilities together and get some good teamwork flowing. But there are better games you can play to accomplish all the things that Killing Floor 3 accomplishes, and with the flat sounding weapons and so little to do, on top of the early technical problems, Killing Floor 3 is not the kind of game you should run to your computer to check out at launch. Maybe in a year, though.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Killing Zeds is a good time, even better and more chaotic with friends
</li><li>There's plenty of weapons and build variety to shake things up</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>It's a shell of a game with very little to do
</li><li>Guns sound hollow and aren't satisfying to shoot, even if Zeds still fall in a satisfying way
</li><li>Poor technical performance makes it a chore to run
</li><li>Progression is a grind, and an even worse one if you try to play the game solo</li>						</ul>

			<p>Once known for their experiential horror titles focused on surviving rather than fighting, Bloober Team has slowly shifted their focus into a more combat-centric survival horror experience. After the success of last year’s remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2</a>, the Polish developers recently unveiled a science fiction title they’ve been developing in tandem with The Medium. We and a small number of other journalists were recently invited out to Oakland, California, to get an early look at the first few hours of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-dev-diary-outlines-combat-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>.</p>



<p>Sometimes it’s about writing what you know, and Bloober Team has taken that old adage to heart with Cronos: The New Dawn being set within a very familiar backdrop for the developers. Some of their earlier titles, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/observer-system-redux-dystopian-fear/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Observer</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-medium-silence-of-the-damned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Medium</a>, were also set within the country’s borders, but Cronos: The New Dawn represents a particular moment in time for the citizens. Following the aftermath of World War II and the Soviet occupation, the city of Nowa Huta was idealized in real life as a monument to the power of the Soviets and a utopian society centered around the city’s steelworks. It’s here, set many years in the future from the city’s intended groundbreaking, that Cronos: The New Dawn takes place. As one of the developers said, putting an authentic piece of the world into a horror story makes it more attractive because you can identify with it even if you’ve never been there.</p>



<p>As a Traveler, the player is tasked with venturing back into key moments of time and extracting a target before they are killed. This is done by piloting into time rifts and exploring the world with only a rough idea of where the intended survivor is. From there, the Traveler is largely on their own, taking over in the footsteps of where their predecessors might have fallen.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn takes a lot of inspiration from the development of Silent Hill 2 in how the game flows, from the intimate camera angles to inventory management and opening locked doors. What sets this science fiction horror apart from the more psychological traumas of James Sunderland are the enemies known as Orphans. These grotesque and often indescribable masses of flesh and tentacles seek out the player with indiscriminate focus, chasing them down and even coordinating their attacks to sneak up on the player while their back is turned. Something unique that Bloober Team has introduced in Cronos: The New Dawn is the ability for these creatures to merge into one another and combine attributes from a fallen comrade, making them more deadly and more difficult to put back down. Having to deal with one Orphan that can spit acid is bad enough, but once they get reinforced armor, fighting them face to face becomes a struggle.</p>



<p>The most efficient way of dispatching these Orphans once they’re knocked down or slain is by using fire. The Traveler can use accelerants scattered around the environment, like discarded jerry oil cans or conspicuously marked barrels, to fill the area with fire. The player can also restock up to a single fuel cell (at least this early on in the story) that can be used to shoot out a small flamethrower and engulf those around in flames. As Cronos: The New Dawn doesn’t feature your traditional dodge or evasion movements, the developers showed off that this flamethrower ability is their way of giving players a way to escape from enemies or mitigate an incoming attack. While the player can only hold one unit of fuel at a time, I did make an effort to see if the game would let me store one in the Item Box that litters many save rooms; the game already knows if you have any fuel in hand, even if it’s in one of these boxes, so there isn’t a way to break the game and carry around more than intended.</p>



<p>Inside these save rooms are a number of terminals that can be used to upgrade The Traveler themselves as well as their different weapons they pick up. From your modest pistol to a stronger shotgun and others, each gun can use the currency that The Traveler picks up on their mission to upgrade the various parameters, giving weapons more damage, a faster reload speed, or also giving the player more health to stand a better chance at surviving. There’s also a crafting table in most locations and the same materials used to make bullets are also used to craft healing supplies, so players must make a conscious decision as to which would give them a better chance of surviving.</p>



<p>The gunplay in Cronos: The New Dawn is largely similar to what players saw in Silent Hill 2 or even EA’s Dead Space series. Played in an over-the-shoulder perspective, players can freely target limbs on an enemy to knock them down or aim for the head for increased damage. Out of all the weapons that I picked up during my two-hour session, the shotgun was the only one that felt like it was properly effective. The pistol was little more than a deterrent unless you were willing to unload the better part of a full magazine into a single enemy to take them out. Of course, you could just as easily try to run around some of these enemies and save your bullets, but the tight corridors of Nowa Huta’s apartment buildings don’t give The Traveler much room to run past an enemy. Once they’re downed, you can always give them a good head stomp just to be sure, but that won’t stop enemies from merging. Only fire gives players that certainty.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cronos_Hospital-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>My experience culminated in a boss fight against a writhing mass of tentacles that would form itself into a hulking black humanoid that would either chase me down and swing indiscriminately in my direction or start throwing parts of itself at me when I tried to shoot it at range. I was rather thankful that this was at the end of the demo, as I had used up all of my healing items and bullets that I brought with me and was limited to the ammo that I could scavenge from the enclosed arena to do the final bits of damage. It was a bit of a low point to the experience, not just because it took me multiple attempts before I could dispatch the boss and get to my final destination, but also at how spongy some of the enemies can be and just how many bullets they’d take to go down.</p>



<p>If you take a step off the beaten path and explore around Nowa Huta in Cronos: The New Dawn, there are multiple small side paths that often lead to lost artifacts that can be cashed in for currency or those essential few bullets or healing items necessary for survival. There are also a variety of collectibles, from your usual gamut of audio logs and written notes to comic books. Backtracking to a much earlier section of the demo with the wire cutters I picked up rewarded me with a quiet respite filled with collectible supplies and a single cat that was added to my lorebook, seemingly one of the various collectibles to scour and find throughout neofuture Krakow.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn merges a familiar take on the developer’s homeland with the science fiction of time travel and trying to divert a catastrophe from taking place. With an estimated runtime of sixteen hours, this will be longer than your usual survival horror trip. I am curious to see how Bloober Team intends to pace the story and how rescuing these survivors (or not) will affect how the narrative plays out.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is tentatively set for a Fall 2025 release across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC/Mac.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Heartworm Review - Retrovertigo]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/heartworm-review-retrovertigo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/heartworm-review-retrovertigo.1254945/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ironically, humanity’s eternal fascination with the end of their lives always has them living outside of the moment. Memory’s the mission, of course, but this worry about whether there’s a reception after the end of everything is, rightfully, a massive roadblock, one which can be considered one of those final hurdles before you can comfortably exist. It’s a conundrum which <em>Heartworm </em>tackles head-on.</p>

<p>This is the debut commercial title spearheaded by Vincent Adinolfi: a survival horror tribute which initially received warm hype when it debuted alongside other titles in the first <a href="https://hauntedps1.itch.io/demodisc2020" rel="nofollow">Haunted PS1 Demo Disc in 2020</a>. Since then, <em>Heartworm </em>has become a labor of love which has seen resistance in the form of delays and, most unfortunately, <a href="https://filmstories.co.uk/news/developer-puts-out-a-call-for-help-as-ps1-style-horror-game-heartworm-loses-its-publisher/" rel="nofollow">a publisher drop-out in 2023</a>. Thankfully, DreadXP are here to save the day, hot on the heels after the runaway success of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/white-knuckle-early-access-preview-falling-from-cloud-9" rel="nofollow"><em>White Knuckle</em></a>.</p>

<p>You play as Sam, a young woman who is suffering from the effects of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder after her grandfather passes away. Unable to cope with the grief, Sam comes across a message board composed of users who’ve heard of a house in the backcountry which has a connection to the void beyond the void. Desperate and with seemingly no other options, Sam enters the house to find out for herself.</p>



<p>One thing that’s going to be immediately obvious about <em>Heartworm </em>– maybe even potentially off-putting – is how unapologetic it is about what came before it. Stylistically and mechanically, it’s punching towards the PS1’s entries of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/resident-evil-20-years-later" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/where-can-i-play-silent-hill-this-october" rel="nofollow"><em>Silent Hill</em></a>. Narratively, it seeks to execute the same environmental storytelling depth of something like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/genre-advancing-shooters-half-life" rel="nofollow"><em>Half-Life</em></a>, but in Adinolfi’s own words, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/22-years-later-half-lifes-influence-is-still-being-felt/" rel="nofollow">a more personal touch</a> has been embossed across the entire package.</p>

<p>Gameplay in <em>Heartworm </em>will consist of the usual type of survival horror shenanigans, that being logistically fantastical puzzles, fixed camera angles which sway between artistic, obstructing, or both, and very, <em>very </em>light combat. A lot of the puzzles can be considered “milquetoast” in a capacity: you find a sequence, memorize the sequence, use the sequence to continue, and this will be <em>Heartworm</em>’s main brain tester.</p>

<p>How it presents those sequences does vary, and <em>Heartworm </em>encourages making your own notes, but I was never challenged enough to go that far. There are never enough pieces or wrong answers to mentally take into account, and the answers are never far enough away from the question to be considered a burden. At the very least, they stay consistent, which is necessary for a story aiming to contort the space around you.</p>



<p>Still, it fares a hell of a lot better than what the combat offers over time. It’s described as “limited”, but contextually, it’s because there’s only one option, and that’s using your camera to stun them into oblivion, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fatal-frame" rel="nofollow"><em>Fatal Frame</em></a>-style. Pop a few candid shots of your own inner fears, and watch them disappear before your eyes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this case, enemy variety is important, and how you interact with them in the heat of battle. <em>Heartworm </em>responds firmly with a fat handful of enemies, each of them unique in their lethality, the highlight of which will be your most common encounter: a walking spectre made of TV static. With its glitchy screams and wails calling for help, your first couple of encounters with them will be nail-biting, but this is where the intensity starts and ends.</p>

<p>As time goes on, combat doesn’t just become an intrusion, but it’s entirely recommended you avoid it entirely, and that’s not in <em>Heartworm</em>’s advice or favor. Enemies become less of a statement on the horror's intuition, but obstacles that speak to be nothing more than such, especially in the latter half of the game, where <em>Heartworm </em>is extremely stingy with ammo for your camera.</p>



<p>Does this feed into the sensibilities of survival horror? Intrinsically, yes, but at the same time, <em>Heartworm </em>is terrified of the player finding frustration in its mechanics of old – no checkpoints, spread-out save room locations, etc – that health items practically rain from the sky. Enemies will only ever deal physical damage to you over time, so don't worry about poison, crippling effects, so on and so forth.</p>

<p>As for the boss fights, you’ll find yourself in tricky situations, but the fights themselves suffer from a terrible case of waiting. There’s never much fortitude on display from the offerings of a giant spider, regardless of whatever game possesses them, but here, the giant spiders and the other looming bookends of each individual act will play similar roles of "they attack, you stun, they run, repeat".</p>

<p>Still, going to a horror game for the bosses is like going to a pizza place for a salad, and <em>Heartworm</em>’s aesthetic is the meal you're looking for. Where <em>Heartworm </em>picks and chooses to let its visual design and art direction fly free are when the game peaks, shimmering depictions of surrealist architecture and stress-inducing set pieces. How it envisions Sam in these environments does become a bit of an issue, especially when it zooms out and shows the full scale of the twisted psyche on display, and Sam becomes a black speck on the horizon -- this can happen even when you have the retro filters turned off.</p>



<p>I played through <em>Heartworm </em>twice, once for the gameplay, and once for the narrative, finding myself at the same conclusion both times in that Sam isn’t even the main character of her own story. Fairly quickly, her context, her reasoning, her history and presence, get snubbed in favor of a larger collective, one that also isn’t given the breathing room to justify considering how much time has been spent, and consecutively wasted on her.</p>

<p>When Sam’s story does return to the spotlight, it's done with such violent strokes of theming and messaging that it's painted in harsh juxtaposition with everything else. Every revelation and turn of the page is set up in implications, never a set statement that wants to mean something, or make you feel something. This is saved for the ending, which, without spoiling, sets up an entirely new implication which throws the entire message out of the water.</p>

<p>It’s a far cry from the previous demo’s of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/heartworm-preview-authentic-survival-horror" rel="nofollow"><em>Heartworm</em></a>, which establish her as more of a team player in terms of how she co-exists with the world presented, and those decisions are muted, but still present. In the full game however, she’s become a tourist to her own turmoils, her trials and tribulations seemingly ineffectual to the alarmingly blurry precedent on display. What messages exist in <em>Heartworm </em>are steeped in sympathy, but it’s hard not to feel apathetic towards a protagonist who, now, has had her resolution dismantled in the name of something I’m still not sure of.</p>

<h2><em>Heartworm&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p><em>Heartworm </em>is gorgeous. It’s so easy to fall in love with how it ticks and trickles its intricacies towards the player, but when the stakes ramp up, so much of its promise is dropped for too many ideas, that none of them get their proper chance to shine. It fades before you even get a chance to drink it in, and the memories it leaves behind are only able to become mere footnotes.</p>
