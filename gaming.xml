			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler is undergoing some rather quick development, as the solid implementation seen in a recent game isn't based on the latest version of the upscaler.</p>
<p>As reported on the<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-games-with-ps5-pro-enhancements.1026072/post-135898977" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ResetERA forums</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a>, the second entry in the series released earlier this month, uses the upscaler's 9.60 version. While the high version number, by itself, suggests that PSSR has been undergoing plenty of development, as we previously only heard of much lower version numbers, a known developer on the ResetERA forums <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-games-with-ps5-pro-enhancements.1026072/post-135903003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that version 9.60 isn't the upscaler's latest version, although they couldn't add more on the matter for the time being before checking if something changed in NDAs regarding the upscaler.</p>
<p>A few days earlier, the aforementioned developer also revealed some <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-games-with-ps5-pro-enhancements.1026072/post-135644619" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interesting information</a> on the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler which suggests that already available older games powered by Unreal Engine 4 may not support the upscaler beyond the initial version. According to the developer, UE4, by default, only supports the initial PSSR version, and with official support from Epic on the engine's updates not being available anymore, developers need to backport snippets of Unreal Engine 5 code to use newer SDKs and thus never versions of the PSSR more upscale. This is the reason some <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-playstation-5-pro-new-patch-updates-pssr-to-latest-version-improves-image-quality/">patches</a> took time to implement more recent versions of the upscaler, and why some games may never get support for them, as this backporting of UE5 code requires time that some development teams may not have.</p>
<p>The PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler is only one of the many features that define the PlayStation 5 Pro. You can learn more about the system in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-release-date-revealed-for-july.1111335/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bushiroad Games and Arc System Works have announced the release date for upcoming anime fighter&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact</em>, which will serve as the first major fighting game adaptation of the popular manga and anime.</p>

<p>As revealed during this weekend's Evo event,&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>will launch on July 17th. When it does, you'll be able to play it on PC, PS5, and Switch. No release has been announced for Xbox.</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunter-x-hunter-fighting-game-announced-at-jump-festa" rel="nofollow">announced in December 2023</a>,&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>was originally scheduled for a 2024 release, but in September, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-delayed-rollback-netcode" rel="nofollow">it was delayed</a> in order to allow the developers to add rollback netcode to the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-release-date-fight.jpg?itok=LTE_vL72 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-release-date-fight.jpg?itok=KYgsXwlR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>is locked in for a July launch.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering what rollback netcode is, it's essentially tech that improves the quality of an online fighting game experience.</p>

<p>The long explanation is very technical, but in short, rollback netcode "rolls back" the state of the game if it detects a delay, but retains your own inputs, which makes online fights feel much more smooth.</p>

<p>Rollback netcode has been implemented in a number of hugely successful fighting games, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-fighterz-rollback-netcode-ps5-xbox" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em></a>, Capcom's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-rollback-netcode-will-be-better-open-worlds-detailed" rel="nofollow"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a>, and Bandai Namco's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/will-tekken-8-have-crossplay-and-rollback-netcode-katsuhiro-harada-responds" rel="nofollow"><em>Tekken 8</em></a>, as well as <i>Nen x Impact&nbsp;</i>publisher Arc System Works' own&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/guity-gear-strive-beta-impressions" rel="nofollow"><em>Guilty Gear Strive</em></a>.</p>

<p>In short, while a delay to&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>was unfortunate, it was put into effect so the developers could make it a more satisfying online experience, which it's hard to complain about.</p>




<p><em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>is the first "full-fledged" fighting game to be based on the manga and anime series. It's a 3v3 battler in which you can play as a range of characters from the manga, including Gon, Hisoka, and Killua, among others.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check the game out when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456420/HUNTERxHUNTER_NENxIMPACT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10007325" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and Nintendo Switch on July 17th.</p>

Hundreds of millions, possibly billions, have been lost over the past year to the hubristic concept of games people will want to keep playing, and investing in, for years to come. But it’s vital to remember there <em>are</em> live-service games that are still raking it in. One of the most impressive success stories is Ubisoft’s <em>Rainbow 6 Siege</em>, which ten years on from release is due to reveal a major update which is being claimed as “a new era.”</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196299" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="385" data-playlist="196299,195734,195189" data-current="196299"><div><p>You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21849.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Rainbow Six Siege X</em>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/1yyppDElemqVlUXSVif55M&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/1yyppDElemqVlUXSVif55M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is described by Ubisoft</a></span> as “the biggest transformation in the game’s history,” with the obvious aim to refresh the aging multiplayer game for the foreseeable future. This will involve new game modes, “deepened tactical gameplay,” and most likely a significant graphical tidying up. The ambiguity here is because, in the tiresome way of modern life, this is all based on a teaser for a teaser, the announcement that there’s to be The Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase on March 13. It’s to be a live event, taking place in Atlanta, Georgia, but obviously will be streamed online <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via the game’s Twitch channel</a></span>.</p><p><em>Siege</em> first launched in 2015, and was a flabby <em>Counter-Strike-</em>me-do, with poor sales. Ubisoft cannily switched to the live-service model, and over the next few years persisted with the game, reinventing it with free DLC, until it had become something enormously loved, and hugely successful. Yes indeed, it’s hard to imagine, but instead of just junking years of work and hundreds of millions of dollars spent, developers instead worked incredibly hard to bring the game to the point of massive popularity. Bewildering.</p><p>Ten years on, it looks like Ubisoft is taking a big gamble, and meddling with the format. All changes bring the threat of a core player-base’s fury, but it looks like the goal with the showcase is to ease everyone in to the second decade of the game’s existence with careful explanation. (There will always be those who would prefer their favorite game wither and die than ever evolve or advance, but they need to shhhhhhhh.)</p><p>Here’s a thought: The brief information about the changes mentions “deepened tactical gameplay,” and I can’t help wondering if there might be a desire to return to <em>Rainbow Six</em>’s roots. When the first game came out in 1998, it was wholly different to the <em>R6</em> people know today. Most significantly, you didn’t control a single character, but rather an entire squad. Those first few games were about <em>planning—</em>you we given detailed briefings about what your team needed to achieve, and then you strategized your approach all before ever showing up. Played best, the bit with soldiers running around was just the unfolding of pre-determined plans, with on-the-fly improvisation if something went wrong.</p><p>It’d be fascinating if <em>Siege</em> were to think about adding modes that re-evoked the series’ original spirit.</p><p>We’ll find out what Ubisoft are actually up to in just under a month.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Spoilers ahead for the players that haven’t caught up with the new Daima series yet, but Goku reached his iconic Super Saiyan 4 transformation again during the latest episode,’ Awakening’, and the form is canon this time. The new Goku SSJ4 Daima transformation draws a lot of inspiration from its GT counterpart, but it is also different in some ways, such as the colours and Goku still being short. The modders have perfectly captured Goku SSJ4 Daima’s essence in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Former Activision-Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, widely regarded as one of the worst CEOs in gaming, believes someone else deserves that title in a textbook case of the pot calling the kettle black.</p>
<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grit podcast</a>, the former Activision Blizzard CEO and former EA chief creative officer Bing Gordon revealed that they used to consider former EA and Unity CEO John Riccitiello as the worst CEO in the video game industry. At Activision, they thought that he was so bad that they hoped he would continue to be CEO so that they wouldn't have to worry about EA, and Activision would have paid for Riccitiello to be the EA CEO forever. Quite a statement, considering everything that happened at the publisher during Kotick's long tenure, which included prolonged workplace harassment, of which he was reportedly aware for years, that led to <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-california-lawsuit-discrimination-harassment/">a lawsuit in California.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="#229 Bobby Kotick, former CEO of Activision Blizzard; and Bing Gordon, Advisor at Kleiner Perkins" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D2urSgcuyyo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bobby Kotick has been Activision Blizzard's CEO for over two decades, sitting at the head of the publisher since he took over in 1991. He stayed as CEO for <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-kotick-depart/">a few weeks</a> after Microsoft's acquisition of the publisher finally went through as per Phil Spencer's request, and finally stepped down on January 1st, 2024. He has always been regarded by many as the actual worst CEO in gaming, although the former EA and Unity CEO could give him a run for his money, as Riccitiello has been involved in a multitude of anti-consumer controversies, including attempting back in late 2023 to introduce <a href="https://wccftech.com/unity-suffers-huge-backlash-for-runtime-fee-based-on-installs-then-rushes-to-clarify-some-points/">a runtime fee for the Unity engine</a> which would essentially charge developer per install. The backlash was so severe that Riccitiello had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-steps-down-following-runtime-fee-fiasco/">step down as CEO of the company </a>shortly after the whole fiasco.</p>

			<p>Okami 2 is being developed using the RE Engine, and fully realizing Hideki Kamiya's vision for the game wouldn't have been possible without it.</p>
<p>Speaking with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kami-2-is-being-made-in-re-engine-confirmed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>, Machine Head Works producer Kiyohiko Sakata confirmed the long-awaited new entry in the series will indeed use the engine that has powered all major CAPCOM games since Resident Evil 7.&nbsp;The studio's experience with the engine will aid Clovers, who has no experience with it, in the development of the game.</p>
<p>As for why Okami 2 is being developed using the RE Engine, CAPCOM producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi confirmed that the engine was picked because, without it, they wouldn't have been able to realize Hideki Kamiya's artistic vision for the game. The game's director himself added that the engine is famous for <em>"showing the best of the games that they have"</em> and that it is very good <em>"expressively"</em>, so it definitely sounds like the game is going to be a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>The announcement of Okami 2 was among the biggest surprises revealed during last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/">The Game Awards show</a>. The only teaser shown to date essentially confirmed that Amaterasu will come back in the new game and that it will feature an updated version of the original's unique visual style. Better yet, as already mentioned, it will be directed by Hideki Kamiya, the director of the original as well as the creator of some of the best action game series ever made, such as Devil May Cry and Bayonetta.</p>
<p>Okami 2 is currently in development for yet to be confirmed platforms. Its release date has yet to be announced as well, so it may be a while until we see how the RE Engine has made it possible for Kamiya-san's vision to realize his vision.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase-date-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft has a big launch on the new through Rainbow Six Siege X—a successor to 2015’s Siege. More original Siege content is on the way, but it looks like Rainbow Six Siege X is replacing its predecessor, and offering big upgrades.</p>



<p>Fun Fact: I got Rainbow Six Siege shortly after release and ended up selling it a few months later because <em>I couldn’t stop playing it</em>. Siege greatly disrupted my single-player gaming, and I decided to end the relationship. I fondly look back on those early days, and 10 years later, the game is as celebrated as ever. It’s a huge esports hit, the gameplay is still strategic and intricate, and tens of thousands of players still hop on each day.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-2-reveal-si-2025-rumour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siege 2 rumor</a> gained huge traction in January 2025. The leak came to fruition with the announcement of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siege X</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-rainbow-six-siege-x-release-date">Do we Know The Rainbow Six Siege X Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>10 years of history. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no release date locked in for Rainbow Six Siege X, nor a vague release period.</strong></p>



<p>Common sense suggests Siege X will likely be released following the conclusion of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-y10s1-reveal-prep-phase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rainbow Six Siege Y10</a>. This isn’t factual though, so be sure to check back as we update you.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase-date">When is The Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase Date?</h2>



<p><strong>The Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase is penciled in for March 13 at 10 AM PT / 6 PM CT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT.</strong></p>



<p>A <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/4IUTIzwOdeRG4l3ms7h1Dz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft article</a> confirmed Siege’s X Showcase date. “A new era of&nbsp;Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp;will be revealed on <strong>March 13</strong> at the Siege X Showcase,” it said. The Showcase will show us every aspect of Siege X and its new changes compared to the original.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-rainbow-six-siege-x-showcase">How to Watch Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase</h2>



<p><strong>Ubisoft has confirmed you can check out the full Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase by watching the action unfold on the Ubisoft Twitch Channel.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft Rainbow6 Twitch Channel</a> is the home of all things Rainbow Six Siege. So it makes sense for Siege X to be unveiled here. It remains to be seen if any YouTube channels also broadcast the Showcase.</p>



<p>Keep your eyes peeled for alternative sources—as will we.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-rainbow-six-siege-x">What is Rainbow Six Siege X?</h2>



<p><strong>Rainbow Six Siege X is described as a “major evolution” of Siege, but it isn’t considered a sequel or normal update.</strong></p>



<p>Ubisoft game director Joshua Mills revealed Siege X aims to keep <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siege around for the next 10 years</a>. He raised expectations for Siege X at the Rainbow Six Invitational: “It is not Siege 2, and it’s not just another update. It’s a major evolution. We’re expanding and reinforcing the very foundation of Siege to ensure it remains the pinnacle of tactical PvP first-person shooters.”</p>



<p>“Graphical and audio upgrades, deepened tactical gameplay, and new ways to play the game,” are also at the forefront of Siege X’s marketing ahead of the Showcase.</p>



<p>Check out its first teaser trailer below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>I imagine Siege X is following in the footsteps of Overwatch 2 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-hits-all-time-player-peak-on-steam-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CS2</a> by being a massively upgraded free-to-play enhancement of the original. If so, we can start dreaming of the new content, gameplay mechanics, and much more Ubisoft has in store.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s no secret Ubisoft needs a big win in the next year. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-preorders-in-line-with-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> might not be enough, but Siege continues to do the business. Does the prospect of X get you amped up? Which new features and twists does Siege X need to separate itself from the OG Siege?</p>



<p>Don’t be afraid to jump into Rainbow Six Siege now if you haven’t already. Let’s answer some common questions about Siege: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-rainbow-six-siege-cross-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Does it have crossplay?</a> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-rainbow-six-siege-have-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is cross-progression enabled?</a> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-rainbow-six-siege-have-a-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">And is there a Rainbow Six Siege Campaign?</a></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/17/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-review.1111281/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/17/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Citizen Sleeper is, in my opinion, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/24/game-of-the-year-2022-best-narrative/">one of the best narrative games ever produced</a>. It deals with massive themes of self, sacrifice, desperation, and the impact of choice in such a way that you can agonise over every story beat. It would always be a tough act to follow, but that follow up has arrived in Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector, bringing a new story, a wider location, and with added gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Citizen Sleeper 2 - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ytLVnt3skzI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector follows the path of a new Sleeper and not the protagonist from the original, but there are similarities between the two. Just like the original Sleeper, the new Sleeper is on the run and trying to find their freedom, though in this case it is a criminal gang boss that is the pursuer rather than a mega corporation. They’re in far worse shape, though, with a memory full of holes and a body that is failing and glitching, and which is getting worse as time progresses.</p>


<p>Instead of being confined to a single space station, you’ll now be able to visit other places by jumping in your Rig. This Rig needs a crew, and this another new thing as you recruit crew members who can help on missions.</p>


<p>In Citizen Sleeper, your character needed stabiliser to continue functioning, but here that is not the case due to changes in how the new Sleeper operates. The risk now comes from stress and broken or glitched dice, with the former also having an impact on crew behaviour in missions. If a dice breaks it can be repaired, provided you have the components to carry those repairs out, whereas glitched dice become permanent and more numerous as the Sleeper’s system glitches build up.</p>
<p>Where a regular dice has different odds depending on its value, a glitched dice’s outcome value will always be 20% positive / 80% negative, meaning you are only likely to be successful with a glitched dice 1 in 5 times. The impact of stress impacts decision making and performance. The higher the stress level the worse your outcomes are likely to be, including dice breaking. If a crew member’s stress level reaches maximum during a contract mission they will abandon their role, removing their two dice and their skills from the equation.</p>
<p>The crew of the Rig is integral to the success of missions, with each having a combination of skills that can complement the Sleeper’s skills to get through missions efficiently. Ideally, you pick crew that have different skills to your Sleeper, and ones that will be viable on mission. However, as you will not know which skills you need on missions, you may make the wrong choice and take someone whose skills do not lend themselves to the task at hand. However, this does not make them useless, as you can still use their dice but with a penalty imposed. For example, if a crew member has a dice valued at six, the value will go down to four if used for a task they have no proficiency with. There was also a Push ability that lets you re-roll dice in the hope of getting higher values for the lowest value dice. Outside of missions, you can have the crew do odd jobs to acquire money or source fuel and food supplies, needed for travel and survival alike.</p>

<p>Narrative is the core aspect of the Citizen Sleeper, and each location in Citizen Sleeper 2 has its own stories occurring, which feed into the bigger arc. On one station there is talk of mutiny, while on another the focus is on growing food to be self-sustainable. There are the relationships between the characters to take into account too, with a few familiar faces popping up from the first game, with these also having an impact on some of the story progressing.</p>
<p>While Citizen Sleeper 2 has some very good writing, it doesn’t quite hit the same heights as the original. The story is still quite personal, but in the first game the story and relationships felt a lot more impactful. The writing is very good too yet, again, in the first game it came across as more concentrated and harder hitting. Branching out in terms of the scope is welcome in this sequel, but some of that magic from the original has been spread a bit thinner here.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I feel it comes down to the glitched and broken dice and the frustrations that they can cause. Either&nbsp;one or the other system would have been plenty of change to the original game, while both can make completing tasks much tougher than necessary.</p>

            <p>The Last of Us' Neil Druckmann has said making sequels to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s beloved franchises requires a level of confidence that, believe it or not, he claims he doesn't have.</p>
<p>Speaking during the DICE summit last week with fellow game developer Cory Barlog, the Last of Us' director was asked: "How do you and your teams approach character development over multiple games?"</p>
<p>Barlog said he had "way too much of the Charlie Day crazy conspiracy board" method of planning, referring to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nTpsv9PNqo">that Pepe Silvia scene from Always Sunny in Philadelphia which has become a bit of a meme</a>. But Druckmann, meanwhile, said he had a different approach, as he "never [thinks] about multiple games".</p>

<p>"The game in front of us is so all consuming," Druckmann explained (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-creator-neil-druckmann-says-he-never-plans-for-sequels-that-requires-a-level-of-confidence-i-dont-have">IGN</a>). "I think you're jinxing yourself if you're starting to think about the sequel when you're working on the first game. So when I was making The Last of Us 2, yeah, sure. Every once in a while an idea pops in your head of where it might go if we get the chance to do another one. But I just approach it as, 'what if I never get to do another one?' ...I'm not saving some idea for the future. If there's a cool idea, I'm doing my best to get it into here."</p>
<p>Druckmann said that, when a sequel to a game does come around, it's only then that he looks back on what the studio has already done, to decide where story points and characters can go. "And if I feel like the answer is, they can't go anywhere, then I go, 'I think we'll just kill them off'," he said.</p>
<p>"I'm half joking, but we just find the next game," Druckmann continued. "When we made Uncharted 1, we had no idea we would do the train sequence of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted-2-among-thieves">Uncharted 2</a>, or where Nathan Drake would be. We figured it out when we made Uncharted 2. And eventually, [it was] the same when we worked on Uncharted 3, [and the] same when we worked on Uncharted 4, where we look back and say: 'How do we not repeat ourselves? Where else could this character go? What else could get him back into the adventure?'</p>
<p>"And we have to come up with a new answer. And if we don't have a new answer then we should ask ourselves, is this the right character? Is this the right game for us to work on? Or is it time to find something new?"</p>
<p>Barlog, meanwhile, said he found connecting elements in games today with something he worked on a decade or so ago "magical", although noted this has its own stresses.</p>
<p>"It is absolutely, unequivocally the most unhealthy thing ever, because it is insanely stressful to try to fold and connect each of these pieces," Barlog shared. "Because, give or take five years, there's hundreds of people involved, and then a whole new group of people often are moved in on the next project. That's a bunch of different... perspectives, and likes and dislikes that are going to negatively impact you setting something up that early. And they're going to be like, 'Let's talk about this, because that was kind of the dumb. I don't know if I want to do that.'"</p>
<p>"I think for me that requires a level of confidence I just don't have," Druckmann responded. "Like this is going to be so successful, I know where this is going next. I'm like, I just want to focus on the next five days in front of me, let alone 10 years down the line."</p>

<p>Back in 2021, Druckmann said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-3-has-a-story-outline-neil-druckmann-hopes-will-one-day-see-the-light-of-day">Naughty Dog had a story outline for The Last of Us 3 penned</a> that he hoped "one day can see the light of day". However, at this time, nothing was in development.</p>
<p>Then in 2023, Druckmann reiterated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-moving-on-from-uncharted-open-to-the-last-of-us-part-3-if-it-has-a-compelling-story">Naughty Dog is open to developing Part 3</a>, but only if "[the team] can come up with a compelling story that has this universal message and statement about love", as it did with Parts 1 and 2.</p>
<p>"With The Last of Us, it's up to us whether we want to continue it or not... If we can't come up with something, we have a very strong ending with Part 2 and that will be the end," Druckmann said at the time.</p>
<p>At the Game Awards in December, Naughty Dog lifted the lid on its upcoming game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">a sci-fi hack 'n' slash called Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>FromSoftware has confirmed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will receive post-release DLC, leading to speculation over what could be included.</p>
<p>Over on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/">Steam page</a>, the description originally included the line "Additional DLC - Additional playable characters and bosses" (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/elden-ring-nightreigns-steam-page-lets-slip-itll-have-dlc-bosses-and-player-characters/">PC Gamer</a>), though this has since been removed.</p>
<p>The DLC will be available by Q4 2025, though no further details are known.</p>

<p>The Steam page went up alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-announced-by-fromsoftware">news of the game's release date</a> and pre-orders beginning, all ahead of the network test that took place over the weekend.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-first-network-test-suffers-server-issues-due-to-congestion">network test initially failed</a>, with players unable to access the first session. FromSoftware was forced to reboot the servers due to congestion.</p>
<p>The rest of the test appears to have been a success, giving players a look at what to expect in the final game.</p>
<p>The test features four playable Nightfarers, but FromSoftware has confirmed the final game will include eight. However, it looks like more will be included in the forthcoming DLC.</p>
<p>It's hard to speculate on who these will be, considering we still don't know who the remaining four will be. The existing four from the network test - Wylder, Guardian, Recluse, Duchess - fit the typical all-rounder, tank, mage, rogue classes, but perhaps others will parallel the likes of the Wretch or Samurai classes from the base game.</p>
<p>As for additional bosses, there's plenty of potential for FromSoftware to add to the game, be that through additional Nightlords or special randomised events. We know already it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms">cherry-picking from across the Souls games</a> - the network test included the Centipede Demon from Dark Souls 1, for instance, while the game's trailer shows The Nameless King from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>.</p>
<p>What we've seen so far, though, has been only the bosses leading to one of the eight Nightlords, so there's still potential for the likes of Malenia or Maliketh to show up in the base game. We've seen nothing of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> though, so perhaps the DLC could add Messmer or other bosses from the expansion, alongside more enemies from past games?</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">Elden Ring Nightreign hands-on preview</a>, there's plenty of potential for FromSoftware to expand the game into a full live-service offering with constant updates and challenges. However, the existence of (presumably paid) DLC suggests this will be a fixed release instead.</p>
<p>We'll know more by the time Nightreign releases on 30th May this year. Did you get into the network test? What did you think?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s been over five years since the game was announced back during Microsoft’s X019 presentation. Repeated no-shows during Xbox showcases and rumors of reboots have caused some to wonder whether Everwild had fallen by the wayside. Not so, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/15/xboxera-interviews-phil-spencer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XboxEra</a>, Spencer listed Everwild as one of the games yet to come out that he was excited for, adding he’d recently visited UK studio Rare, which runs live service pirate adventure game Sea of Thieves, to get a look at Everwild and the progress the developers were making. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, State of Decay is just one of the franchises I love back from the original one, so that one stays on the board. I do think the work that Double Fine’s doing and how Tim [Schafer] kind of solicits feedback from the team. And the other one, I’ll say because I was recently out at Rare. It’s nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they’re making.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Spencer said Microsoft had been able to give the developers of those games (State of Decay, the next game from Double Fine, and Everwild) time while still having a packed schedule of releases (bolstered, obviously, by the acquisitions of Bethesda and Activision Blizzard).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can give those teams time,” Spencer said. “And next week I’m going to be up in Vancouver with the Coalition [Gears of War developer] — and how fun is that?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Everwild, it’s faced concern over the years after the aforementioned reboot rumor, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everwild-reboot-matt-booty-comments">which Microsoft has denied</a>, and the exit of creative director Simon Woodroffe in 2020. Rare filled the director's chair with veteran designer Gregg Mayles, who previously worked on Donkey Kong Country, Banjo-Kazooie, Viva Pinata, and Sea of Thieves.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But what is Everwilds? Reports have indicated it’s a third-person adventure game with god game elements, but given how long it’s been in development, that may have changed. The last Everwilds trailer, released in July 2020, carried the following description: “Everwild is a brand new IP from Rare. A unique and unforgettable experience await in a natural and magical world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has a long list of in-development games, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/perfect-dark-reboot">Perfect Dark reboot</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-halo-games-moving-to-unreal-engine-as-developer-343-industries-officially-changes-its-name">the next Halo</a>, and Playground's new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-fable-reboot-shown-off-with-new-trailer-and-a-2025-release-window-xbox-games-showcase-2024">Fable</a> game.

			<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer mentioned Rare's Everwild game in an appearance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q20AFtPXKSQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the 250th episode of the Xbox Era podcast</a>. During the 36-minute-long conversation, the executive named it among his most anticipated games (among those that have been announced) alongside State of Decay 3 and the next project from Double Fine.</p>
<p><em>I'll go back to what I said earlier. State of Decay is just one of the franchises I love, back from the original one, so that one stays on the board. I do think the work that Double Fine is doing and how Tim (Schafer) kind of solicits feedback from the team [is great]. And the other one I'll say, because I was recently out at Rare, it's nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they're making.</em></p>
<p><em>It has been a while. We've been able to give those teams time in what they're doing, which is good, and still have a portfolio like we have, which is a dream that Matt [Booty] and I have had for a long time, so it's finally good to be there. We can give those teams time. Next week, I'm gonna be up in Vancouver with The Coalition.</em></p>
<p>Everwild was <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-rare-new-ip-x019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> over five years ago, before COVID-19, during the X019 event. Over the years, though, it became clear that Rare didn't really have a clear picture of what they were doing yet. Development was <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-rebooted-from-scratch-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly rebooted</a> in 2021 due to the game being <a href="https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-obsidian-rpg-project-missouri-20220-everwild-real-mess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'a real mess'</a>.</p>
<p>A few months ago, Windows Central's Jez Corden - who's always well-informed on what's going internally at Xbox Game Studios - <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-is-reportedly-progressing-well-at-long-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the game had finally nailed the gameplay loop. The new statement from Spencer confirms this is true, so people can start looking forward to a reveal in the foreseeable future. Indeed, the British studio had already kind of <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-christmas-card-has-rare-fans-hyped-about-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> its fans with a nice Everwild themed Christmas card.</p>
<p>At any rate, the game may be shown again during the upcoming June Showcase, but don't expect it to launch this year. Microsoft already has a big lineup for 2025: following <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avowed</a> (out tomorrow, although Premium Edition owners can already play it), Compulsion Games is set to release <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-hands-on-preview-bottling-up-the-trauma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a> next month, then id Software will follow with <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-is-the-biggest-and-best-game-weve-ever-made-says-id-story-is-out-of-the-codex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> in May, and Fable <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-q4-2025-gears-of-war-e-day-before-that-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supposedly in the final quarter of the year</a>. That's not even counting Ninja Gaiden 4 (which is being published by Xbox Game Studios), the rumored launch of Gears of War: E-Day, and new stuff from Activision Blizzard, like the upcoming Call of Duty.</p>
<p>Everwild may instead be part of the 2026 lineup alongside Clockwork Revolution, Perfect Dark, and the next game from Double Fine, ensuring yet another potentially great year for Microsoft as a publisher. Indeed, it seems like all the money spent on acquisitions is finally paying off now that the developers have hit their stride as part of the Xbox family.</p>

            <p>One of video gaming's great urban fabulists, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> art director and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> visual designer Viktor Antonov, has died at the young age of 52. </p><!--more-->
<p>While there has yet to be a formal announcement from Antonov's family, several of his old colleagues have posted goodbye messages on social media. "I didn't want to say much till I felt it was confirmed, but I learned today that Viktor Antonov, our visionary art lead on HL2, has died," <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> writer Marc Laidlaw wrote in an Instagram post passed on by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-and-dishonored-art-lead-viktor-antonov-dies-aged-just-52">Eurogamer</a>. "I don't have details. Just sadness. Brilliant and original. Made everything better."</p>
<p>"RIP Viktor Antonov," <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1891089643929542914">added</a> WolfEye Studios creative director and Arkane founder Raphael Colantonio on Twitter. "I wish I told you how much admiration I had for you but we get caught in our lives until a surprise lime this hits us. You were instrumental to the success of Arkane Studios and an inspiration to many of us, also a friend with whom I have many fond memories."</p>
<p>Born in Sofia, Bulgaria, Antonov started out in gaming as a map painter for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redneck-rampage">Redneck Rampage</a> in 1997. He subsequently worked on art deco-inspired shooter Kingpin: Life Of Crime, before landing a reputation-making job at Valve in 2004. He was the principle mind behind Half-Life 2's City 17, a wintry expanse of Brutalist concrete and Combine panopticons, which continues to influence more pessimistic sci-fi game developers today. I'm confess, I'm more fond of his achievements as visual designer for Dishonored's oily brickwork labyrinth Dunwall.</p>
<p>Following the release of Dishonored, Antonov worked in more of a supporting role on several ZeniMax Media projects. He consulted on development of 2016's Doom reboot and 2017's Prey. He also worked on a number of cancelled games, including Arkane's hybrid FPS <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crossing">The Crossing</a> and Bethesda Game Studios Austin's multiplayer offering Battlecry. In 2022, Antonov co-founded Eschatology Entertainment to work on the mysterious Project DG, a game about a gunslinger exploring a world "on the verge of destruction".</p>
<p>Rest in peace.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>'s next "major patch" is here, introducing "1700 improvements and fixes to all aspects of the game: balance, locations, quests, blockers, crashes, performance, more A-Life 2.0 fixes, you name it".</p>
<p>The team thanked players for reporting their issues - "this work wouldn't have been possible without your feedback and comments on your personal experience with the Zone" - before detailing the fixes on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/579378232238800945">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>It follows a previous major patch from developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-receives-first-major-patch-including-a-life-fixes">which addressed over 1800 issues back in December</a>.</p>
<p>Audio, cutscenes and VO have been improved with almost 100 fixes, "each aimed to enhance your game experience". There have also been over 450+ improvements made to Stalker 2's regions and locations, 120+ to player guidance and settings, 30+ to interactable objects and zone experience, and 130 buffs to side missions and encounters. </p>
<p>A whopping 300 adjustments have been made to main story quests, too, including issues with a boss fight and disappearing NPCs.</p>
<p>50+ bugs have been squished in your player gear and state, and over 100 when it comes to optimisation and crashing.</p>
<p>You can also expect to see improved AI, better NPC shooting accuracy, boosted stealth, and improved mutant behaviour in combat.</p>
<p>"Thanks for staying with the Zone! As always, we will continue to listen to your feedback and comments, and share game updates as soon as possible," the team concluded. "If you spot an 'anomaly' that is not supposed to be in the game, please report it to our colleagues in Tech Support Hub. That will help us investigate potential issues faster."</p>
<p>At its launch in November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2</a> was criticised for its performance issues. However, in an interview with Eurogamer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delaying-stalker-2-again-not-an-option-studio-says-team-worked-until-it-was-broken-by-marathon-development">GSC Game World's CEO Ievgen Grygorovych said delaying the game was not an option</a>.</p>
<p>"You're so tired that you would just die if you say let's run an additional marathon," Grygorovych said at the time. "We didn't have a chance to say let's do it more. We just had a chance of 'let's do until this moment - the release date - as much as we can'."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A team of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo">Diablo</a> speedrunners spent months searching the 1996 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s 2.2 billion valid randomly generated dungeon seeds to find the layout used in a stupidly lucky speedrun they suspected to be illegitimate, says a new report from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/the-diablo-hackers-that-debunked-a-record-speedrun/">Ars Technica's Kyle Orland</a>.</p>
<p>The three minute, 12 second sorcerer run by Maciej "Groobo" Maselewski was first uploaded to Speed Demos Archive in 2009. Watching it "feels like watching someone win the lottery," writes Orland, thanks to a seemingly random streak of entrance and exit stairways right next to each other, allowing for a rapid, safe descent through the dungeon. Groobo lucked out again on the ninth floor, nabbing the <a href="https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Naj%27s_Puzzler_(Diablo_I)">Naj's Puzzler</a> item needed for later teleporting exploits.</p>

<p>Beginning "in earnest last February", a team of tool assisted Diablo speedrunners started trying to recreate the run, using their own custom map generation tool built by "reverse-engineering a disassembled Diablo executable". From Ars:</p>
<blockquote><p>That tool can take any of the game's billions of possible random seeds and quickly determine the map layout, item distribution, and quest placement available in the generated save file. A scanner built on top of that tool can then quickly look through those generated dungeons for ones that might be optimal for speedrunning.</p></blockquote>
<p>The team's initial goal here was just to learn from Groobo's run, both for their own speedrunning and as a test case to make sure the scanner worked. The problem? The seed they were looking for didn't actually exist. Groobo had, in other words, made up the whole thing. "We just had a lot of curiosity and resentment that drove us to dig even deeper," a runner named Staphen told Ars. "Betrayal might be another way to describe it," added team member AJenbo. "To find out that this had been done illegitimately... and the person had both gotten and taken a lot of praise for their achievement."</p>
<p>From Ars:</p>
<blockquote><p>In their effort to find Groobo's storied run (or at least one that resembled it), the TAS team conducted a distributed search across the game's roughly 2.2 billion valid RNG seeds. Each of these seeds represents a different specific second on the system clock when a Diablo save file is created, ranging from between January 1, 1970, and December 31, 2038 (the only valid dates accepted by the game).</p></blockquote>
<p>After comparisons failed to turn up a re-creation of Groobo's dungeon containing the level 9 Naj's Puzzler drop, they began to search "impossible seeds" - "which could only be created by using save modification tools to force a creation date after the year 2038". They eventually found dungeons with the drop in the right place, using seeds for the years 2056 and 2074.</p>
<p>They also discovered that the original speedrun video had been spliced together from multiple different runs. "In the end we only found two levels that had come from the same run so at least 13 (probably 15) runs were spliced into one video, which is a lot for a game with just 16 levels,"  AJenbo told Ars.</p>
<p>Other evidence (some of it quite glaring in hindsight) began to pile up afterwards, but do read Ars Technica's full piece for that. Why go to all this trouble for a 27 year old speedrun? "It did harm," speedrunner Cecil told Ars. "Groobo's alleged cheating in 2009 completely stopped interest in speedrunning this category [of Diablo]. No one tried, no one could."</p>
<p>If that's all left you feeling exhausted at the lurking deception inherent in men's souls, Here's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stay-awhile-and-play-this-free-diablo-inspired-indie-as-the-mayor-of-tristram">free Diablo-inspired indie</a> where you play as the mayor of Tristam - an upstanding chap by all counts.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Mass Effect 2 in particular is often cited as one of the greatest action role-playing games ever made, and Wall’s soundtrack, which includes the rousing ‘Suicide Mission,’ is considered a series high-point by fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Wall failed to return for 2012’s Mass Effect 3, which came as a shock to fans. Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/feb/14/the-making-of-mass-effect-2-music-soundtrack" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>, Wall discussed why, pointing to a falling out with then Mass Effect development chief Casey Hudson.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Casey was not particularly happy with me at the end,” Wall said. “But I’m so proud of that score.

I handed it in, and they had to do a lot of massaging on their end in order to get it to work, but they did it... and the result is still one of the best ending sequences to a game that I’ve ever played. It was worth all that effort.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Mass Effect 2, Wall went on to make music for Call of Duty games, most recently composing the soundtrack for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a>.

		<p>Ubisoft has announced Rainbow Six Siege X, a big overhaul for the long-running online tactical shooter, which will be revealed in full at the Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase on 13th March&nbsp;at 5pm GMT.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege X Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4vvBU-1CCY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“A new era is on the horizon for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> – one that sets the stage for the years to come of tactical and unique gameplay,” the team writes in the announcement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The R6 team has been working tirelessly to bring to life the biggest transformation in the game’s history and its purpose is to reinforce Rainbow Six Siege’s position at the top of tactical first-person shooters by introducing new ways to play, deepened tactical gameplay, refined game feel and major upgrades all around.”</p>
<p>The teaser trailer could be seen to hint at a back to basics review of the game, focusing on the little scouting drone and explosive charges, but also giving little hints at new or improved gameplay. In particular, the helicopter hovering over a building implies a helicopter spawn and rappel, and of the special forces teams running along walls that they are tethered to – from my memory, this would be a quite significant speed up of the grappled movement. The chained explosions also suggest more interactivity through the environment.</p>

<p>And I say “from my memory” because it’s coming up on the 10 year anniversary of Rainbow Six Siege. The game launched in December 2015, reshaping the series from its roots as a single player or PvE co-op shooter first, to being multiplayer first. It featured destructible environments at its core, enabling players to reshape the levels, open up new firing angles and defensive or attacking positions.</p>
<p>While many still hanker for the a single player mode in the vein of R6 Vegas, R6 Siege proved to be a massive success for Ubisoft, gathering over 70 million players through its first five years, and becoming a staple of the genre thanks to the ‘games as a service’ approach of having regular seasonal updates that added new characters and maps to play. While remaining popular, the game has come in for criticism at times for how outlandish some of the new agents have become, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/28/rainbow-six-extraction-review-ps5-xbox-pc/">a zombie-ish spin-off proved to be…. less successful</a>.</p>
<p>10 years is a long, long time in video games, and keeping players engaged and active is no small feat. We look forward to seeing what Rainbow Six Siege X brings when it is revealed next month.</p>

            <p>
Rainbow Six Siege is getting its biggest overhaul ever, Ubisoft has announced, and looks set to be retitled as Rainbow Six Siege X.
</p>
<p>
This year marks the 10th anniversary of Ubisoft's ever-popular tactical shooter - the company's biggest and longest-running success of the last decade outside of Assassin's Creed. 
</p>
<p>
This weekend, Ubisoft revealed a teaser video for Rainbow Six Siege X, and described it as "the biggest transformation in the game's history" that was set to introduce "new ways to play, deepened tactical gameplay, and major upgrades all around!"

<p>
A full reveal will follow in March, on Thursday 13th at 5pm UK time, but there's a few things we can discern today. 
</p>
<p>
In a blog post, Ubisoft describes Rainbow Six Siege X as "a new era" for its game, "one that sets the stage for the years to come" that's designed to "reinforce Rainbow Six Siege's position at the top of tactical first-person shooters". 
</p>
<p>
So - a sequel, this is not.
</p>
<p>
Footage teasing next month's showcase simply features shots from the current Rainbow Six Siege, meanwhile. How different will the Rainbow Six Siege X actually look?
</p>
<p>
Fan feedback to the teaser has been positive, with many hoping that Ubisoft uses this update as an opportunity to strip back some of the many additions that have been added to Siege over the past 10 years - at least as an option, to allow fresh fans an easier route into the game.
</p>
<p>The announcement comes as Ubisoft seeks to double down on its strengths - including lots of Assassin's Creed - while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-pre-orders-solid-in-line-with-series-second-biggest-launch">the company continues to cut costs</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets-report">court a potential sale</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> producer Ryozo Tsujimoto has acknowledged the importance of the PC platform, and why crossplay will be included in the game.</p>
<p>"Yeah, there are more players than ever playing on PC, including in Japan," Tsujimoto told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-lead-producer-agrees-pc-gaming-is-key-for-japanese-games-there-are-more-players-than-ever-playing-on-pc-including-in-japan/">GamesRadar</a>, "so we definitely see room for the series to capture new players who haven't tried it before if that's their chosen platform."</p>
<p>Crossplay between PC and console players has been included in Monster Hunter Wilds so that "the choice is yours on which platform you want to play with, and then [you can just] go online and hunt with your friends".</p>

<p>This is also likely a reason Capcom released the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-players-can-test-their-machines-ahead-of-release-with-pc-benchmarking-tool">Monster Hunter Wilds PC benchmark tool</a>, so players can test their system ahead of release.</p>
<p>The huge audience for the game is apparent when looking at SteamDB. The beta for Monster Hunter Wilds reached a concurrent player peak of 463,798, while Monster Hunter World reached 334,684, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> reached 231,360.</p>
<p>For comparison, the beta test's peak is higher than the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of GTA, Take-Two CEO boss Strauss Zelnick recently discussed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-pc-version-teased-by-take-two-boss-acknowledges-platforms-growing-importance">presumed PC release of GTA 6</a>, noting that historically "Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms".</p>
<p>"We have seen PC become a much more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue," he added.</p>
<p>Square Enix is also working on an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">"aggressive" multiplatform strategy</a>, releasing its biggest games on PC following PS5 exclusivity, further highlighting the importance of PC for Japanese companies. Both Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Final Fantasy 16 are now available on PC.</p>
<p>In another interview, with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/monster-hunter-wilds/new-weapon-type">PCGamesN</a>, Monster Hunter Wilds director Yuya Tokuda discussed the possibility of adding a fifteenth weapon type to the game.</p>
<p>"When we start development of games such as World and, recently, Wilds, we always consider whether or not this is the time to add another weapon type,” Tokuda said. "It's not off the table for any particular reason, it’s just that we never really decided that we wanted to for the recent titles."</p>
<p>After all the tweaks and changes made to the existing 14 weapons in Wilds, it's tough to find "a 15th weapon that would actually have a place in that lineup and feel equally as valid as the other weapon types while also not overlapping with them too much".</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is set for release on 28th February across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Jim Trinca went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-preview">hands-on with Monster Hunter Wilds</a> recently and while this series entry is more approachable, it still has its quirks.</p>
<p>"For the MonHun-curious consumer, I recommend caution," he wrote. "The FOMO is real here: Monster Hunter is just one of those things that inspires fandom envy. The people who love it do so vocally and passionately and with an infectious enthusiasm rarely seen elsewhere. But as much as Wilds is eager to roll over and present its tummy to you, it is still a Monster Hunter game, and therefore as marmitey as marmite games come."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We still don't have a firm console release date for Grand Theft Auto 6, but a game peripheral company has now stated it will make its later PC debut in early 2026.</p>
<p>The next entry in Rockstar's series is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">scheduled for consoles this autumn</a>. However, the developer along with publisher Take-Two are keeping things close to their chest when it comes to firm details, particularly on the PC front. Back in May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-publisher-addresses-lack-of-pc-news-stating-rockstar-will-make-more-announcements-in-due-time">Take-Two said Rockstar would "make more announcements in due time"</a>, and then earlier this month it teased a GTA 6 PC release is on the cards but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-pc-version-teased-by-take-two-boss-acknowledges-platforms-growing-importance">the company tends not to "go across all platforms simultaneously"</a>.</p>
<p>Now, however, PC accessories company Corsair Gaming has suggested we could be seeing GTA 6 arriving on PC as soon as early next year.</p>

<p>Speaking during its latest financial results, Corsair Gaming's financial VP Ronald van Veen said:</p>
<p>"GTA 6 is probably the one everyone is talking about. And we'll get a glimpse of that, I think, later on in the year for console. My understanding now, it's going to come out in the fall [autumn] for console, and then early 2026 for PC" (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/gta6s-pc-release-date-is-early-2026-corsair-gaming-believes/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>Should this prove true, this is a pretty speedy move to PC when you consider other Rockstar releases. Red Dead Redemption, for example, first launched all the way back in 2010 across PS3 and Xbox 360. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-red-dead-redemption-pc-tech-review">then arrived on PC last year</a>.</p>

<p>As for its console debut, Take-Two head Strauss Zelnick previously said he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-publisher-not-really-worried-about-xbox-series-s-performance">isn't worried about getting GTA 6 to work on Microsoft's lesser powered Xbox Series S console</a>.</p>
<p>Zelnick simply said the team would always "find a way to support platforms despite different levels of tech", in a bid to alleviate any concerns. "Our labels are really good at that," he said in November. "I'm not really worried."</p>
