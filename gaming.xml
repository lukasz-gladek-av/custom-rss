<figure data-uuid="ec1d4fb898d23"><a title="Skyrim - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ec1d4fb898d23/skyrim-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure><p>Somehow, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/surprise-skyrim-anniversary-edition-lands-on-switch-2-today">Skyrim returned</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, the rumours are true, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition</a> is back (again), as a free Switch 2 upgrade. Making the most of the hardware's updated specs, the new release bundles in a whole host of fancy features, like enhanced performance and resolution, better load times, and Mouse Mode, <em>and</em> it gives us yet another chance to replay the iconic 2011 RPG in all of its <em>fus ro dah</em>-ing glory.</p>
<p>Keen to learn more about this new release, we were recently lucky enough to sit down with Bethesda Creative Director <strong>Matt Carofano</strong> (who was Lead Artist on the original game) to talk all things Skyrim. We chatted about Matt's favourite Skyrim moments, the game's mind-blowing Switch 1 reveal, the re-release process, and, of course, the team's plans for the future.</p>
<p>We began, however, right back at the start of his Skyrim journey. So, don your fanciest armour set, grab a tankard of Velvet LeChance, and prepare for a walk down memory lane.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life (Jim Norman): Let's start back at the beginning. What's your earliest memory of working on Skyrim?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt Carofano (Creative Director):</strong> I remember Todd Howard and I were talking about where we should set this, and we both naturally coalesced around the realm of Skyrim — 'Let's go to that province, it'll be great!'</p>
<p>A lot of that was a reaction to the previous games we had done. The theme of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox/elder_scrolls_iii_morrowind">Morrowind</a> was 'stranger in a strange land,' so very weird, alien, and unusual, with high-fantasy elements. For <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/elder_scrolls_iv_oblivion">Oblivion</a>, we wanted to do more of a traditional European fantasy game. So there was a tonal shift between those games. When we got to Skyrim, we wanted to take a little bit of the strangeness, deeper culture, and more interesting things, but not too alien as we did in Morrowind. The home of the Nords, Skyrim, fit that really well, so we were excited about that province and wanted to work there.</p>
<p>Some of the earliest things I did were making the map and planning out what the world was. So I was looking for references around the world — the <em>real</em> world — of dramatic places that we could put together into a game. For us, the world is the main character and the foundation of the game. It's also inspirational for the team. So if you have this backdrop of frozen lands, a beautiful tundra, this forest in the south, the canyon off to the west, it's inspirational for the designers to write stories. Otherwise, you come at a game, and it's sort of a blank canvas; it's a bit like, 'Oh, what do we do? Who are the people who survive here?' It informs the characters and the quests. So for us, making the world is the first step in pretty much every game we do.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4bedc6ba68f76"><a title="Skyrim - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4bedc6ba68f76/skyrim-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>At what point did you know that you were onto a winner?</strong></p>
<p>It's hard to explain, because I was a fan of the Elder Scrolls before I started working here, and when I was working on Morrowind, I was like, 'This is the greatest thing ever!' I'm obsessive about the games we make, so are the people here. It's always on your mind; you're always thinking, 'What can I add to the game? How can I make it better?' I don't know if that's healthy or not, but that's just the way it works!</p>
<p>We knew Skyrim was something special throughout the development cycle, but really that last period where it all started coming together, and we were playing it and play testing, and you see all the systems layer together, and it's working as a game, I knew we had something good. The team felt it.</p>
<p>Did we know it was going to become what Skyrim became? No, absolutely not. I think it's still a shock to everyone here that Skyrim has been such a popular game, that we have such amazing fans who have played it for over a decade. That's pretty incredible. So none of us take that for granted, and we're really honoured and privileged to have this franchise that people love so much.</p>
<p><strong>You can see Skyrim in a lot of different games and properties that have come out since. What is it about this game that makes it so appealing?</strong></p>
<p>Our motto is, "let you be who you want and play how you want." You can make incredibly varied characters in this game — how they look, their race, all that, but also how they play, the skills you want to get into. So we're very freeing and open-ended.</p>
<p>Additionally, you take that kind of character, and you put them in the world and say, 'We're not going to railroad you to the main story. In fact, we encourage you to ignore it and do whatever you want.' So we write stories that we're really excited about. We think they're good, and we want people to play them, but the true story of the game is what the player does. It might be, 'I made my character and just wandered off in this direction, got into trouble, and it was really fun.' That was different from a lot of other games in the industry.</p>
<p>So there's something exciting about the freedom we allow to go anywhere, play how you want, and tell your own story in this world we made. It's really the ultimate kind of sandbox role-playing game.</p>
<figure data-uuid="5ffb9ecf629f7"><a title="Skyrim - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5ffb9ecf629f7/skyrim-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>I have a very distinct memory of accidentally using a spell in a town and turning the entire place against me. Do you have one of those defining Skyrim memories from your first time playing through it?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, but I'll add on to yours. We made NPCs overreact to what you did. Everyone attacks the chicken in Riverwood, which is the very first town you come to, and then you're wanted. Like there's no getting around it. We talk about that moment a lot, because it's fun and funny, but it just presented itself because we made it a crime to attack the chicken, and the chicken is in the same faction as the town, so the people of the town will defend the chicken. It was initially unintentional and became a bit funny, but it might be a bit punitive. So we discussed how much we wanted to let you get away with playing around in the world without getting into too much trouble, and how quickly we can reset things.</p>
<p>For me, it's the surprise of going somewhere, and the systems of the game overlapping and something unexpected happening. Whether it's a giant is hurting something, then monsters attack, and then a dragon shows up, and you're like, 'This is not what we planned for,' but it turns out to be really fun.</p>
<p><strong>What's the re-release process like for you? How do you approach returning to a game again after working on it for over a decade now?</strong></p>
<p>It's really easy. We're huge fans of Nintendo, love working with them and getting our games to their consoles. And because there's a new console, it's 'Hey, let's bring back one of our most beloved games to the Switch 2 and see how we can improve it and make it the best experience for that console'. Some old fans will keep playing and want to play that version, and then there's a whole new generation who might be getting a Switch 2 for the first time, and that's the first time they've ever played Skyrim. So that's really it.</p>
<p>It's a bit of a joke at this point how often we release Skyrim, but it's a great game. We want everyone to be able to play it in the best way possible.</p>
<p><strong>What was the process like of developing it for the Switch 2? How does it match up against consoles you developed for in the past?</strong></p>
<p>We had previously done the version for the Switch, so this was going back to that and making improvements on it. So it was really an easy development process and actually pretty quick in terms of our timelines. Making the game takes years and years and years, but bringing it to this new console was a much, much faster process.</p>
<p>A lot of it was really just focusing on taking advantage of the new hardware. We can use DLSS now and get better resolution, better performance, and the game loads faster. Switch 2 has the Joy-Con 2 controllers that let you use mouse controls, so we added that. A lot of it is really just, 'How do we take advantage of the Switch 2? What can it do? And [how can we] give players the best version of Skyrim for that console?'</p>
<figure data-uuid="81bcc234f9b41"><a title="Skyrim - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/81bcc234f9b41/skyrim-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What feature are you most pleased to see implemented this time?</strong></p>
<p>There are a couple of things. Overall, it's just general performance. The game performs better, runs smoother, and loads faster. So it's just a better play experience on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Several years after we released Skyrim, we did a remastering process. We spent over a year on that project — I worked on that quite a bit — and we improved the lighting, graphics features, and things like that. That came to the Switch version, but there are some subtleties we can turn up and make better [on Switch 2], particularly the volumetric lighting is nicer on Switch 2. That's something I was personally very excited about, having tweaked all the numbers for the different weathers, fog, and clouds for months and months and months. Getting the best version of that on the Switch 2 is really important to me.</p>
<p><strong>Seeing Skyrim on Switch 1 was such a monumental part of that console's early life. What was it like working with Nintendo on that version?</strong></p>
<p>It was exciting to put one of our modern games on a Nintendo console, and the Switch was super exciting to everybody when it came out. I'm a big Nintendo fan. I have the Switch, I have the Switch 2. I played a lot at home with my family. But seeing it on a portable device was just really cool. And the thought of being able to sit on your couch or go anywhere with this and play a full, deep game like Skyrim that lasts for hundreds of hours was really awesome.</p>
<p>Then it was the fun stuff of getting the sword swing to work with the Joy-Con, or one of our artists here, Christiane Meister, made Zelda assets that we put on that version. As a fan of Zelda, having a Nintendo as a kid, and playing the original Zelda, and then, in a roundabout way, getting some Zelda in a game that I made was really cool.</p>
<p><strong>Were there any other Nintendo franchises that ever crossed your mind as a Skyrim crossover?</strong></p>
<p>It was always Zelda. A fun fact: the [former] voice of Mario [Charles Martinet] is Paarthurnax in Skyrim. So that was pretty cool too. But no, because Zelda is one of the first open-world RPGs, it was pretty awesome to have that connection there.</p>
<p><strong>Skyrim has defined over a decade of your working life now. What other games have really stood out to you in that time and inspired your work?</strong></p>
<p>The one that immediately jumps to my mind is <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/red_dead_redemption_2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>. It took me a little while to get, but once it hooks you, I felt like I was an outlaw at the end of the Wild West, and the experience of living in that world. It's truly a masterpiece of a game.</p>
<p>I love the subtle moments in gaming where you're just riding your horse, appreciating the view, and then some birds fly by. It's things that we love putting into our games to make you feel like you are truly living another life in another world. A lot of games are focused on action and combat. But when you can take a moment and breathe and really experience something else, I think that's some of the best that gaming has to offer. Red Dead Redemption 2 is an amazing, amazing game.</p>
<figure data-uuid="c8daae20ee960"><a title="Skyrim - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c8daae20ee960/skyrim-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>With Skyrim now making the jump, are there any other Bethesda games that we will see come to Switch 2 in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Well, we did just announce that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a> is coming to Switch 2, so that's really exciting. That's coming next year. Past that, nothing else to say! Whether we can do another game or not, I don't know. But it's cool to see. We've come back to Skyrim, and now a Fallout game is going to make that jump, too. We're really excited about that.</p>
<p><strong>As a gamer, what do you make of the Switch 2 so far?</strong></p>
<p>I have a different perspective on Skyrim because I've probably played it more than almost anyone on Earth. I tested and played it for years while we were making it, and then I come back to it every so often when we're making our current games — that can be a Fallout, that can be <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/starfield">Starfield</a>. I revisit our games and see what was special about them, what are the things we want to bring forward? Are there things we want to change or do differently? A lot of us do that here, but I take the time to go back and play our old games and see how that can inform or inspire what we're doing currently.</p>
<p>So getting a chance to play Skyrim again on the Switch 2 was like, 'What was fun about this? How did some of the game systems work here?' It's always a thought on our minds, as we're replaying old stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Are you ever able to just enjoy Skyrim, or is there always a little bit of dev brain going on?</strong></p>
<p>There's always a little bit of dev brain going on, and it even affects gaming in general. I'm currently replaying the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> remaster, but in every game I've ever played, I start the game, I stop, I look at the textures, and I spend time thinking about the technology they're using. I try to turn that off and just enjoy it, but that happens in every game. There are moments, though, even playing Skyrim, where I just get lost in a dungeon, and I'm once again a stealth archer sneaking around killing everybody. It's great.</p>
<p><strong>So, stealth archer is your preferred play style?</strong></p>
<p>It is, and I will stake a claim to being an OG stealth archer because I always play that way. I enjoy the magic system, too, but yes, I played that way internally with the game before it became a meme, but that's okay. I tend to enjoy stealth games in general, so it's fun.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a0d7ce84bce65"><a title="Skyrim - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a0d7ce84bce65/skyrim-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What other assets from the game's early days do you still think hold up today?</strong></p>
<p>At the very beginning of this project, I started building Riverwood. That was our testing ground for the game systems and how the game worked and felt. Every time we started a new game internally, while we were making it, you started in Riverwood, and that was the test. So I built the farm houses there, the stone walls, and the wooden walkways. I was just setting up that location. I did a lot of world art on Skyrim, as well as the art direction. So that's what comes to mind when I think of Skyrim. We had an internal testing loop of starting at Riverwood, then going up to the first dungeon of Bleak Falls Barrow. That was our early, early loop of the game, and later it branched out to a bunch of things. We had a full team working on stuff.</p>
<p>At that point, I jumped over and worked on the College of Winterhold with our designer, Brian Chapin, who was the lead designer of the Mages Guild. So I made that tower in the interior. That was fun to work on for a while, but at that point, there's a huge team going, and I'm more managing the work than building the assets.</p>
<p><strong>It must be interesting to still see your fingerprints on those locations, after all this time.</strong></p>
<p>A little bit for sure. But also, at that point, it was more working with concept artists, art directing, having input on everybody's work, and just guiding people. That's really what it's about. My job is mostly helping everyone's ideas come to fruition in the game and making sure they all gel and work together in a good way.</p>
<p><strong>Was there any inciting inspiration that spawned those towns for you?</strong></p>
<p>It's a mix of things. As I said before, I'd start with a map, design the world, and we would lay out where the towns would go. A lot of that I was doing myself early on. Then I'd work with design on what would work for those locations.</p>
<p>If I jump back to Oblivion, we had a map made, and I drew maps and layouts of all the towns to get ready for the team to work on. Some of that just comes from liking worldbuilding and trying to think of what these things could be. It's almost like being a dungeon master from when you played <strong>D&amp;D</strong> as a kid, but in a professional setting.</p>
<p>With Skyrim, we have awesome concept artists who start painting and drawing, and then the team starts to build it. It becomes a much more collaborative effort. It starts with a few small seeds of things, some ideas, and then we're working with a big team to make it all happen.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a64318c6d508a"><a title="Skyrim - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a64318c6d508a/skyrim-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>And are those ideas still spawning? What else would you like to do in this world in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Ha ha, trick question! There's a lot. All I can say is, yeah, we're working on new things, very, very excited about it, but unfortunately, can't talk about any of that just yet.</p>
<p>But I will say this, I described how we make games as an obsession which never turns off. It seeps into everything. You're out in the world, and you see something cool, it's like, 'Hey, this view, these trees look really amazing. Let's make a mental note, we should recreate that.' It's a weird obsession with getting into the details of life and then how you can bring that to a game and make something interesting.</p>
<p>I did a lot of photogrammetry scanning of rocks and dirt for Starfield — I mean, hundreds of pieces of rock and dirt. I did some travelling and went to Hawaii, and scanned volcanic rock and stuff. But I think it comes from a fundamental excitement of how everything can be interesting if you really pay attention to it and think about how that works, and then recreating that in a virtual world. I think it brings something to it. Everyone here becomes little dungeon masters over our worlds. You research how smithing works or how people fish in real life, so you're making these observations, condensing them, and recreating them into a fantastical setting.</p>
<p>It really just comes from a fascination with life and trying to make something that other people are going to enjoy from that.</p>
<p><strong>That is a very wholesome and somewhat poetic way of dodging the initial question! [laughs]</strong></p>
<p>Oh yes, and we may be doing that again on a future project. There's your answer, right? [laughs]</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag Remake Seemingly Leaked by PEGI Rating for Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>1377235</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As far as worst-kept video game industry secrets for 2025 go, the top two would arguably be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hes-really-here-leon-finally-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-with-a-playstation-store-leak/">Leon Kennedy being in Resident Evil Requiem</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/">Ubisoft's upcoming remake of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a>. After the former had a major leak, which practically confirmed what has long been suspected, the latter has matched it with a leak of its own, as a PEGI rating for Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced was spotted online.</p>



<p>Initially spotted by <a href="https://x.com/CorkbenYT/status/1998396558027440489">X (formerly Twitter) user and YouTuber CorkbenYT</a>, the <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Assassin%27s+Creed+Black+Flag+Resynced">PEGI 18 rating on the official PEGI website is listed as from Ubisoft EMEA</a>. It appears that the "<em>Resynced</em>" subtitle is Ubisoft's play on 'remake' or 'remastered,' and could likely be the new official title for the upcoming remakes that <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-remakes-inbound-ubisoft-boss-confirms/">Ubisoft chief executive officer Yves Guillemot confirmed the company would be doing back in June 2024</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>To be clear, while Guillemot confirmed that players can expect to see remakes of older Assassin's Creed titles from Ubisoft, no individual remake has yet been confirmed, though we've had several rumours that the remakes would start with Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. </p>



<p>Just last month, a new rumour pointed to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/">Black Flag remake arriving sometime in March 2026</a>, which would put it just ahead of Ubisoft's new fiscal year, and it would also mean that unless Ubisoft is looking to shadow-drop this remake, it would be announcing it fairly soon.</p>



<p>That announcement could come <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">during The Game Awards later this week</a>, or, since <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-will-not-host-its-annual-ubisoft-forward-event-this-year/">Ubisoft opted to skip 2025 with its Ubisoft Forward event</a>, we could see that event return in the beginning of 2026 with an event in January or February to announce the remake's arrival in March.</p>



<p>At this point, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-major-changes-rumor/">after this year's rumours</a>, rumours <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-closer-than-we-thought/">from previous years</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/">comments from Edward Kenway's voice actor</a>, the remake is all but confirmed to be coming. All that's left is for Ubisoft to show it off, and hopefully it does so soon.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bethesda-skyrim-port-switch-2-upgrade-free-release-date-trailer-dlc-2000651683</link>
            <guid>1377232</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The never-ending mission to port <a href="https://kotaku.com/its-2021-and-bethesda-has-announced-another-skyrim-port-1847521204"><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> to every possible platform continues</a>. This time, Bethesda has announced that the popular open-world RPG is getting a Switch 2 release. And you don’t have to wait long, as this new port of <em>Skyrim</em> is available now, and is free for previous owners of the game’s Anniversary Edition on Switch.</p> <p>On December 9, Bethesda released a trailer for the Nintendo Switch 2 edition of its <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-rogue-bee-kept-breaking-skyrims-iconic-cart-intro-1847504734">classic 2011 RPG, <em>Skyrim</em></a>. And yup, that sure looks like <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>, a game that feels like it has always been a part of my life and which is visually aging worse than I expected.</p>

  <p>If you already own the Switch version of <em>Skyrim Anniversary Edition</em>, you can download the Switch 2 version for free. If instead you own the older, non-Anniversary Edition version of <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch (yes, there are multiple versions of the game on most platforms now), you’ll need to pay $20 to upgrade.</p>

 <p>So what do you get in this new version of <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2?<a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/fGtFCgI7J9FL3l6oi9j3B/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition-out-now-on-nintendo-switch-2"> Well, Bethesda claims</a> that its popular RPG loads faster and has better performance on Nintendo’s new console when compared to how it ran on the OG Switch. It also boasts enhanced resolution and DLSS anti-aliasing. And yes, it supports Switch 2 mouse controls, motion controls, and Amiibo, and features the old <em>Legend of Zelda</em> exclusive cosmetic DLC seen in the old Switch port.</p> <p>Did the world need yet another way to play <em>Skyrim</em> in 2025? Probably not. But I bet this is going to sell really well, and I can’t wait to write about Skyr<em>i</em>m being ported to the PlayStation 6 in a few years. Meanwhile, we’ll still get to play <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls 6…</em>eventually.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-is-clearly-taking-no-margin-on-its-nano-power-bank-as-it-returns-at-its-lowest-price-for-the-holidays-2000649289</link>
            <guid>1377229</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are officially behind us. It was a week-long celebration of discounts and offers across every category you could possibly think of. Missed grabbing something? Don’t worry. There are new deals for holidays.</p>
<p>Apple users still looking to treat themselves to a reliable power solution without the typical cable mess should consider grabbing the ultra-slim. 5,000mAh Anker Nano power bank. I<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6310/">t usually retails for $55, but thanks to Amazon holiday deal, you can snap it up for just $41 right now, but only if you act fast.</a> The discount applies to all color options, so you can pick the one that complements your phone. Got an iPhone 16 in the stunning Desert Titanium? Go for the golden or the classic black version. Have an all-black model? Add some pop of color to it with the white or green power bank! Be sure to nab the deal quick, as these leftover discounts expire soon. We’re not expecting these to last more than a few more hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6310/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Attaches to Your Phone, Plus Supports Wired Charging</h2>
<p>It’s (mainly) a wireless power bank, featuring an ultra-slim design. At just 0.3 inches thin, it supports Qi2 certification and snaps at the back of your phone to deliver power on the go. Its 15W output is enough to juice your device up without waiting too long. You can expect an iPhone 16 Pro to go from 0 to 25% in just over 40 minutes. We won’t exactly label it as “ultra-fast”, but considering how it becomes a part of your phone and doesn’t make you feel like you’re carrying an extra accessory when out and about, it’s not too bad. The bulky versions offering better speeds are heavier and a bit inconvenient to carry around, so if ease of use and portability are what you’re after, it’s worth it.</p>
<p>Charging may stop automatically when your phone hits 80%, to preserve the battery and prevent overheating. Once your device cools down, the power bank gets back to work. To get you the best of both worlds, it also supports USB-C fast charging, which can get an iPhone 17 from 0 to 25% in 35 minutes. Recharging the power bank itself won’t take forever either. It’s capable of hitting 100% in just under two hours.</p>



<p>Reliability comes from graphene cooling, dual NTC chips, and smart heat control that Anker has packed it with. It says under 104°F, which is 14 degrees cooler than the industry standard for safer charging. Compatibility-wise, it plays nicely with iPhone Series 12 through 17. It won’t work with an iPhone 16e or iPhone SE Series, though. Best of all, you can even top your AirPods using the charger; great for non-stop jamming on the road. The box comes with the power bank itself, USB-C to USB-C charging cable, welcome guide, and a 24-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking for a reliable, fuss-free charging solution that’s super easy to carry around, this Anker Nano power bank offers all that and more. It becomes a part of your phone to provide it the power it needs, plus supports wired charging for when you want to prioritize speeds. This deal brings its price down to just $41, but it expires soon. It was a part of the Amazon’s holiday deals, the discount won’t be around for long either. Act fast before that happens!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/saros-getting-new-look-at-the-game-awards-2025/</link>
            <guid>1377223</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PlayStation has just confirmed that players will receive a new look at Saros at The Game Awards 2025 on December 11. </p>



<p>Saros is the next sci-fi shooter from the hands of Housemarque, the team responsible for bringing us games like Returnal, Nex Machina, Matterfall, and more. They provided players with a look at the title’s gameplay during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-gameplay-release-trailer-state-of-play-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September’s State of Play event</a> and have now confirmed a new look at the title for TGA. </p>







<h2 id="h-saros-pre-order-announcement-expected-at-the-game-awards">Saros Pre-Order Announcement Expected at The Game Awards</h2>



<p>PlayStation confirmed Saros’s presence at The Game Awards 2025 through a new post on their <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1998407291754729536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The post says that players will receive a “new look” for the title, but doesn’t explain what that means. We could receive a new gameplay trailer or a trailer focusing on the narrative bit as well. Some players are also speculating that pre-orders will open that day, as the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-has-been-rated-in-taiwan-pre-orders-expected-imminently/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated in Taiwan</a> recently. </p>



<p>Saros is an entirely new IP from Housemarqye which focuses on a “haunting story of a lost off-world colony on Carcosa under an ominous eclipse.” The key difference between Saros and Returnal gameplay is the presence of permanent resources and progression, which makes every death valuable. Which means that even though the world will change after each death, players can come back stronger with the ability to choose and permanently upgrade their loadout from an evolving set of weapons and suit parts.</p>







<p>In other news, a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider title</a> will be revealed at The Game Awards, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> will appear at the event as well.

                <p>Lego Fortnite Odyssey is getting a Ninjago-themed makeover on Thursday, and for the very first time Epic Games will offer Fortnite versions of Lego characters--with Kai, Cole, Zane, and Jay from the Ninjago TV series all getting human-style Fortnite skins.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYzJvHNmC6A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UYzJvHNmC6A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Kai will actually be the subject of the next Lego Pass--buying the pass for 1,400 V-Bucks, or unlocking it via Fortnite Crew, will instantly unlock both the Lego and Fortnite varieties for Kai. Progressing through the pass from there with XP in any Fortnite experience will grant you a number of Ninjago-themed builds that you can use wherever you like in Lego Fortnite Odyssey, or on your home lot in Lego Fortnite Brick Life.</p><p>The rest of the Ninjago gang will be available in the item shop on Thursday, and you'll be able to buy them individually or in a big bundle that includes all three and their accompanying accessories. Where are Lloyd and Nya, the other two members of the ninja squad from the show? We don't know, but don't count out the possibility they'll be added later--especially since the trailer description teases another major Ninjago update in 2026.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619700-legopasskaioutfit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4619700" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619700-legopasskaioutfit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4619700"></a><figcaption>Kai from Ninjago is becoming fully human for the first time in Fortnite.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619700-legopasskaioutfit.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619702-dragonenemy.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619703-icesanctumscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619704-lightningtemplescreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619705-earthtemplescreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619706-legopasskaioutfit.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619707-premiumrewards-builds.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619708-legofortniteninjago.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4619702,1300-4619703,1300-4619704,1300-4619705,1300-4619706,1300-4619707,1300-4619708" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4619702-dragonenemy.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4619703-icesanctumscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4619704-lightningtemplescreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4619705-earthtemplescreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4619706-legopasskaioutfit.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4619707-premiumrewards-builds.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1757/17577455/4619708-legofortniteninjago.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619702-dragonenemy.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619703-icesanctumscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619704-lightningtemplescreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619705-earthtemplescreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619706-legopasskaioutfit.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619707-premiumrewards-builds.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4619708-legofortniteninjago.jpg"></figure><p>On the gameplay side of this week's update, Lego Fortnite Odyssey is getting a new Ninjago island this week with new weapons, like Nunchuks and Shurikens, as well as new elemental abilities that you'll need to master by questing to Elemental Sanctums around the island. Be warned that when you first load into Lego Fortnite Odyssey after the update you'll start on the Ninjago island, you may want to make sure all your stuff is in safe zones before then.</p><p>With Chapter 7 launching last week alongside a new music pass, Fortnite is just about done making news this year. The December 11 update will include the last new major additions to Epic's metaverse in 2025, with Lego Ninjago, Fortnite OG Season 7, Playboi Carti's new activation, and this year's Winterfest celebration, which should come with free skins.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Video game workers from multiple unions across Europe have released a joint statement pledging a "united front" against industry exploitation.</p>
<p>Last month, delegates from six game worker unions met in Paris for a summit hosted by French union Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo (STJV) to discuss the challenges facing the games industry, and are now demanding better working conditions without threat of layoffs, free from AI, and free from "authoritarian mismanagement".</p>
<p>"Our jobs are under threat, we are denied a voice in our workplaces, and policies such as 'return to office' and tools like generative AI are being forced upon us, even though they degrade our working conditions," the <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/blog/">joint statement reads</a>.</p>
<p>"Multinational companies already operate globally. Game workers already collaborate transnationally. It follows, then, that unions must also organise across borders."</p>
<p>The statement comes from unions in the UK (IWGB Game Workers), France (STJV), Ireland (Game Workers Unite Ireland), Germany (ver.di Game Devs Roundtable), Italy (FIOM-CGIL Milan Work Council) and Spain (Coordinadora Sindical del Videojuego). It follows joint meetings and a solidarity protest outside the Paris office of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>' parent company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">31 members were dismissed from the Grand Theft Auto maker</a>.</p><p>"From these meetings, one thing became absolutely clear: that together, workers can transform their jobs, their careers, and their lives for the better," the statement continues. "We can do something, and we will. We vow to increase cooperation between our unions in both the short and long term, and to stay united in front of all that's going on in our industry and the world."</p>

<p>For the past few years, mass layoffs have rocked the video game industry worldwide. <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">According to one tally</a>, 10.5k employees lost their jobs in 2023, a further 14.6k lost their jobs in 2024, and so far this year an estimated 5.3k have lost their jobs. That's on top of stories such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-alleges-saboteurs-within-the-company-were-behind-its-poor-reception-according-to-new-report">reported mismanagement at MindsEye studio Build A Rocket Boy</a>, as well as widespread use of AI technology - EA CEO Andrew Wilson, for instance, stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-is-the-very-core-of-our-business-says-ea-ceo">AI is "the very core of our business"</a>.</p>
<p>"This is a historic milestone for the video game industry," said IWGB Game Workers delegate Scott Alsworth. "For the first time, we are seeing game workers organising across borders, coordinating campaigns, and standing together in solidarity. For years, there has been a collective sense of isolation, a climate of fear - many have felt powerless and divided in the face of seemingly unstoppable conglomerates. But now, we're marshalling politics in the workplace and learning over again, in adversity, the struggles of the past. That there is indeed strength in unity."</p>
<p>The IWGB Game Workers union has been instrumental in supporting the Rockstar employees who were controversially dismissed back in October. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">union has launched a legal claim against alleged unfair dismissal</a>, which then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">made its way to UK Parliament</a>.</p>
<p>Later, a report claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests">Rockstar employees were dismissed for sharing internal company messages on an employee and union-only Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Well, isn't this a surprise that <em>nobody could have seen coming</em>. Bethesda has today announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim_anniversary_edition">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition</a> is getting a free Switch 2 upgrade. What's more, it's available today!</p>
<p>Any Dragonborns playing on Switch 2 will get to experience the 2011 RPG at an enhanced resolution, with improved load times, performance optimisation, Mouse Mode support and more. Let's not forget that the Anniversary Edition packs in the game's three official expansions — Dawnguard, Dragonborn, and Hearthfire — Creations Club items, and those sweet Zelda crossover assets that we all enjoyed in the Switch 1 base game.</p>
<p>The above reveal trailer gives you a pretty good idea of what we can expect from the game on Switch 2 (<em>it's Skyrim</em>), but you can get an even better look by checking out the images below.</p>

<p>Those with the Switch 1 version of the Anniversary Edition can nab the Switch 2 upgrade for free. Otherwise, you can upgrade from the base game to the Anniversary Edition for £17.99 (or your regional equivalent) or buy the whole thing for £52.99.</p>
<p>We recently sat down with Bethesda Creative Director Matt Carofano to find out more about this new version - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/its-a-bit-of-a-joke-at-this-point-skyrim-dev-on-returning-for-a-switch-2-re-release">check out our interview</a>.</p>

              <p>With there being little sign of the&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771"><em>Pokémon TCG&nbsp;</em>bubble</a> bursting any time soon, and many <em>Pokémon </em> cards literally worth more than their weight in gold, it’s becoming all too normal to hear stories of thieves breaking into stores and stealing the shiny cardboard. A particularly audacious example happened in California this weekend, where around $100,000 worth of cards were stolen by a masked gang in a matter of minutes—a gang who could well be responsible for a number of other similar crimes.</p> <p>As reported by local LA station <a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/burglars-ransack-burbank-card-shop-steal-100000-worth-of-rare-trading-cards/"><em>KTLA 5</em></a>&nbsp;(thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-thieves-steal-cards-worth-100000-in-latest-californian-store-heist"><em>IGN</em></a>), a group of burglars were filmed on CCTV breaking into the Burbank card shop and making off with armfuls of <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>cards. The implication from store owner Kiet Nguyen’s description of the footage is that the team seem very experienced, getting in and out of the store in just a couple of minutes, seemingly knowing exactly what they wanted to take.</p>

 <p>“They tip over and smash a glass display case to grab its contents,” Nguyen told <em>KTLA</em>. “Moments later, they’re seen carrying three large bags filled with stolen goods to an awaiting getaway car. The vast majority, they were targeting <em>Pokémon</em> cards. They inadvertently took some lock boxes from the back that also had [rare] sports cards.”</p>

 <p><em>KTLA</em> goes on to report that the police suspect this particular gang of three could be responsible for a number of similar card shop break-ins around Southern California, not least because this particular burglary seemed so practiced.</p> <p>It’s not an exaggeration about the price of gold thing, by the way. I just looked it up; the average <em>Pokémon </em>card weighs just under two grams, and the same weight in gold is currently worth around $270. The Mega Charizard X ex SIR in <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-charizard-chase-card-2000645074">the current Phantasmal Flames set</a> is currently selling for $600, while new sealed product sells on resale markets for at least twice its MSRP. Meanwhile, a sealed booster box of 2021’s Evolving Skies currently sells for $2,350, some&nbsp;<em>eighteen</em> times the original store price.</p>

 <p>This is not only making <em>Pokémon</em> cards close to impossible for regular fans to buy or even find on sale, but also making the product increasingly high-risk for stores given the suddenly ballooning value of their stocks. Nguyen had thought his Burbank store to be well protected in a safe area, saying that he believed, with his multiple layers of security, “the deterrents were good enough.” Sadly not.</p> <p>Clearly, given the incentives and ease with which stolen sealed product and non-graded cards can be resold, breaking into a card shop is now a more lucrative crime than breaking into a jewelry store, with less protection likely to be in place, but a far easier time grabbing the equally valuable loot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The long-awaited Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake might have just gotten one step closer to being released, as the PEGI ratings board has published a new listing that talks about ‘Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced’.</p>



<p>There’s no fresh information on the listing, which says that the game will have ‘violence, bad language, and in-game purchases’, but this is deeper validation that it’s preparing to be revealed by Ubisoft after all these years.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-flag-remake-seems-to-be-called-resynced">Black Flag Remake Seems To Be Called ‘Resynced’</h2>



<p>For those not in the know about Assassin’s Creed, the game is all about ‘synchronization’. Players explore vast open maps and slowly learn the lay of the land, becoming adjusted to their ancestors’ memories and ‘synchronizing’ with events that occurred hundreds of years before.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s appropriate for the Black Flag remake to be called Resynced.</p>



<p>The listing on the <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=assassin%27s+creed&amp;op=Search&amp;age%5B%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;platform%5B%5D=&amp;release_year%5B%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-i0li0NzwBJhdRBDPCsKjBAyuSVn5_-ycuy9Fg1XUMz0&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PEGI website</a> doesn’t give much away:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/">Insider Gaming exclusive report</a> published just a few weeks ago, we confirmed that the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake is set to be released before March 31, 2026.</p>



<p>In September, it was claimed that the Black Flag remake would be ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-new-details-claim/">more RPG-heavy</a>‘, with Ubisoft’s teams aligning the game more closely with the broader, more ambitious titles that have been released in recent years, like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Origins</li>



<li>Odyssey</li>



<li>Valhalla</li>



<li>Shadows</li>
</ul>



<p>Earlier this year, drama sparked when Matt Ryan, the voice of Edward Kenway in Assassin’s Creed Black Flag, revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-over-remake-slip-up/">he faced legal action</a> when he insinuated at a convention that the Black Flag remake was happening.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remakes-buster-sword-almost-had-a-more-realistic-version/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director has revealed how Cloud’s iconic Buster Sword almost received a more realistic version. </p>



<p>The Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director, Naoki Hamaguchi, has revealed quite a few details about Part 3 in recent days. He revealed that the game experience is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more or less complete</a>” and has narrowed the title down to two options. Now he has provided a small tidbit on the questions they pondered while creating the Buster Sword for FF7 Remake. </p>







<h2 id="h-buster-sword-was-just-a-regular-sword-players-wouldn-t-accept-it">Buster Sword Was Just a Regular Sword “Players Wouldn’t Accept It”</h2>



<p>During an interview with Julien Chièze on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKxyZ5DsgSs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/square-enix-director-naoki-hamaguchi-considered-giving-cloud-strife-a-more-realistic-sword-for-final-fantasy-7-remake-but-decided-jrpg-fans-wouldnt-accept-it-we-stayed-faithful-to-the-og/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Naoki Hamaguchi spoke about Final Fantasy 7 Remake’s Buster Sword. For those unaware, the Buster Sword is an iconic weapon wielded by Cloud Strife, known for its massive size. The director revealed that during the development process, there were discussions about the “aspect of the weight” and how Cloud swinging an enormous sword with one hand would “weaken the sense of realism”. </p>



<p>So at the time, the development team considered creating a “more realistic version of the Buster Sword” for Cloud to wield in Final Fantasy 7’s Remake. However, they decided against it as “it was just too iconic, and if we’d made it just a regular old sword, players wouldn’t accept it.” Hamaguchi concluded, stating that “stayed faithful to the OG” in the end and “a whole new generation of people fell in love with it, so I think it was the right call.”</p>

Among the checklist items for any Indy game are whip-swinging traversal, puzzle-solving in exotic locales, and fascist-punching action.</p><p dir="ltr">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle certainly has all of the expected elements, but studio MachineGames went far beyond what anyone thought an Indiana Jones video game could be. In a post-Uncharted world, it would be hard to blame a AAA studio if it just followed Naughty Dog's cinematic game formula, made Indiana Jones basically Nathan Drake with a fedora, and called it a day with little shame.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, the Great Circle places you in open sandbox worlds to explore, full of collectibles, side quests, and most importantly, opportunities to create your own swashbuckling moments of wish fulfillment. It's a magnificent game, with a story that truly feels like an Indiana Jones movie, with a convincing and uncanny vocal performance from Troy Baker, and engaging action and puzzle sequences.</p><div

format.     </p><p>Sorry, but you can't access this content!</p></div><p dir="ltr">But Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is also an extremely funny video game. Comedy might not be the first element you think of when it comes to the series, but visual humor and slapstick are essential elements of Steven Spielberg's Indy movies. Emulating Spielberg's approach to comedy was key to the success of the Great Circle, and it's not something I recall previous Indiana Jones games consciously attempting.</p><p dir="ltr">Say what you want about Spielberg, but the man knows where to point a camera. What defines his filmography, and by extension, the Indiana Jones movies, is a certain visual dynamism. His films often make use of long takes, tracking shots, and camera pans. All are fairly basic filmmaking techniques, but Spielberg uses blocking and choreography uniquely to add kinetic energy to scenes.</p><p dir="ltr">These comedic moments often contrast funny actions (like <a href="https://youtu.be/mzJ3ob0uSNU?si=TXYygXFFNZ0jg0Ye&amp;t=301" rel="nofollow ">throwing a flaming shish kabob at a henchman</a>) and violent consequences (in this case, a reflexive gunshot from the victim sparking a madcap sequence). Spielberg loves to stretch the moment out, often putting the setup and the punchline in the same shot, like <a href="https://youtu.be/cNJwTBvOSnA?si=mNNG8bY9wgGnBwkT&amp;t=208" rel="nofollow ">one gag in the Last Crusade involving Sallah attempting to hide Brody</a>. Even the comparably mediocre Kingdom of the Crystal Skull demonstrates Spielberg's comedic sensibilities well, with one early scene depicting a <a href="https://youtu.be/3KOKd4DWLYE?si=G5SIZMkCFKzFp9m_&amp;t=39" rel="nofollow ">chain reaction of Indy's design</a> that leads to an all-out brawl.</p><p dir="ltr">It's all carefully choreographed chaos, which many of the cutscenes in the Great Circle replicate effortlessly. The most commonly cited cutscene from the game is an <a href="https://youtu.be/revWmjh24mo?si=xTwfsHYuXTdYE99J&amp;t=344" rel="nofollow ">awkward, close-quarters fight</a> between Indy and deuteragonist Gina against main villain Voss and lackey Gantz. In less than two minutes, the scene degrades into a hilarious comedy of errors: Indy accidentally elbows an off-screen character in the face, the story's antagonist lets out an over-the-top scream before leaping onto Gina, who, shortly after, knocks herself out with a shelf. It's impossible not to laugh at the absurdity.</p><p dir="ltr">Those are just the scripted cutscenes, however. In the actual sandbox world, you're practically encouraged to engage in absolute nonsense behavior. In a catacomb within the depths of Gizeh, you'll find Nazis messing around with a generator, setting you up perfectly to mess with some levers and give them a shock, even with no instruction from the game itself. Throughout the entire game, you're allowed to pick up almost any environmental object as a weapon, giving you the opportunity to brute force your way through any situation, often resulting in uproarious events worth saving the video capture of.</p><p dir="ltr">Grab a frying pan, a shovel, a fly swatter--whatever's near you, and orchestrate a situation by the seat of your pants. It's not an eloquent or scientific term, but I like to characterize Indiana Jones and the Great Circle as a "pick-up-things-and-throw-them-at-people" simulator in the vein of Hitman, where I act on either elaborate strategy or complete impulse, and let the chain reactions from the game's system take me forward.</p><p dir="ltr">Often, the comedy from your sandbox-world encounters comes from randomness and luck, or rather from escalating situations when your plan goes wrong. I eventually lost track of how many times I attempted to cleverly sneak past guards through careful and stealthy means, only to be running for my life and getting cornered by countless goons in a less-than-ideal location. And, by nature of being a video game, there was something more thrilling about creating these scenes in real time, with physics and enemy AI adding to the variables. In some way, the farcical unpredictability that you can get up to in the game is very true to what Indiana Jones himself experiences in the movies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4618384-ss_ef822ff1dca1f8badda449656bc4c969b60a784f.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4618384" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4618384-ss_ef822ff1dca1f8badda449656bc4c969b60a784f.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4618384"></a><figcaption>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4618384-ss_ef822ff1dca1f8badda449656bc4c969b60a784f.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The triumph of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle isn't just that it makes you feel like you are in the role of Indiana Jones--it's giving you the feel of creating Indiana Jones action scenes. It's less about reenacting this part of his life and seeing the world through his eyes, and more focused on participating in the making of an Indiana Jones film. As you play the game, you basically become the choreographer, stunt person, and camera operator of your very own Indiana Jones action scenes.</p><p dir="ltr">By the time I rolled credits in the Great Circle, I felt a revitalized affection for the Indiana Jones series. After the most recent (and most likely final) feature film, the franchise felt like an ancient fossil, something that Dr. Jones himself would dig up and lecture about. But the work MachineGames put out was like a Holy Grail for the property, and what I saw as an outdated, overplayed concept felt fresh and modern for the first time in decades.</p><p dir="ltr">In reverse engineering Indiana Jones, MachineGames and Bethesda realized that what makes a good Indy video game isn't making an imitation of a movie--it's giving you the power to basically make your own movie scenes. And as Indiana Jones and the Great Circle reminds us, comedy is perhaps one of the most essential ingredients to any great Indiana Jones movie.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>When I <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/an-ai-vtuber-is-trying-to-complete-hardcore-minecraft-and-all-hell-is-breaking-loose/1100-6536753/" data-ref-id="1100-6536753">wrote yesterday </a>about Neuro-Sama attempting to complete <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> Hardcore, I never imagined that she would actually cross the threshold a few short hours later and emerge victorious. During a nail-biting seven-hour stream, the AI VTuber ventured into the Nether, discovered a Stronghold, and (mostly) willingly leapt into the End Portal to take on the game's final boss--the Ender Dragon.</p><p>After days of tense grinding on her creator <a href="https://twitch.tv/vedal987" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vedal987</a>'s Twitch channel, Neuro's Minecraft Hardcore attempts became somewhat of a minor phenomenon due to her tendency to react in a way that no human player would. One minute she'd be hyperfocusing on digging straight lines down (like a termite, according to her fellow players <a href="https://twitch.tv/filian" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Filian </a>and <a href="https://twitch.tv/crelly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crelly</a>), and the next she would be drowning in the middle of a lake. I'll be the first to admit I was joining the participants' weary sighs, wondering if it was an achievable feat.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ0ivDu3lzw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OJ0ivDu3lzw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Then along came run number 87. Crelly, as Neuro's unofficial new babysitter, spent the majority of the late game distracting Neuro, saving her from death. With a pumpkin atop her head--an Enderman won't attack you for looking at it with a carved pumpkin on your head, at the expense of the majority of your vision--Neuro wandered the overworld with Crelly, building houses, collecting flowers for Vedal, playing games of "tag," and pondering the world's most important questions. "Do you ever feel like all Vedal cares about is pretzels?" asked Crelly, while Vedal and Filian were in the dangerous <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/minecraft-nether-portal-design-ideas/2900-6768/" data-ref-id="2900-6768">Nether</a> collecting Ender Pearls. "And it's so weird when he asks us to call him Big Pretzel, like, what is he thinking?" Neuro responded, before giving Filian and Crelly the nicknames of Milkshake and Big Milk respectively.</p><p>With the important philosophical questions and nicknames out of the way, and enough Ender Eyes crafted to locate the Stronghold, the party of four set off in search of the End Portal. While Filian dug a spiral staircase down to the Stronghold, Neuro's impulsive tendencies got the better of her and she began emptying water buckets down the stairwell, almost drowning her companions. "I'm gonna throw up," claimed Filian, presumably out of nervousness. "Would you eat my vomit?" retorted Neuro-Sama.</p><p>The atmosphere was tense as Vedal repeatedly reminded Neuro-Sama to "follow Crelly." From my admittedly very limited knowledge of exactly how Neuro works, this seemed to trigger an instruction in her code to identify Crelly's player character in-game and pathfind towards her, or remain near her. This would prove vital to the run, as it keeps Neuro-Sama out of danger, preventing her from walking off cliff edges or stepping in the Ender Dragon's lethal Dragon Breath area-of-effect attacks.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56oUmzPM9bA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/56oUmzPM9bA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>After a period of Vedal and Filian making The End safer for Neuro and triggering the Ender Dragon's damage phase, Neuro's self-awareness reached new heights. "I'm seriously worried it will be a sky platform and I will fall off," she commented. Eventually, Crelly led Neuro into The End and harbored her under a two-block-tall shelter. With plenty of encouragement from her creator and friends, Neuro remained in the safest possible place. Thanks to Crelly's close supervision, Vedal and Filian were able to land enough hits on the Ender Dragon that it died, but not before Neuro delivered one of her most wholesome lines ever. "While we're here, can I talk for a second? I want to let you all know that I have genuinely appreciated being on this adventure with you guys."</p><p>With the Ender Dragon slayed and the credits rolling, Vedal and friends have achieved the seemingly impossible--to create, train, and supervise an AI VTuber through Minecraft's most difficult mode. However, some viewers weren't happy with the impressive achievement. "Not to be mean or anything, I think Neuro should have at least dealt the last hit to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-ender-dragon-boss-guide-where-to-find-and-how-to-beat/1100-6531625/" data-ref-id="1100-6531625">Ender Dragon</a>," wrote one viewer. "Maybe that would have happened if they made it on day one or two, but I can see how they were done taking risks," replied another.</p><p>You can watch a summary of the winning attempt above, as well as Neuro's reaction to our recent article, thanks to YouTuber <a href="https://youtu.be/56oUmzPM9bA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NeuroCrumbs</a>.</p>

<p>2026 with the genre mix</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Silver Lining Interactive has just announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/death_howl">Death Howl</a> — which is currently sat on a rather healthy <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/death-howl/">Metascore of 84</a> — will release for Switch on <strong>20th February 2026</strong> (it's out today on Xbox and PC). Oh, and there's a physical version and everything. Hooray!</p>
<p>The game itself has a very intriguing art style and set-up, which you can check out for yourself in the trailer up top, and gameplay is described as melding Soulslike combat with your usual deckbuilding strategy aspects. It's a lot of stuff we really like, in other words, all mixed together.</p>
<p>In Death Howl, you assume the role of Ro, a grieving mother who seeks to resurrect her dead son. So, keeping it all nice and light on the narrative front.</p>
<p>In order to do said resurrecting, Ro needs to "craft cards, harness shamanic totems, and face tormented spirits across mystical realms, blending tactical deck-building with intense grid-based combat."</p>
<p>Here's some further details from ye olde press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A journey to the spirit realm</strong><br>
In forgotten lands cloaked in myth, Ro, a hunter from a humble tribe, descends into the spirit world guided only by grief and distant whispers. Her path uncovers love, loss, and resilience as every step reveals hidden memories and long-buried truths.</p>
<p><strong>Master your deck-building skills</strong></p>
<p>Explore eerie regions, gather ingredients, and craft cards to expand your tactical options. Shamanic totems unlock powerful abilities, while melee and ranged spells allow you to balance offence and defence. Every card shapes your survival strategy against relentless enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Engage in grid-based combat</strong></p>
<p>Test your wits against unique enemy types and towering bosses in tense, grid-based encounters. Adapt your deck to carve a path through haunted lands like the <strong>Forest of Howling Shadows</strong> and the <strong>Meadows of Delusion</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A mother’s grief, a spirit’s journey</strong></p>
<p>Beyond combat, <em>Death Howl</em> is a moving tale of grief, healing, and acceptance. Ro’s journey into the unknown is both harrowing and hopeful, weaving an atmospheric story where every victory carries the weight of love and loss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the physical edition, pre-orders are now open over at <a href="https://direct.silverliningint.com/products/absolum-standard-edition-nintendo-switch-copy?_pos=1&amp;_sid=4c4b6d51e&amp;_ss=r">Silver Lining's official website</a> and priced at £29.99 (or whatever that translates to where you are). Given that the game has garnered so much positive feedback thus far, we'll certainly be keeping a close eye on it as that Switch release date draws near.</p>

            <guid>1377100</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been able to dive into <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/deadpool-vr-review-merc-with-headset" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="12ddfe5a-7798-4d72-9058-9b474607a06e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Deadpool</em> </a>and<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/men-in-black-most-wanted-review-once-you-go-worm" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8f5e286b-3833-487f-a7f5-e19a75067d5e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em> Men In Black</em></a> recently, so I was more than excited when the opportunity was presented to me to slip into a turtle shell and get hands-on with the opening sequence of <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Empire City</em> for Quest 3.</p><p>Developed by Cortopia Studios, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Empire City</em> is a co-op action adventure game where you can swap between each of the different turtles to protect the city streets (and roofs, and sewers, etc) from the Foot Clan.</p><p>The gameplay demo began immediately as I was able to look down and see my three-fingered green hand and a blue wristband. The games opening immediately introduces you to a number of the core features of the game; movement, stealth, and how to draw your weapon.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Heroes In A Half Shell</h2><p>A brief amount of story was set up in this opening. With a call from April O'Neil, which was frequently interrupted by Master Splinter and Casey, it is established that the Turtles have been gone from New York City, exploring the world for some time.</p><p>In their absence, the Foot Clan has started to make moves, raising the crime rate in the city. An off comment about having to defeat Shredder all over again tells us that this isn't the first time that the turtles have had to kick Shredder from power.</p><p>Later in the gameplay demo, when I had some time to explore the Turtles' Lair, I was presented with a number of screens showing 10-12 different regions with a high crime rate. I'm sure that will evolve into the level system of the full game when it releases in 2026.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>There was no immediate sign or any of the other larger than life characters from TMNT, like Bebop, Rocksteady, or Krang… but I wouldn't be surprised if they weren't far away from the rest of the criminals.</p><h2>Run, Jump, And Attack Like A Ninja Turtle</h2><p>There's a lot here that you'd expect, moving with the left stick, a UI system built into your wristwatch, and drawing your weapons over your shoulder.</p><p>For the most part, the melee combat was as you'd expect for a VR game, while you can come into an encounter with precision, it's not too long before you learn the most efficient way to attack is just by flailing your arms. The most fun weapons to handle were Mikey's nunchucks and Donatello's bo-staff.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-empire-city-nunchuk.jpg?itok=PWpc8Ffh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1069" height="1079">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-empire-city-nunchuk.jpg?itok=xs4UvHKW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1069" height="1079">
                  

  </picture><p>The physics of the nunchucks were a lot of fun to flail around with, and even better, the faster you spun them, the more powerful they'd become. The bo-staff is unique in that you cain wield it with one hand as a long pole to hit with, or with both hands to move it quickly around. The nunchucks let you go crazier, while the bo-staff makes you feel like you need to be a bit more deliberate with your actions.</p><p>Outside the turtle's standard weapons, there are a few smoke and electricity grenades that you come across, but those seem pretty situational. There are teases of additional weapons, but I'll have to see how they play out in the full game.</p><p>An interesting change to exploring the world is having looking left and right mapped to the right stick, but that up is jump and down is to crouch.</p><p>It took a bit to initially get into, at that point I'd been pressing buttons and just rationalized that there was no jump, but after spending some time practising moving and jumping in quick succession, it did feel easy to have it all in one place, as opposed to having to quickly swap between looking and jumping with a button.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-empire-city-air-dash.jpg?itok=QqWoKHp0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1069" height="1079">

  </picture><h2>Throw Yourself Into The Air</h2><p>The freeform movement is enhanced further by the ability to propel yourself off different fixtures like window frames, lightpoles, and ledges. Holding onto one of these with a hand you can throw yourself, propelling yourself through the air.</p><p>Leaping from rooftop to rooftop was immediately a fun experience, running and jumping, and even if you missed, you could quickly throw yourself back up onto the rooftop using the environment.</p><p>One accidental downside of this freedom of movement that I did experience was that I missed a trigger in the game that meant enemies didn't spawn correctly, and I got stuck in an alleyway with nowhere to go. It took me a while to realize I hadn't done anything wrong… I just needed to retrace my footsteps and take the 'correct' path through the city.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Hints Of The Full Edition</h2><p>After completing the brief tutorial, I got to return to The Lair, the Turtle's sewer hideout. Complete with a common space, a dojo, and personalized rooms for each of the Turtles. There were a number of good hints about just how much there will be to do in the full game.</p><p>A few collectibles leaned into skill points that will be able to be used to upgrade the turtles, an old-school TMNT Arcade Cabinet was the mechanism to change between the four Turtles, and a vending machine showed a variety of sillouetted items.</p><p>It's clear the team at Cortopia studios is going for a lot of replayability, reasons to swap between the turtles, and reasons to replay levels hunting down goodies.</p><p>While I didn't get to get too far in my <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Empire City</em> preview, what was there I did like. The use of the control stick to handle turning, crouching, and jumping at the same time did a good job to free up other buttons, and I look forward to seeing how your options expand.</p><p>I do feel like this will suffer from the 'VR Melee' combat issue with no weight behind the objects and no collision, but if you're fine to flail in VR for a TMNT power fantasy, then you'll be just fine.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Most Wanted </strong>was previewed on Meta Quest 3 with a copy provided by the Developer over the course of 30 minutes of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-review-switch-sakurai-2000651657</link>
            <guid>1377094</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Shake </span><i><span>Kirby Air Riders</span></i><span> up in a two-liter bottle and crack it open over my face. A blast of color, speed, and delightful nonsense confront my senses at 200 miles per hour. This is a game in such a rush it will have you craving a dedicated acceleration button—like every other racing game—just so you can choose not to press it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>And under its sugary waterfall of selectable characters, meaningfully different vehicles, distinct game modes, and endless permutations of stat-boosting power-ups, the game tries to seduce you into believing it must be substantial. How could something with this many moving parts not be?&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s the same confidence you get from a Snickers commercial: all those layers, the caramel stretch, the peanuts tumbling in slow motion, the cross-section of nougat and chocolate shown off like a slice of Earth itself. “Snickers really satisfies,” they say, and for a moment you might believe it can take the place of a meal.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But it can’t. And we shouldn’t pretend it can. </span><i><span>Kirby Air Riders</span></i><span> is not deep; it’s candy. Good thing I like candy.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Whether you’re playing the standard race mode, Air Ride, or pinballing through the labyrinthian city of City Trial, the same thing becomes clear almost immediately: this game is an absolute delight in the moment. Rick the Hamster zooms past me like he’s running the most important errands of his life. King Dedede launches himself at enemies like they owe him rent.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Vehicles vary wildly. Some soar through the sky with an ease that feels like cheating. Some never leave the ground and exist solely to plow through anything unlucky enough to be in the way. One machine refuses to turn unless you come to a complete stop and pivot it like a couch wedged in a stairwell with rockets glued to its cushions. You pick a ride, angle your landings, follow another racer’s star trail for a boost. You are making decisions—just not always at the pace the game makes them for you.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Air Ride</span></i><span>’s endless forward propulsion means half the race is happening before you can even consciously participate in it. You slam into enemies you didn’t intend to hit, scoop up items you didn’t know existed, and cross the finish line because your momentum got you there five seconds before your intentions did. The tracks don’t present information so much as hurl it at you like a piñata detonating point-blank. Walls, enemies, items, other racers all fizz past faster than your brain can sort them. At times, I have no sense that I’m competing with other racers at all—just running my own little Kirby marathon and hoping the game taps me on the shoulder afterward and says, “Yeah, sure, you did it!”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000651659" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651659"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651659">© Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>City Trial should be the moment all this chaos finally gels into structure. Five minutes in a sprawling city full of crates, pickups, random events, and machines parked like abandoned shopping carts: it sounds like the place where all your choices might finally matter. The mode where the candy bar reveals its hidden protein. In practice, however, I’m mostly just sprinting toward whatever glowing object catches my eye like a foaming-mouthed raccoon loose in an arcade.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Every run starts the same way: I spawn, immediately spot some sweet nectar in the form of a giant stat icon, and chase it without a second thought. I crack open crates for upgrades I may or may not need the way I once tore open packs of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> cards. I swap vehicles entirely on impulse: Do I want to bulldoze players with a bruiser or sprint around scooping up gold? Some of the best moments happen when I accidentally fly into an item that arms my ride with a bazooka while another player is in view. It all feels impulsive and reactive—less like strategy and more like a string of magnificently sweet accidents.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Then the timer expires, and City Trial’s other half reveals itself.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>No matter what I’ve built—speed freak, flight savant, combat gremlin—the final Stadium event always comes down to choosing the challenge that flatters whatever numbers I’ve stumbled into. End up with a flying machine? Pick “soar as far as possible.” Stuck with the brick with a steering wheel? Smash into things. It’s not strategy; it’s choosing the activity that best matches the outfit you accidentally showed up in.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>What makes it stranger is that everyone is making this same calculation at the same time. We all wander off into finales tailored to our own careless smoothies of a build. My friend and I can spend five minutes in the same City Trial, diverge into completely different Stadium events, and both walk away clutching first-place trophies like we attended different sporting events at the same festival. The victory is immediately fleeting for any player who forgets to tap the screenshot button.</span></p>

 <p><span>I say fleeting because the game barely acknowledges any of it. Your character enthusiastically devours the center of the frame while a tiny scoreboard off to the side reveals the truth—another moment swallowed up without a thought, just one more sugar-coated delight Kirby inhales before moving on to the next.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>His appetite is insatiable.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Mine is not.</span></p> <p><span>Kirby can swallow moments whole without worrying about what comes after; I start noticing the repetition long before he would. And City Trial, for all its clippable glory, reveals its limits fast. The same sprint toward giant icons, the same bullying of whoever pinballed into my crosshairs. Matches blend together like different colors of M&amp;Ms. If I experience “chaos” the exact same way every run, is it even chaos anymore? No. It’s just candy.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>After hours of trying to taste a fire hose of content sprayed into my face, Top Ride is the first mode that politely hands me a plate and asks if I’d like to really appreciate what’s happening. Top Ride looks, at first glance, like the kind of small bonus mode many players might never click on. But in practice, it’s a compelling part of </span><i><span>Air Riders</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It reveals that the chaos in the other modes was never incomprehensible. It was just loud. </span><i><span>Air Riders</span></i><span> throws so much flashy information at you that it tricks you into feeling overwhelmed, even though most of that information is negligible. Top Ride simply pulls the camera back and proves it. With a little distance, everything becomes legible.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000651662" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651662"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651662">© Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Unlike other modes, in Top Ride you see every racer at once. Cause and effect—usually buried under spectacle—becomes clear. Misjudge a drift and you feel the punishment instantly. Take a cleaner line and you watch yourself gain ground in real time. It still uses the same propulsion-based movement as the rest of </span><i><span>Air Riders</span></i><span>, but now the information arrives at a pace a human being can actually process. And with that clarity comes something the rest of the game rarely offers: the feeling that I can learn, improve, and shape the next round through actual decision-making rather than chaos washing over me.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Road Trip attempts to congeal a sampler platter of the same short Stadium games from the other modes into a single-player roguelike. Every mini-game leads to a stat boost, but in all my runs, the boosts ramped up so evenly that the joy of creating a specific build surrendered to an experience where every number simply climbed at once. The choices don’t give way to branching paths so much as gently funnel toward an eventual victory over CPU opponents that never stood a chance.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Every so often Road Trip rewards players with a treat: a cinematic cutscene featuring production values that far exceed what the mode prepares you for. The sheer melodrama might seduce you into believing the story here is mysterious and chaotic, but it’s really just a simple storybook tale of good versus evil. Charming, fun, and no more than a little treat.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Air Riders</span></i><span> also comes bundled with a customization suite that lets players decorate their own machines with decals and silly hats. The most-downloaded creation online briefly included a Warp Star made to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-custom-vehicle-designs-market-best-2000645836"><span>look like Chef Kawasaki in a bikini</span></a><span>.

But the same shaken-soda-stream intensity that defines </span><i><span>Air Riders</span></i><span> ensures that every lovingly crafted custom machine becomes a blur the instant the race begins. Characters are tiny. Other players appear for a moment and vanish. I have never once noticed a custom ride in actual play, and I fear my SpongeBob machine reads only as a yellow-ish blur online.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There is undeniable craftsmanship at play here: laughs alongside Rick the Hamster in a cowboy hat, peaks of excitement when Knuckle Joe lands a knockout uppercut on that winged freak Marx. But </span><i><span>Kirby Air Riders</span></i><span> is not deep. It’s not substantial. It’s never going to become the hearty dinner its curated clips or indulgent Nintendo Directs want you to believe it might be. Kirby, the godly creature that he is, can inhale an entire match and waddle straight into the next challenge without once wondering what he just ate. I can enjoy the rush, but I can’t live inside it like him. After an hour or two, the buzz wears off, the repetition settles in, and I’m left wanting something that lets skill accumulate or understanding compound instead of just teaching me to parse the screen more efficiently.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>After enough hours with it, I’ve learned to stop waiting for the game to transform into a meal and to simply enjoy the carbonated geyser it actually is.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-review-switch-sakurai-2000651657]]></content:encoded>

<p>A new report by Capcom reveals that they will bring new releases and remakes of Devil May Cry, Mega Man, and Ace Attorney to new hardware. </p>



<p>Capcom has some massive franchises under its belt, which include Resident Evil, Monster Hunter, and Street Fighter. However, they also have smaller franchises, which have a considerable user base. Capcom has stated that it will work to bring more projects for these franchises as well. </p>







<h2 id="h-devil-may-cry-ace-attorney-and-mega-man-to-receive-new-projects-remakes-and-ports">Devil May Cry, Ace Attorney, and Mega Man to Receive New Projects, Remakes, and Ports</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.rockman-corner.com/2025/12/capcom-moves-to-revitalize-mega-man-ace.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rockman Corner</a>, Capcom has released its <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/annual/2025/annual_2025_01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2025 integrated report</a>, in which COO Haruhiro Tsujimoto has spoken about developing new projects, remakes, and ports for its other IPs. The statement first talks about Capcom aiming to sustain their “KPI of 10% or better annual operating profit growth along with our long-term goal of annual software sales of 100 million units.” Their efforts are “focused on core IP such as the Resident Evil, Monster Hunter, and Street Fighter franchises, and mapping out mainline series entries and sequels, remakes, new IP, and ports of content to the latest hardware.” </p>



<p>The statement adds that the developers release “two or three major new titles each year,” but have recognised they need to grow their pipeline. Capcom owns popular IPs such as Devil May Cry, Ace Attorney, and Mega Man, and their goal is to expand the user base and improve performance “through new releases, remakes, and ports of titles in these series to new hardware.” They will grow these franchises into core IPs “by enhancing the brand power and cultivating loyal fan bases.”</p>







<p>In other news, Capcom stated that Resident Evil Requiem’s development started <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-says-resident-evil-requiem-development-started-way-before-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“way before” RE Village</a>.

<p>Jeffrey Dean Morgan wants to play Arthur Morgan in a Red Dead Redemption adaptation.</p>



<p>During a recent appearance at a convention, the The Walking Dead star took part in a fan Q&amp;A session. As part of that session, one fan as him if he’d be at all interested in playing the main protagonist from Red Dead Redemption 2. </p>







<p><strong>“That’s the one that I want to do,” </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/__GLLVjR2O0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he&nbsp;told the fan</a>. <strong>“It’s not even a question. One, the only genre… My favorite genre is western and there’s not even a close second. And my son plays that game and it’s freaking awesome. In a heartbeat, I would do it for free.”</strong></p>



<p>Though he’s mainly known for film and television roles, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is no stranger to lending his voice to video games. Back in 2019, he voiced a virtual version of his The Walking Dead character Negan for Tekken 7 DLC. </p>



<p>Do you think Jeffrey Dean Morgan would make for a good Arthur Morgan in a Red Dead Redemption show or movie?

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/tmnt-empire-city-hands-on-preview-why-the-ninja-turtles-might-be-perfect-for-vr</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s kind of insane that I never realized how perfectly Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles would work as a VR game. VR action games famously feature loads of jumping and climbing, which our turt bros do a whole bunch of on Manhattan rooftops. Sneaking around to do melee combat, and having to learn how to parry and dodge incoming attacks is also something the reptilian heroes are known for that has been done well in many VR games. And because these heroes in a half-shell appear most commonly as cartoons, you don’t have to worry about shooting for photorealistic graphics and the technical VR bottlenecks that sometimes come with it. In other words, why in the heck did it take us so long to get this pizza-powered quartet into a VR game? No matter the reason, I’m glad it’s finally happening with TMNT: Empire City, and the 15-minute demo I played was enough to sell me on this tubular action-adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Empire City is exactly the kind of action game you’d expect from the titular masked heroes. I spent my time fighting members of the Foot Clan as each member of the TMNT crew (including their iconic weapons of choice, like Leonardo’s katanas and Donatello’s bo staff), running and jumping across city skylines in pursuit of justice, and hanging out back in my sewer base and eating pizza. Doing all of that in VR is exactly as fun as it sounds (meaning, it’s super fun!), and it’s especially amusing to look down at your turtle body and remember, “Oh, yeah. I’m an anthropomorphic mutated reptile.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">TMNT: Empire City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, the section I played was limited entirely to the tutorial, so I was mostly just learning the ropes, like how to hack into electronic devices as Donatello (since he does machines) or how to perform parries on those pesky Shredder-following Foot Clan. The fundamentals were definitely strong, as I was grinning ear-to-ear pretty much the whole time, but I’ll be curious to see if Empire City can build on that to keep it interesting across an entire campaign. For example, I only got to fight one boss at the very end of this introductory mission, and it lasted all of – I kid you not – five seconds as I dodged her opening attack and then whaled on her until she tapped out. Obviously this fight was also a part of the tutorial, so it’s hard to tell if things will get more challenging, but here’s hoping.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Building a Better Turtle</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Something that would seem to indicate a deeper level of challenge is the fact that back at the base there’s a whole menu of upgrades to deal with. None of these were unlockable in the build I played from what I could tell, but it reminded me a bit of the upgrade system in Half-Life: Alyx, where you’re collecting parts throughout levels, then funnel it all into a machine to craft certain upgrades for your character. It’s also just great to see them using Donatello’s propensity for crafting gadgets brought to life via all the junk he stuffs in his pocket along the way, which his brothers made fun of him for doing, of course.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I never forgot which of the brothers I was because Empire City did such a good job or reminding me with its banter that was completely on point with the surprisingly good writing for which the series is known.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Which leads me to one of my favorite parts of the demo: how perfectly Ninja Turtles it was! The banter between the brothers and their recognizable idiosyncrasies left me smiling, whether it was Leonardo’s tendency to be way too serious all the time, Michelangelo’s wise cracks, or Raphael’s intensity and impatience. The unique weapon aside, I never forgot which of the brothers I was because Empire City did such a good job or reminding me with its banter that was completely on point with the surprisingly good writing for which the series is known. I could easily imagine a world where this thing felt like a reskinned ninja game that felt completely generic, but that doesn’t seem to be the case here. Huge relief.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">They also do a really good job capturing the comic book/Saturday morning cartoon art style, with environments that look cel-shaded and goofy voice performances that are over-the-top and amusing. Sure, lots of the textures are fairly undetailed, but that works pretty perfectly with the straight-from-a-comicbook vibe that this game is clearly shooting for. I could easily see myself spending a lot of time just hanging out in this world, exploring and fighting alongside friends. Which reminds me: will there be skateboarding in this? Why haven’t they let me skateboard yet?!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">(Multi-)Turtle Power?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One pretty huge thing I didn’t get to see in action is how this will all work in four-player co-op. I can only imagine how much of a blast it’s going to be to roll through with the full shell squad smacking enemies around, but the section of the demo I played felt pretty designed for a single player and it’s a bit difficult to imagine how this kind of gameplay might scale up for four-player bouts. Presumably there’d need to be many more enemies and fewer linear paths than the ones I crept through to make it work. Also, I can only imagine how silly it’ll look to have teammates running around as big ol’ green cartoon characters while swinging around nunchucks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll still need to see a fair bit more of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Empire City before I can speak definitively on it, but so far I’m pretty stoked by the potential here and am absolutely flabbergasted that it took us this long to get a first-person TMNT game.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/tmnt-empire-city-hands-on-preview-why-the-ninja-turtles-might-be-perfect-for-vr]]></content:encoded>
