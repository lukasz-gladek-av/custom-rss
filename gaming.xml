I am Katsura Hashino, the director of <em><a title="Platforms > Meta [110 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>phor</em>. My representative works include <em><a title="Series > Shin Megami Tensei [93 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/shin-megami-tensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a> III</em>, <em><a title="Games > Persona 3 [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/persona-3">Persona 3</a></em>, <em><a title="Series > Persona [81 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a> 4</em>, and <em><a title="Games > Persona 5 [149 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a></em>. In the previous showcases, we have introduced you to the story and the world in which the main characters will be competing in the royal tournament.</p><p>In this ATLUS Exclusive <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> Character Edition Showcase, we’ll be looking at the campaign in its early stage, introduce the rival candidates and their believers, the fascinating supporters who help the protagonist win the election, and the bonds you will form with these characters. I will introduce them in more depth than what we have done in previous Exclusives</p><p>We will continue to introduce new information about <em>Metaphor</em> on the ATLUS YouTube channel, so please be sure to subscribe to our channel. Now, let’s begin the Character Edition Showcase.</p><p><strong>■ Synopsis</strong></p><p>First, here is a synopsis of the story. On a special mission to save the prince, the protagonist attends the king’s funeral to assassinate the mastermind, the great <a title="Companies > crim [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>inal Louis. Suddenly, the giant face of the supposedly dead king appears in the sky over the Royal Capital, and the “election magic” is triggered. “Whoever can win the most support from the people by the deadline will be the next king.” Thus began an unprecedented uprising for the throne, allowing the citizens to be a candidate to become the next king.</p><p>Gathering popular support is not an easy task for regular citizens who have no electoral experience. That is when Sanctifex Forden of the Sanctus Church, a leading figure in the country, declares the “Tournament for the Throne” as an opportunity for people to put their powers on display and gather support. In this “Tournament for the Throne,” those who have put themselves forward as candidates for king are tasked to visit the major cities in the kingdom, proving their worth to the public as they tackle tough challenges. The first destination, Port Brielhaven, will host the “Exhibition of the Brave,” in which candidates compete to see who can bring in the biggest monster head. Those who make it through will head to Altabury Heights to take on the next challenge.</p><p>It is Batlin, a Sanctus crier, who is responsible for informing the public about the Tournament for the Throne, which has become a truly national event. His lighthearted play-by-play keeps the public engaged in the tournament.</p><p><strong>■ Candidates Vying for the Throne</strong></p><p>Now, in this national election campaign, candidates with various agendas come forward. The two most powerful men leading the tournament from unassailable positions are Forden and the protagonist’s arch-nemesis, Louis.</p><p><strong>Forden</strong></p><p>Forden is the supreme authority of Sanctism, the state religion of the United Kingdom of Euchronia, and is also the head of the Crown Theocracy, the government ruled with Sanctism at its center. In the turmoil following the sudden death of the previous king, he has garnered wide support from the population, given his position as the leader of the moderate faction.</p><p><strong>Louis</strong></p><p>Louis, on the other hand, in contrast to the moderate Forden, is an army officer with military prowess who believes in true meritocracy, wielding overwhelming combat and magical skills that enable him to defeat the humans. His policy of valuing skill and rationality over birth or circumstance has garnered tremendous support, especially among radical youths.</p><p>Of course, these two are not the only ones who will be competing in the Royal Tournament campaign. Other candidates also put their names forward in the campaign, each with their own quirky platforms.</p><p><strong>Gideaux</strong></p><p>The first one I would like to introduce is Gideaux. He is Forden’s primary bodyguard, as well as the Captain of the Monk Army, the enforcement arm of the Crown Theocracy. He himself does not intend to be king, but he doesn’t seem to take kindly to the arrival of the “filthy” elda protagonist.</p><p><strong>Godell</strong></p><p>Next, Godell. Known as “Godell the Black Hound,” he is Louis’ subordinate, but is a rather ambitious man who is running for election on the platform of rising to power. He makes no effort to hide his open hostility, which may eventually become a thorny issue for you.</p><p><strong>Milo</strong></p><p>One of the oddballs is Milo of the ishkia tribe, who preaches an agenda where those of beauty will strip all the hideous of their titles. Wherever he goes, you’re bound to hear the high-pitched screams of his fans.</p><p><strong>Loveless</strong></p><p>Next, the third son of a tavern owner, with the slogan of “All you can drink all year round.” Without giving much thought to the future of the kingdom, some might be tempted to agree with Loveless’ pledge, which falls in line with his hedonistic paripus traits.</p><p><strong>Rudolf</strong></p><p>Rudolf, another bloodthirsty candidate .He pledges to establish a roussainte military dictatorship. His appeal for greater control of the roussainte tribe seems to have attracted the support of those who feel repressed by the rule of moderate clemars.</p><p><strong>Lina</strong></p><p>Lina, a eugief candidate and the only daughter of the family that runs the Kayden Workshop, is participating to promote the gauntlet runner family business. </p><p><strong>Goddard</strong></p><p>Goddard, a demolitionist of the rhoag tribe, is a representative of the elderly, with his pledge to give preferential treatment to the old and tax the young.</p><p><strong>Roger</strong></p><p>Roger, a young man of the clemar tribe, believes in his own righteousness and is pushing forward with his vision of a truly free country with no taxes, no laws, and no religion</p><p><strong>Jin</strong></p><p>Jin from the nidia tribe is intent on winning no matter what, changing his campaign pledge depending on where he goes and who he needs to please at the moment.</p><p><strong>Julian</strong></p><p>We also have Julian of the ishkia tribe who is very conscious about pro-animal rights even when it comes to monsters that threaten people. </p><p><strong>Edeni</strong></p><p>Edeni, an island chief of the mustari tribe, decides to participate in the tournament as a pagan advocate for religious freedom.</p><p>And others with various agendas and objectives will appear.</p><p>As you can see, the “Tournament for the Throne” has a festive aspect with a truly diverse field of rival candidates. But maybe Gallica is right. If one of these candidates become king, the country will face bigger problems.</p><p>The candidates we’ve introduced are all powerful people who have expensive gauntlet runners at their disposal. And I think you will find that there are many who want to represent the tribe they come from and increase their influence. However, some of these rivals are so impacted by the protagonist’s <a title="Genres > Action [2,042 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s down the line that they later become his supporters. I won’t go into detail now, but I hope you will look forward to that as well. Posters highlighting the candidates’ pledges are posted in cities with influential power. You may want to listen to people’s opinions as you walk the streets to see what they think of the candidates’ promises and claims made in speeches.</p><p>During the election period, the protagonist’s popularity ranking in the race can be checked by pressing a specific button in the overworld. At the beginning, the protagonist’s support ranking starts in a rather low position, around 8,121st place as you see here. This is not a <a title="Genres > Simulation [529 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation game</a> where the popularity ranking fluctuates in real time, so it is only a flavor element of the game. But these rankings will change significantly as the campaign progresses.</p><p>The protagonist is a nobody at the lowest level in the country. Of course, he is not the kind of person that anyone would expect to be king. You will feel the dynamics of this royal tournament campaign as you watch the ranking gradually change with the results of completing your missions and through your actions towards the people of the city!</p><p><strong>■ Followers that Support the Protagonist</strong></p><p>Now, while there are rivals in the tournament who stand in the protagonist’s way, there are also encouraging allies who will support your campaign. In the cities that the protagonist will stay at, there are many people with various kinds of problems. By listening to them and helping them, they will become strong supporters of the protagonist.</p><p>Of course, the allies who travel with him, such as Strohl and Hulkenberg, are also important supporters of the protagonist. But he will also meet unique supporters on his journey who do not directly participate in battle. The unique feature of interacting with supporters, or followers as we call them in this title, is that you can acquire powerful Archetypes that you can equip and use in battle.</p><p>Let us now introduce you to what kinds of followers we have.</p><p><strong>Brigitta</strong></p><p>First, there is a rhoag follower named Brigitta who owns an ignitor shop in the Royal Capital. She notices that the protagonist is an elda and asks him to take on a quest to test his strength. If you can complete said request and gain her trust, she will be a powerful follower. When she becomes a follower, the protagonist will not only be able to awaken to the Merchant Archetype, which offers more rewards in battle, but he will also be able to make purchases at the ignitor shop in the Royal Capital, which is usually not available to the elda.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong></p><p>Next is a girl named Maria who lives at the Hushed Honeybee Inn located in the Royal Capital. Separated from her parents and having no friends due to her rhoag and ishkia mixed background, she eagerly awaits the souvenir of stories that the protagonists bring back through encounters they have on their travels. If you can help her feel less lonely, she will also be a powerful follower. The bond with Maria awakens the Healer Archetype, which specializes in healing and purification.</p><p><strong>Bardon</strong></p><p>Next is Bardon, a roussainte who is the captain of the guard corps in Martira. He is a simple, clumsy, but likeable and earnest man who faces new problems after an incident that happens in his town is solved. By supporting him, he will become a strong follower. Your bond with him awakens the Commander Archetype, which can bend the flow of battles to your will.</p><p><strong>Alonzo</strong></p><p>Like Bardon, we meet Alonzo in Martira, an elusive and enigmatic young man of the nidia tribe. His smooth talk leads the protagonist to undertake a certain quest. Even though he swings the protagonist around with his words and actions that go back and forth, he ends up being a one-of-a-kind follower. If you can strengthen your bond with him, you will be able to awaken the Faker, that can be used as a trump card to tackle difficult enemies.</p><p><strong>Catherina</strong></p><p>Last but not least is Catherina, a bounty hunter. She is one of the protagonist’s followers, but she is also a candidate herself who stands up for her tribe—the paripus—which is often looked down upon, with the pledge to make them wealthier. From the bond you form with her, you can awaken the Brawler Archetype, which can deliver decisive blows. While they may be rivals in the campaign together, they do form a strong bond, allowing the protagonist and Catherina to create a unique relationship. We invite you to see for yourself how the competition between the candidates will play out.</p><p><strong><a title="Genres > Party [69 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a> Members</strong></p><p>In addition to the followers introduced here, you can also bond with fellow party members such as Strohl and Hulkenberg, and build a follower relationship with them. Interacting with characters of all ages, tribes, and values, and from different perspectives, will give you a new experience unlike any you have had in previous titles.</p><p>Strengthening bonds with followers can lead to the evolution of Archetypes to higher levels and the unlocking of abilities that will give you a strategic advantage. So please be proactive and talk to your followers when you see them in town or in gauntlet runners. You can check the status of your interactions with your followers, as well as the Archetypes and abilities you have acquired through them, at any time in the main menu, which will help you strategize how to use your time during the operation periods.</p><p>In addition, the follower characters are also voiced by talented voice actors, which we believe will provide a deeper game experience.</p><p><strong>■ Closing</strong></p><p>How did you like it? We are pleased to announce that we have released new information on quite a few characters. Was there a character you liked among the unique candidates and followers? Let us know your favorite in the comments.</p><p>One of the most exciting aspects of this game system is the fact that the bonding process increases the number of very powerful Archetypes. Thinking about what battles you can fight with the Archetypes you acquire from the followers you meet will play a large role in your strategies. It is up to you, the player, to choose a follower in favor of strategy or choose a follower whose circumstances are of interest to you. It is well worth giving thought to, so I hope you look forward to it.</p><p>Up to this point, we have introduced the battle system, the dungeons, the story, and the characters. However, a new and different aspect of <em>Metaphor</em> is the element of enjoying daily activities on your journey. In the next Showcase, I will finally introduce the journey aspect in detail, so please stay tuned.</p><p>Once again, <em>Metaphor</em> is scheduled for release this fall on October 11, 2024. Both the physical and digital editions are available for pre-orders, so please pre-order your copy or add it to your wishlist. Along with the standard edition, a Digital Deluxe Edition commemorating the 35th anniversary of the ATLUS brand is also available. You can also get additional pre-order bonuses, so make sure to pre-order today. See you at the next ATLUS Exclusive Showcase! Thank you very much for your time today!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While Rowling did not directly contribute to Quidditch Champions, she benefits monetarily from sales for the game. In 2022, US Quidditch and Major League Quidditch--real sports leagues inspired by the fictional game--<a href="https://www.usquadball.org/news/quidditch-changes-name-to-quadball" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">rebranded to Quadball in response to Rowling's transphobic statements</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/how-to-make-movie-theater-popcorn-flavacol-secret-ingredient<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re like me, you enjoy a snack of popped corn while watching a movie. And if you’re also like me, you like experimenting at home with flavors. Popcorn toppers, real butter, ghee, heck I know some hippies out there love nutritional yeast. But if you want to recreate the genuine “movie theater” popcorn, do what the pros do: spend 10 bucks and get yourself some Flavacol.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I love additional profits! Credit: <a href="https://shop.gmpopcorn.com/products/original-flavacol-2045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gold Medal</a></figcaption></figure><p>Flavacol comes in a big 32 ounce milk carton that looks like it has not changed since Eisenhower was in office. Gold Medal, the company that makes it, has been making <a href="https://www.gmpopcorn.com/company/history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carnival-adjacent snack supplies since 1931</a>. It’s made in Cincinnati, which is exactly where I want my artificial popcorn flavoring to be made. The side of the carton implores the reader “FOR <em>additional </em>PROFITS TRY THESE GOLD MEDAL PROFIT-MAKERS: Sno-Kones®, COTTON CANDY, NACHOS, HOT DOGS &amp; MORE!.” This is the industrial stuff they use in theaters, it’s a radioactive orange powder that is roughly the same hue as the cheese that comes with Kraft.&nbsp;</p><p>The ingredients in Flavacol are essentially salt, flavors and coloring. It costs less than 10 dollars for about 32 ounces or 827 servings, and unless you are running a theater you will not run out of it for several years. Part of what makes Flavacol work is that popcorn salt is very finely ground, so unlike table salt it permeates every single nook and cranny of the kernel. It gives the popcorn a&nbsp; light orange hue and that “movie” taste that we all know and love. They sell <a href="https://shop.gmpopcorn.com/collections/popcorn-supplies?_=pf&amp;pf_v_brand=Flavacol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several varieties of Flavacol</a> including a “Better Butter” variant, “Premier” variant without yellow #5, and a Color Free version that comes in a 4 pound bucket. I just stick to the normal stuff because I bought it once and have no reason to get anything else until retirement.</p><figure><figcaption>I only have the stuff on the left because I bought it once and have not needed anything else. Credit: Golden Medal.</figcaption></figure><p>There are many ways to prepare popcorn, but I prefer a <a href="https://www.whirleypopshop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whirley Pop</a> over an air popper. It’s a big aluminum kettle you put on your stove. It has a crank that you can use to constantly agitate the kernels while also mixing in whatever oil and additives you want. The Whirley Pop is cheap, and simple and unless you need an <a href="https://www.whirleypopshop.com/products/whirley-pop-stovetop-popcorn-popper-with-metal-gears-stainless-steel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">induction-compatible model</a> or are afraid of aluminum it’s your best bet for the money.&nbsp;ew</p><figure><figcaption>Traded my air popper in for one of these ages ago and I have never looked back. Credit: Whirley Pop</figcaption></figure><p>People are very particular about their popcorn workflow, so feel free to experiment with your preferred oil and salt ratio, as well as the order of operation for when to add your Flavacol. Some people prefer to use special butter flavored popcorn oil. Those people are valid, but for my money you can’t go wrong with Flavacol and coconut oil, the preferred combo of many popcorn enthusiasts. Ghee is nice to experiment with as well, and it’s shelf stable so easy to keep around. I have heard from fellow “corn heads” that a <a href="https://www.popcornsupply.com/stainless-steel-dredge-salt-shaker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stainless steel dredge</a> is also nice to have, since it’s cheap and easy to get at a restaurant supply store, but you can do without it. You can also get a big reusable tub so you can pretend your living room is the weird independent multiplex near your house that’s slightly cheaper for some reason.&nbsp;</p><p>Popcorn itself is a surprisingly deep rabbit hole, too deep to discuss here, but if you have an opportunity, at the very least experiment with different popcorn varieties. <a href="https://amishcountrypopcorn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amish Country</a> is a good supplier and they sell big sampler boxes of all their different varieties, but you should at least give Mushroom a shot – it’s the big puff ball one that you usually see in kettle and caramel corn. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/popcorn/comments/thru38/mushroom_or_butterfly_discuss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Some people love it, some hate it,</a> and I personally go back and forth between that and the standard butterfly depending on my mood and toppings.</p><p>Happy cornin’.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games</a> come in a lot of different themes, but war is one of the most popular ones. And for good reason – war board games can be incredibly fun and exciting. All of the games below will give you a feeling of epic battle. Some may do it in an evening, some may take all day, but none of them will sell you short on battle strategy along the way. Gather some friends, get the snacks and drinks together, and settle in for a long haul thrill ride.</p><p>Here are a few tips to help longer games run smoothly: If you can, get a PDF copy of the rulebook (most publishers make them freely available) and have everyone read it before the game. Insist players do "admin" tasks like sorting their hands or counters outside their turn. You may also want to impose a time limit per turn if all players agree. Now, on with the games!</p><h2>TL;DR: These Are the Best War Board Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#sniper-elite">Sniper Elite: The Board Game</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#twilight-imperium">Twilight Imperium IV</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#blood-rage">Blood Rage</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#dune">Dune</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#kemet">Kemet: Blood and Sand</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#rebellion">Star Wars: Rebellion</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#conflict-of-heroes">Conflict of Heroes: Awakening the Bear</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#undaunted">Undaunted: Normandy / Undaunted: North Africa</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#root">Root</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#twilight-struggle">Twilight Struggle: Red Sea</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#got">A Game of Thrones: The Board Game</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#war-of-the-ring">War of the Ring</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#eclipse">Eclipse: Second Dawn for the Galaxy</a></li></ul><h2 id="sniper-elite">Sniper Elite: The Board Game</h2><div id="164399" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Sniper Elite: The Board Game</h3></p></div><p>Fans of the video game series might be surprised by the close-quarters action depicted in this tabletop adaptation, but that shouldn’t discourage you from its considerable charms. The stealth aspects are wholly intact, as the sniper player is trying to stay slow and silent while up against a punishing clock, and the roving squads controlled by the German player who are trying to sniff him out. In addition to that ever-escalating tension, it’s also got a sense of historical veneer that the video game lacks, with thematic components and more realistic combat. The game comes with two different boards and a variety of sniper loadout options and squad specialists for the German player, ensuring it’s got tons of replay value and tactical decision-making to explore.</p><h2 id="twilight-imperium">Twilight Imperium IV</h2><div id="158887" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Twilight Imperium 4th Edition</h3></p></div><p>Games don't get more epic than this all-day affair of sci-fi civilization building. It's got everything you could want from the genre. A range of bizarre aliens research technology and build fleets to fight over a random galactic hex map. There's inter-player diplomacy, of course, but also in-game political decrees to vote on. Yet while dealmaking is important, it rests on a rock-solid <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategic core</a> to challenge you. The strategy card system, where each player picks a special focus each round, is a particular mechanical gem. This fourth edition retains the sweeping scope but trims lots of fat, making it more accessible. </p><h2 id="blood-rage">Blood Rage</h2><div id="196921" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Blood Rage</h3></p></div><p>In Blood Rage, you control a Viking clan heading into the end times of Ragnarök and trying to gain as much rage, axes and horns as they can to win glory for their warriors and a place in Valhalla. As delightfully angsty as that all sounds, the violent exterior and great-looking components hide a game of considerable strategic subtlety. You’ll be drafting cards to support your actions each round, carefully marshaling your limited supply of warriors and monsters to try and pillage map regions and fulfill quests to earn that all-important glory. Of course, everyone else has the same designs, so you’ll frequently be fighting them for the privilege using an exciting blind battle card system. A fantastic blend of tactical challenge, theme and outright brutality, this is a definitive conflict-based classic.</p><h2 id="dune">Dune</h2><div id="158888" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Dune</h3></p></div><p>Dune is a very different kind of futuristic game, (not to be confused with <a href="https://zdcs.link/PjB0D?_ga=398378208.1708462773&amp;object_uuid=0abb9d39-5c55-4637-acfd-0bb89acb5f8b&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Dune: Imperium</a>). Based on Frank Herbert's famous novel and first released in 1979, it was years ahead of its time. There's little randomness in Dune. Instead, the game rests on a fascinating balance of hidden information and asymmetrical strategy.</p><p>Each player takes the role of a faction from the book, with asymmetric special powers. The Atreides, for example, get to peek at cards as they're auctioned off blind, while the wicked Harkonnen know all the secret traitors in play. The result is an astonishing evocation of the narrative and political themes of the novel. This new edition has cleaner rules and spanking art.</p><h2 id="kemet">Kemet: Blood and Sand</h2><div id="196922" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Kemet Blood and Sand</h3></p></div><p>Imagine all the gods and mythical creatures of ancient Egypt were real, and that they came down to the desert sands one day to tear each other into itty-bitty pieces. That’s Kemet. You could talk about the tech pyramids that allow you to tailor your strategy with special powers across attack and defense, and feed those into your board play. You could talk about how everyone starts with the same battle cards to use in fights, leading to terrible mind games as you try and out-guess what your opponent will play and what they’ll discard. But mostly this is all about out-and-out violence at a breathtaking pace, as the peculiar board layout means there’s no hiding, and everyone is a mere skip away from tearing everyone else’s mummified guts out.</p><h2 id="rebellion">Star Wars: Rebellion</h2><div id="158890" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Star Wars: Rebellion</h3></p></div><p>Star Wars: Rebellion takes a more liberal approach to reconstruct a favorite franchise on your table. It's clearly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games">Star Wars</a>. The Rebellion player is the underdog, trying to survive militarily while winning planets over to their cause. The Empire, meanwhile, wields the power of huge armies to crush the slightest sign of dissent. It's a fascinating asymmetric struggle, peopled by well-known characters and events from the movies. But beyond the famous faces, the unfolding narrative is up to you. It's all woven together with tight strategic strings to ensure each turn is full of challenge and variety.</p><h2 id="conflict-of-heroes">Conflict of Heroes: Awakening the Bear</h2><div id="196924" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Conflict of Heroes: Awakening The Bear</h3></p></div><p>Tactical wargames, where the action is depicted at the level of squads or individual soldiers, are a tricky genre to get right. There’s so much detail available that it’s easy to get bogged down in over-complex systems, which, in turn, slow down what should be a pulse-pounding encounter. No game gets the balance better than the Conflict of Heroes series, which uses a simple system of action points, dice and differing front and rear defense values to offer players excitement, realism and tactical challenge all in one neat package. While it starts out simple, it soon expands to include artillery, vehicles and tanks for a full World War 2 experience. And the command point system, a tiny pool of extra actions you can invoke during your opponent’s turn, is a stroke of genius, with every point spent feeling like giving blood.  </p><h2 id="undaunted">Undaunted: Normandy &amp; Undaunted: North Africa</h2><div><div id="158884" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Undaunted: Normandy</h3></p></div><div id="158885" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Undaunted: North Africa</h3></p></div><div id="173903" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Undaunted Stalingrad</h3></p></div></div><p>While in no way a simulation, the way these games leverage the deck building genre to conjure the tactics of infantry combat from just a few rules is astonishing. Officer cards let you add new unit cards to your deck, imitating the issuing of orders and supplies to soldiers in the field. Those unit cards, meanwhile, let you move the matching troop counters on the modular scenario map, fighting the enemy and seizing objectives. Casualties thin your deck, making units less able to act as their morale erodes under fire. With tense firefights and pivotal moments aplenty, you won't find a more accessible or engaging way to refight the Second World War. </p><h2 id="root">Root</h2><div id="155278" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Root: A Game of Woodland Might and Right</h3></p></div><p>One of the shorter games on the list, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/root-board-game-review">Root</a> is a bold design that throws asymmetry to the fore. There are four factions fighting for control of the woodland realm, each with its own unique rules and feel. The Marquise de Cat and the Eyrie play standard, if quite different, conquest games. The Woodland Folk are guerrilla fighters against those invaders. Finally, the Vagabond is a lone trickster-hero. Don't let the cute theme and quirky art put you off – this is a red-blooded game of brutal strategy, where each play asks big questions about politics and governance in the real world.</p><h2 id="twilight-struggle">Twilight Struggle: Red Sea</h2><div id="196923" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Twilight Struggle: Red Sea</h3></p></div><p>The original Twilight Struggle is often counted among the best board games ever made, but there’s a problem: It’s complex and takes three or four hours to play. This version keeps the core card-play of the original that made it so compelling, with players facing endless dilemmas whether to risk triggering key events for their opponent as they navigate their hand of cards, but cranks down the play time to a mere hour or so. It’s still full of meaty, awkward decisions to navigate, but a new scoring mechanic helps ratchet up the excitement in the shorter game. And for history buffs there’s the chance to explore this little-known corner of the Cold War as it unfolded in East Africa, with real historical events simulated on the player’s cards through the game mechanics, and a book of designer’s notes to illuminate their view of the history.</p><h2 id="got">A Game of Thrones: The Board Game</h2><div id="158891" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>A Game of Thrones: The Board Game</h3></p></div><p>Speaking of politics, this game recreates all the conniving and backstabbing of the books and TV show. To do so, it borrows a trick from classic Diplomacy: only one player can win, but no player has the resources to win alone. Alliances and eventual treachery are thus inevitable, keeping everyone on a knife-edge. It's governed by a thrilling secret order system, meaning you can't know your opponent's intentions until it's too late. Atop this time-tested formula are lots of sweet bells and whistles from the world of Westeros to add strategic interest. A great game in its own right, it's a must for fans of the franchise. </p><h2 id="war-of-the-ring">War of the Ring</h2><div id="158892" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>War of the Ring 2nd Edition</h3></p></div><p>Another top game for lovers of the source material, this is by far the best of the many attempts to board-game Tolkien. At its heart is a brilliant division into two games on the same board. First is the epic clash of armies across Middle-earth, as the free peoples wake up and resist the threat of the dark lord Sauron. Beneath is the quest of the Fellowship to throw the One Ring into the fire before Sauron conquers all. The genius of this design is the way the two halves interweave at every turn, leaving a tricky tactical balancing act for players to master.</p><h2 id="eclipse">Eclipse: Second Dawn for the Galaxy</h2><div id="158886" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Eclipse: 2nd Dawn for The Galaxy</h3></p></div><p>While the Twilight Imperium series has tended to emphasise warfare and diplomacy over long-term planning, Eclipse attempts to bring more strategy to sci-fi civilization-building. Smart systems for initiative and technology upgrades mean you’re always having to look several steps ahead as you branch out from your starting hex into the unknown reaches of the galaxy. That tactical depth doesn’t detract from the feeling of exploring the cosmos, designing ships and taking the fight to your opponents. It’s just that when you get there, you need to be more reliant on having the right tech and the right units than falling back on the luck of the dice. </p><p><em>If you like these, be sure to check out our picks for the overall </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time"><em>best board games</em></a><em> and the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-deals"><em>best board game deals</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>What Counts as a Wargame?</h2><p>In hobby circles, “wargame” is a surprisingly loaded term. Folk who spend a lot of time in gaming circles tend to use it to exclusively refer to a small genre of games that simulate historical conflicts. Although it’s a niche interest, a lot of titles that fit the bill are published every year, often commanding high prices for boxes that contain map sheets and dozens of cardboard counters, because the major effort in getting these games to market is the detailed historical research required. Awakening the Bear and Twilight Struggle: Red Sea are our examples from our list, and they’re at the more approachable end of the genre.</p><p>However, even in this apparently neat definition, there’s room for a lot of grey areas. A few games seek to bring the simulation angle to conflicts that might have happened, but either didn’t, or haven’t, such as the Cold War erupting into World War 3. Others, like Undaunted, take the historical setting but have limited interest in being simulations. Finally, the smallest group of all are games that try to be realistic about entirely fantastic or science-fiction scenarios. Do any of these count as “wargames”? Some gamers will say yes, others no.</p><p>Fundamentally, of course, these kinds of semantic discussions are of limited interest to anyone who doesn’t play these kinds of games. So we’ve gone for the widest possible definition, which is games that explore conflict from a variety of different perspectives, from historical simulation to fantasy diplomacy. But if a particular subsection of conflict games appeals to you, and you want to explore it further, there will be enthusiast sites out there to help you.</p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/creepy-card-game-arsonate-is-a-very-short-race-to-be-the-last-person-burning.939960/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creepy-card-game-arsonate-is-a-very-short-race-to-be-the-last-person-burning<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
2024’s small but growing avalanche of games that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-we-just-went-an-entire-year-where-every-game-was-as-short-cheap-and-existentially-harrowing-as-clickolding-thatd-be-great-thanks">trap you in a room with a nasty little freak</a> continues with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arsonate">Arsonate</a>, in which the nasty little freak wears a gasmask and wants to set you on fire. He wants to do this using cards. There are 47 of them - a forest of silhouettes, laid across the blood-stained table between you. Every turn, you flip a tree card to reveal a flame. When the flames spread to a player’s Tower card, it’s game over.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The trouble is, you can only flip cards on your half of the board, with the conflagration beginning in the middle. So "set you on fire" is wrong, actually: the gist of Arsonate is to carefully sculpt a mutually threatening blaze so that you get incinerated <em>last</em>. Integral to this are fire cards that trigger events. These range from giving you an extra turn – typically, not very welcome – to awarding you a random utility you can use to twist the odds. 
</p>
<p>
Utilities emerge from a weird little dumbwaiter to left of the table, and must be secured in a locker before you can play them. They include fire extinguishers, which let you re-flip a fire card, spy-glasses, which let you peek beneath a tree card, and crowbars, which let you steal a utility from one of your opponent's lockers. Don’t worry, he’ll happily do the same to you: on normal difficulty, the game tells you outright that your enemy loves to cheat. Utilities are executed with pleasing literalness: I have yet to win any real-life cardgames by embedding a fireaxe in the table, but I'm keen to try it during my next round of Cosmic Encounters.
</p>
<p>
Each game of Arsonate should take under 30 minutes, and there are three possible endings. It’s all obviously reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inscryption-meets-russian-roulette-in-this-weird-short-horror-game">Buckshot Roulette</a>, a named influence <a href="https://nashset.itch.io/arsonate-demo">on the Itch.io page</a>, and less obviously of Inscryption, though I’m not sure the demo is as gripping as either. Arsonate’s Host doesn’t have the abject animatronic wrongness of Buckshot’s dealer, and the card game isn't as viscous with flourishes and variables as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inscryption">Inscryption</a>’s equivalent. Still, it <em>is</em> a demo, and it’s getting there.</p>
<p>Why do we like video games that trap us inside with a nasty little freak? I wonder if it’s down to the suspicion that most video game developers are nasty little freaks. "Entertainers", my eye - video game developers are Cartesian demons who immerse us in predatory stagecraft and perform mean tricks on us from behind the veil of code. In games such as this, you can at least savour the pretence of confronting the sadistic fucker and, if you play your fireaxes right, cooking their goose.
</p>
<p>Arsonate is also on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2822980/ARSONATE/">Steam</a> - there's no release date yet. Question for the thread: favourite fire system in a game? I’ll see your oh-so-predictable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-far-cry-2-is-the-best-in-the-series">Far Cry 2 shoutout</a> and raise you one <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tenderfoot-tactics">Tenderfoot Tactics</a>.</p>

			<p>Rockstar Games leaker tez2 <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2/status/1817699079876407495" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> today that Grand Theft Auto V may soon launch on PC Game Pass. The game has previously been on Xbox Game Pass, but only for consoles; it would be the first time on PC.</p>
<p>While the addition of such a high-profile game is always welcome, it is doubtful many gamers would still need to take advantage. Grand Theft Auto V launched on PC on April 14, 2015, nearly two years after its debut on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It's been available for over nine years on various stores, such as Steam, the Epic Games Store (where it was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-free-egs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free</a> to grab for a limited time back in 2020), and Rockstar's own launcher. Moreover, it's currently priced at just $15. The PC version is also still behind the next-gen console version, which was enhanced with ray traced ambient occlusion and shadows a while ago.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V is currently the second best-selling premium game of all time, having recently broken the milestone of 200 million units sold. Only Minecraft, with its estimated 300 million units sold, stands above it; of course, it has a much larger target audience than Rockstar's M-rated game.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor, Grand Theft Auto V did not receive any single player DLCs. There was at least one in production featuring the character Trevor, but it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-rockstar-dev-says-kick-ass-gta-v-standalone-trevor-dlc-was-scrapped-to-milk-gta-onlines-cash-cow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set</a> aside in favor of GTA Online support once Rockstar noticed the incredible popularity of the multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>GTA Online itself is still regularly updated to this day. Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-online-bottom-dollar-bounties-update-out-now-adding-bounty-hunts-dispatch-work-and-new-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released </a>the Bottom Dollar Bounties update last month, and there's more to come throughout the Summer. As for Grand Theft Auto VI, the long-awaited sequel is slated to launch in Fall 2025 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X, while a PC version is likely coming around a year to a year and a half later.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-board-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>When it comes to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games"><u>best Star Wars board games</u></a>, you have a lot of great choices. The Queen’s Gambit, for instance, recreates the multi-front finale of The Phantom Menace. Star Wars: Rebellion captures the breadth of the original trilogy in a three-hour epic. The Mandalorian Adventures is the latest tabletop take on Star Wars, and it’s shooting for a somewhat smaller scope. This new release is content to capture several key moments from the first season of The Mandalorian, presenting these encounters as 40-minute firefights with color, tension, and a minimal amount of overhead. Just like the show upon which it’s based, this is a splendid slice of Star Wars that packs some new surprises while managing to call back to the spirit of the franchise. </p><div catalogid="068db5aa-26cf-442f-bd55-e367b98276dc" id="205353"><div id="205353" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Star Wars: The Mandalorian Adventures Board Game</h3></p></div><p>This is a very straightforward and approachable game. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-adventure-book-game-review"><u>The Lord of the Rings Adventure Book Game</u></a> immediately comes to mind, as the structure here is similar. Play is focused around a spiral-bound book that forms the board. Each new scenario moves on to a subsequent page, allowing for quick setup and minimal storage space. While there is a main rulebook, missions themselves introduce new rules and tweaks that are printed alongside the map. It’s a relatively seamless experience to work through the book and internalize the additional details.</p><p>The core system is simple and surprisingly interesting. Players cooperate to take down game-controlled foes and accomplish the scenario objective. You can choose between characters such as Mando, IG-11, and Greef Karga. Each possesses their own unique deck of cards and abilities. On your turn you perform two actions, but the effectiveness of each action is variable and depends on the card you play. So, if you play a four-strength card to move, then you will move four spaces. A two-strength card to attack means you inflict two damage, and so on. Some cards include special ability text that offers additional benefits. This system is interesting because it’s a blend of a straightforward two-action turn with variance in action points. Furthermore, the way enemy response plays off this card system is splendid.</p><p>These action cards are played in slots on the board. All of the cards any player spends to move go into the “move” slot, for instance. Once one of the slots receives a total of five or more strength total, the enemy phase triggers and a card is drawn. This emphasizes the strength of the game in presenting tense and nuanced systems with the absolute minimal amount of rules weight. It enforces timing constraints and facilitates discussion between players, because you may hold off on throwing down that powerful card so that one of your buddies gets to go before the enemies trigger.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is a very straightforward and approachable game.</p></div><p>This tension is important, as it’s the primary source of drama. All damage is set by the power of your attack card or the activation card drawn for the enemies. No dice are rolled, so the dynamism is entirely encapsulated in the card play. This works to increase the speed of the game and achieve that brief playtime at the expense of a more nuanced combat system. That makes sense, as this game is aimed at less experienced players as well as dedicated hobbyists.</p><p>Despite the relative simplicity, Mandalorian Adventures has an almost puzzle-like feel. The difficulty, while able to be tweaked, is formidable enough that it requires thought and discussion on how players will approach their turns. Often, you will use what information you have in combination with gut instinct to formulate a plan. Analyzing the board state is essential to success.</p><p>One of the most intriguing aspects is in how it bridges the gap between those two levels of players. Each scenario is standalone, as this is not a campaign game. However, it wants you to engage the missions in order on your first playthrough. This is because there is an accompanying deck of cards that gives you step-by-step instructions on what to play next. It’s a key component in introducing new rules in bite-sized pieces, rules that you can then apply to all games going forward. New content is also added to play and the system adjustments are considerable. By your fifth session, the game will have grown quite a bit in density, but it will have been an effortless journey.</p><p>In addition to this large deck of cards, there are two full-sized envelopes. They contain additional ways to play or modify existing scenarios. Once you have finished revealing everything, you will have numerous ways to enjoy the game. It’s an interesting concept, one indicative of publisher Unexpected Games’ design philosophy. They presented a similar approach with their debut title, The Initiative (<a href="https://zdcs.link/BdvJv?object_uuid=9c5fafc2-a1bf-4d20-a416-f65b74714548&amp;t=article" target="_blank">see at Amazon</a>). That game also presented new content during the course of play and shook up expectations. </p><p>This methodology, of breaking up the experience into a gradual arc of play, and then throwing in several optional modules to re-experience existing scenarios, is very effective. One such example, mentioned in the game’s core rulebook and hence not technically a spoiler, is the inclusion of a traitor mode of play. This is a set of cards where players are given a randomized loyalty with the chance of one character being a traitor to the group. This is excellent as it touches upon the themes of trust and honor present in the television series. You can add these cards into any existing scenario to spice it up. This mode is completely optional and not the standard way to play. In fact, it’s probably best to hold off on this until you’ve played several sessions, as the traitor mode is somewhat fragile and can result in uneven plays. Yet, when it comes together with a perfectly timed reveal, it’s wonderfully cinematic. </p><p>There's a good deal of depth here in exploring the system and additional content. It manages to elevate the experience, achieving a status above the comparably mellow Lord of the Rings Adventure Book Game. The Mandalorian Adventures is not likely to supplant Star Wars: Rebellion or Imperial Assault for fans of those more robust and weighty titles, but it’s a surprisingly devious game that captures a solid amount of tension with simple and interesting systems. It is very flexible, supporting solitaire play or even multiple participants sharing characters by shuffling all of the cards into a single deck. This really is a stellar box that offers much more than appears on the surface.</p><h3>Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/xPWJO?object_uuid=9c5fafc2-a1bf-4d20-a416-f65b74714548&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/weoVq?object_uuid=9c5fafc2-a1bf-4d20-a416-f65b74714548&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Asmodee</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/2eRXD?object_uuid=9c5fafc2-a1bf-4d20-a416-f65b74714548&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Unexpected Games</a></li></ul></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 29, 2024 7:43 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>This apparently modest board game unveils itself over multiple plays, presenting an escalating series of surprises that tweaks the overall ruleset through additional content.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fablecraft-startplaying-partnership-announced-by-developers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new update video was released by the developers of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/fablecraft-creators-talk-about-their-accessible-digital-ttrpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Fablecraft</em></a>. This digital TTRPG, which released about a week ago on Steam Early Access, has been steadily rolling out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/developers-of-digital-ttrpg-fablecraft-announce-homebrew-tools" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new features</a> and listening to player feedback. One of those new features is an official Fablecraft StartPlaying partnership.</p>

<p>The Fablecraft StartPlaying partnership was the first thing announced in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqFfYvaYIxM">most recent video</a> on the Tales of Fablecraft YouTube channel. For those not aware, StartPlaying is a premium service platform where players can find TTRPG campaigns run by professional GMs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fablecraft-battlemap-gameplay-screenshot.jpg?itok=EQhhXzBp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fablecraft-battlemap-gameplay-screenshot.jpg?itok=t2jPbQMF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The platform hosts games from many RPG systems. Everything from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/cyberpunk-red-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk Red</em></a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/vampire-masquerade-5th-edition-review-front-loaded-lore" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em></a> is available on the platform if you are willing to pay for a seat.</p>
<p>Now, professional GMs can host games of <em>Fablecraft</em> as well. The video even contains a $10 in-store credit promo for those who want to start playing immediately. Given that the <em>Fablecraft</em> game is currently available for free, you're paying for the convenience of a tailored, safe play environment by a dedicated professional; a great introduction to the tabletop hobby.</p>
<p>The <em>Fablecraft</em> StartPlaying partnership wasn't the only announcement in this update video. Outside of general quality-of-life updates and bug fixes, the video highlights seven feature requests via player feedback. This feedback was gathered via the <em>Fablecraft</em> Discord Server, the Steam Community forums, Steam User Reviews, and their dedicated feedback website.</p>
<p>GMs requested more <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/developers-of-digital-ttrpg-fablecraft-announce-homebrew-tools" rel="noopener" target="_blank">homebrew tools</a>. These include changes to the Gamemaster Guide and a user-generated content marketplace. Homebrew tools were already announced as part of Fablecraft's content roadmap.</p>
<p>As for general requests, players have asked for additional pre-made content, Fable Dice enhancements, matchmaking, and more single-player content like the combat arena. The video does state the dev team's priority right now is towards multiplayer and homebrew integration, given how key it is to the TTRPG experience.</p>

That’s because as he was down, Patrice settled on an unorthodox method to try and clinch victory: he began jumping ever so slightly, and then very aggressively, towards his opponent.</p><p>An utterly ridiculous clip of Patrice pulling this off at the Paris Olympics is going around now, and I’m kind of incredulous at the whole thing. He’s clearly like a wounded (and losing) animal lashing out as it’s backed into a corner, but the move actually stuns the other guy so much that he just keeps being able to press the advance and frantically whip his saber looking for a touch until it eventually connects. It’s the equivalent of smashing the buttons at your local arcade’s exhibition and actually stealing a win off your opponent.<br></p><p>I always thought fencing had much more to do with composure, light touches, and ripostes, but I’m not sure Patrice has ever heard of the terms if I’m being honest. One of the top comments on the video jokes that his “0-60 is faster than most cars,” and they aren’t exaggerating.

Considering that just two weekends ago, the biggest fighting game tournament in the world occurred in Vegas, folks who had the genre fresh on the brain (including myself) started getting jokes off about footsies and jabs, which are attacks you do to try and poke the other player and gain control of the space before you, opening them up to further moves.</p><p>In the parlance of the fighting game community, my man Patrice <em>nailed</em> the jump-in.

The spin-off features a career mode and online play, including co-op and PVP. Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be any split-screen, which would be a huge miss for a licensed game like this.

If you miss a play is it easy to get back in time? What kind of mechanics keep you from constantly hitting breakaways? Comparisons to <em>Rocket League </em>are already being made, which is the best thing any sports game, <em>Harry Potter</em> or no, could hope for. </p><p>Unlike <em>Rocket League</em>, however, <em>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</em> isn’t free-to-play. It’s $30 when it comes out September 3 on PC and all consoles, though it will be free for paid PS Plus subscribers that month.

He was 67.</p>

<p>Supermassive announced Pankhurst's passing on Twitter. A <a href="https://tonypankhurst.muchloved.com/">tribute page</a> from Pankhurst’s family (spotted by <em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-dark-pictures-anthology-curator-tony-pankhurst-has-died/1100-6525365/">GameSpot</a></em>) reveals that he died on May 9 and his funeral was held on June 7. The family is currently accepting donations to Hospice in the Weald, who cared for Pankhurst during his final weeks.</p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We are all saddened to hear of Tony Pankhurst's passing. He was the face of The Curator, and we loved working with him. 🤍 <a href="https://t.co/ZZQbeViE8S">pic.twitter.com/ZZQbeViE8S</a></p>

<p>Pankhurst’s career in the entertainment industry spans over 40 years across films, TV, and radio. In video games, he provided the likeness for the mysterious Curator in The Dark Pictures Anthology games Man of Madan, Little Hope, House of Ashes, and The Devil in Me, although actor Pip Torrens provided the voice and motion capture for the character. Pankhurst did portray a live-action version of The Curator in a trailer for 2021's House of Ashes, which you can watch below.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-london-devs-update-bugs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Last week, Fallout: London was finally released after a lengthy delay and years of development. It emerged as an ambitious and impressive game-sized mod that’s unfortunately plagued by bugs, crashes, and stability issues – plus a complex installation process that can alienate users on some platforms. However, there’s a dizzying amount of meat on the bones and it’s something I’m desperate to play in full.</p>



<p>That’s why I’m over the moon that Team FOLON has revealed the impending deployment of an update that’ll target the worst issues in Fallout: London.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-wrong-with-fallout-london">What’s Wrong With Fallout: London?</h2>



<p>Fallout: London is pretty great, but some fundamental issues with the mod’s stability are making it a nightmare to play. I managed to battle my way through about 20 minutes before I hit a crash loop that never ended. Fortunately, Team FOLON has pledged that an update is coming to tackle these issues:</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/TeamFOLON/status/1817959101441446153">https://x.com/TeamFOLON/status/1817959101441446153</a></p>



<p>This is great news for anyone struggling to play one of the most ambitious mods in gaming history. Fallout: London has hundreds of quests and 20 original factions, and it features an authentic representation of post-apocalyptic London. I <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-london-review-first-impressions/">wrote up a review</a> featuring my first impressions if you’re interested.</p>



<p>If you’re having issues with <strong>your </strong>installation of Fallout: London, try following the advice detailed in this lengthy guide.</p>

That massive scope includes more than 700 different characters and 140,000 lines of dialogue.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to make sure we got this one right," creative director John Epler said in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilgaurd-took-so-long-as-bioware-wanted-to-make-sure-we-got-this-one-right-that-and-it-takes-a-long-time-to-record-700-characters-and-140000-lines/" rel="nofollow ">GamesRadar</a>, in which he also revealed the enormous amount of dialogue.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard Is a Great Start For Newcomers | Summer Game Fest 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Performance director Ashley Barlow added that--in addition to other projects BioWare was working on during the decade between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition/">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> and The Veilguard--part of the reason the game took so long to make was simply due to the sheer number of characters and voice lines.</p><p dir="ltr">"We started casting five years ago," Barlow said. "The team, the talent, has been on for five years. It takes a long time to record [dialogue for] 700 characters, you know--80,000 lines or 140,000 lines with all the Rooks. It just takes time to make [it] good."</p><p dir="ltr">The game features seven romanceable companion characters, and the player-character--who BioWare has nicknamed Rook--has four voices for players to choose from (two feminine voices and two masculine voices). That brings the total number of voice actors for main characters alone to 11. Add in Varric (who will accompany the player in certain parts of the game) and the game's main antagonist, Solas, and you're looking at 13 voice actors who absolutely <em>must</em> get their lines right.</p><p dir="ltr">Given the fact that the total number of characters is 700 (with all of them <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/">voiced by actual humans</a>), it's no surprise that the game took significant time to make, especially considering the varying dialogue branches that have become commonplace in most RPGs. They even got Alex Jordan, who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/actor-who-voiced-baldurs-gate-3s-kissing-noises-announces-charity-stream-with-hilarious-tiktok-video/1100-6521395/">provided all of the kissing noises</a> for Baldur's Gate 3, to pitch in for one of Rook's voices (it's unclear if he also provided smooching sounds for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-gonna-show-a-lot-of-skin/1100-6524909/">The Veilguard's spicier scenes</a>).</p><p dir="ltr">"I sit on a throne of moans," Jordan <a href="https://x.com/AlexJordanVO/status/1815478891693101081" rel="nofollow ">joked on Twitter</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">But all the time in the recording booth was worth it, according to Epler, who says the newest entry in the Dragon Age franchise is "the best version" of the game that it "could possibly be."</p><p>BioWare still hasn't announced an official release date, but the game is currently slated for release sometime in late 2024.
