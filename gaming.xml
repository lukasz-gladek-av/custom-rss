            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dual monitors are yesterday’s setup. Triple monitor arrays look impressive but waste desk space and demand GPU resources just to manage bezels. The real power move is one massive ultrawide that replaces everything while delivering an experience no multi-monitor rig can match. <strong>Samsung’s 49-inch Odyssey OLED G93SC</strong> solves the fundamental problem gamers face: you need maximum screen real estate, perfect image quality, and response times fast enough to matter in competitive play. This isn’t a compromise solution: It’s the endgame display that removes every excuse between you and peak performance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3899/">Right now it’s dropped to $879 from its typical $1,599 price on Amazon, a 45 percent discount that brings premium QD-OLED technology within reach of gamers</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3899/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The 49-inch curved display has 5120×1440 resolution which <strong>provides the equivalent of two 27-inch QHD monitors side-by-side</strong> without bezel interruption. That 32:9 aspect ratio dramatically reimagines the experience of games. Racing simulations wrap around your peripheral vision with opponents on each side of you simultaneously. First-person shooters give you situational awareness that is cheating-like, with flanking enemies in sight earlier than players in ordinary displays.</p>



<h2>Gamers Will Love It</h2>
<p><strong>Quantum Dot OLED is the current leader in display technology</strong>, combining OLED’s perfect blacks and infinite contrast with quantum dot color and brightness. Elder LCD screens have bleeder backlights that bleed through black areas, warping shadows and hiding enemies in the shadows. QD-OLED pixels are emitting and can be completely turned off and produce actual blacks with no light bleed. <strong>DisplayHDR True Black 400 certification</strong> means you can see into deep, rich darks but still have great highlights, so you’ll notice movement in dark corridors that other players just can’t spot on their lower-end panels.</p>
<p>The 0.03ms gray-to-gray response time is essentially click-by-click. For context, the majority of gaming monitors market 1ms response time, and a lot of LCD panels fail to even get close to actually providing that figure. This <strong>OLED screen responds 33 times faster</strong> and removes motion blur and ghosting even during high-speed camera pans or acrobatic action scenes. Combined <strong>with the 240Hz refresh rate</strong>, you get 240 separate frames per second with each frame gliding into the next. <strong>HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort inputs</strong> provide this bandwidth in full so your GPU can send frames at full speed without disruption.</p>



<p>G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro support guarantee the <strong>monitor works with both Nvidia and AMD graphics cards</strong>, synchronizing the refresh rate of the panel with the output from your GPU in frames. This eliminates screen tearing, stutter and input lag and produces smooth motion even when frame rates are changing during fast motion scenes.</p>
<p>The slim build is just 4.5mm thick at its thinnest, with a premium metal finish that feels expensive sitting on your desk. The height-adjustable stand means you can position the gigantic screen at perfect eye level, and the USB hub makes it simple to plug in peripherals without reaching behind to your PC.</p>
<p>At $879, this is the cheapest way to get into premium ultrawide QD-OLED gaming. This monitor normally retails for $1,599, and other ultrawides with such specs cost even more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I look forward to the Call of Duty multiplayer beta each fall in the same way I look forward to the return of pumpkin spice lattes: I know exactly what I'm in for, and I always savor that first warm, familiar sip. This year's closed beta is the blast of violent, nutmeg-infused flavor I've been looking for since that first northerly chill swept across the land, and while it definitely feels like the CoD I’ve come to expect, there are a few new features I'm already really enjoying and a few more I'm really looking forward to unlocking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I installed the beta Thursday afternoon and had planned to play it well into the night, rallying my dedicated group of Call of Duty friends (the Beef Lords) to join in on the fun. In fact, playing with the boys is absolutely my favorite thing about CoD, and even a given year’s iteration is only so-so, we still have a good time together. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, and I can't really fault it since this <em>is </em>a closed beta, every time I tried to squad up with my friends, I had a hard crash. In fact, it felt like I spent more time waiting for BLOPS7 to restart than I did in matches. That's a huge bummer, because I just want to run around shooting strangers in the face with my bros. Eventually I was able to get into a few matches with one friends, and good old Call of Duty fun was had by all. It still crashed, but only after a few matches this time. I had initially planned to hit the level 20 cap last night, but with all the time I wasted rebooting not only the BLOPS7 beta but also my PC, I was only able to make it to level 14. I know. I'm not proud.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crashing aside, and no surprise here, but I’ve had a blast with what I’ve been able to play so far. I mean, it's Call of Duty, where the whole point is either to rack up as many kills as possible, or hold an objective… while also racking up as many kills as possible. I truly believe no one does it better than CoD, at least when it comes to gunplay. It's razor-sharp every damn year. It works exactly how I want it to work, it feels exactly how I want it to feel. It's as dependable as the sun rising in the east each morning.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Omnimovement, Omnimprovement</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest and most immediate changes this year are updates to the Omnimove system first introduced in last year's Black Ops 6. If you're not familiar, Omnimovement is a control mechanic that lets you perform John Woo-esque flights of gun-firing fancy, while also allowing you to move around more naturally when you're on the ground. Previously, dropping prone would reduce your target size but would render your movement slow and cumbersome. Omnimovement lets you slide to prone and do sick dolphin dives, mantle walls, and look like an action movie star in everyone else's clips, firing your weapon with 360-degrees of aiming movement while on your back.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Multiplayer Maps</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This year's Omnimovement system adds wall running and wall jumping to your arsenal. It basically lets you hop around the map like Jiminy Cricket, as you can chain up to three wall jumps together. It's really fun, though I haven't really used it tactically so far. Mostly I'm flying off walls just because it feels awesome, and if I happen to get the literal drop on an enemy, all the better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also makes moving around the map faster and gives you an advantage over mantling. When you mantle a ledge, your arms can't be used to shooting, on account of them being used to pull you up and onto that ledge. On top of that, it's kind of slow, and an opponent can use this to their advantage. You're basically a sitting duck until you get your feet all the way up, and those few moments can be the difference between life and death… well, usually death and a different kind of death.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wall jumps change that, because rather than mantle over a ledge in the traditional way, you can just bounce off the wall and make your way to the top without using your arms. You never have to put away your weapon – heck, you don't even need to stop firing your weapon. It takes away that moment of complete vulnerability, and as long as there's a wall nearby and the next level up is reachable within three jumps, you can parkour your way to victory.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Wall jumping might be my favorite addition to BLOPS7 so far.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easier said than done, mind you, and I'm not yet skilled enough to consistently hit shots when I'm going up or down from a wall jump. But it's still fun as hell, and might be my favorite addition to BLOPS7 so far.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">BLOPS7 Beta Maps</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are three maps in the closed beta: Cortex, The Forge, and Exposure. They're fine. They're not bad maps by any means, and I do like playing on them, but nothing about them really stands out to me in the way some of the maps from BLOPS6 did, either. Last year's Rewind map, with its super long corridors and building interiors, was one of my favorites, as was Skyline, with its secret passageway, various hiding spots, and multiple levels. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then again, the maps in last year's beta were even worse (I’m looking at you, Babylon), so the middling nature of these is probably not an indication of overall quality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cortex is probably my favorite of the three this year just because it has everything I like in a map: outside lanes with the possibility of falling to your death, tight interiors to come face-to-face with opps, as well as medium-length interiors and exteriors that work well with LMGs, SMGs, and assault rifles. It lends itself really well to deathmatch and objective-based modes. Plus it has some sweet sci-fi incubator tanks where I presume the super soldiers of tomorrow are being grown from the cells of past heroes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exposure is a larger map, and has a lot of cool opportunities to really feel out the wall jumping and running. There's a dangling shipping container on the map that might as well have a Wile E. Coyote-esque sign on it saying "WALL JUMP HERE." Meanwhile, The Forge is pretty big, but it doesn't really have any super long, open lanes for snipers to trade lead back and forth. That's not to say there aren't some great opportunities to do just that, but it doesn't have the same feel as last year's Rewind, with its back alley and strip mall-front.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Forge might not be my favorite map of the three, but it does have one of my favorite environmental features so far: a spinning, four-piece circular wall in the center of the map. During modes like hardpoint, the hardpoint will spawn in that area and people take turns either hiding behind or popping out from those spinning walls. It adds an extra layer of unpredictability when you're trying to hold an objective that I really like. You can't just lay prone with a sniper and peek around a corner, because the corner moves. That being said, there are a pair of lookouts on either side, so you can keep watch of the objective or just pick people off as they try to bumrush it. It's great. Even in deathmatch or Kill Confirmed it's fun, but it's really cool for Hardpoint and Domination.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Forge has one of my favorite environmental features.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the official BLOPS7 blog, there's a fourth map, Imprint. Either I've just had terrible RNG luck or they haven't actually turned that one on yet, because I haven’t seen it so far. I'm going to play the hell out of BLOPS7 over the weekend, so that could change.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Guns and Guns</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you unlock all the level requirements, there are a total of 16 available guns. Right now, and I hope Treyarch is reading this, the M10 Breacher, the default shotgun, is stupidly overpowered. You can nail enemies from way farther away than the laws of physics should allow right out of the gate, and they'll fall down dead when you do so. You barely need to aim it to get a kill across a large room. That sort of shotgun behavior is fine, even expected, at close range, or when you've leveled up and thrown a bunch of attachments on it. But as a default gun, it's just too powerful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the flip side, and this is something I never expected I'd say, but the XR-3 ION sniper rifle is exactly where it should be, power wise. Usually I feel like sniper rifles lean toward being way too OP. Don't get me wrong, I still hate snipers, and I still think people who use snipers on small maps are weak and their bloodlines are weak. But when you get a kill with the XR-3 it feels earned. There's a level of finesse here I'm not accustomed to with previous sniper rifle iterations, and I've actually used it without feeling like a dirty sniperboy. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I've always loved SMGs in Call of Duty, but none of the three available this year are doing it for me as of yet. They feel a tad too weak, which is usually the case, but it's generally made up for by a high rate of fire and lighting-fast speed of handling. I'm going to have to wait and see on the SMGs until progress is fully unlocked, but for right now, they don't feel quite like they should, as if it takes one or two bullets more than I’d expect to down an opponent. I also don't love the LMG, the Mk. 78. Similarly to the SMGs, it feels like it takes a millisecond or two too long to effectively down an enemy. I'm going to need more time with that one as well to see how it ends up running when it's fully kitted out, but for right now I'm not feeling it at all.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Assault Rifles this year are, much like last year, where it's at.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Assault Rifles this year are, much like last year, where it's at. While in previous years I ran with SMGs or LMGs, in BLOPS6 I fell madly in love with my XM4 assault rifle. This year I've been grinding on the M15 MOD 0, but I'm a level away from unlocking the Peacekeeper Mk.1 in the beta, which might be the best weapon in multiplayer, hands down. At Call of Duty Next, it felt like everyone was using it, so I’m excited to try it out again from the comfort of my own desk. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've got an entire weekend with the closed beta, and I plan to hit that level cap and unlock as much as it will let me. The open beta next week will let you grind to level 30, and the best part is all your progress will carry over to the final game. I'm hoping CoD keeps to its promises, because the new features sound pretty sick: trading loadouts with friends and even copying them from enemies who killed you, XP carrying across all modes instead of on a per-mode basis, and the ability to re-roll the daily challenges, which I love. Also, the final game promises some of the sweetest gun camos yet, and I'm really excited to spend hours and hours of time I'll never get back just so I can have a gun that's all shiny. Until then, I'm really enjoying BLOPS7, and I’ll be back with a full review around launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seth Macy is Senior Social Commerce Producer, and just wants to be your friend.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You do not love to see it, but it’s been a big week for Saudi Arabia, the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/08/11/saudi-arabia-executions-surge-in-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">human rights abuse factory</a> that in recent years has taken to cosplaying as a cultural hub. Wielding checks that would probably turn the eyes of any normal person into Looney Tunes dollar signs, <a href="https://defector.com/grim-visions-emerge-from-the-riyadh-comedy-festival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Riyadh Comedy Festival</a> has attracted the likes of Dave Chapelle, Louis CK, and even noted Guy Everybody Thought Wasn’t A Shithead Bill Burr. And of course, a consortium including Saudi Arabia <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-ea-sale-is-bad-news-for-everyone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased EA for $55 billion</a>. The one thing all these parties have in common? Deep, unabiding cynicism. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>This time around, we discuss the two latest signs that the video game industry is being chopped up and sold for parts: EA’s $55 billion sale and <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-price-increase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft’s decision to up Game Pass’ price by 50 percent</a> – the latter of which follows <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-game-pass-unsustainable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple rounds of layoffs and studio closures</a> almost certainly intended to help pay for the company’s own $68.7 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard.&nbsp;</p><p>Who benefits from any of this, aside from executives and, now, a government that seeks to sportswash human rights abuses via not just sports themselves, but also some of the biggest video games about those sports? And what, really, is left of these once-unshakable juggernauts even before they <em>really </em>go through the most vicious iteration yet of the profit-ravenous meat grinder?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we discuss <em>Baby Steps</em>, a literal walking simulator about masculinity that Chris absolutely adores. Finally, we invent new candy bars, including, unfortunately, Dubai Twix.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can buy EA for $56 billion, get the old Maxis team back together, and forc– er, politely ask them to make <em>The Sims 5</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Bill Burr is the person that came the closest to having a reasonable throughline, but even he comes off as wildly racist, so it doesn’t matter.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Racist and also incredibly naive in a way that his entire persona does not seem to otherwise betray.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Exactly. It’s like, man, you’re just dumb. If this is true, you’re just a dumb guy.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, but I don’t buy that. I don’t think he’s dumb. I think the check was so big that he was like “Alright, I’m gonna pretend to be someone else for a little bit.”</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>They drove a truck of money to my house. I’m not made of stone.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Here are the quotes [from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/sep/30/riyadh-comedy-festival-saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Guardian article about comedians’ decision to perform in Saudi Arabia</a>]. This shit’s nuts:</p><p>“Some comics were transparent about their willingness to ignore their moral convictions in order to play at the festival. ‘So what, they have slaves?’ asked Tim Dillon in a podcast segment that led to his firing from the festival. ‘They’re paying me enough money to look the other way.’ Pete Davidson offered a similar take, acknowledging in a chat with Von that people have asked him why, given his father’s death on 9/11, he would take a paycheck from the Saudi government. He did not address the criticism directly, but he did suggest he was happy to forget 9/11 for the right price: ‘I just know I get the routing, and then I see the number, and I go, I’ll go.’”</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> It’s not “never forget” anymore. It’s “conditionally forget.”</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Now how many zeroes are we talking about?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> This one knocked my brain out of my head:</p><p>“[Chris] Distefano, chatting with Halkias, joked that an upside to the kingdom’s repression of women is that his fiancee can’t come with him. Mark Normand, on the other hand, joked he would bring his wife to show her how good she has it in America: ‘I want to be like: You see? You think I’m an asshole? Well, they’ll cut your clit off, bitch.’’”</p><p>That’s a thing somebody said! That’s a thing somebody said publicly!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Don’t do that! Don’t use those words.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>I don’t like that.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Absolutely insane. But the Saudi strategy is serving its purpose. I’m not sure it's ever gonna see the light of day because these things are really difficult to source, but I’ve been working with my former Washington Post colleague <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mikhail</a> on a piece about how much streamers and now also commentators were paid to be involved with the Esports World Cup, which is the Saudi government’s annual esports event. The numbers I’ve heard are big but not that big.</p><p>But the telling thing I heard from one of my conversations with a prominent <em>League of Legends</em> commentator is that this year they felt like one of the final holdouts. Last year, a lot of people in that scene took a principled stand and said “I’m not gonna engage with this. I’m not gonna take the money.” And this year there are just so many fewer that did that. Most of them took the money, and it’s been increasingly normalized in esports, as it has in all these other places. Money plus persistence wears people down.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/wayward-netflix-martin"><h3>Wayward Is A Queer Exploration Of The Troubled Teen Industry</h3></a><p>Mae Martin's new Netflix show creates a *very* creepy small town</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/candy-crush-saga-lawsuit-alleged-scam-tournament-king"><h3>Candy Crush Player Sues Activision Blizzard Over Alleged ‘Scam’ Tournament</h3></a><p>He says King tricked players into thinking they have a chance at the grand prize</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-ea-saudi-arabia-riyadh-comedians]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Many people don’t need the latest MacBook Pro with its $4,000 sticker shock but they also can’t do real work on a $300 Chromebook that chokes on anything beyond web browsing. The middle ground does exist, and HP has hit it out of the park with<strong> this 17-inch laptop that offers real productivity features without the premium price</strong>.</p>
<p>The brand appears to be clearing inventory and rather than advertising these savings on their own site, they’re unloading units under the radar on Amazon at historically low prices. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4476/">HP 17″ laptop (Intel Core i3, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, Windows 11 Pro) has been chopped from $2,399 down to $699, a 71 percent discount</a> that puts professional-grade computing in the budget of students and remote workers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4476/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The 17.3-Inch Display Changes Your Workflow</h2>
<p>This is driven by the <strong>Intel Core i3-N305 8-core processor up to 3.2GHz</strong> and Intel UHD Graphics. This configuration handles everyday multitasking, web surfing, document editing and media playback without frustration or lag. The i3-N305 is Intel’s energy-efficient hybrid architecture designed for laptops that balances performance and battery life by dynamically shifting workloads between the performance and efficiency cores based on what you’re doing. You won’t be rendering 4K video or playing AAA games on max settings, but for office work and streaming entertainment, this processor delivers smooth performance.</p>



<p>Screen size matters more than many people realize until they’ve actually worked on a larger display: The <strong>17.3-inch HD+ screen gives you much more workspace than standard 15.6-inch laptops</strong>, reducing the constant window juggling and tab switching that breaks your concentration. The 1600×900 resolution packs approximately 1.4 million pixels and delivers crisp text rendering and sharp graphics for documents and videos. The anti-glare coating reduces reflections from overhead lighting and windows.</p>
<p>The 32GB of RAM changes how you work by eliminating the performance limitations of heavy multitasking. You can have dozens of browser tabs open, several <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/microsoft-365">Microsoft 365 applications</a> open simultaneously, be in video calls as you work on presentations and still have apps running in the background without noticing the slowdowns.</p>
<p>The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD provides fast and spacious storage</strong> with Windows boot times in seconds and instant app opening. PCIe NVMe technology provides read and write speeds up to 15 times faster than traditional mechanical hard drives, which transfer files quickly and make opening large documents instant.</p>
<p>At $699, you’re getting a genuinely capable laptop that performs real work without compromise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After much contemplation, we realize that the scheduled <em>Kingmakers</em> launch on October 8 will no longer be possible. We want to apologize to all of the fans who are eagerly anticipating this game. We are sorry for letting you down.</p><p>Why is <em>Kingmakers</em> being delayed? In short it’s an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game, and we don’t want to cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out the door earlier. Our goal, from the start, has been to create something that’s nothing like anything else on the market, in terms of gameplay, scale, scope, and interactivity.</p><p>With <em>Kingmakers</em>, we set out to push the Unreal Engine 4 codebase to its absolute limits, while still providing true 60 frames per second to midrange PCs, without the need for fake frames. We are an 80 percent engineering team, who got into this business to push technological barriers.</p><p>We currently have tens of thousands of soldiers, each with Al and pathfinding that rivals what you’d expect from a AAA third-person shooter. When you walk away from a battle, it continues to play out. Nothing is faked. We have giant 6 story castles where every room can be entered and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a Lumbermill, it’s a real place that can be entered, or, in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat arena.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>When you drive a car into a tree, you’re ejected through the windshield, the tree breaks from its stump, and then rolls over whatever hapless soldiers are along its path.

We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it.</p><p>So that is what we are doing now. We’re making sure everyone who buys the game is enthralled and feels like their money was well spent. We want this to be the case whether you have a top-of-the line rig or a PC that’s seen better days.</p><p>Thank you so much for all of your love and support. We hope we are doing everything we can to earn it.</p><p>We will be presenting a half-hour-long deep dive on <em>Kingmakers</em> gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we’ve been working on.</p><p>—Redemption Road Games</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/kingmakers-early-access-delayed-to-unannounced-date]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-lina-khan-ftc-microsoft-activision-merger-2000631611</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">unpopular Game Pass price hikes</a> have caught the attention of Lina Khan. The former head of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took to social media on Friday to once again criticize the company’s acquisition of <em>Call of Duty</em> maker Activision Blizzard. “As dominant firms become too-big-to-care, they can make things worse for their customers without having to worry about the consequences,” she wrote just a day after the price of Game Pass Ultimate rose to $30 a month.</p> <p>It was Khan’s FTC during the Biden Administration <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-ftc-deal-court-call-duty-xbox-ps5-1850623628">that sued Microsoft to prevent the $70 billion Activision Blizzard deal</a> from going through. The regulator argued that further market consolidation in gaming would harm consumers, and ended up taking the matter to court. A judge ultimately ruled in favor of Microsoft, but that hasn’t stopped Khan and others from criticizing the outcome in the years since.</p>

 <p>“Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision has been followed by significant price hikes and layoffs, harming both gamers and developers,” she posted on X today alongside a chart showing Game Pass prices doubling since the trial concluded. “As we’ve seen across sectors, increasing market consolidation and increasing prices often go hand-in-hand.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision has been followed by significant price hikes and layoffs, harming both gamers and developers. </p> <p>As we’ve seen across sectors, increasing market consolidation and increasing prices often go hand-in-hand. </p> <p>As dominant firms become… <a href="https://t.co/FoI50tlEsL">https://t.co/FoI50tlEsL</a></p> <p>— Lina Khan (@linamkhan) <a href="https://twitter.com/linamkhan/status/1974192096841265511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>A similar point was made <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-ftc-black-ops-6-appeal-1851599323">when Microsoft raised prices last year</a>. “Microsoft’s price increases and product degradation—combined with Microsoft’s reduced investments in output and product quality via employee layoffs, see FTC’s February 7, 2024, Letter—are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24852374-24-07-18-ftc-letter-re-microsoft-game-pass-price-increases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FTC wrote</a> last July when it was still appealing the merger.”</p>

 <h2>Microsoft promised regulators Game Pass prices wouldn’t go up</h2> <p>Khan isn’t the only one going “I told you so” this week. Shortly after the latest Game Pass price hikes were announced, players started circulating the company’s old quotes back during the Activision merger fight. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority also tried to block the deal over pricing concerns.</p>

 <p>“Game Pass prices will not increase as a result of the Merger, and certainly will not increase to a point that offsets the substantial benefits of Activision titles coming to Game Pass on a day and date basis,” the company <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/microsoft-insists-game-pass-prices-will-not-increase-as-a-result-of-activision-merger/">claimed back in 2023</a>. “This is especially so given Game Pass will continue to be constrained by B2P [buy to play].”</p>

 <p>In the years since, Microsoft appears to have done exactly that, <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483">adding <em>Call of Duty</em> to Game Pass</a> but jacking up the price as well, even though players can still choose to buy the game à la carte for $70 on console and PC.</p> <p>Microsoft might argue that $30 a month is a fair price to pay for subscription-based access to <em>Black Ops 7</em> and hundreds of other games. It’s impossible to know without access to rest of the Xbox math, most of which Microsoft stopped reporting to the public years ago. All we know is that according to Microsoft, Game Pass was profitable and generating $5 billion in revenue a year, even before the latest price hikes.</p>

There are plenty of powerful guns and equipment to try, as we went over in our best BO7 loadouts guide but you'll also want to make sure you have the best perks to suit your playstyle. In this guide, we'll discuss the recommended perks and Wildcards, and we'll also break down how the new Combat Specialties work this year.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Best_perks_for_multiplayer">Best perks for multiplayer</a><ul><li><a href="#Perk_1_slot">Perk 1 slot</a></li><li><a href="#Perk_2_slot">Perk 2 slot</a></li><li><a href="#Perk_3_slot">Perk 3 slot</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Best_Wildcard_picks">Best Wildcard picks</a></li><li><a href="#Combat_Specialties">Combat Specialties</a><ul><li><a href="#Hybrid_Combat_Specialties">Hybrid Combat Specialties</a></li><li><a href="#Core_Specialties">Core Specialties</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_perks_for_multiplayer">Best perks for multiplayer</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_1_slot">Perk 1 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ghost:</strong> Undetectable by enemy Scout Pulse and UAV when moving, planting, defusing, or controlling Scorestreaks. This is in the Recon (blue) perk category.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost is a great perk for staying off the radar if you're a player who wants to go for stealthy plays. This can also be a smart pick if you're planning on making a class to lay low with a sniper rifle.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ninja: </strong>Move more quietly. This is in the Recon (blue) perk category.</p><p dir="ltr">Like Ghost, this perk can be used for stealthy plays. It's also one of the best picks for non-respawn modes like Search and Destroy.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost and Ninja are both in the same perk slot this year, so you <strong>can't equip them both</strong> for a stealth loadout unless you choose the Perk Greed Wildcard, as mentioned below.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cold-Blooded: </strong>Undetectable by AI targeting and thermal optics. Player-controlled scorestreaks don't highlight you. This is in the Recon (blue) perk category.</p><p dir="ltr">It's always good to have at least one loadout equipped and labeled as a Cold-Blooded class. This makes it easy to switch in a pinch, as Black Ops 7 features plenty of lethal scorestreaks that can target you.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Flak Jacket:</strong> Reduces incoming explosive and fire damage. This is a Strategist (green) category perk.</p><p dir="ltr">Flak Jacket is a solid pick if you're an objective player looking to jump on a Hardpoint or Domination flag. It will help protect you from the grenades lobbed your way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579846-bo7_mp_reveal_dawg_01_final_branded.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579846" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579846-bo7_mp_reveal_dawg_01_final_branded.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579846"></a><figcaption>The D.A.W.G. scorestreak</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579846-bo7_mp_reveal_dawg_01_final_branded.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_2_slot">Perk 2 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Looper:</strong> Gain the ability to re-earn Scorestreaks in the same life. This is an Enforcer (red) perk.</p><p dir="ltr">By default, you can't keep earning your streaks in the same life, and you need to die to reset them. Looper allows you to keep earning your streaks over and over. This is a good perk if you're someone who can rack up plenty of points and want to keep earning streaks.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Fast Hands:</strong> Swap weapons faster and extend fuses when throwing back grenades. This is a Strategist (green) category perk.</p><p dir="ltr">Movement and speed remain so important in Black Ops 7's fast-paced multiplayer. Having the faster weapon swap can really save you when your primary runs out of ammo.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_3_slot">Perk 3 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dexterity:</strong> Reduced weapon motion and full ADS on slides, dives, and wall jumps. Take less fall damage. This is an Enforcer (red) perk.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the most popular pick for the third perk slot. Dexterity is what you'll want to equip to make the most of Black Ops 7's omnimovement while engaging in gunfights.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tracker:</strong> See rough locations of nearby enemies on your minimap and see their footsteps in the world. Aiming down sights auto-pings enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">If you don't care as much about the movement aspects, Tracker is a great perk for getting more intel. This perk lets you follow highlighted footsteps and hunt your enemy on the map.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Bankroll:</strong> Start each life with +150 score towards scorestreaks. This is in the Recon (blue) perk category.</p><p dir="ltr">Bankroll is great if you normally struggle to earn streaks or just want to give yourself a boost to earn them faster.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_Wildcard_picks">Best Wildcard picks</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579847-wildcards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579847" data-ratio="0.56328125" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579847-wildcards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579847"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 7 Wildcards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4579847-wildcards.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Treyarch's Wildcard system returns in Black Ops 7. Each loadout can be equipped with one Wildcard to help you further customize and make your loadout feel even more powerful. Here are some recommended options:</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Overkill: </strong>Equip any non-melee weapon in Primary and Secondary slots.</p><p dir="ltr">Overkill lets you run an additional primary weapon. This is great for pairing something slow, like a sniper rifle or marksman rifle, with something faster, like a submachine gun.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the first time in its robust 50-year history, GAMA has announced some major changes. The trade organization known for hosting Origins Game Fair and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gama-expo-will-be-moving-to-baltimore-in-future" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GAMA Expo</a> will be rebranding and announcing a new ten-year plan towards the health of the global tabletop industry.</p>

<h2>The New GAMA Ten-Year Project</h2>

<p>According to an in-depth report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/10/02/gama-unveils-10-year-plan-to-become-epicenter-of-global-tabletop-gaming-industry-renames-itself-after-almost-50-years/" rel="nofollow">Board Game Wire</a>, the new ten-year project for GAMA is for the organization to become the new epicentre of the global tabletop industry. This project encompasses a comprehensive range of plans to enhance GAMA membership globally and diversify its financial support, shifting its focus from solely sponsoring tabletop expos to leading the conversation on industry sustainability.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gama-expo-promo-screenshot.jpg?itok=EfYgj4we 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gama-expo-promo-screenshot.jpg?itok=DAW_X9Pu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition, GAMA's plan will continue their ongoing advocacy within the tabletop space, such as its lawsuits <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gama-joins-second-anti-tariff-lawsuit-against-trump-administration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">against the Trump administration's</a> disruptive trade tariffs and their wholesome promotion of the board game hobby through <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gama-brings-game-store-day-to-flgs-retailers-this-november" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Store Day</a>.</p>

<p>The plan was spearheaded by President Nicole Brady. According to Brady, this shift was to allow the organization to manage important issues better long-term than "playing whack-a-mole" on a case-by-case basis. It was during an online "town hall" meeting that Brady articulated the future of the organization as a global one that treats the industry as more than just a hobby.</p>

<p>This push for formal organization and management is the impetus for the organization's new name. While originally known as the Game Manufacturers Association, the organization will now be known as GAMA: The Tabletop Association. As an official statement from the organization reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The tabletop game industry has grown far beyond where we were in 1977 when we were founded. Our new name honors that evolution while maintaining our legacy of nearly 50 years of serving the tabletop industry.&nbsp;We’re excited to move forward under a banner that celebrates the full spectrum of our industry and the people who shape it."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for immediate plans, GAMA's focus in the next two years will be on an anti-counterfeit initiative, education and certification programs, providing professional resources, and reaching out to media about business-relevant topics.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Unity is urging developers to take “immediate action” after it disclosed a major security vulnerability affecting games built using versions of its popular development tool dating back to 2017. While there is “no evidence of any exploitation of the vulnerability, nor has there been any impact on users or customers,” Unity already has fixes available to developers, <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/unity-platform-protection-take-immediate-action-to-protect-your-games-and-apps/1688031">according to a post from Larry Hryb</a>, aka “Major Nelson.”</p><p>Specifically, developers need to take action if “you have developed and released a game or application using Unity 2017.1 or later for Windows, Android, or macOS,” Hryb says. Unity’s “platform partners” have also “taken further steps to secure their platforms and protect end users.”</p><p>Valve already released <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/507340830949770871">a new version of Steam</a> that adds mitigations for the exploit, and “for Windows, Microsoft Defender has been updated and will detect and block the vulnerability,” Hryb says. Google and Meta have taken steps as well, according to Hyrb. There are “no findings to suggest” that the vulnerability can be exploited on iOS, visionOS, tvOS, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, UWP, Quest, and WebGL.</p><p>Numerous developers have taken actions in response to the disclosure. Obsidian <a href="https://x.com/Obsidian/status/1974215697845923976">removed</a> some of its games and products from digital storefronts, including <em>Grounded 2 Founders Edition</em>, <em>Avowed Premium Edition</em>, <em>Pillars of Eternity: Hero Edition</em>, <em>Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</em>, and <em>Pentiment</em>, until it can “implement the necessary updates to address the issue.” <em><a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1974171006085554309">Marvel Snap</a></em>, <em><a href="https://x.com/wickedgame/status/1974169075405533675">No Rest for the Wicked</a></em>, <em><a href="https://x.com/ingress/status/1974171560891351070">Ingress</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://x.com/FateGO_USA/status/1974229267316605253">Fate/Grand Order</a></em> have all received updates as well.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-tips-guides-side-quests-2000631593</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-things-to-know-before-starting-digimon-story-time-stranger.1316152/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In most ways, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341"><i><span>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</span></i></a> <span>isn’t a complicated RPG. The turn-based monster tamer’s battles are mostly straightforward, and it’s got waypoints telling you where to go for most missions. However, after spending 40 hours in the game, I do have a few quick tips for those of you heading to the Digital World now that the game is out. Grab your Digivice and let’s go.</span></p> <h2><b>You will lose access to side quests for dozens of hours</b></h2> <p><span>Easily the most frustrating thing I encountered in my first playthrough of </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>was the way it gates side quests. Without getting into spoilers, there’s a point when the game will warn you that some of the side quests you’ve been doing will be inaccessible for an undetermined amount of time. Years of playing video games had me expecting this meant I wouldn’t be able to complete those quests until I finished the story mission I was about to embark on. As it turns out, it would be dozens of hours before I could go back to those quests. This would normally have been fine, but side quests have a lot more to offer in </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>than just a side story and some loot. Throughout the game, you’ll get Anomaly Points that raise your Agent rank. Digivolution levels are gated behind leveling up this rank, and if you can’t complete more quests, you might be stuck at a lower rank and unable to level up your party until much, </span><i><span>much </span></i><span>later in the game. So heed this warning when you hit it, because it really fails to adequately warn you just how long it will be before you can go back to those missions.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Using items doesn’t cost you a turn</b></h2> <p><span>One of the merciful things </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>does is that it allows you to use an item </span><i><span>and </span></i><span>attack each turn, rather than choosing between them. This means you’ll be able to heal up your team, raise stats, or remove a status effect without having to give up doing some damage as well. A lot of other turn-based RPGs tend to make you choose between these options as a strategic challenge, but you’ll be glad </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span> doesn’t when you endure one of its long, drawn-out boss fights.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Upgrading your Agent rank helps circumvent grind</b></h2> <p><span>Those Anomaly points you get for completing quests are used to upgrade your Agent rank, which enables you to unlock Agent skills on a skill tree. Some of these perks are universal, such as giving you access to new high-impact Cross Arts abilities that can benefit your whole team. However, some of them are applied only to certain Digimon with different personality types. If you go down one skill tree, you’ll be able to raise stats and experience for the friendly Digimon in your team, while another path will grant you those perks for brave Digimon. So don’t just go down these skill trees without some plan in place, as they can help you reach powerful new heights if you target specific traits and personality types. It’s much simpler than grinding random battles.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Don’t get precious about saving your Cross Art</b></h2> <p><span>Cross Arts abilities can have a wide variety of uses in battles. They can heal your team, raise their stats, or they can take a chunk of your enemy’s health bar down and leave them with debuffs for a few turns. Since they can be so impactful, you might feel like you need to hold your Cross Art for a big boss fight, but this ability charges up fast when you do pretty much anything in battle. Attacking an enemy or using an item can give you points toward your Cross Arts gauge, so it’s pretty easy to fire off multiple uses of this in a longer fight. Feel free to use it often, and keep in mind that the more actions you can do in a turn, the more charge you’ll get toward using it again.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Try to have a rideable Digimon on your team at all times</b></h2> <p><span>Some Digimon can double as both a party member and a rideable mount. I rode my Growlmon for much of the game, but when he digivolved to WarGrowlmon, he couldn’t carry me on his shoulders anymore. Thankfully, WereGarurumon stepped up and put me on his shoulder, and later, when he became MetalGarurumon, I was able to ride on his back. Riding your Digimon gets you places faster than walking on foot, but as they transform into new, stronger versions of themselves, they might lose the ability to carry you around. Just be mindful of this as you move throughout the evolution tree.</span></p>

As with any flagship sale at Amazon, great deals start going live days ahead of the actual event, and we're already finding a few worthwhile offers popping up at the online retailer. That includes over $100 off the Amazon Fire Max 11 productivity bundle, which not only comes with a no-ads version of the tablet itself, but also a keyboard case and a stylus (which you probably would've ended up buying separately, anyway).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Jumping out of the Netflix animated movie and into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, the KPop Demon Hunters have arrived for some Demon Rush, a new Halloween month riff on Horde Rush.</p>
<p><iframe title="KPop Demon Hunters Takes Over Fortnite" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ipctlvNePk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>KPop Demon Hunters has been a huge hit on Netflix, an animated movie from the studio behind Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse that sees a trio of demon hunting KPop stars face off against demons that are now starting to fight them at their own game. It features the performances of Jeongyeon, Jihyo and Chaeyoung of Twice for the musical numbers, with the film’s soundtrack having plenty of success in its own right.</p>
<p>Anyway,&nbsp;Demon Rush is a limited time event, a revamped version of Horde Rush that sees Rumi, Mira, and Zoey fight endless waves of demons, and with KPop Demon Hunters inspired perks to use. The mode is available from 2nd October through 1st November.</p>
<p>Of course, this spills over to the Battle Royale and Blitz modes, with Rumi, Mira and Zoey outfits, accessories and emotes in the Fortnite Shop, and new new items available by completing quests including Rumi’s Sword and Mira’s X-tra Spicy Ramyeon.</p>

<p>And the tie in also extends to both Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) and Fortnite Creative, using the assets for this movie tie in for their own creations.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Viral Medieval Shooter With Giant Armies Gets Indefinitely Delayed Just Days Before Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/kingmakers-delay-medieval-shooter-steam-early-access-date-2000631559</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/viral-medieval-shooter-with-giant-armies-gets-indefinitely-delayed-just-days-before-launch.1316125/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Kingmakers</em> was due out in Early Access in just a few days but it’s apparently not ready yet. The medieval sandbox shooter has been indefinitely delayed as the team at Redemption Road works on getting everything working as intended. “We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it,” the studio wrote in an announcement on Friday.</p> <p>Odds are you’ve seen a <a href="https://kotaku.com/this-time-hopping-action-game-brings-a-grenade-launcher-1851274937">bit of <em>Kingmakers</em> here or there</a> over the years, even if you didn’t know it. The multiplayer game features sprawling maps and giant armies and is supposed to facilitate real-time destruction as you engage in everything from medieval combat to blowing up a bunch of armor-clad knights with tanks. The game’s impressive physics simulation helped it go viral on social media, land a big trailer at Summer Game Fest this year, and become the sixth most-wishlisted game on Steam. So it’s surprising to see it pulled from launch at the last minute.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/HhiDBLQrOS">pic.twitter.com/HhiDBLQrOS</a></p> <p>— Ian Fisch – Lead Coder on Kingmakers (wishlist!) (@Ian_Fisch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ian_Fisch/status/1974143748419563537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“After much contemplation, we realize that the scheduled<em> Kingmakers</em> launch on October 8 will no longer be possible,” the team <a href="https://x.com/Ian_Fisch/status/1974143748419563537">announced today</a>. “We want to apologize to all of the fans who are eagerly anticipating this game. We are sorry for letting you down.”</p>

 <p>The rest of the message goes on to try to explain why the game is being indefinitely delayed. TL;DR:<em> Kingmakers</em> is ambitions and delivering on that is hard!</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">GTA6, but you're dropped in the 1400s.<br>No cops. Just the angry knights you ran over 🚗 <a href="https://t.co/tLmQjUgmM3">pic.twitter.com/tLmQjUgmM3</a></p> <p>— Kingmakers ⚔️ (@Kingmakers_Game) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1929956825589584144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“We currently have tens of thousands of soldiers, each with AI and pathfinding that rivals what you’d expect from an AAA third-person shooter,” Redemption Road states. “When you walk away from a battle, it continues to play out. Nothing is faked. We have giant 6-story castles where every room can be entered and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a lumbermill, it’s a real place that can be entered, or, in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat arena.”</p> <p>The studio doesn’t really go into much more detail than that but promises that a deep-dive overview will be livestreamed soon to update players on where things are at. That makes it sound like the delay won’t just be a couple of weeks or months. Will it still be out before the end of 2026? We’ll see. “We’re making sure everyone who buys the game is enthralled and feels like their money was well spent,” the developers wrote.</p>

If Zombies doesn't show up when you boot up the beta, Activision recommends restarting the client.</p><p>The Black Ops 7 beta also added new multiplayer content today, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-all-maps/2900-7062/" data-ref-id="2900-7062">the map Imprint</a>.

In it, Kratos climbs Mount Olympus as he seeks to reach its zenith and bring his full might down upon the gods who wronged him.

But as the duo fight through a harsh and unforgiving land, Kratos is forced to face the truth that there remain parts of his nature he can't surpress if he wishes to protect those he loves most.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">God of War Ragnarok (2022)</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zj7b2P?object_uuid=14ce168e-1a3e-4a3f-998f-c8436592da6f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See on Amazon</a> (PS5) </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Picking up about three years after God of War (2018), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">God of War Ragnarok</a> sees Kratos and Atreus forced to take on the Norse pantheon in an attempt to stop the complete destruction of the nine realms.
