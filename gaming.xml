              <p>Dyson comes out with a new vacuum model almost every year, and the V11 is a big step up in the brand’s cordless line with 185 air watts of suction that makes a real difference on both carpets and hard floors.</p>
<p>On Cyber Monday weekend, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">the price dropped from $629 to $399 which is a new all-time low</a> for a model that still competes with Dyson’s newest models. That discount is important because you’re getting tech that was top-of-the-line just a few years ago, but now it’s priced more like mid-range competitors that can’t match its suction power, autonomy or build quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three Power Modes</h2>
<p>You can switch between three different power settings on the V11 using a button on the handle and it lets you control how much battery life you give up for cleaning power.<em> Auto mode</em> uses sensors in the cleaner head to figure out what kind of floor it is and changes the suction automatically. It increases suction on carpets and decreases it on hard floors to save battery life while still cleaning well. <strong>Eco mode extends runtime by up to 60 minutes</strong> by lowering suction to its lowest effective level. This is great for quick daily cleaning of hard surfaces that don’t need maximum power. When you turn on <em>boost mode</em>, it gives you the full 185 air watts for a few minutes of deep cleaning.</p>



<p>The <strong>LCD screen on top of the vacuum shows you what power mode you’re in</strong>, how much time is left until it runs out, and maintenance alerts when the filters need to be cleaned or there are blockages. This real-time feedback takes away the guesswork that comes with other cordless vacuums. You won’t have to wonder if you have enough power to finish the room or if the loss of suction means a clog or just a full bin.</p>
<p>The Motorbar cleaner head has a <strong>brush bar that spins and has technology that keeps long hair and pet fur from getting stuck</strong> in the bristles: This means you don’t have to spend as much time cutting up tangles off the roller with scissors. The brush bar works on all kinds of floors without needing to be adjusted by hand and it moves smoothly from area rugs to tile to hardwood while still cleaning well.</p>



<p>It only takes a <strong>few seconds to switch the vacuum to handheld mode</strong> by removing the wand and connecting tools directly to the motor body. This makes it a powerful tool for cleaning furniture, stairs, and car interiors. The mini soft dusting brush can clean delicate surfaces and electronics without scratching them, and the crevice tool can get into baseboards and tight corners that regular vacuum heads can’t reach.</p>
<p>Advanced <strong>HEPA filtration catches 99.99% of particles as small as 0.3 microns</strong> which includes common allergens like dust mites, pollen, and pet dander that can make people allergic. The sealed filtration system makes sure that the air that comes out of the vacuum cleaner is cleaner than the air that goes in and it is a big help for people with asthma or allergies.</p>
<p>Dyson offers a<strong> two-year warranty on the V11</strong> and <strong>lifetime support through their app</strong> which has maintenance guides and troubleshooting help when problems come up. The vacuum is only 6.6 pounds when fully assembled, which makes it light enough to carry up the stairs without any trouble but heavy enough to handle daily use. The docking station that hangs on the wall charges the battery and keeps the vacuum and tools in one neat place so you don’t have to search through closets to find them.</p>
<p>Taking $230 off the price of a Dyson vacuum is a great deal, especially for a model that still works as well as vacuums that cost a lot more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Star Wars Outlaws (Gold Edition) for Nintendo Switch 2 at 50% Off Could Sell Out Before Cyber Monday Even Arrives]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-gold-edition-for-nintendo-switch-2-already-half-price-for-black-friday-2000648499</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Game prices have been a hot topic of conversation surrounding the Nintendo Switch 2. <em>Mario Kart World</em>, the first launch title for the console, comes with an outlandish $80 price tag. Nintendo’s favorite ape has taken centerstage once more in <em>Donkey Kong: Bananza</em>, priced at $70. Third party titles seem to be sticking with the standard $60 for the time being. Those also tend to actually go on sale unlike first party Nintendo titles (which do, but far less frequently and with far less substantial discounts). <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6083/">So right now during Black Friday weekend, it’s pretty expected to find these Nintendo games are still full price while an awesome title like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>has come down by 50%.</a></p>
<p>Previously unavailable on Nintendo consoles, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> first arrived in 2024 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. With the launch of the Switch 2, Nintendo is now able to supports a lot more graphically-demanding third party titles. We’ve seen Nintendo Switch 2 releases for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, and now <em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>too.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6083/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>came to the Nintendo Switch 2 back in the beginning of September, selling at a full retail price of $60. Now, just a couple short months later, it’s down to just $30—for a limited time at least. Through Black Friday, you come discover this galaxy of opportunities and experience Star Wars from the scoundrel’s perspective for just $30.</p>
<h2>Gold Edition: Base Game &amp; More</h2>
<p>This is the Gold Edition of the game. That means comes with the Star Wars Outlaws season pass including, not one, but two story DLCs. The pack includes the base game along with the Wild Card story pack, A Pirate’s Fortune story pack, Jabba’s Gambit exclusive Day 1 mission, The Kessel Runner character pack, The Hunter’s Legacy bundle, and The Cartel Ronin bundle.</p>



<p>In <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, you live the high-stake life of an outlaw in Star Wars’ first-ever open world action-adventure. Play as scoundrel Kay Vess and you seek freedom and a new life for yourself. Overcome enemies through stealth, gadgets, and your trusty blaster. Pilot a ship—the Trailblazer—as you embark in thrilling dogfights with the Empire and other foes you’ll make along the way.</p>
<p>Cities are bustling with interesting characters and cantinas to explore. In each location, you’ll find new challenges with exciting rewards waiting for the taking.&nbsp;Every choice you make effects your in-game reputation, which can have consequences for your story and your character down the line.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6083/"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> for the Nintendo Switch 2 supports all modes of play—TV mode, tabletop mode, and handheld mode.</a> This version of the game clocks in at about 20GB which is about a third the size it is one other consoles. It runs in 720p in handheld mode and 1440p when docked at 60fps.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Seagate Goes Zero-Profit on 2TB External Hard Drive, 500,000 Photo Storage at New Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-goes-zero-profit-on-2tb-external-hard-drive-500000-photo-storage-at-new-record-low-2000648741</link>
            <guid>1368145</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cloud storage sounds great until you realize you’ll have to pay monthly fees forever and hope your internet connection stays strong when you need to get to something important. External hard drives solve both problems by letting you physically control your files without having to pay for them over and over again. Plus,<strong> with 2TB of space, you can store about 500,000 photos or hundreds of hours of video</strong> before you even think about running out of space.</p>
<p>Because it works right away with almost any device you own and only needs a USB cable to start transferring files, Seagate’s portable drive has become one of Amazon’s most popular storage options. This Black Friday weekend, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3788/">the price of the 2TB model dropped from $79 to $64, which is the lowest it’s ever been</a> for a drive that is always one of the best-selling in its category.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3788/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Storage That Works Everywhere</h2>
<p>The drive connects through USB 3.0 which in <strong>real-world tests speeds up transfers to 120MB per second</strong>&nbsp;which means that moving a full movie file takes less than a minute instead of the slow speed you’d have to deal with with older USB 2.0 connections.</p>
<p>You can also plug it<strong> right into Windows PCs, Macs, PlayStation consoles, or Xbox systems</strong> without having to install drivers or reformat it in most cases because is because Seagate ships the drive with broad compatibility already set up. People who use Macs may need to reformat their drives for Time Machine backups, but this only takes a few clicks, and once you set it up, the drive does backups automatically without any problems.</p>



<p>The <strong>metal case protects the device well from small drops and bumps</strong>&nbsp;but if you’re putting it in a backpack with other gear, you should get a padded case. Seagate offers a <strong>one-year rescue service</strong> that includes data recovery in case the drive fails which gives you peace of mind because professional recovery services usually cost hundreds of dollars and can’t always guarantee results.</p>
<p>The<strong> USB connection provides power directly so you don’t need a separate power adapter</strong> that could get lost in a drawer or make your desk look messy. You can use this drive anywhere there is a USB port like in coffee shops or airport lounges, without having to look for an outlet. The drive spins at 5400 RPM which is a good balance between speed and reliability and it also uses very little power so it can be used with laptops without draining the battery.</p>



<p>This drive can be used as <strong>extra storage for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X systems</strong> that fill up their internal storage faster than you can delete old games. You can store PS4 and Xbox One games on the drive and play them right away without having to copy them back to the console’s internal storage. However, you have to transfer PS5 and Series X games back to the console’s SSD before you can play them.</p>
<p>For $64, you can get 2TB of reliable storage that is $20 to $50 less than most other drives. Plus, you get Seagate’s reputation for durability and a rescue service, so you don’t have to worry about buying an unknown brand. The price works out to about 3 cents per gigabyte, which is better than cloud storage subscriptions after just a few months of use.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[LEGO Goes Zero-Margin Beyond Its Star Wars Line, Jurassic World Dinosaur Falls to Year-End Clearance Pricing After Black Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/black-friday-drops-legos-jurassic-world-dinosaur-fossils-t-rex-skull-by-38-2000648149</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Have little ones who can’t get enough of dinosaurs? Surprising them with a buildable T. rex skull is going to light them up instantly, and today is a great time to pick one up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6082/">LEGO’s Jurassic World Dinosaur Fossils: T Rex Skull building set, which gets you a posable T. rex skull, plus a fossilized footprint with a plaque, is currently sitting at just $25 on Amazon.</a> That’s after a 38% discount on its retail price of $40, and the price is the lowest we have seen in quite some time. It’s a Cyber Monday deal, and the holiday rush is going to set in quickly. We recommend grabbing it fast, as the offer (or the stock) is likely going to end soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6082/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Display Worthy</h2>
<p>This fun set is made for ages 9 and up, and gets you a total of 577 pieces. It’s not going to be one of those massive projects that require week-long dedication, and won’t be a super quick job either. Think of it as a fun little weekend activity that your kids can begin on a Saturday and be done with by Sunday.</p>
<p>Attention to detail is truly impressive. You’ll be building a fairly realistic dino toy; a T. rex skull with dinosaur bones that sits on a display stand. You can choose to keep the jaws open for a scary look or close them when letting the beast rest. The skull is paired with the fossilized footprint, plus a plaque that displays some cool facts about the Tyrannosaurus. Kids can learn about the height of the giant, its weight, dietary preferences, and more as they build. There’s a hidden amber piece added somewhere in there to add a little mystery for the curious minds, too. Finish off by adding some LEGO plants around for a foresty feel.</p>



<p>Once made, the set measures over 8 in. (21 cm) high. Place it on a shelf in the living room, or in the kids’ play area; it’s going to look stunning everywhere. You can display the skull, amber, and footprint in different ways. It’s going to look great on its own, and even pair it with other Jurassic World kits for a fuller setup.</p>
<p>Like all LEGO sets, this too comes with a detailed instruction manual. The guidebook takes you through each step, and is pretty easy to follow. But for additional assistance, you can install the LEGO Builder app, as well. The platform offers 3D instructions, plus lets you zoom in on the blocks from each angle to get a better understanding. Kids can save all their sets, track progress, and even build with friends!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6082/">This deal lets you grab it for just $25, which is basically nothing for the experience the set offers</a>. Now is a great time to bring one, or even two of these home for the little dino lovers in your life without blowing your budget. That said, there’s plenty more going at a discount right now. Black Friday is over, but you can still pick everything from kitchen essentials to high-ticket items like TVs, smart home devices, tech gadgets, and more without paying the full price. Just note that most discounts are short-lived. If you see something you like, don’t wait too long to grab it.</p>

		<p>It’s felt like a pretty subdued week, with the US focussing on its holiday, and Black Friday sales not being terribly interesting or exciting this time around, to my mind at least. Some good indie game sales, but when the price for a game is only coming down to £35+, it’s harder to get worked up about that. But did you manage to grab any bargains?</p>
<p>Outside of that, I guess we have to give in and accept that it’s Christmas. You could be strict and hold out until Monday, but I’ll be putting up a tree and decorations this weekend.</p>

              <p>If you want to modernize your home without getting rid of all your old appliances, traditional stores can be very frustrating. A <strong>smart plug is great because it turns any regular appliance into a connected device</strong> without you having to buy expensive smart versions of everything: You don’t need to spend $200 on a smart lamp when you can use a simple plug to make your $30 lamp respond to voice commands and set routines. But the good news is that during Black Friday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5877/">Amazon’s smart plug goes down to $12 for Black Friday, which is less than its usual price of $24</a>. This looks like a move by Amazon to<strong> get more homes connected to Alexa</strong> without making any money.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5877/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Voice Control at a Reasonable Price</h2>
<p>The Amazon smart plug controls the flow of electricity to whatever you plug into it: This means that <strong>any device that has a physical on/off switch can be controlled by Alexa</strong>: Your coffee maker can start brewing before you get out of bed, your lamp in the living room can turn on when you say <em>“Alexa, good morning,”</em> and the box fan in your bedroom can turn off by itself when you fall asleep. The<strong> plug connects directly to your Wi-Fi network</strong> so you don’t need to buy a separate smart home hub and it only takes a few minutes to set up through the Alexa app. Once it’s connected, the plug will automatically reconnect after a power outage or Wi-Fi problem.</p>



<p>The small size of 2.2 inches deep by 3.2 inches wide by 1.5 inches high k<strong>eeps your second outlet free</strong> for another plug or device. This is more important than you might think because a lot of smart plugs are too big to fit in both outlets so you have to choose which device to use. The plug works with any household item that runs on 120 volts, from table lamps and fans to coffee makers and holiday lights. You can also<strong> use the Alexa app to set up routines</strong> that link together different tasks: For example, when you say <em>“Alexa, I’m home,”</em> your entryway lights will turn on and your coffee maker will start.</p>
<p>You can control devices from anywhere in your home <strong>without getting up because the plug works with Alexa’s voice control system</strong>, and you can also control <strong>everything from the Alexa app when you’re not home</strong>. This lets you turn off devices you forgot about or make it look like someone is home while you’re away. You can set your lights to turn on at sunset or your fan to turn off after two hours without having to remember.</p>
<p>For $12, this is a great deal for making your current devices smart instead of buying expensive new ones that are already connected. A smart lamp usually costs $50 to $100 more than a regular lamp: With this plug, you can add the same features to any lamp you already own for a lot less money. Black Friday is the best time to buy them if you want to automate several outlets in your home without spending hundreds of dollars on separate smart devices.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-popular-bose-quietcomfort-noise-cancelling-headphones-are-back-to-its-lowest-price-ever-for-black-friday-2000648466</link>
            <guid>1368127</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="146" data-end="748">The holiday season is in full swing, with city streets glowing under festive winter lights and all of us eagerly searching for the perfect gifts for friends, family, and loved ones. Black Friday weekend has officially arrived, too, bringing some of the year’s most attractive deals on popular tech products. One standout offer on Amazon features a major discount on a top-rated pair of Bose headphones. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6081/">For a limited time, the Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones are available at an impressive 43% off</a>. The price has dropped from the usual $349 to just $199, giving you a substantial $150 in savings.</p>
<p data-start="750" data-end="1214">People who spend lots of time on public transportation or endure frequent flights can really benefit tremendously from a solid pair of noise-canceling headphones. The Bose QuietComfort headphones can help you create a calm, focused soundscape by removing unwanted background noises. Enjoy you music, podcasts, audiobooks, or any other audio without being interrupted by the bustle of everyday life.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6081/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="750" data-end="1214">How Does Noise Cancellation Work?</h2>
<p data-start="1216" data-end="1714">The underlying technology of noise cancellation is pretty ingenious. Built-in microphones positioned on the outside of the headphones listen to the sounds around you. The headphones then generate soundwaves that mirror incoming noise but invert those waves. When the original noise and the inverted signal meet, they effectively cancel each other out. This process reduces these distracting background noises significantly, leaving only the audio coming from your connected device.</p>
<p data-start="1716" data-end="2199">The Bose QuietComfort headphones offer two distinct listening modes: Quiet and Aware. Quiet mode engages full noise cancellation, ideal for situations where total focus is desired. Aware mode, on the other hand, allows outside sounds to flow through naturally. This option is good for when staying alert to one’s surroundings is important, like working in an office and someone might need to get your attention or when navigating busy areas where hearing traffic and other activity is key for your own safety.</p>


<p data-start="1716" data-end="2199">The plush padding of the over-ear cushions and headband are designed for all-day comfort—and you might even be finding yourself wearing them all day with the exceptional battery life.</p>
<p data-start="1716" data-end="2199">The headphones can provide a full 24 hours of listening time on a single charge. This will keep you able to listen to your favorite turns through your whole commute, entire work day, and commute home. If you every find yourself having forgotten to charge the headphones, no sweat. Plugging in the Bose QuietComfort headphones for just 15 minutes will grant you up to two and a half additional hours of playtime. The headphones charge over USB-C.</p>
<p data-start="2201" data-end="2672">The QuietComfort headphones come in a wide assortment of colors, so you can choose a style that suits your preference. Options include cypress green, chilled lilac, petal pink, twilight blue, sandstone, moonlight gray, white smoke, and a classic black. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6081/">All of these colors are priced at the discounted $199 level for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Linus Tech Tips Thinks the Steam Machine Price Will be Around $700]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-machine-price-analysis/</link>
            <guid>1368124</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new video posted to their YouTube channel, Linus Tech Tips has broken down the cost of the hardware that will be added to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-machine-everything-to-know-about-valves-new-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a> to get a sense of how much the console be priced. Spoiler alert… It’s likely to be much more than people thought online.</p>



<p>According to Linus Tech Tips, the parts at their historical low price will cost around $602, but that number has increased significantly in recent months by a whopping 50%, bringing the price to around $900.</p>



<p>As Linus Tech Tips rightfully pointed out, though, these prices are for name brands, and they think the cost can be reduced to around $813 at retail. However, Valve does have a direct-to-consumer model, meaning that it doesn’t need the traditional retailer margins of around 10%.</p>



<p>The question is then, how much profit does Valve want per console? Traditionally, console manufacturers have subsidised or even taken a loss on their consoles, while subscription models and software are their profit centres. </p>



<h2 id="h-steam-machine-will-cost-700">Steam Machine Will Cost $700?</h2>



<p>The conclusions led Linus Tech Tips to believe that the Steam Machine will cost approximately $699, if the hardware prices remain at the prices they do today. Linus Tech Tips then went on to say $800 at most if the hardware market continues to climb at the unprecedented rate it has been going. That could be a hard sell when the <a href="https://amzn.to/48iMmlb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation 5 is only $399</a> at the moment.</p>



<p>And remember… This is for a model with a 500GB SSD… Not 1TB / 2TB.</p>



<p>You can watch Linus Tech Tips’ full analysis and breakdown below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Personally, though, I think that the Steam Machine might be a little pricier. I would think that $799-849 would be the 512GB version, with a 2TB costing $999. But then and again, maybe I am just a little loopy when it comes to pricing. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[The 10 Best Metroid Games]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-metroid-games</link>
            <guid>1368121</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Since 1986 the Metroid series has gone from 2D to 3D (and back to 2D) and to consoles and portables, with plenty of Samus appearances and cameos in other games along the way. It’s responsible for co-creating the Metroidvania genre, leading to games like Hollow Knight and Ori and the Blind Forest and dozens more. And hey, it's even dabbled in pinball and soccer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on the way, it’s the perfect time to look back on this incredible series. Here are what we consider the top 10 Metroid games, judged by the all-important factors of level and map design, progression, innovation, and lasting legacy. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Metroid 2: Return of Samus</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/metroid-2-1763025727531.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">These days, one of the most basic functions expected of a Metroidvania game is map screen that slowly reveals itself as you explore its maze-like network of corridors and hidden rooms. But back in 1991, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-ii-return-of-samus">Metroid 2: Return of Samus</a> arrived on the Nintendo Game Boy, that wasn’t exactly standard practice yet. That makes Metroid 2 feel a bit on the obtuse side, especially since its main focus is sending Samus to SR388 on a planet-wide quest to hunt down every last Metroid left with no real way to track their locations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if you persevered and played along with your own hand drawn map (or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Metroid/comments/oopo2z/metroid_2_return_of_samus_guide_from_nintendo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one tucked inside an issue of Nintendo Power</a>) you were rewarded with a pocket-sized Metroid game complete with all of Samus’ signature moves and weapons from the NES game, even if the benefits of portability also meant playing on a fuzzy little puke-green Game Boy screen. Still, from its big character sprites, tense chiptune music, and lonely, claustrophobic setting, there’s something really special about Metroid 2. And for people wishing Metroid 2 had a few more modern features, 2017’s excellent 3DS remake from MercurySteam totally delivers on that front, but hey, we’ll talk about that one more in a bit.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Metroid</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/metroid-1763025831686.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Inspired by the 1979 sci-fi film Alien as well as previous Nintendo hits like Super Mario Bros and The Legend of Zelda, the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid">Metroid</a> game was unlike anything else at the time. Sure there had been tons of space shooters and platforming games released by the time Metroid arrived in 1986, but none of them had ever brought so many elements of those genres together in the same place, complete with a huge map with horizontally and vertically scrolling screens. What made Metroid especially unique at the time was the way its protagonist Samus controlled and explored through unique power-ups, like the ability to turn into a ball and explore hidden tunnels, or the “screw attack” jump that allowed you to rapidly flip up walls and corridors, tearing through ugly space monsters along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also established grotesque creature villains like Kraid, Ridley, and Mother Brain, all of whom continued to show up in Metroid games for decades to come. And it concluded with one of the most clever NES game ending sequences ever: a frantic escape from a ticking time bomb after defeating the game’s main boss. And perhaps one of the coolest surprises was its multiple endings, several of which revealed that bounty hunter Samus Aran was a woman the entire time, a concept that was pretty uncommon for video games in the mid ‘80s. So much of what makes modern Metroid games so incredible can be traced back to the revolutionary original NES game, and the same can be said for the entire Metroidvania genre as a whole.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Metroid: Samus Returns</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/samus-returns-1763025916151.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-samus-returns">Metroid: Samus Returns</a> took all of the promise of the original Game Boy game Metroid: Return of Samus and completely rebuilt it from the ground up and presented it in full color, glasses-free 3D, complete with totally overhauled graphics, newly remade music, and a much improved combat system that gave Samus an uppercut style melee attack to knock back enemies between bursts of arm cannon blasts and morph ball bombs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s still ultimately a remake of a fairly one-note Metroid game, but finally having a map (viewable at all times thanks to the 3DS’ second screen,) snappy, fluid player movement, and offensive options against adversaries makes Samus Returns feel distinctly like its own thing. After Team Ninja’s wobbly and unsatisfying Metroid: Other M in 2010, fans were justified in worrying that another outside developer handling the Metroid franchise wouldn’t exactly lead to the best results, but MercurySteam proved it had what it takes to make a very good Metroid game. And, eventually, it would even make a great one. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/metroid-prime-2-1763026042183.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While nowhere near as revolutionary as its predecessor, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-2-echoes">Metroid Prime 2</a> is a rock solid sequel that introduces a really cool light and dark parallel dimension mechanic; a classic Nintendo gameplay trope established in The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past’s light and dark worlds that allows you to explore alternate versions of the same levels to hunt for power-ups and suit upgrades that help you better survive in each one. With that concept Prime 2 also introduced Dark Samus, a character that sounds exactly like what you’d expect: a dark, evil version of Samus, which unsurprisingly turned out to be really cool. So cool, in fact, that Dark Samus went on to become an assist trophy and eventually a fully playable character in the Smash Bros. games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime 2 also introduced a pretty barebones Metroid multiplayer mode that felt like a response to the success of games like Halo at the time, and while four different colored versions of Samus strafing in circles while they shoot at each other might not seem like the most interesting thing to do in a Metroid game, it was somehow entertaining enough to work in short bursts between trying to one hundred percent the main campaign.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Metroid Fusion</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/metroid-fusion-1763026186885.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After an eight year hiatus from Metroid games (the series skipped over the entire Nintendo 64 generation, after all) the year 2002 brought us two new entries in the series across the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance, the latter of which was a classic 2D sidescrolling Metroid game with gorgeous pixel art and an endlessly replayable campaign. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-fusion">Metroid Fusion</a> built on all of the excellent gameplay established in the SNES classic Super Metroid, and although it didn’t quite hit the same highs, it’s still a very awesome game on its own, held back only by its slightly more linear exploration and overly talky commanding officer character, Adam Malkovich. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Metroid Fusion immediately stood on its own as a tight, briskly paced Metroid game that instantly became a huge hit with the speedrunning community thanks largely to its multiple ending unlocks that appear depending on completion time and percentage finished. Samus came back in a big way in 2002 and reminded people that Metroid was here to stay as one of the best video game franchises ever created.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/metroid-prime-3-1763026349284.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">By 2007, the Metroid series had gone 2D, 3D, had touch screen controls, and had become a rumble pack-infused pinball game, so obviously the natural next step was a Nintendo Wii motion and pointer controlled game, as was tradition at the time. Luckily, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-3-corruption">Metroid Prime 3</a> largely avoided many of the frustrations and pratfalls that several other franchise sequels stumbled on during the awkward "waggle era" of gaming that we’ve largely moved on from as a species. And while some of the motion control implementation in Prime 3 felt a little finicky at times, pointing a Wii remote at the screen to blast away at enemies was immensely satisfying. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Better than that, though, Prime 3 also capped off the excellent Prime trilogy with a more beautiful and breathtaking world that added more verticality and cool new traversal methods, along with “hyper mode” which gave Samus the option to go full on attack frenzy at the expense of her health. Metroid Prime 3 was a fantastic send off for the Prime franchise at the time when none of us had any idea it wouldn’t get a sequel for eighteen years. Unless, of course, you count the 3DS game Metroid Prime: Federation Force... which we definitely won’t, even if it did tease Metroid Prime 4 in its secret ending. True story.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Metroid: Zero Mission</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/metroid-zero-mission-1763026399657.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The second Metroid game on the Game Boy Advance is also a remake of the first Metroid game ever released, with a stunning new 16-bit pixel art overhaul, taking notes from Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion to improve the original NES game in just about every conceivable way. Every boss fight feels bigger and better, the improved soundtrack rocks, and hey, there’s even an actual map now! And if you ever get nostalgic for the original, it’s unlockable here, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, multiple difficulty options made their way to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-zero-mission">Zero Mission</a>, along with new cutscenes, a time attack mode, and a gallery of images that you can uncover by performing specific criteria. While the original NES game was revolutionary at the time and still has its charm today, Zero Mission is truly the best way to experience the game that started it all for the Metroid series. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Metroid Dread</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/metroid-dread-1763026521682.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While the remake Samus Returns for the 3DS was MercurySteam’s first effort at a Metroid game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-dread">Metroid Dread</a> was a totally original adventure that added a whole new twist, creating one of the most tense and exhilarating Metroid experiences to date. Being constantly hunted by E.M.M.I, the fast, hulking, and intelligent killer robots ready to end Samus’ mission in seconds, meant that the typical explore-at-your-own-pace gameplay of the traditional Metroid mission was frequently replaced with tense and dangerous urgency.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MercurySteam also took the melee combat and parrying system from Samus Returns and improved it, making close quarters fights feel better than ever, which, with the snappier controls and increased player speed, allows Metroid Dread to go pound-for-pound with the best modern Metroidvanias. Dread is also the toughest game in the series since the original NES Metroid, but manages to never feel cheap or padded thanks to its brilliant map design and liberal checkpoint system. In an ideal world, MercurySteam is giving us a new 2D Metroid every few years while Retro Studios continues to make 3D Prime games, giving us the best of both worlds for this legendary series.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Metroid Prime</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/metroid-prime-1763026689679.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">On the N64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 64, and Donkey Kong 64 all proved that once 2D Nintendo franchises could successfully make the jump to 3D, but unfortunately, this era didn’t involve a brand new 3D Metroid game, or really, any new Metroid game at all. But in 2002, Retro Studios did the unthinkable: it successfully transformed the classic feel of Super Metroid into a stunning, atmospheric, and revolutionary first-person action platforming game with fantastic shooting mechanics and an incredible world to explore. From seeing small drops of condensation build around Samus’ visor to the first time we stepped into the icy Phendrana Drifts as the camera panned out and the piano music swelled, we knew we were experiencing something magical. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything from morph ball exploration to suit upgrades and an ever evolving arsenal of weaponry and traversal tools made their way into our hands in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime">Metroid Prime</a> after the franchise had been largely dormant for eight years. Boss fights and explosive set pieces brought the series to epic new heights, setting the stage for future Metroid Prime games for years to come. At the time, standard first person shooters were a dime a dozen, but there was really nothing like Metroid Prime. Not only that, but twenty years later, Prime still holds up well, as proven by the Nintendo Switch release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-review">Metroid Prime Remastered.</a></p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Super Metroid</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/13/super-metroid-1763026798566.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Almost three decades later and after a wide variety of experimentation across various genres, perspectives, and control methods, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-metroid">Super Metroid</a> still remains the greatest Metroid game of all time. In fact, Super Metroid set the bar so high that the team behind it couldn’t figure out how to top it during the entire Nintendo 64 era, so the Metroid series just took that generation off like it was a victory lap. Super Metroid still feels amazing and is still enjoyed by new players and hardcore speedrunning obsessives alike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But why? Well, it's perfectly paced and has some of the most rewarding exploration, meticulously crafted level design, pulse pounding music, and some of the best looking pixel art of all time. Like several of its most successful Super Nintendo contemporaries, it took everything that worked in the previous NES installment and improved it, making one of the greatest and most iconic sidescrolling action games ever made. Super Metroid helped define both the future of the series and the genre as a whole. It’s a master class in game design and one that both indie and triple-A game developers have been citing as an inspiration for nearly thirty years now. It’s not only the best Metroid game, it’s one of the best video games ever made. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there you have it, the top 10 Metroid games leading up to the launch of the highly anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. Once the new instalment releases it will join a lineup of fifteen games with Metroid in the title, all of which I made sure to give a nod to in this article, even if only ten of them made the list. So what’s your favorite Metroid game ever made? Which game do you wish made the list or got bumped higher or lower? Are you a diehard defender of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-other-m">Metroid: Other M</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-federation-force">Federation Force</a>? Did you play hundreds of hours of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-hunters-first-hunt">Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt</a> demo when the Nintendo DS launched like I did?

            <title><![CDATA[Govee Speaker Lamp (Sound by JBL) Is Still Alive at Its Black Friday Price, Listen to ‘Golden’ With Music-Light Sync This Holiday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-table-lamp-2-pro-x-sound-by-jbl-2000648503</link>
            <guid>1368103</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="56" data-end="537">With Black Friday weekend finally here, you can save big across essentially every category of products. Whether you’re looking for a new espresso machine to treat yourself to barista-level lattes in the morning or if you’re hoping to snag a new 4K monitor for your gaming PC, now is the weekend to find what you’re looking for. If you’re just perusing the web this weekend for something you maybe don’t “need” but seems like a cool thing to have, this could be just the thing. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6080/">The Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro x Sound by JBL has come down by 25%.</a> This Bluetooth speaker and lightshow in one normally goes for $180, but Black Friday has it down to just $135. You end up saving yourself $45.</p>
<p data-start="56" data-end="537">Govee’s smart table lamp offers a fun way to mix both sound and light at your next party, synchronizing the light and color to the music playing through its speaker. The lamp’s integrated chipset and advanced algorithm allow it to respond to music in real-time with a 32ms response time. This ensures the lights stay in perfect sync with every beat, making your music come alive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6080/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="56" data-end="537">Set the Perfect Atmosphere</h2>
<p data-start="539" data-end="902">The lamp features 16 different music modes that adjust the lighting based on the rhythm of your music. You can switch between modes to match the mood, whether you’re hosting a lively party or trying to create a more relaxing vibe to wind down to.</p>
<p data-start="904" data-end="1318">This lamp is equipped with 210 high-density LED beads—20% more than previous versions—ensuring sharper, more vibrant colors. You can individually adjust each bead’s color, allowing you to create a personalized lighting scheme. Experiment with the colors as you turn your room into a unique light show.</p>
<p data-start="1320" data-end="1743">Sound quality is just as impressive as the lighting as the Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro is made in collaboration with JBL. Powered by a compact 2.5-inch, 500cc full-range speaker and backed by JBL’s equalizer algorithm, the audio is crisp and full of depth. For a more immersive experience, you can even pair two lamps together for stereo sound, with synchronized light effects to match.</p>


<p data-start="1320" data-end="1743">For those who want to take it even further, the Music DreamView feature allows you to synchronize the lamp with up to 10 other Govee lights. This turns your entire room into a synchronized light and sound experience, heightening the atmosphere (or perhaps causing sensory overload) for any occasion.</p>
<p data-start="1745" data-end="2034">This smart lamp offers up to 4.5 hours of continuous light and sound on a single charge. Note that that’s with volume and brightness set at 50%. The lamp has adjustable brightness (600lm) and a wide color temperature range (2700K–6500K). Fine tune it to your needs.</p>
<p data-start="2274" data-end="2533">The Govee Home app unlocks more personalization options, giving you full control over the lighting in your space. Voice control is possible with compatibility for Alexa, Google Assistant, and Matter, allowing you to adjust the settings or switch modes just by asking. Even set custom routines. You can make it so when you say, “Alexa, I’m going up, up, up,” the Govee lamp automatically shifts to a bright, golden hue and starts blasting “Golden” by Huntrix from <em>K-Pop Demon Hunters</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[MOZA AB6 Flight Simulator Review—A New Level of Immersion]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ab6-flight-review/</link>
            <guid>1368100</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been around 4 weeks since I unboxed and started playing with the AB6 flight simulator bundle from MOZA, and it’s a true step up in terms of quality and immersion from what I’ve been using previously. For complete transparency, I am not a tried-and-tested flight simulator enthusiast with years of experience; in fact, I only got into flight simulators in the past 12 months thanks to my 9-year-old son, who is obsessed with planes. So naturally, as an adult who loves his toys… I couldn’t just let him have all the fun.</p>



<p>Nearly $1500 later, and we finally have a decent flight simulator setup, but when MOZA contacted me to try out their new AB6 flight, I jumped at the chance.</p>



<p>MOZA has been in both the flight and racing simulator scenes for several years, and their AB9 flight stick was very well received in the flight simulator community. With the AB6, they’ve opted for a more affordable offering at $399. For those not in the flight simulator community, it’s a price tag that might seem steep, but compared to other products on the market that offer similar features, it really is a good deal.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-fully-immersive-product">A Fully-Immersive Product</h2>



<p>One of the key highlights of the MOZA AB6 is a force-feedback flight base that delivers up to 6 Nm of peak torque—roughly half the output of the AB9. While on paper that is a huge difference, the competitive price and inclusion of the flight stick as a part of the bundle (which does not apply to the AB9), it is a good compromise. Remember that the AB6 is aimed at getting people into the hobby at a competitive price, rather than pricing them out.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What I will say is that the force feedback completely changed the immersion for both my son and me, and I don’t think either of us wants to go back to what we were using. In fact, I would recommend anything to get into the hobby with force feedback at the start, rather than wasting money further on down the line.</p>







<p>One of the things I was massively unaware of with the AB6 is that you can also change it into a shifter if you’re also into race simulation. So, if you’re like me and are sick of changing parts around, the MOZA AB6 makes it relatively easy to change a few settings and swap out the flightstick for a shifter and go from in the air to on the ground.</p>



<h2 id="h-ab6-specifications">AB6 Specifications</h2>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Dimensions</td><td>188*123*163 mm</td></tr><tr><td>Housing Material</td><td>Aluminum alloy</td></tr><tr><td>Dust Bag Material</td><td>Microfiber leather</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>2.95KG</td></tr><tr><td>Motors</td><td>Dual high-performance servo motors</td></tr><tr><td>Roll Axis Continuous Torque</td><td>4.4N·m</td></tr><tr><td>Peak Combined Torque</td><td>6N·m</td></tr><tr><td>Travel Range</td><td>±20° roll (X-axis), ±17° pitch (Y-axis)</td></tr><tr><td>Compatible Sticks</td><td>All MOZA flight sticks</td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td>72W</td></tr><tr><td>Voltage Input</td><td>110~220V AC —&gt;12V DC</td></tr><tr><td>Game Resolution</td><td>0-65535</td></tr><tr><td>USB Polling Rate</td><td>1000Hz</td></tr><tr><td>Mounting Options</td><td>Desktop clamp (included), baseplate (sold separately), direct hard mount</td></tr><tr><td>Emergency Stop Switch</td><td>Optional</td></tr><tr><td>Smart Telemetry-Based Force Feedback</td><td>Supported (no plugin required)</td></tr><tr><td>Native Force Feedback Support</td><td>√</td></tr><tr><td>Platform</td><td>PC</td></tr><tr><td>Included Accessories</td><td>Power supply, power cable, data cable, toolkit, user manual, stickers</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-ab6-overall-thoughts">AB6 Overall Thoughts</h2>



<p>Again, I am not a fully-fledged flight simulator enthusiast, but if you’re like me with a year or so in the cockpit, I couldn’t recommend the AB6 by MOZA enough. The production quality and immersion that the AB6 brings you is such a massive step up from the more common flight simulator products that most people start off with, that I do think it’s worth spending an additional $100 or so to get the full bang for your buck on what the hobby can offer.</p>



<p>You can check out MOZA’s AB6 and other products over on their <a href="https://amzn.to/4onOdK8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amazon page here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Two Years After That Stunning Reveal, Light No Fire Still Only Has a ‘Tiny’ Team Working on It]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/two-years-after-that-stunning-reveal-light-no-fire-still-only-has-a-tiny-team-working-on-it/</link>
            <guid>1368091</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been almost two years since Hello Games took 2023's edition of The Game Awards by storm with the stunning reveal trailer of <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-is-a-planet-sized-fantasy-online-multiplayer-sandbox-rpg-from-no-mans-sky-developer-hello-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Light No Fire</a>, quickly becoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-handily-tops-youtube-views-for-tga-2023-trailers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most viewed trailer shown at the event</a>.</p>



<p>The next game of the independent UK studio behind No Man's Sky immediately made a lasting impression on games. Whereas NMS tried to create a whole galaxy to explore, Light No Fire focuses on a single planet, but with the ambitious goal of making it truly Earth-sized as never before in games. This new survival adventure game distinguishes itself from the studio's previous work with its high-fantasy setting, as showcased in the trailer, which features staple fantasy creatures such as dragons, skeletons, anthropomorphic races, and more.  </p>



<p>Another exciting aspect of Light no Fire is the promise to host the entire community on this massive planet with no loading screens or instancing, offering players a single procedural Earth-like planet on which all traversal is continuous and everything players build or discover exists in a shared ecosystem.</p>



<p>The planet's geography also appears to be highly varied. The trailer and screenshots show towering mountains, deep oceans, and numerous distinct biomes. Many of the technological advancements <a href="https://wccftech.com/massive-update-releases-for-no-mans-sky-adding-new-storyline-deep-sea-diving-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced in recent No Man's Sky updates</a> are being used to create more advanced atmospheres, oceans, and fauna for Light No Fire.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the goal is to create a fully shared multiplayer world where players can “carve a life together,” meet others organically, and travel, build, and fight cooperatively. Buildings and settlements are persistent and can be discovered by others, reinforcing the sense of a unified community. Exploration will be a big part of the game, of course. Players will have the opportunity to climb extreme mountains and sail the ocean with ships and their discovery and naming of places feeds into the shared world state. There will also be 'unique enemies' and valuable resources to discover throughout the world.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Light No Fire Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jKQem4Z6ioQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Critically, Hello Games also promised that the survival sandbox already seen in No Man's Sky will be bolstered by the depth of a roleplaying game. That said, there's still a lot we don't know about Light No Fire, and it looks like things may stay that way for quite a while.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/275850/view/627816662678110800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recap of the many updates released this year for No Man's Sky</a>, founder and managing director Sean Murray told the community that a 'tiny team' is continuing to work 'at pace' in the background on Light No Fire. Murray added that he's 'really pleased' with the progress and believes the game will be something special, but most fans took this brief statement to mean the game might still be several years out.</p>



<p>Granted, Hello Games only has around fifty employees, and given the pace of updates coming to No Man's Sky, it's somewhat obvious that they don't have a large team working on this new project. Still, it might eventually come to a place where they must choose whether to increase in size or remove some people from No Man's Sky in favor of Light No Fire. </p>



<p>Either way, the developer got notoriously burned with the launch of No Man's Sky. <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-finally-reaches-very-positive-overall-user-review-rating-on-steam-8-years-after-disastrous-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It took them eight years to regain the 'Very Positive' user review rating on Steam</a>, and they definitely don't want to botch another release, even if it means taking more time with it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Have you ever looked at <em>The Washington Post </em>and thought, “Why is a billionaire allowed to use his massive wealth to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619887/jeff-bezos-washington-post-opinion-section-limits-free-speech-markets">influence</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon/626809/washington-post-editor">punish</a> editorial decisions at one of the nation’s premier newspapers?” and / or “I wonder if I could do that?” Well, <em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1649950%2FNews_Tower%2F" rel="sponsored">News Towe</a>r</em> can help you answer at least one of those questions.</p><p><em>News Tower</em>, out now on Steam, is a management sim game that covers the business of running a newspaper in the 1930s. Players inherit a struggling paper with aims to turn it into New York’s premier news destination, but they’ll have to manage everything from keeping the lights on, keeping their reporters happy, and keeping rival newspapers, mobsters, lawsuits, fake news, and old news at bay.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption>Here’s what your tower can look like with all the money in the world.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Sparrow Night</cite></span></p></section><p>In addition to providing all the news fit to print, your main job in <em>News Tower</em> is making your employees efficient and happy. Smells, loud noises, heat, and lacking a sense of purpose all degrade their happiness, leading to sloppy, slow work. You can mitigate those annoyances by building office walls, installing fans, and generally making your tower a good place to work. Initially, I was confused that some of my employees were unhappy even though they all had their own offices. It was only when I started adding little amenities like plants, clocks, and decorative wallpaper — items not strictly tied to increasing their skills or getting rid of annoyances — that they improved. Hmm, wonder if there’s a metaphor in there somewhere?</p><p>I love this little game and not only because it’s rare to have one that caters to my specific profession. Management sims can get tedious, especially if the majority of gameplay is done by reading text and menus (*cough* <em>Crusader Kings</em> *cough*). But <em>News Tower</em> feels more like a god playing with dolls than with spreadsheets. Employees amble across the screen, filing reports and repairing broken fixtures with the charming jank of <em>South Park</em>’s Terrance and Phillip puppets. Your news tower responds to you as you build it up, with light fixtures jangling and dust clouds swirling every time you move walls around. When it’s time to go to print, you have to throw a big switch that makes a pleasing and tactile <em>ka-thunk</em> noise. Even the soundtrack adds to the immersion, with <a href="https://youtu.be/r2S1I_ien6A?si=JWvsAyg1quJHP-RU">iconic big band drum licks</a> playing as your paper flies through the presses just like in the moving pictures.</p><p>Playing <em>News Tower</em> as a journalist surprised me in ways I should have expected but did not prepare for. I went into this with the goal of playing it as true to life as the systems would allow, thinking that my skills would translate easily and quickly into success. But so far, I’ve bankrupted my newspaper, <em>The Star</em>, on three separate occasions.</p><div><p><figcaption>Break sales records while breaking the corporate bank account.</figcaption></p></div><p>Every week, your news wire operator brings stories that you can assign to your reporters. You choose which stories to pursue based on multiple factors, including what readers in a certain district want, synergy with other stories you’re working on, and your reporters’ strengths.</p><p>There are also powerful factions like the mob, the mayor, and more who, depending on if you’re courting them or not, can influence your decisions. It’s easy to say, like I did, “I’m an ethical journalist, I won’t let anyone dictate what I can write about!” But that calculation swiftly changes when the mob offers me cash to leave any stories about crime on the cutting room floor or when pleasing the mayor gets me favorable deals on the loans I need to keep my reporters paid. Even though I never took cash, I did play along with the different factions so long as their requests stayed within what I deemed ethically acceptable. After all, that’s how the game is played for real. But also like real life, money turned out to be my biggest challenge.</p><div><p><figcaption>You can play nice with the mob for cash or run the risk of having your reporters’ knees broken.</figcaption></p></div><p>Over time, all your employees grow in skill, requiring higher salaries. I could have replaced the senior reporters with cheaper newbies, but that would have slowed the paper down, and I had gotten used to stories coming in on Thursday and Friday instead of the Sunday deadline (with abundant, self-aware apologies to my editor). Paper was another ironic money sink. As my reporters improved and articles came in faster, I was forced to expand my paper’s size up to two- and three-page runs. So though I was breaking sales records and pleasing readers with high-quality journalism, I was hardly making a profit because it cost so much extra money to print.</p><p>There was a point where I reached a happy medium where the paper was profitable and of good reputation and quality. But I was feeling a bit of FOMO because <em>The Star</em> wasn’t printing even higher-quality stories because it didn’t have a photographer. So I took my healthy profits and hired a photographer, thinking that’d solve my problem… but it made things worse. I didn’t realize that a photographer just taking the pictures wouldn’t be enough to get them on the page. I had to hire a developer and build them a dark room, then hire a chemical processor and build them their own room because the chemical smell impacted employee morale. My single, thoughtless purchase behind chasing a new technology turned into an avalanche of expenses that eventually led me to bankruptcy. Okay, yeah there’s definitely some metaphors in here.<br>I don’t love <em>News Tower</em> because it’s professional flattery wrapped up in a management sim. I love it because it pretty faithfully exposes why good journalism is so hard to find these days. Being a craven opportunist will net you the cash but none of the quality. Do the work the right way, and your paper will get choked to death by bigger competitors with less scruples. After many failures, I’m doing a run where I’m expanding as slowly and cost-effectively as I can without taking any favors, no matter what. I can see why Mr. Bezos does what he does, running a newspaper ethically is <em>hard. </em>I’m gonna do it anyway.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/830340/news-tower-indie-game-management-sim]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-clears-star-wars-imperial-star-destroyer-now-selling-4-8-rated-set-at-new-all-time-low-2000648724</link>
            <guid>1368082</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Putting together a huge LEGO set is one of those rare things that gets kids and adults to stop looking at screens. And when it comes to the Danish toy maker’s line, Star Wars themes are by far the best and the most popular. Harry Potter sets might get some love, but the galaxy far, far away is always at the top of the sales charts.</p>
<p>The problem with famous Star Wars builds is that they almost never go on sale for a lot less, so you have to be patient and wait for the right time to get one at a good price. The good news is that during Black Friday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6094/">the iconic Imperial Star destroyer set is on sale for $119 on Amazon, down from its normal price of $159</a>. As you might know, this model is one of the most popular ships in the entire collection.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6094/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Legendary Ship That Will Actually Fit on Your Shelf</h2>
<p>This<strong> 1,555-piece set</strong> turns the scary wedge-shaped cruiser from<em> A New Hope</em> into a brick model. The size is just right so it doesn’t take up too much space on your display and <strong>the finished model is 18 inches long and just over 6 inches tall</strong> so it stands out on a bookshelf without taking up an entire wall. LEGO made this version with a hidden carry handle that folds into the hull so that this way, younger builders can swoop it around the room during imaginary space battles without it falling apart in their hands.</p>



<p>The real magic happens inside the hull where LEGO packed in <strong>several rooms that show off the Empire’s harsh military style</strong>: There is a real bridge with command stations, a separate control room with technical panels, and even a break room because Stormtroopers need coffee breaks too. The armory has weapons for the crew, and the cargo area has the glowing Kyber Crystal pieces and thermal detonators that refer to deeper Star Wars lore.</p>
<p>These little things on the inside turn the build from a simple display piece into something you can actually explore and move around, which keeps the fun going long after the building is done. The engineering also makes sure that you can get to these areas without having to take down the whole building. The hinged panels swing open easily and lock back into place securely.</p>



<p>There are <strong>seven mini-figures in the box, and the main one is Darth Vader in full black armor and a cape</strong>. There’s also an Imperial Gunner, an Imperial Navy Trooper, and Commander Praji and a standard Stormtrooper is the backbone of the Empire’s forces. The set also comes with a <strong>25th anniversary edition of Cal Kestis</strong> from the Jedi video game series: This is a one-of-a-kind collectible that won’t be available in future releases.</p>
<p>This $40 discount is a big deal for a high-end LEGO set of this size and difficulty, especially since Star Wars collaborations don’t usually get discounts this big outside of big shopping events. You’re paying about $0,076 per piece, which is much less than the usual ratio that LEGO charges for licensed themes.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/charge-multiple-devices-on-the-go-for-just-11-with-this-2-pack-of-ankers-20w-charger-2000648506</link>
            <guid>1368079</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Keeping your devices charged at all times doesn’t have to be complicated. Those who use multiple gadgets to get through their days can greatly benefit from dual-port chargers that make it easy to top up to two essentials at the same time. And today is a great time to pick a couple for literal pennies.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6079/">A 2-pack of Anker’s 20W charger, which typically sits at $19, just dropped to $11 at Amazon, after a whopping 41% discount</a>. Each of these comes with two ports, and with this deal, you’re basically paying just a little over $5 for each. The offer applies to the black color option. Others are discounted too, but the prices vary. For instance, the white option is sitting at $13, while green and purple are going for $14 each. Plus, for every color except black, discounts are only available to Prime members. These are Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals (even though the event is behind us), but they’re selling out fast. Get yours before the stock runs out or Amazon decides to push the price back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6079/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast, But Safe Charging for Your Essentials</h2>
<p>The charger is designed to be compact and portable. It fits in the palm of your hand, slides into your pocket, and can be tossed into any backpack without bulking things up. Getting two of these means you can keep one for home use, while the other in your laptop bag or car for hassle-free on-the-go usage. Two ports (one USB-C and one USB-A) let you power two devices at the same time. The 20W output isn’t massive, but still decent to juice your essentials up without taking too long. It can fast charge an iPhone 16 from 0 to 50% in around 30 minutes. You’ll enjoy maximum power when using a single port. When both are in use, expect each to deliver 7.5W max output.</p>



<p>A 5 ft USB-C to USB-C cable is included with each charger, which is long enough for you to be able to use the connected devices comfortably as they charge. As for compatibility, it plays nicely with a range of devices. These include iPhone Series 15 through 17, iPhone Pro Series (2024, 2023, 2022, 2021), the latest Google Pixel devices, recent Samsung phones, and even Galaxy tablets. You will also be able to power your earbuds, select iPad configurations, plus smartwatches with each. Basically, it covers all the devices you rely on on a regular basis. But despite all the power, the charger stays calm and cool as it works. Anker’s enhanced safety system includes overvoltage protection, temperature control, and other helpful safety features to protect your devices from long-term wear, while also maintaining their battery health.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6079/">Included in the box are two Anker chargers, a 2-pack 5 ft USB-C to USB-C cable, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty, in case something goes wrong. You can now grab this bundle for just $11.</a> It’s open to all shoppers, but Prime members will enjoy free delivery with their purchase, too. If you’re not one, you can still get free delivery, but only on orders above $35. Just don’t wait too long to grab the deal, as it’s going to end soon. Holiday rush is in full swing, and as a general rule, if you spot something you like, jump in on it while there’s still time. Additionally, there’s plenty more going at a discount right now, so it’s a good time to stock up on both the essentials and pricey options without blowing your budget.</p>

<p>Core, blimey!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Publisher Fireshine Games and developer Pugstorm dazzled us with the gorgeous survival sandbox game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/core_keeper">Core Keeper</a> back in September last year, and today they have announced that more is on the way in the shape of a swanky new Switch 2 Edition.</p>
<p>Arriving on <strong>28th January</strong>, you can expect this one to feature beefed-up graphical fidelity and frame rate (targeting 60fps), as well as a bunch of visual tweaks in the lighting, shadow, water quality and particle effect departments to keep things looking super sleek.</p>
<p>What's more, the Switch 2 version will include native eight-player co-op — a substantial step up from the original's four — and anyone can get involved with a session, even if you're playing on Switch 1 (assuming the session is being hosted by a S2 player, of course).</p>
<p>And the best part of all: this Switch 2 Edition upgrade will be <em>completely free</em> for those who already own the game on the old hardware!</p>
<p>The good news doesn't end there either. Fireshine Games and Pugstorm have <em>also</em> announced that the free 'Volt &amp; Voltage' update will be arriving on all systems on the very same day. This packs in a new biome to explore, fresh enemy types and bosses, and a bunch of cool new weapons. It promises to be a rather beefy one, so if you've been looking for an excuse to dive back in, this might just be the perfect opportunity.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/core-keeper">our review</a> of the original Switch 1 release, we called Core Keeper "a wonderfully engaging and mysterious survival sandbox that is tough to put down once it gets its hooks in you," and it's certainly one to watch if you're a fan of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terraria">Terraria</a>. Bring on even more in January!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreen-65w-wall-charger-4-ports-hits-record-low-day-after-black-friday-amazon-forgot-to-stop-deals-2000648712</link>
            <guid>1368070</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Having a lot of chargers plugged into every outlet makes a mess of cables and adapters that takes up space and looks bad. The Ugreen Nexode 65W charger combines everything into one small unit so you can charge your laptop, phone, and tablet all at once from one wall outlet. And the good news is that right now, this <strong>four-port GaN charger</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/">is down from its usual price of $39 to $24</a> on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Charges 4 Devices at Once</h2>
<p>The charger can be so small because of the new Gallium Nitride technology while Standard silicon-based chargers need bigger parts to safely handle 65W output. GaN works better and makes less heat which lets Ugreen fit a lot of charging power into a package that is only 2.64 x 1.65 x 1.5 inches. The <strong>foldable plug design</strong> makes it even more portable because the prongs tuck away flat which keeps other things in your bag from getting scratched and stops the charger from getting stuck on fabric.</p>
<p>The <strong>four-port setup with three USB-C outputs and one USB-A port</strong> works with almost all of your devices. You can charge your MacBook Pro through the main USB-C port at full speed which is 65W. This is the same speed as Apple’s own charger which charges a MacBook Air to 51% in just 30 minutes. The other ports can charge your phone, wireless earbuds, tablet, or even a Steam Deck at the same time.</p>



<p>Built-in protections keep the device from getting too hot or too much current, and they automatically change the power delivery when they sense a problem. You don’t have to worry about power surges or overheating problems that cheap chargers have when you leave devices plugged in overnight.</p>
<p>The <strong>smart power distribution system</strong> gives out watts based on what is connected and what each device needs: When you charge your phone, it gives it the right amount of power to charge quickly without giving it too much power, which could hurt the battery over time. When you add your laptop to the mix, the charger changes its power budget to give priority to the device that needs more power.</p>
<p>You get here <strong>four ports and 65W of power for $24 which is less than what most single-port chargers cost</strong>. Plus, the package is smaller than most laptop adapters.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday weekend is here, and with that comes tons of deals across every product category under the sun ranging from vacuums to coffee makers to, yes, even video games. Amazon has the PlayStation 5 Slim on sale for $100 off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5801/">This disc edition of the console has recently been priced as high as $550, but during this weekend, you can grab the system of just $450.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5801/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tons of Games</h2>
<p>Okay we all love our memes about the PS5 saving it has no games. And while maybe at this point in the console’s lifecycle we were hoping for a little more, the library of choices you have for what to play is far more than the barren wasteland Twitter makes it out to be.</p>
<p>The new <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> is one of the best looking and best playing action games of the generation. <em>Returnal</em> is a fast-paced third-person shooter roguelike with eary vibes reminiscent of <em>Metroid</em>. <em>Astro Bot</em> is our much-needed plunge back into the 3D mascot platforming genre. It’s a brilliantly fun love letter to all things PlayStation and earned its title as 2024’s Game of the Year at The Game Awards last year.</p>
<p>Then if you missed out on the PS4 generation, you have countless titles waiting for you to dip into—some of which even enhanced for their move onto the PlayStation 5.&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us: Part 1 </em>and <em>The Last of Us: Part 2</em> regularly get cited as the best story in video games. Well, at least the first one does (though I am a stark defender of the second one). Form your own opinion on the choices made by the iconic characters in these post-apocalypse stories that went on to inspire and HBO adaptation.</p>
<p>Access a bunch of these instant classics with a subscription to PlayStation Plus Premium. You’ll be able to access hundreds of games across PlayStation generations like&nbsp;<em>Control, Kingdom Hearts 3, Final Fantasy VII Remake,&nbsp;</em>and more.</p>



<h2>Expandable Storage</h2>
<p>While this model PlayStation 5 is marketed as having a 1TB SSD, your actual usable storage isn’t quite that. Much of the internal drive’s space is dedicated toward system software that enables the PS5 be, well, a PS5. Out of the box, its more accurate to say you’ll be working with a little over 850GB.</p>
<p>If you’d prefer more space, you can always expand it. The PS5 Slim’s storage is expandable via an internal SSD slot. Brands like Crucial, Samsung, and Wester Digital all make SSDs which come with heatsinks and are compatible for installation in a PlayStation 5. Much of those you’ll be able find on sale this weekend and next between Black Friday and Cyber Week. Installation is pretty easy too. There are any number of tutorial videos to choose from on YouTube. All it takes is a screw driver and five minutes of your time.</p>

            <p>Netflix's Assassin's Creed show will reportedly explore ancient Rome.</p>
<p>That's according to a new report by <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-set-to-explore-ancient-rome">Nexus Point News</a>, which claims sources say the TV show will explore a time period hitherto untouched by the game series, and feature figures such as Emperor Nero and Seneca the Younger. If true, that would see the series set between 54-68 AD.</p>
<p>According to the official blurb for Netflix's take on Assassin's Creed, the series will be "centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions - one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny".</p> <div>

Beyond that, who Wallace will play has not been announced yet, but according to the publication the upcoming show will feature characters different from the games.</p>

            <p>Build A Rocket Boy has quietly released a "free starter pack" to resuscitate its flailing action-adventure game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a>.</p>
<p>The free pack, which was released yesterday (28th November), hopes to snag new players by offering a taster of the "ever-expanding gameplay experience of MindsEye".</p>
<p>"Dive into an action-packed mission in the campaign and preview a selection of new playable content that is delivered regularly through ARCADIA," the description teases.</p>

<p>The demo sees you play as Jacob Diaz, a former soldier with a neural implant and fractured memories, "drawn into an explosion that erupts into a high-speed chase and fierce firefight through the city".</p>
<p>It features the story mission Robin Hood and access to a "variety" of ARCADIA missions and challenges, which are "updated regularly". Here's what's currently on offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Garden Party – Drone Race</li>
<li>Chase The Sun – Drone Race</li>
<li>Honor Among Thieves</li>
<li>Downtown - Goin' Haywire</li>
<li>Crosstown Traffic – Checkpoint Race</li>
<li>Rude Interruption</li>
<li>Turbulence - Race</li>
<li>Free Bird – Sky Race</li>
<li>Winging It – Checkpoint Race</li>
<li>Craz-Eye Taxi – Checkpoint Race</li>
<li>Friendly Fire</li>
<li>Cruise Control – Sky Race</li>
<li>Fractured Echo – Survival Horde</li>
<li>Road To Hell - Race</li>
</ul>
<p>The free starter pack is available on Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series consoles.</p>
<p>Last month, MindsEye boss and Build A Rocket Boy studio founder Leslie Benzies alleged in an internal meeting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-alleges-saboteurs-within-the-company-were-behind-its-poor-reception-according-to-new-report">"saboteurs" within the company were behind the game's poor reception</a>. Shortly after confirming redundancies, he said negativity towards the game was "uncalled for" and alleged "internal and external" forces scuppered the game's launch.</p>
<p>Benzies' comments come just weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-developers-sign-damning-open-letter-against-studio-execs-over-longstanding-disrespect-and-mistreatment-following-games-disastrous-launch">MindsEye developers signed an open letter against studio execs</a> over "longstanding disrespect and mistreatment".</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">wasn't the first time the game's negative reaction has been blamed on others</a>. Even before the game was released, studio co-CEO Mark Gerhard claimed in an exchange on the MindsEye Discord server that "all the people who reacted negatively were financed by someone". He later added there was a "concerted effort" against the studio, and it "doesn't take much to guess who".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launch-what-we-didnt-hope-for-says-io-interactive-ceo-as-publishing-future-in-question">Publisher IO Interactive has since distanced itself from the project</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/save-space-and-boost-efficiency-with-ankers-675-usb-c-docking-station-while-its-going-for-32-less-2000648509</link>
            <guid>1368052</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Docking stations are a great way to manage multiple devices on your desk without cord clutter. You plug everything into a single unit and keep it beside your monitor for easy access. But what if we told you there’s an even more efficient way of doing things?</p>
<p>Anker’s 675 USB-C Docking Station doubles as a monitor stand and lets you connect up to 12 devices at the same time! <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6077/">On a regular day, it would run you around $250, but all thanks to Black Friday, you can grab one for just $170 today.</a> That’s after a massive 32% discount. Even better, you’ll enjoy free shipping with your purchase, whether you’re a Prime member or not. The main sale event is technically over, and Cyber Monday is still a couple of days away. This lingering deal is a great way to save on an efficient charging solution if you missed grabbing it yesterday and can’t wait for Monday!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6077/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Saves Space</h2>
<p>It looks like a regular monitor/laptop stand, even though it’s anything but that. You’re getting a bunch of ports on the side, including a 100W max USB-C upstream port, 3 USB-A ports, 2 USB-C ports, SD/microSD card slots, a 4K HDMI port, a wireless charging pad, and an Ethernet port. That’s everything you need to connect all your essentials, plus a few extras, without feeling limited. Place your monitor on the top, and then add a keyboard, external storage, headphones, and more. The wireless charging pad makes it easy to top up your smartphone while you’re busy being productive. All of us have our phones on our workstations anyway, so it’s a great way to juice them up instead of letting them sit idle. The 100W max USB-C upstream port charges your laptop as you work, just as well. Note that the dock does not support display via any of the USB-C ports. You can only do that using the single HDMI port. It shouldn’t be a problem, though, unless you’re looking for a bigger, multi-monitor setup with three or four screens.</p>
<p>There’s some space under the dock that you can use to store your keyboard and mouse when not in use. Just push them under once you’re done working, and come back to a clean, tidy setup the next day. Raising your monitor to your eye level also promotes a better posture, as you can easily sit up straight instead of slouching.</p>



<p>Exceptional stability comes from an Aircraft-Grade aluminum alloy body with an anti-slip silicone strip for sturdiness. The curved edge design makes the overall look and feel premium. It’s built to blend into any workstation, from the most basic ones to those that have quite a lot going on in terms of personality. Getting started is straightforward, as just plugging your laptop in wakes your entire workstation up. The dock plays nicely with a wide range of laptops and monitors, including Dell XPS, Lenovo, iMac, MacBook, and more. OS-wise, it works well with Windows 10 and 11, plus macOS 10.14 and above.</p>
<p>The package comes with the docking station, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6077/"> The current deal brings the price down to just $170, which is basically nothing for the features it offers.</a> You’re saving a nice $80 on a solution that’s going to make your workstation much more efficient and a whole lot cleaner.</p>

<p><em>"Stellar? It's a chaotic mess!"</em> Indeed it is, and well met, my friend. However, that's exactly why it's so damn good, so stop shouting at me.</p>
<p>Also, it's only a mess when you don't know what you're doing. That's right, and as I tried to impress in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">my 8/10 review</a>, once you know what you're doing in Kirby Air Riders, and once you take that knowledge with you into the online realm...well, it's a surprisingly strategic thing. There's a way to play well and a way to play badly, and luck doesn't come into it nearly as much as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart</a>, with its back-of-the-pack power-up boosts and blue shell upsets.</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adokhxvg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Nope. If you know the score in City Trials, as is the case with any race on any track in this game, you'll reap the rewards directly, and so being able to quickly grab the best power-ups (that's all those ludicrously massive icons that littler the arena) alongside a proper knowledge of the fastest routes, most protected avenues, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-how-to-reach-city-trials-floating-garden-and-floating-island">secret areas</a>, and all that jazz, will make you a winner. Oh, wonderful skill-based racing with a high-skill ceiling - you <em>were</em> hiding in there all along.</p>

<p>So. Given that I'm rightly enamoured with the air riding here, and given that I've been so impressed by a game that manages to remove acceleration control (one of the best bits of driving) whilst still remaining more strategic and engaging than other racers of its ilk, it's shame to have a complaint, but I do.</p>
<p>As we reported a little while back, Kirby Air Riders creator and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.</a> guru Masahiro Sakurai has said that there will <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/sakurai-has-no-plans-for-kirby-air-riders-dlc-everything-is-here">not be any more DLC for the game</a>. Sad (and also slightly spoiled) face. And it's a sad face because as much as I adore City Trial, I think its biggest strengths are drawn from and highlighted by its map - as a map you have to learn so well.</p>
<p>However, in having to get so very familiar with it to succeed against the best that online play can throw at you, only having the one to play on is something that's gonna limit my time with this one, and maybe, ultimately, bring it to a premature end.</p>
<p>If I was aware of even one new City Trial map coming down the pipeline, I'd be confident in the fact that Kirby Air Riders would remain on my Switch 2 indefinitely. And it still may do, by the way, because I just can't get enough of Rick.</p>
<p><em>Why</em>? Well, because he's a huge and cuddly hamster and I love him. But that's a different story.</p>

<p>No, what I mean is <em>why</em> can't we just have one more map? It's not an issue in any way in the rest of the game's modes, and the minigames that see out a round of City Trial are superb - nothing needs doing there.</p>
<p>Indeed, I fully feel as though Sakurai is being 100% genuine in his "<em>Everything is here...I've thrown everything I have into this game from the start"</em> statement when announcing that DLC was a no-go. I just...can't we just have even one more? (How hard can it be to design a breathtakingly brilliant map that works in solo <em>and</em> online play for player counts that vary wildly? I mean, <em>come on.</em>)</p>
<p>There's a ton of content here when you dig into Air Ride, there's endless reams of stuff to unlock and collect in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-all-playable-characters-and-how-to-unlock-for-every-game-mode">characters</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-all-tracks-and-how-to-unlock">tracks</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-all-machines-and-how-to-unlock">machines</a> in Road Trip, but the very nature of City Trials, with its hyper-fixation on this single (admittedly large and very well thought-out) Skyah map, surely means that it'll only continue to thrive and surprise if they chuck more maps in there for the long-term riders to tuck into.</p>
<p>C'mon, Nintendo. Let us feast on the fun of learning another area inside out whilst crushing our foes in online match-ups.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Apple Keeps the M5 MacBook Pro at All-Time Low as It Begins Clearing Out Post–Black Friday Stock]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/apples-2025-macbook-pro-dropped-to-its-lowest-price-ever-for-black-friday-2000648462</link>
            <guid>1368034</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday and Cyber Week are upon us. Now is the time to save big on tech stuff, home good, and everything else under the sun. Been thinking about upgrading your laptop? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6078/">Amazon is offering the Apple MacBook Pro at its lowest price yet, with a 16% discount that slashes $251 off the regular price, bringing it down to just $1,349</a>. If you’ve been eyeing this powerhouse laptop, there’s no better time to grab it.</p>
<p data-start="484" data-end="1070">This particular model is the 2025 version of the MacBook Pro, featuring Apple’s latest M5 chip, built to handle even the most demanding tasks. The M5 is equipped with a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU, delivering exceptional performance for everything from creative work to software development. The 16GB of memory and 512GB SSD ensure smooth multitasking and plenty of storage space for your files, apps, and media. This MacBook Pro can tackle everything from heavy video editing project to coding to everyday tasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6078/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="484" data-end="1070">Built for Apple Intelligence</h2>
<p data-start="1072" data-end="1516">AI has taken over the zeitgeist so its unsurprising Apple’s marketing around the M5 chip is leading with the buzzword. It’s been engineered for what Apple calls “Apple Intelligence,” making it powerful enough for automatically compiling tons of code, responding to AI prompts, and generating images based solely on descriptions. Whether you engage with AI or now, the chip’s power still translates into faster performance and more efficiency, so you can get more done in less time.</p>
<p data-start="1518" data-end="1947">Battery life on the 2025 MacBook Pro is exceptional. Thanks to the M5 chip, you can expect up to 24 hours of continuous use on a single charge, which is an incredible improvement over Intel-based MacBook Pro models. In fact, this is up to 14 times longer battery life than previous Intel versions, allowing you to work, stream, and browse for hours without worrying about finding an outlet.</p>
<p data-start="1949" data-end="2358">The MacBook Pro’s 14.2-inch Liquid Retina display is another highlight. The screen boasts an impressive 1,600 nits of brightness and supports a wide color gamut, delivering vibrant, true-to-life colors that will make all your photos, videos, and creative projects pop. The display’s able to render one billion colors, ensuring incredible detail and accuracy when watching a movie or editing photos.</p>


<p data-start="2360" data-end="2782">For those who rely on video calls—whether for work, school, or just catching up with loved ones—the MacBook Pro has some great little features . The built-in 12MP camera shoots in full 1080p HD, ensuring that you always look your best during meetings or virtual hangouts. The three-microphone array works alongside the six-speaker system to create an immersive sound experience, using spatial audio technology to ensure clear audio on both ends of the call.</p>
<p data-start="2784" data-end="3289">The camera also features Apple’s Center Stage, which uses AI to automatically adjust the camera’s angle as you move, ensuring you remain centered in the frame throughout video calls. No matter where you are in the room, Center Stage keeps you in view. This feature is compatible with pretty much all the popular video call apps like FaceTime and Zoom.</p>
<p data-start="3291" data-end="3572">This model is available in two elegant color options: space black and silver, so you can choose the one that best suits your style. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6078/">Both are on sale for Cyber Monday at its all-time low price of just $1,349.</a></p>

            <p>A new Dead Rising game is reportedly in development.</p>
<p>While there's been no formal word of a follow-up game, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-dead-rising-game-development-set-in-hollywood">mp1st</a> claims Capcom has another "major" Dead Rising project in the works, reportedly set in Hollywood.</p>

<p>According to the site's sources, the game has been in development since 2023. Codenamed 'Rec', it reportedly sees the return of Frank West and <em>may</em> be a direct sequel to the 2006 zombie game (the source seemingly wouldn't confirm either way). Isabela Keyes and the game's signature Psychopaths will also be returning.</p>
<p>For those who can't remember that far back, 2010's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-rising-2">Dead Rising 2</a> boasted similar gameplay to the original game, but featured a completely different character. West only returned in Dead Rising 2's Case West DLC.</p>
<p>That's not all, either. The same source claims the main villain will be "an extravagant and deranged film director who forces Frank and other survivors into various trials, all in the pursuit of filming his 'perfect movie'."</p>
<p>We'll also see the return of his "time limit mechanic" and his infamous camera. Sadly, there's no firm commitment to a release date at this stage, though.</p>
<p>We gave last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-review">Dead Rising's Deluxe Remaster a middling three out of five stars</a>, writing "the over-the-top zombie shenanigans still hold up in 2024, but next to the remaster from 2016, this is definitely geared more toward first-time players than returning fans."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Since Black Friday Week started, Amazon has sold hundreds of thousands of Xbox controllers. Even though it’s now the weekend after Thanksgiving, there are still great deals on these gaming essentials but the problem is that a lot of the color options are already sold out. However, the famous <em>Carbon Black</em> version is still available this Saturday morning and is now at its lowest price ever: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">$39, down from its usual price of $64</a>. This is the <strong>2025 model with all the newest features</strong> and at this price, you’re getting Microsoft’s best controller for almost 40% less than what you’d normally pay.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Play on Any Platforms</h2>
<p>The new Xbox wireless controller has some important improvements over older models. For example, it works with more than just traditional gaming setups as you can can<strong> connect this controller to your Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Windows PC, Android devices, iOS devices, Fire TV Sticks, smart TVs, and even VR headsets</strong> without wires using Bluetooth. You only need to buy one controller that works with all of your devices so you don’t have to switch between different peripherals for different platforms.</p>
<p>Microsoft improved the ergonomics by adding a <strong>textured grip to the triggers, bumpers, and back case</strong>. This makes it easier to control the game for long periods of time. The hybrid D-pad has a faceted design that makes it easier to make both sweeping and exact directional inputs. This makes a big difference in fighting games and platformers where every input counts. The <strong>controller also has a dedicated Share button</strong> that lets you take screenshots and video clips without stopping the game which makes it easier to make content if you like streaming or just want to save special moments.</p>



<p>The included AA batteries last a long time and <strong>give you up to 40 hours of gameplay</strong>. If you want to use rechargeable batteries instead, you can switch to the Play and Charge Kit. You can now keep a stable connection up to 30 feet away from your device, which gives you more options for how to set up your gaming area. Dynamic latency input technology makes the time between pressing a button and an action on the screen shorter. This makes the game feel more responsive, which competitive gamers will love, but casual gamers will also benefit from it.</p>
<p>The Carbon Black color is the <strong>classic Xbox look that never goes out of style</strong>: It has a matte finish that doesn’t show fingerprints as easily as glossy finishes. The housing is sturdy and doesn’t flex or creak, and the buttons give satisfying feedback without being too loud. You can also use the Xbox Accessories app to change the buttons on your controller to fit your needs for certain games or accessibility, which is more customization than most third-party controllers offer.</p>
<p>For $39, you get the newest controller technology from Microsoft which is less than what last generation’s model usually costs. The price is at an all-time low, and the improvements coming in 2025 will make it even better.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Razer Blackshark V3 PRO—Even Better Than Brilliant]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/review-razer-blackshark-v3-pro/</link>
            <guid>1368022</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Razer Blackshark V2 Pro was my go-to headset for the longest time, and it was also the pick of many of the world’s best esports pro players. That’s why I was elated when Razer revealed the Blackshark V3 Pro, the next generation of the award-winning headset, packed with upgraded technology but retaining the classic, flawless aesthetic that we all knew and loved.</p>



<p>The Razer Blackshark V3 Pro is out now and selling like hot cakes. In this review, I’m breaking down exactly why this headset is worth every penny of the somewhat expensive price tag.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-razer-blackshark-v3-pro-worth-269-99">Is the Razer Blackshark V3 Pro Worth $269.99?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing this review, the Razer Blackshark V3 Pro had a price tag of $269.99, which might seem exorbitant to some. However, the technology that’s packed into this headset more than makes the tag worthwhile, and there’s a reason why the world’s best pro players, especially those in the Call of Duty space, rely on this device.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the fundamentals. This is a wireless ANC headset, which means that when you’re playing, you’re unencumbered by cables and you won’t hear a thing around you. You’re completely in the zone and loving life, and that’s what this headset is all about.</p>



<p>It uses Razer’s Hyperspeed technology to ensure you’re getting low-latency connections that deliver your audio as clearly and efficiently as possible, which is of the utmost importance for <strong>any gamer</strong>, as audio desync is a harrowing issue that prevents the pinnacle of performance being delivered.</p>



<p>If you’re playing as part of a team, you’ve got the Hyperclear, detachable boom mic, which has a fat pop filter to keep your vocals clean and your callouts succinct. I used the boom mic on a range of software to test it out, from OBS to Audacity, and from Discord to in-game voice chats, and I can confirm it’s just as clear as most desktop podcast microphones, which is <strong>nice</strong>.</p>



<p>The Razer Blackshark V3 Pro comes in a range of designs, from black to white, and from ‘esports green’ to a special-edition Counter-Strike 2 version. I’m a <strong>huge </strong>fan of the esports green variant, which is available exclusively from Razer, but for my review of this headset, I used the clean white version.</p>



<p>For this new generation of the Razer Blackshark headset, the tech titan has pumped new technology behind the cups. The extremely capable drivers have been tweaked to reduce harmonic distortion, the bass range has been improved, and the directional audio capabilities are second-to-none, thanks to the THX Spatial on-board mechanics.</p>



<p>Put simply, you’ll hear a foot scraping on the floor across the map and be able to pinpoint exactly where it came from.</p>



<p>It gets better, though.</p>



<p>The Razer Blackshark V3 Pro has <strong>quad mode</strong> connectivity, which means it can work with 2.4Ghz wireless bands, Bluetooth, USB inputs, <strong>or </strong>via a 3.5mm cable. The battery is also nuts, and without ANC turned on, you can get up to 70 hours of battery life. The only negative I have about the headset is that it could really do with a dock of some kind to make charging more ‘comfortable’ and seamless.</p>



<p>That’s why I love the Astro A50 Gen 5, after all.</p>



<p>Interchangeable faceplates, app control, customization through the Razer Synapse software, and incredible levels of comfort thanks to a low-weight profile and comfy cushioning all come together to make this one of the best headsets on the market right now for both casual and pro gamers.</p>



<p>Don’t sleep on the Razer Blackshark V3 Pro.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Razer Raiju V3 PRO Review—An Elite Alternative to Scuf and Battle Beaver]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/razer-raiju-v3-pro-review/</link>
            <guid>1368019</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re in the market for a ‘pro-grade’ controller and are considering a Scuf or a Battle Beaver, put those thoughts on hold. Instead, take a look at the Razer Raiju V3 Pro, an all-new device that’s customizable, capable, and created by the best technical minds at Razer, one of the most reputable gaming brands around.</p>



<p>In this Razer Raiju V3 Pro review, I’ll help you understand why this is one of the best alternatives to the eye-wateringly expensive pro controllers on the market, and why it’s definitely worth your investment.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-razer-raiju-v3-pro-worth-219-99">Is the Razer Raiju V3 Pro Worth $219.99?</h2>



<p>The Razer Raiju V3 Pro will set you back a pretty penny, but it’s worth every cent. I’ve been trialling this wonderful controller for a couple of weeks on <strong>both </strong>PlayStation and PC as I write this, and I have had a brilliant time. I’ve used it across Battlefield 6, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and ARC Raiders, and in every situation put before me, the controller has excelled.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the build.</p>



<p>The controller is bigger than your average Dualsense controller, but it uses a similar mapping in terms of thumbsticks and face buttons. It has the classic trackpad that you’ve learned to associate with PlayStation controllers, but the triggers and shoulder buttons are more reminiscent of an Xbox controller. It’s the perfect hybrid, in my eyes.</p>



<p>You’ve got two extra buttons alongside the shoulder inputs, and up to <strong>four </strong>tactile inputs on the back, all of which are hot-swappable and customizable in a matter of seconds.</p>



<p>The thumbsticks are modular and can be swapped out just as quickly, and you get extras in the attractive carry pack that the controller comes in to suit your needs.</p>



<p>Additionally, almost every input on the controller is ‘mouse-click’ in build, the triggers come with stops that you can switch on and off to suit your game, and the entire thing is wrapped up in a comfortable, durable shell that looks great and feels nice in your hands.</p>



<p>It’s as premium as you can get, and it still comes in under the cost of a Scuf or a Battle Beaver.</p>



<p>But wait, <strong>there’s more!</strong></p>



<p>The Razer Raiju V3 Pro can be further adjusted with Razer’s Synapse software, which includes creating on-board profiles, setting actuation points, adjusting deadzones, remapping inputs, and so on.</p>



<p>If you want to use the controller wirelessly on a PS5, you’re covered. If you’d rather go wired on a PC, you can do that too – and you can switch between those inputs easily enough. The Razer Raiju V3 Pro is marketed as a ‘lag-free, esports-grade’ device, which means you have lightning-fast response times and super-low latency inputs.</p>



<p>It’s expensive, but that’s the point. It’s a premium controller that’ll suit the best pro players in the world, and it has been crafted in collaboration with those very competitors, especially in the Call of Duty space. It takes a while to get used to the inputs if you’ve never used a controller like this, but it’s well worth investing that time to seek those results in-game.</p>



<p>I can’t fault the Razer Raiju V3 Pro controller, and that’s rare for me when it comes to reviewing peripherals.</p>

            <guid>1368007</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A rot that started long ago in the Jade Abbey has surged, making a final push, seeking to taint the sacred water of the Everspring. One of its former keepers has gathered a group to stop this from happening, hoping to save the entire realm from falling entirely to the Chaos god Nurgle. <em>Warhammer Quest</em> is back! In this spoiler-free article, we check out the brand new set, <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em>.</p>

<p>We've covered previous editions of <i>Warhammer Quest</i> on the site, including the futuristic <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> iteration, <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/on-tabletop-warhammer-quest-blackstone-fortress" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Quest Blackstone Fortress</a>, and the horror-filled streets of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-quest-cursed-city-preview" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Quest Cursed City</a>.</p>




<h2>What's the Quest?</h2>

<p>The original <i>Warhammer Quest </i>hit tabletops in 1995, following the earlier success of <em>HeroQuest</em>, which has also seen a recent revival. Games Workshop brought <em>Warhammer Quest</em> back in 2016, and since then, we've seen new iterations, using the same concept of players cooperatively exploring and conquering a dungeon. Each edition has had variations in rules and mechanics, along with a brand-new setting for each.</p>

<p>This time, <em>Warhammer Quest</em> continues to explore the depths of the <em>Age of Sigmar</em> setting, moving away from the snowy, cramped, and death-filled streets of Ulfenkarn to Ghyran, the realm of life, and the Jade Abbey, the source of the powerful waters of the Everspring, for which Nurlge, the plague god, has set his sights.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-3.jpg?itok=xg-rblNb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-3.jpg?itok=ElU6mTxL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I absolutely love the background for <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em>. Gelgus Pust, a Chaos Champion of Nurgle, has sought to control the Everspring ever since he betrayed his order. Once a senior in the Jade Abbey, his lust for power corrupted him, and he brought others with him in a revolt that nearly captured the Everspring. To stop him, the Everqueen flooded the Jade Abbey, wiping out attackers and defenders alike, but keeping the Everspring from falling into the Chaos God's hands.</p>

<p>Pust has since been on a ruthless campaign, steadily weakening the defences of the Jade Abbey over centuries until he's now in a position to strike. But there are heroes willing to risk it all to stop him. Gathered by Inara Sion, a former colleague of Gelgus and the last surviving member of the Jade Circle, tasked with defending the Everspring. The battle between Pust and Inara, finally coming to settle the score after centuries, sets the stage for the adventure.</p>

<p><em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> has several mechanical changes from previous editions. The first is the inclusion of a map book, which takes the place of the map tiles from previous editions. This takes away the ability to randomly generate maps and instead fixes maps to those available in the map book. There is still variety to be found, and different missions, enemies, and map placement can make the same map into an entirely new experience. The benefit of the map book is that it speeds up setup time to almost nothing, as you only have to find the map page of the quest card, set up the enemies, heroes, and items, and you're ready to play. In a game that can serve as an entry game into the wider <em>Warhammer</em> and <em>Age of Sigmar</em> settings, this change is very welcome and lets you focus on the core delivery, rather than spending time building a map out of tiles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-6.jpg?itok=6DygxOqc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-6.jpg?itok=8fs4yIAY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each characters turn in&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater </em>is driven by actions cards.</figcaption></figure><p>The second noticeable mechanical change is that actions are now cards. Each hero starts with 3 core action cards, move, attack, and aid, and each has the dual effect of letting you complete the action and providing the energy to complete other actions. Each time you use an action card, you need to expend other action cards with enough energy to complete the action, which can include the action you are completing.</p>

<p>So you can exhaust the aid card to move, then exhaust the move card to move, and then the attack card to attack, or use all 3 to attack, or any combination thereof. Characters can also gain other action cards, increasing their available energy for the turn, and actions not on cards can also be taken with special quest actions, or individual character actions detailed on their character card. This mechanic will be familiar to those who've played <em>Warhammer Quest The Adventure Card Game</em>, and was one of my favorite mechanics from the game.</p>

<p>I've always loved the action card mechanic, it makes it super clear what you can do each turn and keeps everything really clean visually, especially as you gain actions that provide energy. It really feels like leveling up your hero as they can complete more each turn. The action mechanics themselves are also really straightforward, with the number of dice to roll in an attack listed, and the number you need to roll as well. Enemies block attacks equal to their defence value, which keeps combat really quick.</p>

It takes away from the fixed puzzle nature of some games, where you know if you move here, you can attack or take this action. The randomness of possibly having to take 2 move actions to get to where you need to be, or having a great dice roll and getting there in 1 move, feels very heroic. It also feels very in keeping with regular board games, where your movement is usually based on a dice roll. The exception to this is Drolf, the Duardin, who has a fixed move. This feels very thematic and sets Drolf out with the fixed, determined nature of the Duardin, but also their restriction on speed.</p>

<p>Enemies are controlled with custom dice that give them a simple series of actions they carry out when activated, with stronger enemies taking multiple actions as they scale up. Their movement and attacks feel purposeful, but are quick and simple enough that you get to focus on the heroes, rather than getting bogged down in the minutia of individual swarms of enemies.</p>

<p><em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> features 4 heroes initially, and 3 unlockable heroes that you'll see on the box of the game, and as you put the miniatures together for the set. We'll leave you to discover the 3 unlockable heroes, but the 4 core heroes are:</p>

<ul><li>Edmark Valoran, known as the Manticore Knight, has the best defense of the heroes and has a chance to damage adjacent enemies when he blocks their hits. He starts the game with the Shield of the Manticore, which can be used to automatically block a hit before a saving throw.</li>
	<li>Bren Tylis, the Renegade Saint, gets to choose each round to reroll her move, attack, or save rolls. It's a pretty powerful ability, giving you a better chance to achieve what you need to that round. Bren starts the game with the Relics of the Past equipment card, which can be used when you discard a reward card to stop it from being discarded on a 5+, which is great for keeping some single-use items around.</li>
	<li>Inara Sion, the Cleansing Blade, has a poor defence, but a great ranged attack to keep her&nbsp;away from enemies. They also have a Barrier of Water ability on their card, which can be used like the core abilities to block hexes to enemies, and make lethal hexes safe for the heroes. Their Blade of Flowing Water equipment also lets her&nbsp;move the counter for free, without having to power the ability.</li>
	<li>Drolf Ironhead, the Grizzled Explorer, has a fixed movement, a ranged attack, and can ignore lethal hexes by sprinting through them (by spending more energy on the move card to move 6 hexes instead of the standard movement). They come equipped with the Ranger's Kit, which can let them move through blocked hexes, which is amazing for last-minute objective saves or flanking an enemy who might have your party pinned.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-5.jpg?itok=ZqPwGYau 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-5.jpg?itok=eopu3qqp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each of the 3&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> acts in the campaign are driven by the act cards. Cleanse the Spawn Pit is used as the tutorial for your first game.</figcaption></figure><h2>Standing Against The Rot</h2>

<p>The <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> campaign consists of 3 acts, and each act is made up of 15 act cards (drawn randomly from 32 for each act). Each act has a final boss (of which there are 3 possible scenarios to face them in), and another 14 cards made up of encounters, events, and rest sites.</p>

<p>This means that you could play the game through all 3 acts, deliberately using different cards for each play-through, and have 2 unique play-throughs with still a spare card and an extra boss scenario, but the randomisation element will keep each play-through unique, or if you just want a one-off game, you can use any of the acts in skirmish mode.</p>

<p>Playing through the campaign first, before embarking on skirmish mode, is worthwhile, as you unlock extra characters and rewards as you do, and it avoids spoilers in skirmish mode, should you wish to play through the entire campaign.</p>

<p>Each encounter is pretty fast to play through, and you can get through a few in an evening, or half an act if you're lucky with event and rest site cards. This is helped by the quick setup for each encounter, letting you progress onto the next quickly. There are also several storage boxes for the heroes and acts, to keep the cards tidy in the box, and help you remember where you got to if you do have to pack away before finishing the campaign.</p>

Gelgus Pust!</figcaption></figure><h2>Warhammer Quest Darkwater Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>I had an absolute blast with<i> Warhammer Quest Darkwater.</i> I started my journey into miniatures gaming with <em>Heroquest</em> in the early '90s,&nbsp;and I played the original <em>Warhammer Quest</em> on release a few years later, so there's always been a bit of nostalgia here for me. Having also played the last 2 iterations, <em>Blackstone Fortress</em> and <em>Cursed City</em>, and reviewing them here on the site, this has been one of my favourite dungeon crawler games to date. The setting is perfect, and it captures the oppressive rot nature of Nurgle, whilst still being accessible for gamers who might be having their first experience here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Set up is fast, and games have a great flow with straightforward AI control for the enemies. The heroes feel unique, and the campaign is fast-flowing, but long enough to give it a great sense of depth. Repeat plays are also possible with the number of act cards across the 3 acts, and randomising them when generating the campaign. Previous <em>Warhammer Quest</em> editions got multiple expansions, and I hope that we see that here for <em>Darkwater</em> too.</p>

<hr>



<h3 id="h-custom-gamer-tag-neon-sign">Custom Gamer Tag Neon Sign</h3>

<p>Anyone looking to jazz up their streaming set up should definitely take a look at the Custom Gamer Tag Neon Sign, which lights up the room and simultaneously acts as promotion for their brand.

<hr>



<h3 id="h-the-ultimate-streamer-s-log-book">The Ultimate Streamer’s Log Book</h3>

<p>Keeping ideas fresh is a tough challenge for any streamer or content creator, and finding the right approach can be tricky. That’s where The Ultimate Streamer’s Log Book comes in handy, providing over 100 stream challenges to help you stay organized and come up with fresh approaches.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-kdd-headset-stand-with-charging-station">KDD Headset Stand With Charging Station</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Any streamer or content creator needs to ensure they have all their required equipment fully charged and ready to go, which is where the KDD Headset Stand comes in perfectly. Equipped with 2 USB and 1 type-C charging port, it can be used to charge smartphones, tablets, headphones, controllers, and more, making it among the best gifts for streamers.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-overhead-camera-mount-with-ring-light">Overhead Camera Mount with Ring Light</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re thinking of doing top-down content, like pack openings or drawings, an overhead camera with a light is a must-have, and this has both in one. Compatible with iPhone and Logitech webcams, among others, this camera mount attaches to the desk and provides everything you need for a quick set-up.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-pqrqp-3-in-1-wireless-lavalier-microphone">PQRQP 3-in-1 Wireless Lavalier Microphone</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Recording content on the go means you should have a clippable microphone to block out background noise and focus on exactly the source you want, and this 3-in-1 microphone presents an affordable option. Compatible with iPhone, Android, cameras, and more, it’s the perfect tool for content creating on the go.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-frigidaire-retro-9-can-personal-fridge">Frigidaire Retro 9-Can Personal Fridge</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Long sessions on stream or editing content can be taxing, and you don’t want to have to keep on going in and out for refreshments. A mini fridge on hand is therefore advised, and the Frigidaire Retro 9-Can Personal Fridge has enough room to keep you going in a long stint, and a nice design to boot.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-elgato-prompter">Elgato Prompter</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Keeping engaged with chat is crucial for any live streamer or content creator, but you don’t want to crank your neck turning your head to different monitors. The Elgato prompter counters that, showing a live feed of chat to interact with, or, if recording content, showing a script to follow.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-neewer-collapsible-backdrop">Neewer Collapsible Backdrop</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A green screen might not be an immediate necessity but, once you start using it, you’ll never look the other way again. The Neewer Collapsible Backdrop has both green and blue screen, coming double-sided, and is easy to put up and store, all available for a decent price.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-elgato-4k-s-external-capture-card">Elgato 4K S External Capture Card</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A capture card is one of the most important items for any streamer or content creators, as it quickly captures all content from an external source, like a console, and connects it to PC and your stream. Without it, you’ll be limited on your options when streaming, and it should be one of the first things you pick up when you get started.</p>
