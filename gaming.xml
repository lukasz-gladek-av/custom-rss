            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It took me a long time to become even halfway decent at <em>Forestrike</em>. The martial arts action game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252953/olija-game-review-nintendo-switch-steam-pc-ps4-xbox">from <em>Olija</em> developer Skeleton Crew</a>, has a unique twist in that it lets you see what will happen in most battles and then practice your strategy accordingly. It turns the act of combat into a type of puzzle game, but one that still requires fast reflexes and precision decision-making to be successful. And it has successfully turned me into a solid fighter — at least in the realm of a pixelated video game.</p><p>You play as a martial arts student named Yu, who, despite being relatively green, is tasked with ridding his homeland of an evil empire. To do this, you mostly travel across the landscape beating up bad guys. <em>Forestrike </em>has a roguelite structure, meaning that each time you play the levels and scenarios change slightly, and also that you’re going to lose a lot. But that losing is also inherent to the premise: This is a game about constantly learning. Along the way you’re accompanied by various martial arts masters who will teach you new techniques to aid in your quest.</p><p>Central to all of this is an ability known as foresight. In essence, this lets you preview a battle before you go in for the real thing. It’s like a practice run; you can see how things will play out and practice your strategy in advance. Battles in <em>Forestrike</em> are fast, usually lasting just a few seconds, but like a great martial arts movie, they involve a carefully orchestrated series of movements. Foresight lets you figure out exactly how you want to proceed before you’re actually in danger.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that <em>Forestrike</em> is easy. Early on, I got my ass kicked regularly. Even when you know exactly when you should dodge, or pick up a weapon, or use a slow but powerful kick, it’s still a challenge to nail it when it counts, no matter how much you train. The game also constantly throws different challenges at you; sometimes you can only use foresight a limited number of times in a battle, other times not at all.</p><p>Foresight is not a crutch to make the game less challenging, but more of a tool to sharpen your skills. It’s like tossing some warm-up shots before an actual basketball game. Those challenges help keep the game fresh even as many of the battles can be pretty similar. The same goes for its structure, which lets you regularly unlock new skills for each run and eventually meet new martial arts masters who will each teach you new techniques, giving you even more options.</p><p>Eventually, things started to click. And when you do eventually pull off a flawless run through a big group of enemies it feels <em>incredible</em>, like you’re really in a classic action movie, pulling the strings. But those few seconds of perfection involve a whole lot of practice.</p><p><sub>Forestrike <em>is available now on Steam, and is “coming soon” to the Nintendo Switch.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/826331/forestrike-review-nintendo-switch-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-goes-hard-on-watch-ultra-2-now-selling-at-new-all-time-low-for-black-friday-day-2-2000646455</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-goes-hard-on-watch-ultra-2-now-selling-at-new-all-time-low-for-black-friday-day-2.1361626/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For a long, long time, the premium adventure watch market was dominated by Garmin and Suunto, but then Apple came to the party with the <em>Ultra</em> series and hasn’t looked back since. The <strong>Apple Watch Ultra 2 competes directly with flagship models from both brands</strong>&nbsp;and adds in smartphone integration that those dedicated sports watches just can’t match.</p>
<p>Apple keeps strict pricing on their own website and in Apple Stores, so it’s a complete waste of your time checking there for deals. But Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5821/"> just dropped the Ultra 2 to $599 for Black Friday, down from $799, which marks a record low and saves you $200 on Apple’s most rugged wearable</a>. This 25% discount is the deepest cut this watch has ever seen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5821/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Titanium Construction Survives Everything You Throw at It</h2>
<p>A <strong>49mm case made of titanium</strong> resists corrosion and impacts that would destroy aluminum watches within months of serious outdoor use. The sapphire front crystal laughs at scratches regular glass couldn’t survive, maintaining clarity through years of adventure abuse. Verification through military standard MIL-STD 810H testing shows the watch handles extreme temperatures, shocks, and conditions that exceed those most users ever encounter. <strong>Water resistance reaches a depth of 100 meters</strong>, enabling serious diving alongside swimming and water sports.</p>
<p>The 49mm size provides space for a bigger battery and a more luminous display than standard Apple Watch models have. The <strong>Always-On Retina display peaks at 3000 nits of brightness</strong>, and remains readable under direct sunlight where other screens totally wash out. The larger Digital Crown and customisable Action button work with gloves on, as well as in cold weather where touch-only controls fail.</p>



<p>Precision<strong> dual-frequency GPS</strong> delivers accuracy that serious athletes and navigators require. By utilizing both L1 and L5 satellite frequencies, the system reduces errors from signal reflection off buildings and terrain. The recorded routes of your runs better match the actual paths you run, rather than placing you directly through buildings or zigzagging all over.</p>
<p>The running features compete directly with dedicated running watches from Garmin and Coros. Advanced metrics track running form, including ground contact time, vertical oscillation, and stride length. Automatic track detection senses when you’re running on a standard track and makes adjustments accordingly. Support for custom workouts accommodates structured training, like warmups, intervals, recovery periods, and cooldowns. Training load analysis shows how your workouts are affecting your body over time to help you avoid overtraining.</p>



<p><strong>Cellular connectivity lets you leave your iPhone behind</strong> while maintaining communication capabilities. You call, text, stream music, get directions, and access apps without your phone nearby. That sense of freedom completely changes outdoor activities where carrying a phone would add bulk or create risk. Emergency SOS works anywhere with cellular coverage, providing safety during solo adventures.</p>
<p>That means <strong>battery life reaches 36 hours of normal use with the Always-On display active</strong>, extending to 72 hours of runtime in Low Power Mode for multi-day adventures. This is considerably beyond the typical Apple Watch models and closer to what dedicated adventure watches can manage. The extended battery life makes the Ultra 2 a practical choice for ultra-long hikes, ultra-marathons and multi-day trips in general.</p>
<p>Health monitoring includes tracking heart rate, the measurement of blood oxygen, ECG capability, and sleep analysis. Fall detection and crash detection provide automatic emergency alerts in case of accidents. Temperature sensing tracks overnight variations useful for cycle tracking and illness detection. All of these features run continuously without affecting battery life much.</p>
<p>At $599, you’re getting Apple’s flagship adventure watch with titanium construction and precision GPS for 25% off its standard price. Comparable Garmin watches cost between $800-1000 without the smartphone integration that Apple provides.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-swallows-its-pride-macbook-air-falls-to-all-time-low-and-goes-2x-cheaper-than-pro-2000646450</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-swallows-its-pride-macbook-air-falls-to-all-time-low-and-goes-2x-cheaper-than-pro.1361614/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>MacBook Pro models start at $1,599 which puts Apple’s professional laptops out of reach for many buyers who want quality computing without spending a fortune. The MacBook Air with M4 chip delivers similar performance for everyday tasks at literally half the cost of its Pro sibling.</p>
<p>Apple never discounts products on their own website or in Apple Stores, and keeps strict pricing that forces deal hunters toward third-party retailers. Amazon dropped this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">2025 MacBook Air (256GB model) to $749 for Black Friday, down from $999</a>, and marks a record low that <strong>already moved over 10,000 units this month</strong>. This 25% discount represents the kind of Apple savings you simply won’t find anywhere else.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pro-Level Performance in Air Package</h2>
<p>Housing the most recent Apple silicon architecture,<strong> the M4 processor in the MacBook Air unleashes performance</strong> that increasingly blurs the line separating Air and Pro notebooks. The chip handles demanding tasks like video editing, photo manipulation, and software development without the thermal throttling that plagued Intel MacBooks. The<strong> unified memory architecture means the CPU and GPU can share the same 16GB pool efficiently</strong>, and sidestep the bottlenecks traditional systems experience. This level of performance handles professional workflows smoothly, which the previous generations of Air just couldn’t manage well.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Intelligence integration</strong> comes built into this M4 MacBook, bringing AI capabilities directly into the operating system. The system helps with writing tasks, image generation, and intelligent assistance without requiring cloud processing for many features. The M4’s Neural Engine processes AI workloads locally and keeps your data private while delivering fast results.</p>



<p>It features a<strong> 13.6-inch Liquid Retina Display with vibrant colors and sharp text</strong> for extended work sessions comfortable. This display features P3 wide color gamut for accurate color reproduction that photographers and designers require. This <strong>system comes with 500 nits of brightness</strong> for clear visibility in bright environments without struggling to see content. Bezels remain thin from all sides to retain maximum screen space within the compact chassis.</p>



<p>It’s a 12MP <em>Center Stage</em> camera that provides clear video calls with a<strong>utomatic framing that keeps you centered as you move</strong>. The camera tracks your position and adjusts the frame with optimal composition during video conferencing. That will work across FaceTime, Zoom, and other video applications without manually having to change anything.</p>
<p>Fanless design means <strong>this MacBook runs in complete silence, no matter the workload</strong>. The M4 chip creates such minimal heat that passive cooling takes over the thermal management without mechanical movement. You work in quiet environments such as libraries or late-night sessions without disturbing anyone with the fan noise. This silence is a real advantage compared to Pro models that immediately fire up their fans when doing resource-intensive work.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery life reaches 18 hours of video playback or about 12 hours of typical mixed use</strong>. You can go through a whole day without searching for outlets or managing power settings. This is due to the M4 chip architecture, which brings performance with power-sipping efficiency.</p>
<p>We have Apple’s latest MacBook with an M4 chip and 16GB RAM for $749, which is a straight 25% discount off the original price and makes it half as expensive as entry-level models of the MacBook Pro. For Black Friday, this sale makes current-generation Apple Silicon accessible without compromise or having to settle for older models.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-goes-nuclear-on-9100-pro-ssd-pricing-all-sizes-are-selling-for-a-new-all-time-low-2000646445</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-goes-nuclear-on-9100-pro-ssd-pricing-all-sizes-are-selling-for-a-new-all-time-low.1361611/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Storage speed dictates how fast your entire computer feels, from boot times to application launches to game loading. The<strong> Samsung 9100 PRO</strong> is the cutting edge of SSD technology and harnesses <strong>PCIe 5.0</strong> to deliver double the read speeds of previous generation drives.</p>
<p>This kind of performance transforms workflows for gamers, content creators and even professionals running AI workloads that require instant data access. Amazon slashes prices on all three capacities: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/">the 1TB dropped from $199 to $134</a>, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/">2TB dropped from $279 to $219</a>, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/">the 4TB dropped from $469 to $369</a>. That means <strong>every capacity hits record low pricing</strong> that makes next-generation storage genuinely accessible.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>14,700 MB/s Read Speed Removes Every Bottleneck</h2>
<p>The resulting sequential <strong>read speed of 14,700 MB/s nearly doubles what the PCIe 4.0 drives</strong> offer and revolutionizes how fast data navigates your system. Windows boots in seconds, applications launch in real-time and large file transfers take place faster than it can process what’s going on. Games with DirectStorage support can load levels in moments rather than the loading screens that define current gaming experiences. What’s more, it actually <strong>far exceeds what most users can currently saturate</strong>&nbsp;which truly means the drive will stay relevant as software catches up to the hardware capability.</p>
<p>The <strong>sequential write speeds match the impressive read performance</strong>, handling large file creation and modifications without slowdowns like cheaper drives experience. To video editors working with 8K footage, timeline scrubbing remains responsive, while exports complete in a fraction of the time. For content creators moving huge project files around between drives, transfers finish almost instantly.</p>



<p>The PCIe 5.0 x4 interface leverages four lanes of the latest PCIe standard to achieve these speeds on a compatible motherboard. Intel 13th and 14th generation platforms, along with AMD Ryzen 7000 series, support PCIe 5.0 natively. The M.2 2280 form factor fits standard slots without adapters or special mounting requirements. Older PCIe 4.0 systems run this drive at reduced speeds, still delivering excellent performance while leaving upgrade headroom when you eventually update your platform.</p>



<p><strong>Samsung’s thermal solution is also great and</strong> manages the heat generated by high-speed operation. Included in both the controller and NAND packages are heat spreaders for dissipating thermal energy during sustained transfers. Additional thermal management is provided by systems with dedicated M.2 heatsinks or motherboard cooling solutions.</p>
<p>With this drive,<strong> AI computing workloads benefit considerably from its speed characteristics</strong>. Machine learning models load their training data much faster, and a lesser time is spent waiting for storage. Local AI inference runs more responsively when the models stream from the high-speed storage. In fact, the specifications target AI computing aside from gaming and professional workstations.</p>
<p>At these Black Friday prices, Samsung’s flagship PCIe 5.0 SSD becomes within reach at all capacities. The $134 1TB offers 33% savings, bringing next-gen speed to budget builds. The best value for enthusiasts looking for significant capacity with maximum performance is the $219 2TB. The $369 4TB offers premium storage to pros and power users needing both speed and space.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/i-wish-these-tales-games-would-have-been-remastered-before-tales-of-berseria/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>With the Tales series Remaster Project, Bandai Namco is bringing back older entries in the series to modern consoles and PC, allowing more users to enjoy some solid JRPGs such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-vesperia-definitive-edition/">Tales of Vesperia</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-review-the-power-of-friendship-enhanced-and-improved/">Tales of Graces f</a>, whose action-oriented combat systems continue to be among the best in the genre.</p>



<p>Series producer Yusuke Tomizawa recently confirmed that<a href="https://wccftech.com/bandai-namcos-tales-series-has-a-lot-brewing-but-the-most-interesting-will-take-a-while-to-show/"> more remasters are planned</a>, shortly before the release of Tales of Xillia Remastered last month. He promised the next announcement would follow the October 2025 release. That promised announcement, Tales of Berseria Remastered for PC, PS5, Xbox Series, and Switch, has now arrived, to the disappointment of many fans, myself included.</p>



<p>As you may have noticed if you visit Wccftech daily, I didn't cover the announcement earlier this week, despite being a massive fan of the series. I was so disappointed by it that I didn't want my negative feelings to show in my report, because <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-berseria-review-tale/">Tales of Berseria is objectively one of the best entries in the series</a> and one that I thoroughly enjoyed, having played it for over 200 hours across the Japanese PlayStation 4 release and the global Steam release.</p>



<p>The game definitely deserves these new quality of life updates, including early access to the Grade Shop, destination icons, and the ability to toggle encounters. However, since the original released just in 2016 and is easily playable on other modern systems, a simple Nintendo Switch port would have served the same purpose.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Still, there are a few other Tales games that I wish Bandai Namco would have remastered before Tales of Berseria, to help the franchise stay relevant during its prolonged hiatus since the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-arise-keeping-the-flame-alive/">Tales of Arise</a> in 2022.</p>



<h2 id="h-tales-of-hearts-r">Tales of Hearts R</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Tales of Hearts R doesn't deserve to remain stuck on PlayStation Vita</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although Tales of Hearts R was launched in 2014, only two years before Tales of Berseria, the game has a major issue that its successor does not: availability. Having been released exclusively on the PlayStation Vita, one of Sony's less successful gaming systems, very few players had the opportunity to experience Kor Meteor and his friends' journey across the world of Organica. With the very real possibility that the Vita digital store may eventually go offline, the game's access could become even more limited.</p>



<p>It would be a massive shame if Tales of Hearts R never gets remastered. Not only are the story and characters quite enjoyable, tied together by a mineral-based theme that suits the world rather well, but the combat system is, to date, one of the best 3D renditions of the series' Linear Motion Battle System, granting players the chance of performing some cool, intricate combos without being overly broken with the Chase Link system. Even better, Tales of Hearts R solved the recurring issue of unbalanced boss fights by introducing a combo-breaking mechanic for all enemies, which can be countered by the players with a timed button press, allowing expert players to keep up the pressure. All this, combined with the unique fighting styles of all playable characters, makes Tales of Hearts R a joy to play for action game fans.</p>

<h2 id="h-tales-of-the-abyss">Tales of the Abyss</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>While Tales of the Abyss would deserve a remake in my opinion, a remaster would be very welcome</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tales of the Abyss, much like Tales of Hearts R, has an availability issue that's made even worse by the fact that neither the original PS2 release nor the Nintendo 3DS ports are available for purchase digitally, forcing players to track down physical copies of the game, which can be both costly and challenging, or rely on emulation. This, coupled with the great story and characters and its enduring popularity among fans, would have made a remaster of the game far more preferable than Tales of Berseria Remastered (though something could already be brewing, judging from <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.facebook.com/tales/posts/pfbid0AgTrWaitqVq48nF11pma2sKktjLkiUc462WG4hoTEqyto7fFg7iJPoJX4T9XeSZUl">a new image Bandai Namco shared on social media</a>).</p>



<p>While a remaster would quickly bring one of the series' best entries to a wider audience, I would personally prefer a full remake. Luke's compelling story and charming companions are exceptional, but some gameplay elements feel a little dated. Specifically, the combat system feels restrictive due to its reliance on the old Artes trees, forcing players to exploit glitches to get creative. Additionally, the overtuned Free Run mechanics make it too easy to negate powerful enemy attacks.</p>

</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-tales-of-rebirth">Tales of Rebirth</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Tales of Rebirth is a challenging game that takes a slightly different direction from the rest of the series in terms of combat</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While Tales of Hearts R and Tales of the Abyss have been released in the West at some point, a few older entries in the series haven't, at least not officially. Among them is Tales of Rebirth, which is not only the last all-original mainline 2D entry in the series, but an excellent game in its own right that was made<a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-rebirth-english-patch-download/"> fully playable in English for the first time only last year.</a></p>



<p>While Veigue's story can be hit-and-miss (and involuntarily hilarious) sometimes, the game's battle system is one of the most articulate combat systems in the history of the series, featuring some very interesting mechanics such as battlefields being divided in three different planes instead of one and the Rage mechanics which can be manipulated on the fly to improve either offensive and defensive capabilities, making for a very dynamic system that makes battles engaging for its entire duration. The ability to enhance Artes with unique skills is the cherry on top of a combat system that is far from being the flashiest in the series, but is one of the most interesting nonetheless, attempting and succeeding at addressing the button-mashing criticism sometimes addressed to the series as a whole.</p>

<p>With Tales of Xillia Remastered already having been released, remastering Tales of Xillia 2 next would have been a given. Not only is the game already localized, it uses the same engine as its predecessor, and it's generally, in my opinion, a much better game, successfully addressing many of its criticisms, such as the empty fields that replaced a classic world map, pacing, and lack of optional content.</p>



<p>Although it recycles much of Tales of Xillia's locations, Tales of Xillia 2 succeeds at making the second venture through the united world of Rieze Maxia and Elympyos engaging with a very personal story, which is elevated by some of the dark implications of Ludger's alternate realities eradication. Things do get a little confusing at times, as it usually happens when multiple dimensions are involved, but ultimately, Tales of Xillia 2's story and main characters, amazing combat system, and stellar soundtrack make it a game worth experiencing. Hopefully, it won't take long for the<a href="https://wccftech.com/bandai-namcos-tales-series-has-a-lot-brewing-but-the-most-interesting-will-take-a-while-to-show/"> already confirmed remaster to come out.</a></p>

<figure><figcaption><em>Tales of Destiny Director's Cut is still today the best entry in the Tales series that most fans in the West haven't played</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While I haven't purposelly ranked which Tales game I would have liked to see remastered before Tales of Berseria on purpose since I would love to see all of them on modern consoles and PC, if I only had to chose one, it would be Tales of Destiny Director's Cut, and not only because the original PSX release was the first entry in the series I played, or because I have played the game for close to 500 hours back in the day when I had all the time in the world and loved every second of it.</p>



<p>Seventeen years after its release, the remake of the second entry in the series continues to be, in my opinion, the best Tales game ever released. Everything, from the story, which does a great job of making Stahn's journey both exciting and epic, to the charming cast of characters and gameplay, remains unmatched in the series to this day.</p>



<p>However, if I were to pick only one reason to remaster the game, it would be its combat system. Marking the debut of the Chain Capacity system which has been iterated upon by future entries in the series, the Tales of Destiny Director's Cut rendition of the franchise's Linear Motion Battle System is, simply put, amazing, combining deep strategic thinking with the Weakness system that increases damage when hitting the enemy with an element they are week to, with almost complete combo freedom, doing away with the Artes tree system employed by past games to deliver an extremely deep experience with tons of tech that would even put some traditional fighting games to shame.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Even if we were to ignore the game's quality, remastering Tales of Destiny Director's Cut in the near future would be the best way to get the series out of the slump it has fallen into following the release of Tales of Arise. Although there are surely some technical challenges, such as source code issues and localizing the game in English for the first time, remastering the game ahead of the launch of the next entry in the series would give Western players what feels like a brand-new, excellent title that could revitalize a series that has been stuck on remasters for far too long. And with so many 2D titles finding success nowadays, there's really no reason not to make the game's beautifully detailed sprites shine at higher resolutions.</p>



<p>These are the Tales games I would have loved to see getting the remaster treatment before Tales of Berseria, but there are many other entries in the series still stuck on old consoles. Do you agree with my list, or would you like to see any other entry in the series getting remastered? Let us know in the comments!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Health tracking usually means strapping a bulky smartwatch onto your wrist and then remembering to charge it every few days. The <strong>Oura Ring 4 takes a completely different approach by putting comprehensive health monitoring into a sleek ring</strong> that disappears on your finger. You forget you’re wearing it within minutes which can’t be said about even the smallest smartwatches on the market.</p>
<p>Amazon dropped <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5816/">all colors and sizes to $249 for Black Friday, down from $349</a>, and marks a record low that makes this discreet fitness tracker genuinely accessible. The<strong> 29% discount applies across silver, black, gold, and stealth</strong> finishes in every ring size.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5816/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Finger-Based Sensors</h2>
<p>The position of a ring on your finger gives<strong> cleaner biometric signals</strong> than is possible with wrist-based devices. The arteries in your fingers sit closer to the surface, with less interference from tendons, bones, and movement artifacts. This placement captures heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen levels with improved accuracy compared to the traditional fitness trackers.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep tracking represents the Oura Ring’s greatest strength</strong>: an analysis of your rest in granular detail that actually displays patterns invisible to casual observation. It tracks the stages of sleep, movement, temperature variation, and calculates sleep efficiency scores. When you wake up, you get a detailed picture of how well you actually slept, rather than how many hours you spent in bed.</p>



<p>It takes a variety of health metrics and puts them into one daily number that shows if your body is ready for intense activity, or if you need to recover. <strong>Sleep quality, heart rate variability, body temperature, and recent activity levels</strong> are factored in to give an estimate. A high score would suggest that you can push hard in workouts, while lower scores recommend taking it easy.</p>
<p>Temperature tracking reveals small variations in your body’s baseline that are indicative of various states of health. It is used by women for cycle tracking, where body temperature changes predictably across menstrual phases. The ring spots illness before you feel any symptoms, often showing a rise in temperature a day or two before the worst cold symptoms set in.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life reaches about a week on a single charge,</strong> and dramatically outlasts smartwatches that need daily charging. The wireless charger tops up the ring in about an hour, and you’re even able to charge while working at your desk. That extended runtime means you capture sleep data every night without needing to charge before bed.</p>
<p><strong>Activity tracking counts steps, active calories, and movement</strong> throughout the day. It doesn’t require workout logging, as the ring automatically detects activities and categorizes them accordingly. Heart rate monitoring during exercise shows intensity levels and recovery patterns. The main focus remains on daily activity rather than detailed workout metrics which suits users who want health insights without obsessive exercise tracking.</p>
<p>The <strong>Oura app presents all this data in clean visualizations</strong>, highlighting trends and actionable insights. Daily scores for sleep, readiness, and activity provide easy status checks without the need to deep-dive into charts. The app can identify patterns across weeks and months, showing how changes to lifestyle decisions impact health metrics. Personalized recommendations based on your own data help one improve scores rather than just broad, generic advice. The cost for the subscription model, after the first month is free, is $5.99 a month, which grants access to full features and historical data.</p>
<p>At $249, you’re getting premium health tracking in a form factor that traditional fitness trackers can’t match. Apple Watch and Fitbit devices cost similar amounts, but require wrist real estate and daily charging. This Black Friday pricing opens up the Oura Ring to users who want in-depth health data without the commitment to the wrist.</p>

I don't usually go in for 'relic' effects on anything, but this looked a bit special. It felt artful and novel in a market where neon gamer gear dominates, screaming for attention, and 'cheapening' otherwise decent equipment. The Xbox face button layout, though, meant it wasn't specifically relevant to Switch owners.</p>
<p>Fast-forward several months, and there's <a href="https://www.pbtails.com/products/550-spyder-crush-controller-limited-edition-with-k-silver-tmr-joysticks">a new model</a> bearing Nintendo's classic button layout. Retailing for $79.99, this is the firm's familiar Crush pad but with '50s automotive stylings - specifically, it's celebrating the 70th anniversary of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_550">Porsche 550 Spyder</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hqyntv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>There's no official licensing on this tribute, but the finish is beautiful, if you're into that sort of thing. The red light strip along the bottom edge (you can change the colour - more on that later) looks like a tail light, while the decals and details across the face, plus the silver paint job and the 'grille', faux-number plate, and red strips on the rear, give the feel of a quality piece of retro memorabilia. The burgundy trim of the D-pad and the shoulder buttons add to the classy, retro stylings, too.</p>

<p>Opinion among Team NL is divided — you'll need to be a classic car connoisseur or have a thing for mechanical engineering and retro design — but I love the look and feel. It's a niche aesthetic and the pad won't suit every gaming purpose, but there's a luxuriousness to the finish and the chrome accents that gets my motor running. You feel like you should be playing with leather driving gloves when you're handling this thing (and maybe I did).</p>
<p>In the hands, gloved or otherwise, this Crush pad feels like an old-school Xbox 360 controller, but weightier, and definitely glossier. The metal of the default sticks is just the beginning, and the slickness of the bodywork is probably a dealbreaker if you main games that give you sweaty palms.</p>
<p>Fingerprints were my immediate concern on taking the pad from its black and white case and removing the little foam collars around the sticks, but surprisingly, I haven't found them an issue. I assumed I'd need a microfiber cloth after every session, but it's been fine sitting on the side over the past couple of weeks, despite the dust on my TV shelf and my sticky gamer paws.</p>

<p>A braided USB-A to C cable is included for charging (the claimed 30-hour life feels accurate, although that'll depend on your lighting intensity), plus a dongle for 2.4G wireless connection and plastic/rubber sticks if you want to swap out the zinc alloy pair.</p>
<p>And honestly? If you're into your online shooters or just want to be competitive in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, you'll want to switch the stick covers; channel-hopping in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blippoplus">Blippo+</a> was a dream, a tense shootout in Springfield less so. I had no issue racing in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID</a> or unleashing ninja skills in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a>, but chromed metal just doesn't offer enough grip for split-second, precision inputs.</p>
<p>The sticks themselves are the TMR variety, so power efficient and offering commensurate performance and protection against drift to Hall Effect. Obviously, it'll take a year or two of use to thoroughly test their resilience, but there's nothing to suggest they'll start wandering. They feel robust and responsive.</p>
<p>Changing the sticks involves removing the magnetic faceplate, which can be tricky if you don't have decent nails, but gripping the front housing up around the shoulder buttons while pressing down on the sticks with your thumbs will eventually prise the cover away. Swap out the metal ones, clip the caps into the plastic domes, pop the cover back on, and you're away.</p>

<p>PB sells other faceplates, although it would be weird to buy one of these and then ruin the aesthetic with a clear orange cover. Also worth noting is that the carry case's foam insert holds the two-part plastic sticks only, so you'll need to store the metal ones safely somewhere else.</p>
<p>Removing the chrome ones feels like sacrilege, though, like you've whacked some cheap rims on a vintage Jag. It functions well, with gyro controls, some very nice rumble (the growl it makes when it connects to the console feels, brilliantly, like a revving engine), and pleasingly springy analogue triggers. The D-pad felt fine for a blast through some NSO classics, and the whole controller has a premium-feeling heft to it.</p>
<p>Even the RGB lighting feels somehow sophisticated here. Holding down the 'T' (turbo) button and moving the left stick lets you pick the exact colour of the light strip, while the right stick changes the face and central Home buttons. You can tweak the intensity of the LEDs, too, and I appreciated that it's all there and selectable via the pad itself, no external software needed. You can't buy a lightbulb these days without downloading a bloody app.</p>

<p>Face button lighting presets are selectable, as well: Super Famicom-style is the default, but you've also got PlayStation blue with the customary hues of Sony's shapes, or Xbox green and corresponding button colours. There's also a Dreamcast-style option - at least I think that's what the orange home button and this colour layout are referencing. Obviously, the Nintendo ABYX labelling remains, but it's a neat nod to other platforms.</p>
<p>No clicky microswitches is a big plus, personally; all the face buttons feel nicely responsive without the irritating, cheap-sounding click that makes playing in a quiet space irritating. Toggling the switch on the top edge changes from 'S' (Switch) to 'X' (XInput), and everything functioned exactly as you'd expect when testing with Steam using the included dongle (or wired if you prefer) and iOS over Bluetooth.</p>

<p>While you get added turbo options via the aforementioned button, you don't get NFC reader for amiibo or a 'C' button for easy Switch 2 GameChat access. There's no headphone jack, either, so headset gamers should look elsewhere, and you don't get any fancy back buttons, either.</p>
<p>Another minor quirk is that '-' and '+' here are in the position of the Home and Capture buttons on Nintendo's controller, so prepare for some accidental screenshots at first. Also, you can't wake your Switch 2 up with this - not an issue for me as I always turn it on via the console, but some people really like the convenience of grabbing the pad down the side of the sofa and powering on.</p>
<p>This isn't the kind of pad you'll leave jammed down the side of the sofa, though. For $80, there are functions missing that you might hope to have. If you only get one controller for Switch 2, look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Nintendo's own option</a> or something from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-pro-3-bluetooth-controller-tmr-sticks-and-hall-effect-triggers-elevate-this-switch-2-compatible-pad">8Bitdo</a>. You're really paying for the <em>style</em> here. The Crush 550 needs pairing with a high-backed, leather-studded chair and a glass of Margaux while enjoying a visual novel or a light puzzler. It's <em>not</em> what you want if you're in the midst of a nailbiting deathmatch, perspiring between frantic frags and Dorito downtime. You wouldn't want to rag this into the ground with twitch shooters.</p>
<figure data-uuid="acd25fd22122d"><a title="PB Tails Crush 550 TMR Controller For Switch 1 &amp; 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/acd25fd22122d/pb-tails-crush-550-tmr-controller-for-switch-1-and-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It really depends what kind of gamer you are, then. I find this a pleasure to play with, and I'll be using it whenever a game doesn't demand more performance than it can manage. A classic car is a perfect comparison; this is a fair-weather pad, a beautiful Sunday driver you take out only when conditions allow. If you're in the market for something for the weekend and value-for-money is less important than sophistication, this will look and feel great in your showroom.</p>

              <p>Mini PCs pack full desktop functionality into compact cases that disappear behind monitors or tuck into tight spaces where traditional towers won’t fit. The Mac Mini made this form factor popular, but Apple charges premium prices that put compact computing out of reach for budget-conscious buyers.</p>
<p>The <strong>Kamrui GK3 Plus</strong> provides a similar set of everyday capabilities at a fraction of the cost and performs well at web browsing, office work, streaming and even light photo editing. Amazon dropped <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/">the 16GB/512GB model to $189 for Black Friday, and applying the 10% promo code gets it down to $170 from the usual $229</a>&nbsp;which is a record low that makes desktop computing absurdly affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Intel N95 Processor Handles Daily Tasks With Ease</h2>
<p>The 12th generation <strong>Intel Alder Lake N95 processor</strong> runs at a base frequency of 1.7GHz and boosts up to 3.4GHz when tasks require extra power. Four cores take care of multitasking scenarios like running a browser with multiple tabs while streaming music and working in documents. This chip delivers 35% better CPU performance and 78% improved graphics compared to older N100 and N5105 processors found in competing budget mini PCs.</p>
<p>The integrated Intel UHD Graphics runs 4K video playback, casual photo editing and general desktop work with ease. You will not be editing 4K video timelines or playing demanding games, but everyday computing feels responsive and capable. The graphics output supports three displays simultaneously through dual HDMI ports and a VGA connection.</p>



<p>This 16GB of DDR4 RAM is enough to supply modern computing without slowdowns that plague systems with less capacity. You keep dozens of browser tabs open, run multiple applications side by side, and jump between tasks without waiting for content to reload. This amount of memory matches what many premium laptops include and is well above what budget systems often offer. You notice the difference immediately in daily use, where 8GB systems start to struggle with basic multitasking.</p>
<p>The 512GB M.2 SSD stores your operating system and files on fast solid-state storage. Boot times measure in seconds rather than minutes, and applications launch quickly without the delays hard drives cause. <strong>Storage expands through an additional 2.5-inch drive bay that accepts SSDs up to 2TB</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s compact,<strong> measuring only 5.1 by 5.1 by 1.96 inches</strong> and it is small enough to mount behind a monitor via an included VESA bracket. This mounting option creates a pseudo all-in-one setup that keeps your desk clean and hides the computer from view. The size makes it perfect for entertainment centers where it connects to TVs for streaming without the bulk of a traditional PC. You escape the limited app selection of smart TVs by running a full Windows installation with access to any streaming service or application.</p>
<p>Connectivity includes Gigabit Ethernet for fast wired networking and dual-band WiFi for wireless flexibility. Bluetooth 4.2 interfaces connect wireless peripherals like keyboards, mice, and headphones. The port selection has USB connections for external devices and storage in addition to the video outputs. This connectivity handles typical home and office setups without requiring adapters or hubs.</p>
<p><strong>Windows is ready to go, right out of the box</strong>.</p>
<p>At $170 with the promo code, you’re getting a complete desktop computer with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD for less than most people spend on accessories. Performance won’t be of the same caliber as Apple Silicon, but general computing tasks run smoothly without the premium price tag.</p>

              <p>Nintendo has dominated portable gaming with the Switch 2, but Sony finally offers a compelling alternative for PlayStation owners who want their games on the go. The company built an empire around the PS5 as a living room powerhouse and the <strong>PS Portal extends that experience beyond the couch and into your hands</strong>.</p>
<p>This device <strong>streams your entire PS5 library to a beautiful 8-inch screen</strong>, and lets you play God of War or Spider-Man anywhere in your home or via cloud gaming on the move. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/">dropped it to $179 for Black Friday, down from $199</a>. That’s a record low, one which already moved over 8,000 units and counting.</p>

<h2>PS5 Games to Your Hands</h2>
<p>The <strong>full HD 1080p display stretches across 8 inches of screen</strong> real estate, creating an immersive portable gaming experience. You see game details clearly with vibrant colors and sharp text, making even busy action sequences easy to keep track of. Screen brightness handles a wide range of lighting conditions, from dimly lit bedrooms to bright living rooms.</p>
<p>The<strong> 60fps capability</strong> ensures smooth gameplay that matches what you experience on your TV. Frame rates stay locked during intense action sequences, maintaining the responsive feel that PS5 games deliver on the console itself. The visual quality impresses given the streaming nature of the device, with minimal compression artifacts during stable WiFi connections.</p>



<p><em>Remote Play</em> <strong>connects directly to your PS5 console over WiFi</strong>, and streams games installed on your system to the portable device. You play your whole digital and disc library without buying games a second time or waiting for separate downloads. The PS5 does all the processing while the Portal displays the video output and transmits your controller inputs back. The upside of this is that you get complete PS5 graphics instead of downgraded portable versions.</p>
<p>The <strong>cloud streaming through Playstation Plus Premium</strong> unlocks gaming without needing your PS5 powered on: you access hundreds of titles from the Game Catalog and Classics Catalog streamed directly to the device. Select PS5 games from your digital library stream sans downloads, affording instant access to big titles wherever decent internet is found.</p>



<p>The<strong> features of the DualSense controller integrate</strong> directly into the Portal’s design: haptic feedback and adaptive triggers are built into the grips. You feel immersive sensations, from terrain textures to weapon recoil, the same as the standard PS5 controller. A familiar button layout means PlayStation players don’t need an adjustment period. The ergonomic design spreads the weight comfortably during long play sessions.</p>
<p>Tempest 3D AudioTech provides for spatial sound through the headphone jack or wirelessly via Playstation Link compatible devices. You really hear enemies coming from specific directions and environmental audio placed precisely in three-dimensional space. This audio quality adds a layer of immersion that most portable gaming devices lack. The experience approaches what you’d get through a proper home theater setup, compressed into a personal audio bubble.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life reaches several hours</strong> of continuous play and sees you through extended gaming sessions without the need for a charge. USB-C charging makes use of standard cables you already own, ensuring that topping up from portable batteries or wall chargers is a breeze. The device goes into sleep mode fast when you pause a game to conserve battery life for when you return.</p>
<p>At $179, you’re getting a premium portable streaming device with DualSense features and an 8-inch display for 10% off. The Switch 2 costs significantly more while running native games at lower graphical fidelity than streamed PS5 titles.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has announced "Teammates", an "AI experiment to change the game" and "deepen the player experience".</p>
<p>The developer/publisher said the project is "more than just talk" and will add "depth to gameplay by going beyond AI chatbots and turning NPCs into real teammates" as you play a first-person shooter.</p>
<p>The reveal comes after Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot told investors yesterday that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-believes-generative-ai-is-as-big-a-revolution-for-games-as-the-shift-to-3d-as-tech-is-embraced-company-wide">generative AI has been integrated across the entire company</a>, calling it a "revolution" for video games as big as the shift from 2D to 3D.</p>

<p>"First and foremost, Teammates is an experimental research project, albeit a playable one," Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/3mWlITIuWuu0MoVuR6o8ps">explained</a>. "Built around the mechanics of a first-person shooter, players take on the role of a member of the resistance in a dystopian future, tasked with moving through an enemy base to locate five missing members of their team.</p><p>"In the short playable level, players must recover the final memories of those who were sent in previously to discover their fates, while fending off squads of enemies along their path. Besides the AI voice assistant – Jaspar – the player is accompanied by two NPC squad members – Pablo and Sofia – also featuring the new advanced capabilities."</p>
<p>AI assistant Jaspar can highlight enemies or objects, provide story and lore details, alter game settings "on the fly", or even pause the game, all through simple and natural vocal instructions.</p>
<p>"But more than this, he is a dynamic and responsive character within the story," the company added. "The underlying systems can process the information available within the Teammates experiment’s environment, and contextual cues, interpreting and adapting to the player’s vocal input and actions."</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Today we’re unveiling Teammates, an AI-driven research project exploring how new tech can deepen the player experience.</p><p>More than just talk, this brand-new experiment adds depth to gameplay by going beyond AI chatbots and turning NPCs into real teammates. Find out more:… <a href="https://t.co/SyISwjJ5af">pic.twitter.com/SyISwjJ5af</a></p></div>— Ubisoft (@Ubisoft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1991930899252810021?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>

<p>You can also directly command - or "chat with" - your NPC teammates, Sofia and Pablo.</p>
<p>"Our early experiments showed players were quickly connecting with the AI-driven NPCs and the voice assistant concept," director of gameplay GenAI Xavier Manzanares added.</p>
<p>"Jaspar was helping players when they got lost or weren’t sure what to do, he could access menus and settings, tell players more about the world and the story. We really started to like Jaspar and saw how a system like this could be interesting for many different kinds of games."</p><p>“This technology opens doors to new, personalised experiences,” added data &amp; AI director Rémi Labory. “Player input shapes character reactions in real time, something traditional development can’t achieve. We’re also delivering a full pipeline, with the experience taking players from onboarding to debrief, which is a first.”</p>
<p>The team said it was "aware of the criticisms around AI in games", but insisted the goal "is not to replace creatives, but rather to find ways to enhance it by combining the strengths of the technology and the human creativity and ingenuity that are crucial to making games".</p>
<p>"At first, I had the same concerns as many others," explained narrative director Virginie Mosser. "But I discovered that it’s the exact opposite of removing the human from the process. I still write the story and character personalities, but instead of fixed lines, we create these kinds of fences that let NPCs improvise within the world but stay within the boundaries of the lore and motivations we have given them. They can improvise, but we still set the rules and direct the story and characters."</p>
<p>Ubisoft finished by saying that "Teammates" has already been shared with a few hundred players in a closed playtest. It will continue to test and develop the technology, "building the tools and gathering vital reactions and suggestions from real players and creative teams within Ubisoft to refine and expand the systems they have built, all with a philosophy of human creativity, ingenuity, and curiosity at the heart of their work".</p>
<p>This news follows the cessation of trading for Ubisoft, which sent the entire industry into mass speculation. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-116bn-tencent-investment-into-assassins-creed-maker-is-on-track-following-last-weeks-surprise-delay-to-financial-report">Ubisoft later confirmed that this was due to an issue with new auditors</a>, despite broad speculation of a grander acquisition.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, the estimated digital file sizes for the Switch and Switch 2 Edition of Samus' long-awaited adventure have also gone live on the eShop and official Nintendo website. So, if you didn't already know, here's what you can expect:</p>
<h3>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Estimated File Size<br></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>- Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (Switch) - <strong>28.9 GB</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>- Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition - <strong>31.6 GB</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Of course, these sizes are still classed as an "estimate" at the moment and are subject to change before and after release, depending on the patches and updates distributed. The eShop also has Metroid Prime 4's Upgrade Pack listed as <strong>1.5 GB</strong>.</p>
<p>In comparison, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> (based on the first Prime entry) is just under 7 GB according to the Switch eShop.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/metroid-prime-4-beyond-will-be-a-cross-gen-title-for-switch-2">previously confirmed</a>, the Switch 2 version of Metroid Prime 4 supports higher resolution, faster frame rates, HDR and mouse controls. When in docked mode, players can choose from 4K at 60fps (quality) or 1080p at 120fps (performance). And in handheld/tabletop mode, the options are 1080p at 60fps (quality) and 720p at 120fps (performance).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has unveiled Teammates, a short playable experience powered by generative AI. It was developed by the team behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-blows-up-at-gdc-2024-between-ubisofts-neo-npcs-xboxs-narrative-graph-tool-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024's Neo NPC demo</a>, which was recently honored under the France 2030 program for advancing French innovation.</p>



<p>In the initial prototype from 2024, Neo NPCs demonstrated novel cognitive and natural language abilities, but they were still confined to a static environment. In Teammates, Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) are placed in a traditional first-person shooter setting and are equipped with advanced AI features. This allows them to respond dynamically to real-time voice commands, adapt their behaviour to each situation, and reveal their distinct personalities.</p>



<p>From mission briefings to battlefield commands, they react naturally, adapting to players' strategies, moods, and even personal slang. Ubisoft states that NPCs can interpret player intent and tone, as well as environmental cues, generating fluid, context-aware reactions that enhance immersion and player agency.</p>



<p>Virginie Mosser, Narrative Director on the project at Ubisoft, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>It’s really about experimenting with entirely new ways of creating interactive stories. Our role is to give AI meaning, to narrativise it, ensuring logic doesn’t replace soul. We designed Teammates to leave space for player creativity, finding that balance between emotion and unpredictability.</em></p>



<p>Ubisoft also showed a new in-game companion called Jaspar, a personal assistant designed to support players throughout their missions. Jaspar recognises players by name, assists with onboarding and understands the game's lore. He can also highlight threats or key objects in the environment, remind players of their mission objectives, suggest next steps, and act as a tactical guide when they are unsure what to do. The companion even has the ability to manage HUD elements, open menus, and adjust settings.</p>

<p>The Teammates experiment serves both as a playable prototype and a testbed for the underlying technology. Xavier Manzanares, Director of Gameplay GenAI at Ubisoft, explained:</p>



<p><em>Games of tomorrow will listen, understand and react to players far more than today, and our research gives a glimpse of what adaptive, generative play could add on top of proven game systems. It’s the first time we’ve shared an experiment this early with players, but our goal is to pave the way with a strong technology layer so our creators can start imagining the value it could bring to their project and players.</em></p>



<p>The team has also built an API that abstracts the complexity of generative systems, embeds necessary guardrails, including hallucinations, bias, toxicity, among others, and helps control its power to put it at the service of human creativity and play.</p>



<p>In the press release accompanying Teammates, Ubisoft co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot stated that creativity will remain 'deeply human', with AI tools only helping to bring creative visions to life in new ways.</p>



<p>But in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quarterly earnings</a> call, Guillemot added:</p>



<p><em>We are making great strides in applying GenAI to high-value use cases, delivering tangible benefits to our players and teams. It's as big a revolution for our industry as the shift to 3D, and we have everything to lead on this front.</em></p>



<p>It's probably going to be a while before we see this technology applied to actual games. However, Teammates has already been shared with a few hundred players in a closed playtest. The team behind the experience will continue to test, build tools, and gather feedback and suggestions from real players and creative teams within Ubisoft to refine and expand these systems. An explainer video is also coming soon for those who'd like to see it in action.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>The end of 2025 is fast approaching, so I've found myself going back to some of this year's releases to see which games might make their way into my top five. It was perhaps a mistake to boot up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>, however, as those who have played it will know what an absolute monster it is. Maybe I'll put a few hours into it before moving on to something else, we'll see...</p>
<p>I've also recently gone back to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/evil_within">The Evil Within</a> on the PS5. I can't believe it's over ten years old already! I do really love it though, even if it doesn't quite reach the lofty heights of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>.<br>
Happy gaming, folks!</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>The <em>tap, tap, tap</em> of 2026 on my door has kicked me into gear to finally finish <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. I am about 15-20 hours in, and boy, do I feel pain. It's a lot — like, <em>a lot</em> — but I haven't been this all-consumed by a game in a long old time.</p>
<p>I'm breaking up my Lumière sad times with the odd run of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>, which has also proven to be right up my street. Karl has been my go-to for longer runs so far, but I am becoming increasingly attached to my beloved frog wizard, Brome, and his adorable little animations. Let's hope I can get at least one run wrapped up before a certain space bounty hunter zooms into view next month.</p>

<p>With GOTY approaching, I'm in catch-up mode. This weekend, I'll be carrying on with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a>, and hopefully returning to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a>. Non-2025, I've also dipped back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID</a> recently. How I wish Nintendo would put analogue triggers back in their controllers!</p>
<p>Not 'playing', but game-related, I'm eager to catch up with the movie-length <a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2WDfsiLiRA" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2WDfsiLiRA" rel="noopener noreferrer">NES 40th anniversary Portland Retro Gaming Expo panel</a> which went up earlier in November. And news of Rebecca Heineman's passing had me looking back over 40+ years of her work, so the 3DO port of Doom and <a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbIil2HPSU" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbIil2HPSU" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burgertime videos</a> are calling. <a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://bsky.app/profile/textfiles.com/post/3m5ugvjyzkk2m" href="https://bsky.app/profile/textfiles.com/post/3m5ugvjyzkk2m" rel="noopener noreferrer">F cancer, indeed</a>.</p>

<div><p>A couple of Steam releases caught my eye this weekend, and I do hope to see them both on consoles down the line. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710820/Cleared_Hot/">Cleared Hot</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2105620/Sektori/">Sektori</a> are the spiritual sequels you never knew you needed to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/desert_strike_return_to_the_gulf">Desert Strike</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/geometry_wars_galaxies">Geometry Wars</a>, respectively. Princess woes continue with both Zelda and Melinoë still at odds with Ganon and Chronos (and Typhon, I guess) in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> (now in physical cartridge glory, hurrah!) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. I do hope I get to tackle more of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>, it is one of the biggest surprises of the year IMO. In the middle of all this, I feel a lot of folks are overlooking a stellar Switch release that was nearly my game of the week if not for a certain pink ball: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/neon_inferno">Neon Inferno</a>. I have been eagerly waiting for this one for some time now, and it is delivering on every front.</p><p>

Game of the week is, without surprise, Kirby Air Riders. I know the original GameCube title (which is on my shelf) didn’t really raise many eyebrows back in 2003, but I am hopeful a lot more people get to slide around with it this time. It is another finely crafted SORA masterpiece that will certainly keep yours truly occupied until December arrives.</p></div>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I found a very neat game on Steam called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3503440/Astro_Prospector/">Astro Prospector</a>. It's about £5. Maybe less. And it's brilliant — this little snack-sized incremental game that's all about shooting asteroids and dodging bullets. Think <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cobalt_core">Cobalt Core</a> meets <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> with coffee theming.</p>
<p>Other than that, still plugging away at Hades II! I stopped for a while to let the ending get patched and to help judge an indie game competition (which is where I discovered Astro Prospector), but now both of those are done, I'm back on the grind. I'm not rushing towards the ending just yet, as I'm having more fun trying out silly builds and unlocking new weapons, and after that, I might move on to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, since I'm hearing good buzz about it (and the new <strong>Monster Factory</strong> episodes have me wanting to play <strong>Fallout</strong>-type games again).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the North they come, via the sea. For pillage, plunder, and slaughter, before disappearing back across the ocean, leaving the survivors to pick up again amongst the destruction. But the last few times have been different, and warriors have remained and are pushing further and further South, and they will continue to do so unless someone pushes them back into the ocean. The Chaos Marauders have arrived with the <em>Warhammer The Old World</em> Chaos Marauders Reinforcement Set. In this article, we'll have a look at the boxed set and the&nbsp;Arcane Journal: The Razing of Westerland supplement that contains their rules.</p>

<p><i>Warhammer The Old World </i>is a rank and flank wargame, brought back from retirement and based on the original <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy tabletop game after Games Workshop changed the setting into the current <em>Age of Sigmar</em>. You can check out our review of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-old-world-review-hit-refresh" rel="nofollow">Warhammer The Old World Starter Set</a> that launched the release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-2.jpg?itok=DuLOSkZB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-2.jpg?itok=uD0DAF_W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Warhammer The Old World</em> Chaos Marauders Reinforcement Set contains 50 miniatures to expand or begin your invasion force.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Components of Conquest</h2>

<p>To celebrate the release of the new Chaos Marauders miniatures, Games Workshop is launching them with a Reinforcement Set that contains:</p>

<ul><li>40x Chaos Marauder miniatures that can be built as 2 units of 20, or 4 units of 10, each with a headman (champion), standard bearer, and musician, and they can be armed with either&nbsp;hand weapons and shields, great weapons, or flails.</li>
	<li>10x Chaos Marauder Horesmen that can be built as 1 unit of 10, or 2 units of 5, each with a horsemaster (champion), musician, and standard bearer, and they can be armed with either cavalry spears, or flails.</li>
	<li>2x new Warriors of Chaos transfer sheets, each containing 246 Norscan tribes icons and rune decals.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-3.jpg?itok=Faas2KC5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-3.jpg?itok=JERmuLXY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new command units for the Chaos Marauders really stand out against the rest of the unit.</figcaption></figure><p>The multitude of weaponry and head options means that you can create several unique-looking units with the set, and the option to have all units (6 if split into their smallest forms) with a champion, standard bearer, and musician is great for optionality. The Chaos Marauders are also now on 30x30mm bases (25x25mm base before), which they fill, so they look a lot more beefier than before, accurately reflecting the battle-hardened warriors that they are. I love the Marauder standard bearer with axe, he looks like an absolute unit, only held back from devastating his enemies because he's carrying a huge banner.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-5.jpg?itok=5WUoq2nc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-5.jpg?itok=prLCd6iB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new Arcane Journal has the rules and background for the Chaos Marauders, and an awesome Path to Glory campaign for them.</figcaption></figure><h2>Rules Of The Arcane</h2>

<p>The new&nbsp;Arcane Journal: The Razing of Westerland, sold separately from the Mauraduers Reinforcement set, but containing their profiles, fits alongside the <em>Warhammer The Old World</em> Ravening Hordes rules for making your Warriors of Chaos army, supplementing and replacing some rules.</p>

<p>The book starts by detailing Frydaal the Chainmaker’s invasion of Westerland, along with a map of the invasion and background on the Marauder tribes and their 4 cults. It also includes a Path to Glory campaign, where players start with a small force and build up to full-sized armies over several linked games. You will need the Arcane Journal: The War of Settra’s Fury book as well, which details how to play the smaller-scale games that make up the first few campaign games. To supplement the campaign, the Razing of Westerland contains 3 scenarios that you can use in your Path to Glory campaign, reenacting&nbsp;the Chainmaker’s early battles in Westerland.</p>

<p>Arcane Journal: The Razing of Westerland also includes new profiles for Chaos Marauders and Marauder Horsemen, which replace those in Ravening Hordes. The main change is taking away the option to take a Chaos god mark and changing it to a mark of 1 of 4 Chaos Cults, either the Bloodied Hound, Carrion Crow, Slithering Serpent, or Fell Raptor. I prefer the Cult of the&nbsp;Bloodied Hound, which can gain the Marauders a +1 boost to their weapon skill once per game by passing a leadership test in the command phase, because if Chaos Marauders aren't attacking, what are they doing?</p>

<p>The journal also has a new magic lore for Chaos Sorcerers, Lore of the Shadowlands, which has spells like Shadowed Assailants, that deals 3D6 strength 1 hits to an enemy the caster is engaged with, with no armor or regeneration save allowed. The book closes with 18 new magic items that can be used by any Old World army.</p>

<p>The new Chaos Marauders and Marauder Horsemen miniatures are fantastic, and really capture the frozen waste barbarian nature of the warriors. The Chaos Marauders Reinforcement Set is a great way to start or expand your force with them, containing either 3 large units or 6 smaller ones, with full optionality, no matter how you spread your units. The Arcane Journal: The Razing of Westerland has some great background, and the Path to Glory campaign feels very in keeping with the Chaos Marauders campaign as they ravage Westerland. The new Cult and Chaotic Traits also allow you to flesh out your forces a lot more, giving some real individuality to your units and flexibility on the battlefield.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Swedish developer Fatshark is getting ahead of Black Friday sales by offering Warhammer: Vermintide 2 completely free to keep <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/552500/Warhammer_Vermintide_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>. If you add it to your library before November 24 at 10 AM Pacific Time, you'll keep it forever.</p>



<p>The promotion is part of the so-called '10 Years of Tide', the event that celebrates the tenth anniversary of the release of the first Vermintide game. For its part, the second franchise entry, launched seven years ago, has since more than doubled its original release content through free updates, DLCs, and major additions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/chaos-wastes-free-expansion-adds-rogue-lite-elements-to-vermintide-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chaos Wastes</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-gets-versus-mode-with-4v4-battles-and-several-characters-to-choose-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Versus</a>.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Fatshark released a free new map called "Return to the Reik," a beloved location from the first game that has been reimagined in Warhammer: Vermintide 2. River Reik returns with expanded, boat-focused gameplay that puts deck skirmishes front and center. Players will battle their way across swaying platforms, using the barge and riverbank environments to transform every encounter into a cinematic co-op spectacle.</p>



<p>This mission is a reimagining of the Warhammer: End Times Vermintide's popular level, blending nostalgia with deliberate changes and new encounters. Fatshark says they added new routes and set-piece moments, as well as boat props, to give the River Reik mission a distinct Vermintide 2 flavour, while maintaining the core story elements. The result, according to the studio, is a familiar yet surprising experience that will reward Ubersreik Five veterans and invite newcomers to discover a classic in a new light.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The studio's most recent game, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, is also part of the 10 Years of Tide campaign. As announced this week, the game will be updated with the new (and free) Hive Scum class on December 2. Hive Scum is a class that focuses on dual-wield expertise thanks to twin‑wield pistols and dual-wielding shivs. The December 2 update will also introduce a new Operation mission set in the trenches of Atoma, as well as a new time-limited special event in Darktide.</p>

<p>With this in mind, the latest one is now live and it offers up a Whimsicott based on the same one used by Federico Camporesi to win the 2025 Pokémon North America International Championships (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://x.com/SerebiiNet/status/1991841929357893758">Serebii.net</a>).

<p>The same titles are currently giving trainers the opportunity to catch a Goodra with the Mightiest Mark. This event is now underway and will repeat on 28th November - 30th November 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon loves to push its own brands during Black Friday, and the Echo Dot always gets the deepest cuts. By selling these smart speakers at razor-thin margins-or even at a loss-Amazons ensures Alexa finds her way into as many American homes as possible. The strategy works brilliantly for the company, but it also gives shoppers some incredible deals. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">newest Echo Dot now drops from $49 to just $31</a> which is a record low price found only on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Best Sounding Echo Dot Ever Made</h2>
<p>Amazon says this is the <strong>best-sounding Echo Dot they’ve ever made</strong>, and the difference is actually appreciable: clearer vocals, deeper bass, and altogether punchier sound well above its weight class. Music fills a bedroom or office surprisingly well for something this small. Previous Echo Dot generations sounded thin and tinny in comparison. The audio upgrade alone justifies replacing older models you might have scattered around the house.</p>



<p><strong>Alexa integration</strong> makes this speaker a genuinely useful daily assistant: ask for the weather while you get dressed, set timers while you cook, or get quick answers to random questions throughout the day. The voice recognition works reliably from across the room, even with music playing. You can even tap the top to snooze your morning alarm when you need a few extra minutes.</p>
<p>Music streaming connects to all of the services you probably already use. <strong>Amazon Music, Apple Music, Spotify, among others, all work seamlessly through voice commands</strong>. Bluetooth connectivity lets you stream from any device when you want manual control. You can fill your entire home with synchronized music by pairing multiple Echo devices in different rooms. The ecosystem grows naturally as you add more speakers over time.</p>
<p>Smart home control makes the Echo Dot a<strong> central hub for any connected device</strong>: lights, thermostats, plugs, and many more accessories follow your every simple command. With its built-in motion sensor, routines can be automatically invoked as soon as you turn up in a room. The indoor temperature sensor allows you to create comfort-based automation, where you start the fan once it gets too hot.</p>



<p>Privacy controls certainly help mitigate these concerns about always-listening devices. The dedicated microphone off button physically disconnects the mics when you need guaranteed privacy. Amazon has built layers of protection into the system, stating explicitly that they do not sell your personal information. You can review and delete voice recordings at any time through the Alexa app, a big improvement over previous models in terms of data transparency.</p>
<p>Pairing options extend the functionality well beyond basic speaker duties. Pair with Fire TV devices for a home theater-like audio experience, link with compatible Eero mesh systems to extend Wi-Fi coverage throughout the house, and create speaker groups that play synchronized audio across multiple rooms. The Echo Dot works great on its own but really shines as part of a larger system.</p>
<p>At $31, the Echo Dot introduces smart home capability for a near-disposable price. In one small package, you’re getting better audio quality, Alexa integration, smart home control, and integrated sensors. This Black Friday deal brings the newest model to its lowest recorded price.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-inspired-sandbox-game-hytale-canceled-after-a-decade-of-development/1100-6532646/" data-ref-id="1100-6532646">Hytale was canceled</a> after spending a decade in development and the studio behind it, Hypixel, was slated to be closed as well. Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme subsequently revived the company and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/canceled-minecraft-competitor-hytale-isnt-canceled-after-all/1100-6536298/" data-ref-id="1100-6536298">purchased all of the rights for Hytale</a> from Riot Games. Collins-Laflamme also reiterated his commitment to releasing Hypixel in early access. Now, we know how much the game is going to cost.</p><p>On social media, Hypixel revealed that Hytale <a href="https://x.com/Hytale/status/1991884477816300023" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will retail for $20</a>. However, there will be more expensive editions with perks including cosmetics that fans can purchase in support of the team. After confirming the price, Collins-Laflamme noted that this decision puts him financially at risk because he's already committed to bankrolling his company and funding the game out of his own pocket.</p><p>"I'm pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible," wrote Collins-Laflamme on X. "I'm taking on a considerable personal risk after repurchasing the game and getting it ready for early access for a growing team of now 50 talented individuals. I said I was all in, and I am delivering on that promise. The game is unfinished and runs on a build from over four years ago. Charging more didn't feel right. I don't think the game is good yet. My team and I will push hard to make it good, then great. The vision is clear and progress is fast."</p><p>Collins-Laflamme added that he wants to attract as many players as possible, even during rough economic times. Hypixel has also released a post detailing <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-modding-strategy-and-status" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">how far along the modding feature is</a>. The short answer is there's still a lot of work to be done. For now, Hytale doesn't have a release date, but Collins-Laflamme has implied that the game's early-access period will begin relatively soon.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Capcom surprised fans with the announcement of a remaster of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/onimusha_2_samurais_destiny">Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny</a> for the Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>The same title eventually arrived in March of this year, and now in another update, Capcom has this week released a demo, which you can download right now from the eShop. According to the official description, it will allow players to experience the "gripping prologue" as you dive into the samurai action.</p>
<p>In our review of Onimusha 2 on the Switch, we mentioned how it was a faithful revival of one of the PS2's best games and included plenty of quality-of-life updates and extras that fans (and newcomers) were sure to appreciate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is a strong, worthy successor to the original that is now at its absolute best on Switch. Some of it feels dated by modern standards, with fixed camera angles that arguably should have been ditched back in 2002, but it still feels incredibly fun regardless."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/onimusha_warlords">Onimusha: Warlords</a> was also previously released on the Switch in 2019, if you want to start from the beginning.</p>

While we're still waiting on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-2025-black-friday-sale">Nintendo's deals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">Xbox</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-sale-2025-early-deals">Amazon</a> launched Black Friday sales earlier this week. Now <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">PlayStation</a> has entered the fray with a spread of discounts on games, accessories, and even PS5 consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's worth checking your wishlist and doing some scrolling, as a starting point, we're seeing great discounts for anyone looking to start or fill in the gaps on a Final Fantasy collection. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Final Fantasy Games on Sale for Black Friday </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, you’ve got options. The PlayStation Store offers the best discounts on the FF7 Remakes, but Amazon is actually offering physical copies. It really comes down to how much you care about having those games lined up on your shelf vs. sitting in your digital library. If you’re on the PC side, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/playstationpublishersale2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam is also running a PlayStation publisher sale</a> that includes roughly the same discounts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Final Fantasy Pixel Collection is pretty unreal bang for your buck. It includes the pixel remasters of the first six Final Fantasy games for just $30 total with the current price drop, making it a great choice for something you can really dig into over the holidays. The discount also applies to the <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrRWl?object_uuid=464cd0b5-f8e2-4b16-a1ca-a7eee5a1762f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch version</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for news on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-a-completed-story-at-square-enix">third and final part</a> of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy, you can pick up the first two games at a discount. Remake Intergrade (Intergrade just meaning the PS5 version) has dropped to $19.99 for physical and $14.99 for digital. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, released just last year, has dropped to $39.99 for the physical copy on Amazon and $34.99 through PlayStation. Michael Higham's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">9/10 review of Rebirth for IGN</a> describes how it "impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion as both a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenge and depth, and as an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most recent mainline release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-review">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, has dropped to its <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0BPMTJJ6D" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest ever price on Amazon</a>, which happens to be $5 cheaper than you can find it on the PlayStation Store. While outside of Black Friday deals themselves, Amazon does have a teensy tiny 5% discount on the most recent spin-off release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review">Final Fantasy Tactics: Ivalice Chronicles</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>More PlayStation Black Friday Deals </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation has knocked $100 off both its PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles, the only real console deals we’ve so far this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-predictions-and-latest-news">Black Friday</a>. There’s also PlayStation Plus discounts and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dualsense-ps5-controllers-black-friday-early-deals">spread of DualSense controllers</a> on sale, including my personal favorite, the limited edition Ghost of Yotei version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Blythe (she/her) is an SEO Coordinator at IGN who spends way too much time in character customization screens and tracking down collectibles. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-game-deals-ps5-black-friday-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s AirPods Pro have dominated the premium earbud conversation for years, but Samsung finally built a serious challenger. The <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro pack AI-powered noise cancellation, adaptive sound optimization, and a completely redesigned fit</strong> into a sleek package. The kicker is the price: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">At $159 instead of $249 on Amazon, these earbuds now cost almost half what Apple charges for the AirPods Pro</a>. This Black Friday deal exists only on Amazon since Samsung isn’t running this discount on its own website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AI-Powered Audio That Learns How You Listen</h2>
<p>The <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro put AI right inside your ears</strong>, exactly where it needs to be, in ways that matter most. Adaptive Equalizer in Samsung’s earbuds analyzes the shape of your ear canal and adjusts the audio output for the best sound delivery. What you get is a kind of personalized listening that automatically improves from how the earbuds are fitted in your ears. You don’t have to fiddle with EQ settings or guess which preset sounds best as the AI does everything for you and gets it just right.</p>



<p><strong>Adaptive Active Noise Cancellation</strong> is another strong suit for Galaxy AI. It continuously monitors your environment and adjusts the cancellation intensity in real time. Louder subway noise will trigger maximum blocking, while a quiet office gets lighter treatment. The transition happens seamlessly without any need for you to manually change it. You can stay immersed in your music while remaining aware of important sounds with ease.</p>
<p>The redesigned fit addresses one of the biggest complaints about previous Galaxy Buds generations: Samsung <strong>reworked the shape and materials for long-lasting comfort</strong> during extended listening sessions. The earbuds stay secure during workouts and commutes without creating pressure points. You can wear them for hours without that fatigue from cheaper earbuds.</p>



<p>Sound quality is top-notch and delivers on the promise of this premium tier. Rich bass, clear mids, and crisp highs seamlessly come together in immersive audio across each genre. The dual drivers take everything from podcasts to orchestral music with amazing accuracy. Supporting spatial audio adds three-dimensional depth to compatible content. Movies and games feel more immersive when the sounds seem to be coming from every direction.</p>
<p><strong>Touch controls are responsive</strong> and allow you to customize actions to your liking. Tap or swipe to pause playback, skip tracks, adjust volume, take calls, and more. You can program different gestures on each earbud to make the most of the functionality. Controls reliably work, even when you are working out and your fingers are a bit sweaty. Voice assistants are just one tap away if you need hands-free assistance.</p>
<p>Battery life keeps the music going through long days without anxiety.: The earbuds give you hours of playback with ANC enabled, and the case offers multiple additional charges. Quick charging gets you back to listening fast when you’re running low. Wireless charging support means that you can drop the case onto any compatible pad. USB-C handles wired charging when you need it.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro go for $159 and offers flagship features at a mid-segment price tag. You’re getting AI-powered ANC, adaptive sound optimization, premium comfort, and striking design all rolled into one. This Black Friday deal on Amazon saves you $90 off regular pricing, but more importantly, cuts the AirPods Pro by a significant margin.</p>

              <p>Amazon started <em>Black Friday Week</em> off with a bang on Thursday by knocking the AirPods 4 with ANC down from its usual $179 to $109. Shoppers jumped on it immediately, but Amazon decided to go even harder on Friday: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4602/">Now the price is at an unbelievable $99 (44% off)</a>, a record low for earbuds that are barely into their first year. The standard <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3769/">AirPods 4 without ANC also hit a new low at $79, down from $129</a>. Neither of these deals exists on Apple’s website because it will not run Black Friday promotions. Amazon clearly has different plans.</p>

<h2>Premium ANC Earbuds Finally at an Accessible Price</h2>
<p>Until Apple figured it out, active noise cancellation seemed impossible on open-ear earbuds with the H2 chip. The <strong>ANC model of AirPods 4 blocks out the ambient noise without the sealed feeling of traditional in-ear designs</strong>. Airplane engines, office chatter, and street noise fade into the background so you can focus on your music or calls. The technology adapts continuously to your environment, adjusting cancellation levels in real time.</p>



<p><strong>Transparency mode flips the script</strong> when you need to hear your surroundings. A quick press lets in ambient sound so you can have a conversation or listen for announcements without removing the earbuds. The transition between ANC and Transparency is genuinely instant and seamless. It’s this flexibility that makes the AirPods 4 truly useful for everyday life, rather than just an isolated listening session.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptive Audio goes even further:</strong> it automatically blends noise cancellation and transparency, depending on your environment. Walk down a busy street, and it ramps up awareness of your surroundings. Sit at your desk, and stronger noise cancellation kicks in to help you focus. In essence, the earbuds read the room and adapt-without any input from you. It feels almost magical once you experience how seamlessly it works.</p>
<p>With <strong>Personalized Spatial Audio</strong>, an immersive three-dimensional soundstage is built around your uniquely shaped ears. Technology utilizes the TrueDepth camera on your iPhone to scan your ears and optimize audio delivery. Movies and music acquire depth and dimension that standard stereo simply cannot match. It feels like the sounds are around you, not inside of your head. Immersive audio will enormously improve the gaming and video content.</p>



<p>All these advanced features are powered by the <strong>H2 chip</strong>, and it does so with great battery efficiency. You get up to 30 hours of total listening time with the charging case, ample for a week of commutes and workouts. The earbuds themselves will last around 6 hours on a single charge with ANC turned on. When you’re in a real hurry, a quick 5-minute charge gives you about an hour of playback.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort remains a strong suit for the open-ear design</strong> that Apple has refined generation after generation. The earbuds sit securely without creating pressure or fatigue during extended listening sessions. No silicone tips means no irritation in the ear canal, no plugged-up feeling. And most people can wear them hours on end without discomfort. The fit works for workouts, commutes, and everything in between.</p>
<p>For $99, the Apple AirPods 4 with ANC deliver flagship audio features at a mid-range price point. You are getting active noise cancelation, adaptive audio, spatial audio, and the H2 chip in comfortable open-ear earbuds.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/return-to-the-year-2000-with-classic-multiplayer-dos-games-in-your-browser/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<blockquote><p>Chrono Divide is a fan-made project which aims to recreate the original “Red Alert 2” from the “Command &amp; Conquer” series using web technologies. The result is a game client that runs in your web browser, with no additional plugins or applications installed.</p>
<p>The project initially started out as an experiment and was meant to prove that it was possible to have a fully working, cross-platform RTS game running in a web browser. Now, with a playable version already available, the end-goal is reaching feature parity with the original vanilla “Red Alert 2” engine.</p></blockquote>
<p>It works with a client-server model (“say goodbye to port forwarding and firewall exceptions”), supports mods, offers both modern and classic mouse control schemes, and works “on any device and operating system, directly from your web browser,” including phones and tablets. You (understandably) have to have a copy of the game files to play, though.</p>
<p>Further, there are leaderboards and a <a href="https://discord.gg/uavJ34JTWY">Discord server</a>, plus modern-game-style “seasons” (with no monetization, of course) that feature special rules and map rotations. So there’s a decent-sized community playing <em>Red Alert 2</em> on the regular in 2025, which is pretty wild.</p>
<p>Chrono Divide joins a handful of similar projects in bringing older multiplayer PC games with modern bells and whistles to web browsers. One example: <a href="https://dos.zone/mp/?lobby=*">DOS Zone</a> offers one-click joining of online matches of <em>Doom</em>, <em>Quake 2</em> and <em>3</em>, <em>Unreal Tournament</em>, and <em>Half-Life: Deathmatch</em>—again, with a Discord server for an extra community layer.</p>
<p>So if you want to spend your Friday night reliving the TCP/IP and LAN party multiplayer games of the early 2000s, well, there you go. I’ll see you there—I still think <em>Unreal Tournament</em> is the best multiplayer first-person shooter ever made.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">We are fast approaching the end to another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> chapter, and that means it's nearly time for a huge live event that will introduce a new era for Epic Games' metaverse. It's Fortnite's biggest party, typically drawing its biggest concurrent player numbers by a wide margin each year. In 2023 it drew more than 11 million players, and 2024's event pulled more than 14 million.</p><p dir="ltr">And with this year's chapter finale, titled Zero Hour, looking like it's going to rope in every collab Fortnite had over the past 365 days <em>while also</em> picking up old storylines that Fortnite abandoned years ago, this one's looking like quite a doozie.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4609075-g6tarewx0aalrhx.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4609075" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4609075-g6tarewx0aalrhx.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4609075"></a><figcaption>The Fortnite Chapter 6 finale event looks like it'll be quite a spectacle.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4609075-g6tarewx0aalrhx.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">When is Fortnite's Chapter 6 finale event going down?</h2><p dir="ltr">The live finale event, which will only take place one time, will begin at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET on Saturday, November 29.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll be able to join the mode 40 minutes prior to start time, which likely means there will be some sort of pre-show entertainment. Prior to the event at the end of Star Wars season back in June, there was an X-Wing vs TIE Fighter PvP space flight sim for players to enjoy before the main event, so these things can get pretty elaborate.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Will Fortnite go offline afterward?</h2><p dir="ltr">Yes. You can expect that Fortnite's servers will go offline for the Chapter 7 update once the event ends. But if all goes well, Fortnite should only be down for about 4-7 hours. Expect Chapter 7 to start in the evening on November 29.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Fortnite Chapter 6: Zero Hour live event teaser</h2><p dir="ltr">Epic has offered a cinematic teaser for the event, and it looks like<em> a lot. </em>Check it out.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwh7WFCW3f8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mwh7WFCW3f8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr">What can we expect to happen during the Zero Hour event?</h2><p dir="ltr">Based on the teaser, we're going to get some kind of Avengers: Endgame-level confrontation with Chapter 6's ultimate big bad, whose tentacles have made sporadic appearances throughout the chapter. All the past year's Fortnite collabs will team up like it's the end of Ready Player One, and then whatever happens will usher in the Chapter 7 island.</p><p dir="ltr">We're expecting characters from tons of different IPs that collabed with Fortnite in the past year to show up, with Godzilla x Kong, Star Wars, Halo, K-Pop Demon Hunters, Hatsune Miku, Power Rangers, TMNT, and Superman already being teased. Likewise, at least two upcoming Chapter 7 collabs--Kill Bill and Back to the Future--will also have parts to play.</p><p dir="ltr">But Zero Hour won't just be about the collabs. The Fortnite original superhero group known as the Seven are almost guaranteed to make their return during this event. None of the members of the Seven have been seen since the end of Chapter 3, so it's been a while.</p><p dir="ltr">The big question is whether they'll be the same versions of the characters as before. We've already had two different versions of The Paradigm, who were entirely different characters from alternate realities, so we might get to meet a new version of The Foundation not played by Dwayne Johnson. But there have been no rumors either way on that front just yet, so we'll have to wait and see.</p>
