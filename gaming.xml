		<p>Nintendo revealed Donkey Kong Bananza for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, coming to the new console on 17th July 2025, just a month and a half after the Switch 2’s June debut.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza – Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z_EIYSSl3cY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Donkey Kong Banaza is the first fully 3D platformer in the DK series since the N64’s Donkey Kong 64, and so the gameplay here is dramatically different and more modern than Rare’s 90s classic.</p>
<p>There’s a big emphasis on DK’s strength, letting him just smash through enemies, smash through walls, and even smash down into the ground…. then use chunks of the ground to smash more stuff around him!</p>
<p>there’s a lot of great looking 3D platforming here, with big camera sweeps that shift the perspective an awful lot. Donkey kong has been given a big restyle to match the updated look of the character from the Super Mario Bros. movie.</p>

<p>There’s no real clue what the story will be this time, but we’d put some money down on the gallery of crazed baddies having stolen his banana haul. What does seem to have also happened is DK having made a friend with a purple crystalline looking creature.</p>

			<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is getting significantly upgraded on Nintendo Switch 2, with support for two different display modes supporting high resolution and framerates.</p>
<p>As confirmed during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTVeYm4iIM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct</a>, the fourth entry in the series launching later this year worldwide will also receive a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, which will take advantage of the system's power to offer two display modes. In Quality Mode, the game will run in docked mode at 4K resolution, 60 FPS with HDR support, and at 1080p, 60 FPS with HDR support in handheld mode. In Performance Mode, the game will run at 1080p resolution, 120 FPS with HDR support, and 720p resolution, 120 FPS and HDR in handheld mode. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on Nintendo Switch 2 will also support the new Joy-Con 2 mouse functionality, which is sure to make the experience even better.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a release date has yet to be officially confirmed for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, so we still don't know when we will be able to experience Samus Aran's new adventure and some of the game's mechanics, which include the Psychic Abilities shown in the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-new-gameplay-trailer-introduces-psychic-abilities-and-more/">latest trailer</a> last week. These abilities promise to spice up the experience considerably as they will allow Samus to operate mechanisms, open doors, control the trajectory of beams, and more.</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-first-trailer-release-date/">2025 release date</a> on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-getting-upgraded-nintendo-switch-2-versions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are two of the games getting upgraded versions for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">Nintendo Switch 2. </a></p>
<p>These new upgraded versions will be classified as the "Nintendo Switch 2 Editions" of each game, and if you already own either game, or any of the games that are getting a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, you'll be able to get the new version by purchasing an upgrade pack.</p>
<p>Both games will enjoy improved visuals and framerates, with HDR compatibility added for both titles that are surely to make the painted art style for each game pop and look better than it has before.</p>
<p>Nintendo also revealed that the Nintendo Switch Online app would be renamed to the Nintendo Switch app and will include a "Zelda Notes" section that will provide helpful tips to players while they're exploring Hyrule, as well as allow Tears of the Kingdom users to easily share their creations.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 – 4.2.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DXUmjX7DsP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We don't yet know how much the upgrades are going to cost, though if you've yet to buy either Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom, it would be a good bet that both games are going to be available at the regular full price for brand-new Nintendo games.</p>

It was originally intended to be DLC for <em>Hollow Knight</em>, but <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/hollow-knight-silksong-revealed">according to developers Team Cherry</a>, “it quickly became too large and too unique to stay a DLC, as initially planned.” The game will take place in a new kingdom, with new moves and new weapons at your disposal as well as new enemies to take on.</p><p>Nintendo featured gameplay of <em>Silksong</em> during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8lvHT_IQbM">a broadcast at E3 2019</a>. But since then, there have only been a few substantial updates about the game. Xbox showed a new trailer for it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/12/22175400/hollow-knight-silksong-sequel-xbox-game-pass-trailer">in June 2022</a> and said it would be available within 12 months. The game was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/9/23717855/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed">delayed shortly before that deadline</a>. The game was announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/16/23356667/hollow-knight-silksong-playstation-ps5-ps4-still-no-release-date">for PlayStation, too</a>. And in January, Matthew Griffin, who works on marketing and publishing for <em>Silksong</em>, <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696">stated that</a> “the game is real, progressing and will release.”</p><div><p>Now that the game has a release window, it might almost be time to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-in-clown-makeup">take off our clown makeup</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo says they will have “clearer image quality” and higher resolution than the original releases.</p><p>Nintendo also promised that games like <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>, <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>, <em>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</em>, <em>Super Mario Strikers</em>, <em>Chibi-Robo! Plug Into Adventure</em>, <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em>, and <em>Pokémon Colosseum</em> will be available on the service.</p><p>The GameCube game library will launch on the same day as the Switch 2, June 5th, and will be available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online: Expansion Pack.</p><p>Since its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17874798/nintendo-switch-online-launch-subscription">launch in 2018</a>, Nintendo’s slowly built up its online subscription service by offering games from console generations past, alongside other neat features. In addition to enabling cloud saves and online play, the base service offers players access to games from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/17/18185533/nintendo-switch-online-classic-nes-games-blaster-master-zelda-2">the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries</a>, along with the recently added <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284073/nintendo-music-streaming-app-switch-online-subscribers">Nintendo Music app</a>. The more expensive Expansion Pack subscription adds games from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591722/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-advance-games-expansion-pack">Game Boy Advance</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688780/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-64-sega-genesis-controllers">Nintendo 64, and Sega Genesis</a>, plus DLC from <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, <em>Animal Crossing</em>, and <em>Splatoon 3</em>.</p><div><p>Before this addition, GameCube games weren’t totally absent from the Switch. Nintendo has remastered or ported a handful of games to the system over the years, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/9/23592822/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-best-way-classic"><em>Metroid Prime </em>and<em> Metroid Prime 2</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/14/23873435/nintendo-switch-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-trailer"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438499/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Sunshine</em></a> (before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307522/mario-limited-time-nintendo-switch-disney-vault">yanking the collection that contained <em>Sunshine</em> from stores</a>).</p></div><p>Last year, Nintendo conducted a secretive online playtest that was initially thought to be for GameCube games with online multiplayer features. That test <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo">was actually for an MMO</a>, but at least Nintendo was a little late in adding GameCube games, rather than never doing it at all.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The critically acclaimed games will feature “enhanced resolution and frame rates” and HDR support. Nintendo didn’t go into specifics on those upgrades, but the titles were running at a perfectly smooth 60fps during the stream.</p><p>Both titles pushed the original Switch hardware to its limits with occasional frame rate drops, so if Nintendo is able to deliver buttery-smooth gameplay on the new console, many early buyers will be happy to replay these classics.</p><p>The company also demonstrated a new second-screen experience in its Nintendo Switch app for Android and iOS. A “Zelda’s Notes” feature will be able to show your location on a map in the massive world of either game, and it can help guide you to shrines and koroks that you haven’t yet discovered “It’s a game-specific service that’s exclusive to the Switch 2 Editions of these titles,” the company said. The Nintendo Switch Online app will be renamed to a simpler “Nintendo Switch” at the end of May, Nintendo confirmed during the stream.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the Switch 2 Direct, Nintendo finally revealed the purpose of the button, a new feature called GameChat.</p><p>As its name implies, GameChat enables Switch 2 players to communicate using the console’s built-in microphone. Nintendo noted how the Switch 2’s microphone will feature background noise filtering to ensure that GameChat calls come through clearly. And in addition to giving people a way to talk directly to one another, GameChat also features screen sharing functionality that will allow you to broadcast your gaming to friends on group calls. Notably, you will <em>not</em> have to be playing the same game while using GameChat, meaning that people within a call will be able to play and screen-share different titles simultaneously.</p><p>In a press release, Nintendo announced parents looking to monitor their children’s use of GameChat will be able to enable or disable the feature through the Nintendo Switch Parental Control smartphone app.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch Online smart device app*** will be soon renamed to the Nintendo Switch app. It’ll continue to offer voice chat when playing supported titles on a Nintendo Switch system, as well as game-specific services for titles such as Splatoon™ 3 and Animal Crossing™: New Horizons. On Nintendo Switch 2, you can enjoy chatting with friends with GameChat while playing Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games or compatible Nintendo Switch games (app not required).<br>The updated app will also include ZELDA NOTES, a new game-specific service that supports players on their adventures in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.</p><p>The GameChat feature represents a major step forward in Nintendo’s social gaming offerings. Of the three major manufacturers, Nintendo was the only one that did not have a way for players to communicate with their friends via the console. Shortly after the launch of the original Switch, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/18/15995098/nintendo-switch-online-app-out-now-ios-android">Nintendo released a mobile app</a> that let users participate in voice chat for select games, but it’s awkward to use an app for a feature that comes standard in other consoles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will release in 2025, according to a showcase reel for Nintendo’s upcoming Steam Decklike, the Switch 2. Imagine dropping release details for a game as hotly, wildly, despairingly anticipated as Silksong in an effing montage video. Because that is what Uncle Mario did.</p>
<p>The game appears for a handful of seconds, so there’s not much more to tell, but it’s nice to have something tangible after years of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fans-uncover-another-hollow-knight-silksong-character-in-team-cherrys-riddle">Team Cherry teaser campaigns</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unless-this-cake-is-lying-to-you-silksong-will-reappear-in-april">fan conspiracies about cake</a>. There were a few more concrete indications that Silksong would grace the Switch 2’s software reveal. Earlier this month, the developers updated the Steam page, changing the copyright date to 2025.</p>

<p>Team Cherry revealed Silksong back at E3 2019. It stars the balletic stilleto-wielding Hornet - a boss from the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> - and takes place in the new kingdom of Pharloom. It's about journeying upward through a realm "haunted by Silk and Song". More as we get it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The very last game trailer at the Nintendo Switch 2 event was for a new 3D, open-world adventure, Donkey Kong Bananza.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza trailer kicks off by showcasing all the different types of biomes players will explore in the game, including thick forests, vast greenlands, snowy mountains, and much more. Donkey Kong enters the scene later, showcasing his diverse traversal abilities, such as running, jumping, and climbing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most mesmerising system of Donkey Kong Bananza is its destructible environment, with Kong able to demolish almost anything with his fists. The trailer shows Donkey Kong performing a ground pound to create a massive hole underneath him before he punches himself out from the mound. Kong is also shown grabbing a piece of concrete from the floor underneath him to cause even more destruction by either smashing it into his surroundings or tossing it around like a boulder.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Donkey Kong Bananza trailer at Switch 2 Direct also showcased other vital details, such as interactive elements of the environment, transitioning from 3D to 2D and back, and all the different types of minions and bosses. Donkey Kong Banana is set to release on July 17, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo Switch 2 has landed a FromSoftware exclusive, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-lands-fromsoftware-exclusive-the-duskbloods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Duskbloods</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Direct revealed that the console will cost $449.99 at launch. This likely justifies the new games and incredible console features, making this one of the most powerful consoles ever.</p>



<p>One of the biggest questions surrounding the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> has been its price. The first Switch console retailed for $299.99 and £279.99 when it first came out. However, the new and improved Switch 2 is jam-packed with a litany of expensive features including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-120fps-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4K, HDR, and 120 FPS capabilities</a>.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 was expected to cost much more, and now we finally have the answer.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It’s going to sell like hot cakes. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will cost <strong>$449.99</strong>, and it remains to be seen if this is a fair price for such a sophisticated piece of hardware. You can also pay a bit more as there’s a packaged bundle featuring a digital copy of Mario Kart World for <strong>$499.99</strong>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-gb/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Switch 2</a> also looks like it costs a whopping <strong>£395.99</strong> in the UK, with the additional Mario Kart World bundle increasing to <strong>£429.99</strong>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 Direct</a> confirmed and delivered many of the features that players wanted from a follow-up console. With big-time AAA exclusives already confirmed, including a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-is-getting-a-new-3d-adventure-on-the-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3D Donkey Kong game</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>, FromSoftware’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-lands-fromsoftware-exclusive-the-duskbloods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Duskbloods</a> exclusive, the Switch 2 is looking to wow the gaming community.</p>



<p>Nintendo is promising more information on the console and games in the coming weeks. For now, go to our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a> to discuss the Switch 2 Direct event. Is the console too expensive?

<p>Fans of FromSoftware were surprised to see the developer announce an exclusive title for the Nintendo Switch 2, The Duskbloods, during today’s Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. The trailer drew immediate comparisons to the developer’s Sony exclusive, Bloodborne.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-switch-2-isn-t-getting-bloodborne-so-they-got-their-own-version-in-the-duskbloods">The Switch 2 Isn’t Getting Bloodborne, So They Got Their Own Version in The Duskbloods</h2>



<p>FromSoftware and The Duskbloods were given the final slot in the third-party partners showcase, and for good reason. The trailer started with the typical dark, gothic imagery and mood of a Bloodborne game, and when the FromSoftware logo appeared, fans thought the unthinkable had happened.</p>



<p>The trailer showcased more of the environments and enemies that will appear, as well as some more advanced technologies like a steam-powered jetpack and dual wield submachine guns. During the trailer, the player either summons an NPC familiar ally or a co-op partner, but it’s unclear which yet. Finally at the end, fans were given a title: The Duskbloods, plus a look at a cute but terrifying large rat-bird hybrid adorned with glyphs.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While several of the games announced at the Direct were promised at the Switch 2 launch date, June 5th, The Duskbloods trailer only gave a release window of 2026. More information on the new game from FromSoftware will be announced via a Creator’s Voice article from director Hidetaka Miyazaki. That article will be published on the Nintendo website on April 4th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-game-officially-revealed-as-mario-kart-world<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Nintendo Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct, Nintendo officially revealed its new Mario Kart game coming to the console, which we now know to be titled Mario Kart World. It's Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, and it's a launch day release on June 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer today was a fast-paced explosion of neat new elements. Rapidfire, we got a look at a number of returning characters, new tracks, and feature such as jet skis on water, rail grinding on the edges of courses, the ability to bounce off walls, customizable characters with hats and outfits, changing weather and time of day on courses, a photo mode, and the ability to play as the cow from Moo Moo Meadows. You heard me!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest feature of World is the ability to drive off-road essentially anywhere you want on the course in what seems to be a large open world. In a new mode called Knockout Tour, racers have to drive across the open world to different checkpoints from course to course, and get knocked out if they're below a certain placement when they reach checkpoints. And there's a free roam mode where you can just drive around for fun, no racing involved, with friends if you like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's so much to dissect here! We saw a lot more of the roster of characters for one. It includes: Mario (obviously), Bowser, Baby Luigi, Baby Peach, Toad, Lakitu, Wario, Yoshi, Paulina, Luigi, Birdo, Shy Guy, Baby Daisy, Waluigi, Toadette, King Boo, Donkey Kong, Wario, Baby Rosalina, Baby Mario, Koopa, Peach, Daisy, Rosalina, Nabbit, Shy Guy, Hammer Bro, and yeah, still inexplicably, the Moo Moo Meadows Cow. I'm so happy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also saw a number of new courses In addition to the desert-themed course with Yoshi's Diner that we saw in the initial reveal, we saw a new course that seemed to involve driving along canals on jetskis, something called "DK Pass" that looks a bit like Mount Wario and makes use of snowmobile karts, a course seemingly themed after the construction tower of the original Donkey Kong game, a new big city track, a jungle-themed course with an overgrown giant Question Block, some sort of Peach-themed temple, and a whole lot more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last "mainline" Mario Kart game, Mario Kart 8, originally came out way, way back in 2014 for the Wii U, and was later re-released as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the Nintendo Switch. Since then, it's become the definitive Mario Kart game, selling nearly 65 million copies and getting numerous updates over time with new racers, tracks, karts, and more. While other Mario Kart games have come out during that time, such as Mario Kart Tour on mobile and Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit, this new Mario Kart release on Switch 2 is a major step forward for Nintendo as it says goodbye at last to one of the best-selling games of all time. Can Mario Kart World surpass it? We'll have to wait and find out.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at the Nintendo Direct today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">right here</a>.

The system’s built-in mic can be used to voice chat while playing games with up to 12 people in different locations. Up to four friends can share their screen, and if they connect a compatible USB-C camera, such as the Nintendo Switch 2 camera (sold separately), they can also video chat, seeing each other’s faces as they cheer, shout, or laugh while playing.

                <p>Nintendo fans won't have to wait much longer to get their hands on the Switch 2. The successor to one of the best-selling video game consoles of all time is slated to release <strong>June 5</strong>, Nintendo announced during its hour-long livestream that fully lifted the veil on the Switch 2. You also don't have to wait much longer to preorder the Nintendo Switch 2, as Nintendo revealed that major retailers will open reservations online and in stores on <strong>April 9</strong>. The Nintendo Switch 2 will cost <strong>$450</strong> at launch. There will also be a bundle with a digital copy of the Switch 2-exclusive launch title Mario Kart World for $500.</p><h2>Nintendo Switch 2 Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>Video game consoles typically don't come with preorder bonuses in the same way that games often do, but with Nintendo products, retailers often have exclusive bonuses. These range from practical products themed around Nintendo, such as tote bags and popcorn buckets, to display pieces and little trinkets. One unknown retailer is rumored to have a collectible coin for those who preorder the Switch 2. We will update this article as Switch 2 preorder bonuses are confirmed.</p><p>We expect that all major retailers who typically carry Nintendo hardware and first-party games will create placeholder pages for the Nintendo Switch 2 either today or in the coming days. <strong><a href="https://howl.link/mchk0rsl3pobe?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17370520340753?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a></strong>, for instance, has had a sign-up page on its site since Nintendo officially announced the Switch 2 in January. You can still sign up to receive notifications now, if interested.

There's a chance, and perhaps a good one, that Amazon won't carry the Nintendo Switch 2 in general, or at least not at launch. Amazon is the only major retailer without a mention or Switch 2 banner on its site. When it comes to video games, the retailer's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Nintendo/page/BE0EB5D0-0AD6-4564-8BC5-4A129A3A9CFD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo store page</a> hasn't been updated in months.</p><p>For the past year, the relationship between Amazon and Nintendo has clearly been rocky. Amazon hasn't stocked the vast majority of first-party Nintendo Switch games, both new releases and hits from years past. Perhaps more telling is the fact that Amazon didn't carry the 2024 Nintendo Switch holiday bundles, the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F9822067437%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle%2F1100-6530531%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hyrule Edition Switch Lite</a>, or the recently released <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCONFIDENTIAL-885298%2F15177460250%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle%2F1100-6530531%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Bros.

Additional pairs of the new and improved Switch 2 Joy-Con Controllers will be available at launch. In the coming weeks, you can expect third-party accessory manufacturers to reveal new controllers, carrying cases, grips, screen protectors, and other accessories for Switch 2. Some third-party companies, such as the boundary-pushing manufacturer Dbrand, have been teasing Switch 2 accessories for months. Dbrand is creating a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15048490%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fgrip%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle%2F1100-6530531%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 2 version of its popular (and very good) Killswitch grip case</a>.</p><p><strong>You likely own a few "Switch 2" accessories already</strong></p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is also backward compatible with Switch accessories such as headsets and controllers--to an extent. For example, your Switch Joy-Con Controllers will work in docked mode with the Switch 2, but you can't connect them to the tablet for handheld mode. Accessories such as your Nintendo Switch carrying case are also unlikely to be compatible with Switch 2. But your <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller%2F55485228%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle%2F1100-6530531%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Pro Controller</a> and third-party gamepads such as the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller%2F55485228%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle%2F1100-6530531%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Wireless Controller</a>--our top pick for Nintendo Switch--will be compatible with Switch 2 from the jump.</p><p>Because of the sheer abundance of existing Switch accessories, there will likely be some interesting options to improve your Switch 2 experience at launch. The new Joy-Con don't appear to address one of the more common complaints about the default Switch 2 controllers: ergonomics. As such, grip cases and third-party alternatives for handheld mode will likely be popular this time around, too. Existing controllers like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8JJRCJN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameSir's G8 Plus</a> could be of interest, as this Bluetooth controller is compatible with Switch and tablets of up to 8.5 inches. It will certainly be able to cradle the Switch 2, and we'd be surprised if it isn't able to connect to the console.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-mario-kart-building-sets-get-nice-discounts-at-amazon/1100-6528603/">Lego Mario Kart Building Sets Get Nice Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pac-man-fans-can-preorder-shadow-labyrinth-secret-edition-for-only-60/1100-6528469/">Pac-Man Fans Can Preorder Shadow Labyrinth Secret Edition For Only $60</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers-4k-steelbook-edition-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6527748/">Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers 4K Steelbook Edition Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-sci-fi-and-fantasy-spring-book-sale-save-big-on-popular-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon Sci-Fi And Fantasy Spring Book Sale - Save Big On Popular Box Sets</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-sean-connery-4k-steelbook-collection-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6530389/">James Bond Sean Connery 4K Steelbook Collection Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-skywalker-saga-4k-box-set-featured-in-amazons-spring-sale/1100-6530379/">Star Wars Skywalker Saga 4K Box Set Featured In Amazon's Spring Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-controller-gets-nice-discount-a-month-after-its-release/1100-6529695/">8BitDo Ultimate 2 Controller Gets Nice Discount A Month After Its Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-4k-blu-rays-box-sets-in-amazons-b2g1-free-big-spring-sale/1100-6530318/">Best 4K Blu-Rays &amp; Box Sets In Amazon's B2G1 Free Big Spring Sale</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller was officially revealed during the latest Nintendo Direct, and it's making some incremental improvements to the existing gamepad. Launching on June 5 alongside Switch 2, it includes several new buttons--including a C button to launch GameChat and two back buttons.</p><p>Beyond the inclusion of new buttons, you'll also find a headphone jack--a notable omission on the current Switch Pro controller. Beyond that, it looks to share many of the same features. Nintendo is yet to confirm all its specifications, but we'd expect gyro controls and rumble to make a return. It's unclear if Hall Effect or TMR sensors are used for the joysticks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4469312-screenshot_2025-04-02_at_9.36.22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469312" data-ratio="0.59393063583815" data-width="692" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4469312-screenshot_2025-04-02_at_9.36.22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469312"></a><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4469312-screenshot_2025-04-02_at_9.36.22.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4469313-screenshot2025-04-02at9.36.38%E2%80%AFam.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4469314-screenshot2025-04-02at9.36.29%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4469313,1300-4469314" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4469313-screenshot2025-04-02at9.36.38%E2%80%AFam.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4469314-screenshot2025-04-02at9.36.29%E2%80%AFam.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4469313-screenshot2025-04-02at9.36.38%E2%80%AFam.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4469314-screenshot2025-04-02at9.36.29%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p>As far as looks are concerned, it's quite similar to the standard Switch Pro Controller. Featuring offset analog sticks, a D-pad, four face buttons, and four bumpers on the top of the gamepad, it looks remarkably similar to its predecessor.</p><p>The Joy-Con are also getting some new functionality, including not just a C button, but also the ability to function as a mouse for supported games. They also have larger buttons that should make it easier to use them when sharing with a friend.</p><p>Expect to hear more about Switch 2 Pro Controller pricing and hardware details at a later date.

                <p>Nintendo has announced a new 3v3 sports title: Drag x Drive. Releasing exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2, Drag x Drive will put your hoop-shooting skills--and the Joy-Con 2's mouse controls--to the test.</p><p>Revealed as a part of April's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Nintendo Switch 2 direct</a>, Drag x Drive sees you take control of your own wheelchair-wielding athlete in an intense game of something kinda-sorta resembling basketball. In order to move around and pull off maneuvers, players will have to use the new console's mouse controls, then take aim and lift the Joy-Con 2 into the air to shoot for the basket.</p><p>Drag x Drive's release date has yet to be announced.</p>

A short creature clad in armor wades through a dark pool, before launching a jetpack to quickly cross a canyon.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4469325-nintendodirect_nintendoswitch2%E2%80%934.2.20251-24-40screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4469325" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4469325-nintendodirect_nintendoswitch2%E2%80%934.2.20251-24-40screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4469325"></a><figcaption>There are a variety of weapon types in The Duskbloods</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4469325-nintendodirect_nintendoswitch2%E2%80%934.2.20251-24-40screenshot.png"></figure><p>Characters appear to be able to hover in midair for short periods of time, and the silver-haired character is seen biting the neck of an enemy, lending further credibility to the vampire-like-creature theory.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4469326-nintendodirect_nintendoswitch2%E2%80%934.2.20251-23-59screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4469326" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4469326-nintendodirect_nintendoswitch2%E2%80%934.2.20251-23-59screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4469326"></a><figcaption>Many weird enemies await in The Duskbloods</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4469326-nintendodirect_nintendoswitch2%E2%80%934.2.20251-23-59screenshot.png"></figure><p>While there is an element of history in the scenes shown, vehicles including trains and weapons including guns suggest The Duskbloods timeline is set more recently than Elden Ring's 5,000 years ago.

            <p>
The Switch 2 is getting a brand new 3D Donkey Kong platformer.
</p>
<p>
Donkey Kong Bananza won't be a launch title, but will be released on 17th July. That's a month after the console launches on 5th June.
</p>
<p>
Most notably, the game features a re-designed Donkey Kong model that appears to be the same as that used in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-announced-as-switch-2-launch-title-complete-with-24-player-races-new-modes-and-more">new Mario Kart World</a> (and similar to his design in the Mario film).

<p>
In the trailer, we see the gorilla punching, climbing and rolling his way through 3D destructible environments. 
</p>
<p>
He also has some sort of purple rock-crystal companion on his shoulder. In fact, many of the enemies appear to be made of crystals.
</p>
<p>
And of course there are both mine cart sections and 2D sections, as you'd expect from a traditional Donkey Kong game.
</p>
<p>
This will be the first 3D Donkey Kong platformer since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, and follows <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a> - the Wii remake released on Switch earlier this year. It also ties in nicely with the new Donkey Kong area of the Super Mario World theme parks.
</p>
<p>
Also at the Direct, Nintendo announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">release date and price of the Switch 2</a>.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</a> is coming to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, though no release date was given.
</p>
<p>
Though rumoured, the news was confirmed at today's Switch 2 Direct, along with tonnes of other games.
</p>
<p>
This is the first part only of the Remake trilogy, though will include the Intermission DLC starring Yuffie as with the Intergrade re-release on PC and PS5.

<p>
There was no mention of the second part, last year's Rebirth. "Please look forward to more updates on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> remake project for Switch 2," said director Naoki Hamaguchi in the presentation.</p>
<p>Though the third part is yet to be officially revealed, it's unclear if that will be a PlayStation console exclusive at launch.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> arrives on Switch 2 five years after its initial release on PS4. While the original PS1 game is already available on the original Switch, this will be the first time Remake will be on a Nintendo console.
</p>
<p>
This is all part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's multiplatform strategy</a> after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>'s initial PlayStation release underperformed. The power of the Switch 2 should allow for other more recent games to be released on Nintendo's new console.

            <p>
Well, where to start! As part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-live-everything-announced-as-it-happens">Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct</a>, FromSoftware has unveiled a brand-new title. It's called The Duskbloods, it's coming to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">Switch 2</a> next year, and it looks <em>wild</em>.
</p>
<p>
There's little information to share about The Duskbloods right now, beyond it's frankly eye-popping announcement trailer, but it looks very much like it's in the classic Soulsborne mode - just with a whole lot of <em>everything</em> thrown in.
</p>
<p>
It's got a huge clock tower reminiscent of Bloodborne, Eastern influences triggering recollections of Sekiro, it's got character design that looks like it's tumbled straight out of Dark Souls - and that's before we even get to the jetpacks, the steampunk influences, and the fact players can transform into blimmin' T. rexes!
