            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-reports-strong-profits-hands-out-ps20-million-to-staff<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Employees at Games Workshop are getting a pay bonus. Despite the tabletop industry being highly volatile due to reckless <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a> disrupting trade and imports, the UK-based studio has reported growth. Growth that will be given to its staff.</p>

<h2>The Games Workshop Windfall</h2>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/warhammer-games-workshop-staff-payout-b2756495.html" rel="nofollow">The Independent</a>, Games Workshop will be distributing bonus payments to its staff drawn from profits. These bonus payments will be distributed on an equal basis to each member of the staff. The studio, most well-known for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer: 40,000 </em></a>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</em></a>, stated the payout was in recognition of its employees' contributions to financial performance.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=QoeV3s9Y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=SlKjeshh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That performance has led to a £20 million windfall for the company, demonstrating strong sales and growth. This is a notable increase from last year, which saw £18 million shared among the staff for stellar performance. Considering other tabletop studios have either shut down or have filed lawsuits in response to current events, this report of growth is unexpected.</p>

<p>As for how much that&nbsp;£20 million will break down among the Games Workshop staff, that is harder to parse. GW doesn't disclose how many employees they have, but it is believed they have 1,500 employees in their home base in Nottingham. Assuming that number is correct, that would mean each employee may be getting about £13k in pay bonuses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the staff number cited doesn't take into account global employees, either in offices outside the UK or working online.</p>

<p>A major factor in Games Workshop's growth are its licensed video games. These include ongoing support for Owlcat Games' RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</em></a> and Saber Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/space-marine-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em></a>. This is in addition to strong sales and ongoing support for the company's many tabletop miniatures games.</p>

<p>The growth of Games Workshop may not be slowing down anytime soon. The company has <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/amazon-warhammer-40000-film-contract-signed-production-can-now-begin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">partnered with Amazon</a> and Vertigo Entertainment to produce official movies and TV shows set within the grimdark sci-fi world of <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>. Better still, the production has the star power of Henry Cavill on board.</p>

If you just want a fun, colorful throwback to pass the time, my suggestion is <em>Penny’s Big Breakaway</em>, one of last year’s great unsung Dreamcast 3D platformer homages. </p><p>There are two other Switch games that are only slightly on sale but might be of interest. The <em>Chrono Trigger</em>-like <em>Sea of Stars</em> is currently $22.75 (around 30 percent off), but just got a big free <em>Throes of the Watchmaker</em> DLC that adds a new eight-hour quest, additional character, and more classes. <em>Labyrinth of the Demon King, </em>meanwhile, is a lo-fi horror dungeon crawler that just came out last week and is already turning heads. It’s $16 this week (20 percent off). If you’re interested in what might end up on the list of 2025's most overlooked games, I’d give this one a shot. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/parks-2nd-edition-board-game-review.1197825/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/parks-2nd-edition-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When the original Parks released in 2019, it quickly became a modern classic, thanks in large part to its gorgeous artwork celebrating the U.S. National Parks. See our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/parks-board-game-review">review</a> for details on that first edition. But Keymaster Games didn’t just slap a fresh coat of paint on the 2nd Edition and call it a day. Instead, it thoughtfully combined the base game with its expansions, streamlining the gameplay, updating the visuals, and introducing new features, all while preserving that cozy game feel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The result is something that feels like both a sequel and a revision. Either way, the 2nd Edition of Parks is a great excuse to hit the trails, snap some photos, and fill your canteen all over again.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What's in the Box</h2><div catalogid="04f06aa9-6449-4d2e-9c89-8b6612131675" id="220791"><div id="220791" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Parks (2nd Edition)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the original version, the second edition of Parks comes in a beautifully designed box packed with components that live up to its iconic design. Right on top, you'll find a textured, high-quality rulebook that's easy to follow and includes a QR code that links to a helpful video if you prefer to learn by watching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Parks is relatively straightforward to play, it includes a wide variety of components. Two log-shaped containers hold the game's colorful wooden tokens, representing the resources you'll collect while hiking the trail. Beneath those is a tri-fold game board with clearly marked spaces to guide you easily through setup. The game board has been completely redesigned and expanded, with an all-new permanent trail area, canteen tile drafting section, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real standout is the built-in storage tray at the bottom of the box, which is the best I’ve seen across the 60-plus board games I own. Everything has its place, from tokens and tiles to dice and cards, all packed efficiently to keep the game’s footprint compact, while making cleanup a breeze. The tray holds decks for the Parks, Gear, Passion, Ranger Teddy, and Volunteer Projects cards, along with solo reference cards, Season and Campsite tiles, Photo and Hiker tokens, Trail Site tiles, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player gets a board featuring an empty backpack and water bottle, with clearly marked sections around the edges for organizing visited and reserved parks, purchased gear, and more. The Backpack holds up to 12 resources, while the water bottle has six spaces for Canteen tiles you can fill as you play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest updates in the 2nd Edition is the expanded card set, which now includes <em>all</em> 63 U.S. National Parks, up from 48 in the original. The cards feature all-new artwork and clean iconography that better matches the game's updated, more colorful design. While some fans may miss the original illustrations from the <a href="https://59parks.net/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fifty-Nine Parks print series</a>, the new art feels more cohesive and fits well with the rest of the game’s style. Each card includes the park’s name, founding date, and a short blurb about what makes it unique.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay in the second edition of Parks is a streamlined take on the original, incorporating elements from both expansions. The goal is simple: score the most points by hiking the trail, visiting parks, snapping photos, and completing optional objectives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To set up, each player takes a pair of hikers and the matching player board. They also receive a random Canteen token, placed on their board, and a Campfire token flipped to its lit side if playing with more than three players. Each player is then dealt two Passion cards and chooses one to keep, discarding the other. Lastly, the First Hiker token is given to the designated starting player.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Gameplay in the second edition of Parks is a streamlined take on the original, incorporating elements from both expansions.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Passion cards provide small thematic goals to chase during the game, such as visiting parks with specific icons, using Wildlife tokens to take photos, or buying Gear from the item shop. Once completed, you can flip the card to choose one of two rewards: an ongoing effect that lasts the rest of the game, or an endgame bonus that adds extra points to your final score. Some Passions are easier to complete than others, and I usually leaned toward the endgame bonuses as those extra points were often the difference between winning and losing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each round in Parks takes place during one of three seasons: spring, summer, or fall. All three seasons are drawn randomly at the start of the game and each offers a unique bonus, such as rewarding players for collecting the most of a specific resource or visiting parks with certain icons. While spring and summer don’t grant any extra points, the fall season awards three bonus points to the winner, making it especially appealing. Players can choose to ignore these objectives, but they offer useful incentives if they align with your goals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On their turn, players move one of their two hikers forward along the trail, collecting resources or performing the action on the Trail Site tile above the space they land on. Since you can only move forward toward Trail’s End, careful planning is key. Trail Site tiles can offer specific resources like sun, water, forest, and mountain; let you buy Gear from the item shop; allow you either to take a photo by exchanging any resource or add a token to your Canteen; roll the Trail Die for a random bonus; or trade any resource for a Wildlife token (which, fittingly, acts as a wild resource token). Every tile is shuffled each season to keep things fresh and unpredictable, except the Parks space, which is permanently located in the middle of the trail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Landing on the Parks space lets you either reserve a park or visit one by paying its resource cost. If you have enough resources, you can even visit multiple parks on the same turn, making this space crucial for scoring points. Because of that, it’s often the most hotly-contested spot on the board. Thankfully, there’s no limit to how many parks you can reserve, and no penalty for not visiting them before the game ends. However, since you can’t reserve and visit in the same action, each choice on this space carries real weight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parks is ultimately a game about opportunity cost. Every move asks the question: <em>What am I giving up by going here?</em> Many Trail Sites offer one-time bonus resources, so players are racing to grab what they can before others beat them to it. Since each Trail Site is unique each season, and you can't share a space with another player (including yourself) unless you use a lit campfire, every decision matters. You might skip ahead to grab a key resource or reach a specific site, but doing so means sacrificing everything you passed along the way, with no chance to go back until the following season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like many <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-worker-placement-board-games">worker placement games</a>, the real strategy in Parks comes from using both of your hikers in tandem to block opponents from collecting key resources or taking valuable actions. In higher player count games, the trail can get crowded fast, so refreshing your campfire to share spaces becomes essential. In lower player count games, there’s more room to breathe, allowing you to slow down and hit more spots along the trail. When a player reaches the Trail’s End, they choose one of three actions: take the Parks action, pay any resource to take a photo, or buy Gear. The first hiker to arrive at each space also gets a one-time bonus, adding an incentive to rush the trail. This constant push and pull between slowing down to gather resources and racing ahead for rewards is the real special sauce that makes Parks shine.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Parks is ultimately a game about opportunity cost. Every move asks the question: <em>What am I giving up by going here?</em></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Because your Backpack can only hold 12 resources, you need to manage your inventory carefully by spending resources when possible, or you risk having to discard valuable ones at the end of your turn. The Canteen, by contrast, offers flexible bonuses whenever you collect water. Instead of placing the water in your Backpack, you can slot it into a Canteen to gain a resource or perform an action, depending on what you’ve collected. Some tiles even grant powerful effects, like taking the important Parks action. Once used, Canteen bonuses remain unavailable until the next season, so timing matters. Overall, they’re a clever way to give players alternative paths to key actions and resources without relying solely on open trail spaces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another way to earn points on the trail is by taking photos. This is most commonly done by visiting a Trail Site or the Trail’s End space with a photo icon, where you can exchange any single resource to take a photo worth one point. The player with the most photos at the end of the game also earns bonus points, giving you a good reason to snap a few along the way. If you land on a space with the Shutterbug badge, you’ll claim the Shutterbug token, which lets you take a second photo each time you use the photo action, as long as you can pay for it. However, the token can be taken by other players, so make the most of it while it’s yours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During your expedition, you’ll have chances to visit the Gear shop and purchase items to help you along the trail. Gear costs between one and three sun resources, depending on the effect. While Gear doesn’t directly earn you points, it offers light <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine-building</a> opportunities like gaining bonus resources at specific Trail Sites, filling your Canteen after certain actions, or refreshing your Campfire more often. That said, I found the Gear shop to be hit or miss, unless it directly benefits your overall gameplan. You’re usually better off saving your resources for visiting parks, since that’s where the real points are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Parks supports solo play and up to five players, I found it shines best with two or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-three-player-board-games">three players</a>. However, the strategy feels much more cutthroat at two players (a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board game</a>, this is not). Regardless of player count, when only one player has hikers left on the trail, they must move both hikers to Trail’s End on their next turn. This rule keeps players from being too greedy with trying to hit every space along the way, as they risk being rushed and missing out on more valuable opportunities. In a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player game</a>, this is even more noticeable, since one player can jump to the end early and force the other to skip potential turns needed to catch up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you have a few hikes under your belt, you can add optional modules to Parks to increase variety or raise the difficulty. The Camping mode introduces three tents to the trail, allowing you to choose from a pool of powerful bonuses. However, using a tent means you cannot collect resources or use the action at that Trail Site. Volunteer Projects add more challenge by introducing restrictions that players must follow, such as spending extra resources when visiting parks, limiting the number of Wildlife tokens you can hold, or only being allowed to visit parks you’ve already reserved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parks includes a full <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo mode</a> that pits you against Ranger Teddy, an automa made up of two sets of hikers that take actions by flipping cards to determine their movement. Your goal is to achieve the highest score possible, which adds plenty of replayability. While Ranger Teddy’s hikers don’t collect resources, purchase Gear, or visit parks directly, they discard those elements when landing on the corresponding spaces, effectively simulating the pressure of competing players. Because their movement is often unpredictable, you’ll need to stay on your toes in order to succeed. You can also add Ranger Teddy to multiplayer games to simulate more players on the trail and add some variety.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Parks (2nd Edition)</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a03b63?object_uuid=f5a59f38-3e1e-4251-8ac5-9d190a74c934&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgJqo?object_uuid=f5a59f38-3e1e-4251-8ac5-9d190a74c934&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Atomic Empire</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9l3eGN?object_uuid=f5a59f38-3e1e-4251-8ac5-9d190a74c934&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Keymaster Games</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QdbZV1?object_uuid=f5a59f38-3e1e-4251-8ac5-9d190a74c934&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">More Family-Friendly Board Games We Recommend</h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>May 23, 2025 6:50 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Parks (2nd Edition) is a cozy strategy game that pairs beautiful visuals with deceptively simple worker placement. It builds on everything that made the original great, refining the experience with streamlined rules that are easy to learn but still reward smart play. Its interconnected systems create fresh challenges each time you hit the trail, encouraging careful planning and efficient turns. While visiting parks remains central to the experience, new scoring opportunities provide ample ways to outmaneuver your opponents. Optional modules add variety and difficulty for seasoned players, while the revamped solo mode and Ranger Teddy automa provide plenty of reasons to come back for one more hike.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Licensing revenue was £50 million, up from £31 million. Core profit is £210 million, up from £174.8 million, and licensing profit is £45 million, up from £27 million. That amounts to profit before tax of £255 million, up from £203 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Off the back of those huge profits, and “in recognition of our staff’s contribution to these results,” Games Workshop is giving employees £20 million, up from the £18 million it handed out last year. The money will be paid on an equal basis to each member of staff. Games Workshop is estimated to have around 1,500 staff. If that’s accurate, it means each employee is set for a £13,333 (approx $18,000) bonus.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop’s main business is the sale of miniatures fans assemble and paint for use in tabletop wargames, such as Warhammer 40,000. But it is increasingly an IP business, with huge revenue from smash hit video games such as last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, and animations, such as Amazon’s Warhammer 40,000 Secret Level episode. Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-finalize-deal-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-but-production-may-take-a-number-of-years">Games Workshop and Amazon finalized a deal for Henry Cavill's Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe</a>, which will involve the creation of films and television series. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-iii">Space Marine 3 is also in development.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where does Games Workshop go from here? The company pointed out that licensing revenue in the period is at a record level and it does not expect this to be repeated in 2025/26, although it remains a core focus. Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer generally is bigger than it’s ever been, and based on these results, it’s not slowing down any time soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop recently held its annual Warhammer Skulls showcase, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-returns-space-marine-master-crafted-edition-and-more-all-the-announcements-and-trailers-from-warhammer-skulls-2025">we’ve got all the announcements and trailers right here</a>.

                <p>One of the most intriguing developments with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is that the Joy-Con 2 controllers have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-supports-joy-con-mouse-controls/2900-6517/" data-ref-id="2900-6517">mouse-like functionality for certain games</a>. That's been a long-requested feature, but players who love using mice appear to have that option on Switch 2 as well.</p><p>During a demonstration for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nobunagas-ambition-awakening-announced-for-pc-ps4-and-switch/1100-6512819/" data-ref-id="1100-6512819">Nobunaga's Ambition: Awakening CE</a> on Switch 2 (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-supports-standard-usb-mice/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>), producer Michi Ryu plugged a wired mouse into the console and began playing with it. He also noted that when the mouse is plugged in, it takes priority control away from the Joy-Con 2 controllers. Ryu used the mouse around the 10:53 mark in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CstlgmcDgy0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CstlgmcDgy0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This doesn't necessarily mean that all Switch 2 games will be compatible with a standard mouse. It's also unclear if wireless mice are also usable on Switch 2. XCOM creator Julian Gollop recently suggested that Switch 2's mouse options <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-xcom-creator-thinks-switch-2-mouse-controls-have-big-strategy-game-potential/1100-6531445/" data-ref-id="1100-6531445">may lead to more strategy games on the system</a>.</p><p>Nintendo's upcoming 3v3 sports title, Drag x Drive, will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-drag-x-drive-a-switch-2-game-that-relies-on-mouse-controls/1100-6530555/" data-ref-id="1100-6530555">extensively feature the Joy-Con 2's mouse capabilities</a>. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will also incorporate the ability to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-will-let-you-swap-to-mouse-controls-on-the-fly/1100-6530602/" data-ref-id="1100-6530602">switch between Joy-Con 2's controller and mouse-like capabilities on the fly</a>. That may make aiming a lot easier in the upcoming sequel. Nintendo also recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-offers-a-first-glimpse-at-how-mouse-controls-work-on-switch-2s-home-menu/1100-6531454/" data-ref-id="1100-6531454">a better look at how the Joy-Con 2's mouse capabilities</a> will work.</p>

                <p>Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann has further discussed the company's upcoming new IP, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalatic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, saying it offers the "deepest" gameplay for any game the studio has made so far. Druckmann also briefly discussed the backlash from some people to the game's unveiling.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8tOTQhepAI&amp;t=3886s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last Stand Media</a> (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/just-stick-to-your-guns-neil-druckmann-isnt-phased-by-all-the-hate-intergalactic-got-theres-stuff-happening-with-media-right-now-that-you-just-have-to-ignore/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via PC Gamer</a>), Druckmann said he's "very, very excited" for Intergalactic, adding that "it's the deepest gameplay we've ever done." It's not exactly clear what he means by that, but we should find out in time. "I can't wait to show it off," Druckmann said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4499918-hereticlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4499918" data-ratio="0.55225311601151" data-width="1043" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4499918-hereticlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4499918"></a><figcaption>A scene from Intergalactic.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4499918-hereticlarge.jpeg"></figure><p>The reveal trailer for Intergalactic showed main character Jordan A. Mun in a spaceship before she descended down onto a planet to fight a giant robot enemy with a red sword. The trailer cut out <em>just </em>as the action was set to begin, so we can only guess as to what happens next.</p><p>Also in the interview, Druckmann reacted to some of the controversy surrounding Intergalactic, and specifically the misogynistic and racist comments directed at Tati Gabrielle, who plays Mun.</p><p>"I don't know if there's much I could add to that conversation, to be honest," Druckmann said. "There's stuff happening with media right now that you just have to ignore for the most part, just stick to your guns, and do what you believe in.

			<p>FromSoftware's Elden Ring Nightreign launches next week. Ahead of the much-hyped debut, IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first?utm_source=threads,twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Game Director Junya Ishizaki to dive deeper into the multiplayer spin-off game.</p>
<p>One of the main criticisms levied at Elden Ring Nightreign so far is that, according to FromSoftware, it is tailored either for playing solo or with a party of three players. Ishizaki-san admitted that duo groups have been overlooked during the development phase, but added that it is being looked and proper support may be added after launch.</p>
<p><em>The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that. As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign. Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start. And so we did put a lot of effort into creating this experience that was playable for solo players in as much as the rules and new systems allowed. So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well.</em></p>
<p>There's also no PvP whatsoever in Elden Ring Nightreign, unlike Elden Ring itself. Ishizaki said that it was never even considered:</p>
<p><em>From the start, PVP was not something that we very actively considered for Nightreign. We wanted it to be a co-op multiplayer experience at its core and we found that as we developed these character actions and these unique abilities for each character, balancing them and tweaking them around PVP as well proved to be very… Not only very difficult, but took away from those ideas and that scope that we'd established for each of these characters. So we really wanted the focus to be on PVE and on co-op, and so we knew where our priorities were. So no, we didn't consider PVP in Nightreign.</em></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is launching on May 30 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Check out our latest preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

Like many other adventure games of its era, <em>Onimusha 2</em> doesn’t take that long to beat, but its branching story paths make it worth revisiting over and over again. </p><h2 id="h2171762"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em>?</h2><p><strong>A standard playthrough of <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em> can take about 10 to 15 hours to beat if you’re just focusing on the story and if it’s your first time</strong>. It’s quite similar to Capcom’s most notable franchise, <em>Resident Evil</em>, where repeated playthroughs will increase your familiarity, allowing you to beat it quicker on subsequent runs. Speedrunners have completed this game in under than five hours. In fact, the remaster has an achievement for finishing the game within that time.</p><p>If you want to earn all the Achievements and/or Trophies, you’ll also have to beat the game on Ultimate mode, as well as finish a complete playthrough without enhancing any of your weapons or using any jewels.<strong> All of these additional playthroughs can add up to 20 more hours of playtime to the total count</strong>. You’ll also need to collect all files and maps for their respective completion achievements/trophies, which can take multiple playthroughs if you somehow miss any of them.</p><figure id="" data-id="027f14dc6984ce80bd6aa2cbcc0d6956" data-recommend-id="image://027f14dc6984ce80bd6aa2cbcc0d6956" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character in Onimusha 2 glows with energy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character in Onimusha 2 glows with energy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="027f14dc6984ce80bd6aa2cbcc0d6956" data-recommend-id="image://027f14dc6984ce80bd6aa2cbcc0d6956" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character in Onimusha 2 glows with energy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are also multiple endings depending on your friendship with various characters like Ekei, Kotaro, and Magoichi.

I also asked them if the console will support USB keyboards. If so, that would make the Switch 2, which launches on June 5, even more of a direct competitor to the Steam Deck. Either way, I’m excited that the console will support more control options, as that allows more people to play in whatever way works best for them. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Is it weird to have nostalgia for an operating system? I don't mean missing a particular feature that's been removed from modern versions or a specific productivity setting that's no longer supported. I mean a sense of longing for the vibes of the computer interface you grew up with, an ache for the aesthetics of user interfaces past.</p>
<p>I would have thought I was immune to this particular brand of nostalgia. Then I happened upon <em>Desktop Survivors 98</em>, a new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/vampire-survivors-a-cheap-minimalistic-indie-game-is-my-game-of-the-year/"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>-style "bullet heaven" autoshooter that leans hard into the aesthetics of the late '90s Windows machines I grew up with. And while that low-res, 256-color presentation is what drew me in, it was the intriguing mouse-controlled gameplay underneath that has kept me coming back for more retro-styled action all week.</p>
<h2>Start me up</h2>
<p>When it comes to capturing the feel of the '90s computer environment, <em>Desktop Survivors 98</em> gets everything just right. This is in large part due to rampant theft of familiar old-school icons; items like My Computer, Calculator, <em>Minesweeper</em>, Search, and more look like they were taken directly from a classic Microsoft tile set. The game's low-res desktop backgrounds and Windows also look like they came out of a years-old Microsoft style book.</p>
<p>But much of the nostalgic appeal of <em>Desktop Survivors</em> is in the little nods to how computers used to work.&nbsp;<span>It's in the faux Start menu in the corner to access various menus and the Settings window that uses&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old Visual Basic-style sliders and buttons</a>.</span>&nbsp;It's in the way the item shop looks like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2009/04/geocities-to-close-after-15-years-of-aesthetic-awesomeness/">a teenager's first Geocities page</a>&nbsp;and the "boss mode" icon that can hide the game in an instant. It's even in how the game jumps into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=queN9r3Leis">the old Mystify screensaver</a> if you leave it idle for too long. This is a game that was obviously made with a lot of love for the old-school versions of Windows that inspired it.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<figure>
    <div>
            <p>
              That blue bar sure does take me back...
                          </p>

      </figure>

<p>If that kind of nostalgia were all there was to <em>Desktop Survivors 98,</em> it would probably not be worth much more than a 15-minute demo. But the underlying game actually takes the developing Survivors-like genre in some interesting directions.</p>
<p>As usual for the genre, the gameplay here centers around navigating through throngs of encroaching enemies (and their projectiles), all while herding those enemies together so your auto-firing weapons can take them out. Defeated enemies drop gems that are crucial to gaining new weapons and powers that also lean heavily on nostalgic computing gags—I particularly liked one weapon based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnT54Dcy86w">the "flower box" screensaver</a>&nbsp;and another based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbQ5OveB6TY">the "bouncing cards" at the end of a successful <em>Solitaire</em> game</a>.</p>
<p>Theming aside, the main element that sets <em>Desktop Survivors</em> apart from its predecessors in the genre is the mouse-based controls. Your old-school mouse pointer is your character here, meaning you get to precisely dodge and dart around the screen with all the speed and accuracy you'd expect from such a flexible input device.</p>

<figure>
    <div>
            <p>
              Once you move through these dungeons with a mouse, you won't want to go back to a joystick.

      </figure>

<p>While there is a serviceable Steam Deck mode designed for analog stick-based movements, it's a hard control paradigm to return to after experiencing the freedom and speed of mouse movements. Decades of mouse use have likely been preparing you for just this moment, training you to weave your pointer through the tight, quickly closing spaces between enemies without really having to think about it.</p>
<h2>More of the same?</h2>
<p><em>Desktop Survivors</em> also sets itself apart by taking place on a series of single-screen battlefields rather than smoothly scrolling maps. These rooms don't feature any significant obstacles or walls to block your movements, either, making each enemy room play kind of similarly to the ones you've seen before it. This also makes it a little easier to avoid many enemies simply by scrubbing your mouse pointer in a wide circle, causing the enemy horde to bunch up in comical blobs.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>This complaint falls away when you stumble on optional boss rooms. There, talkative and inventive retro references (appearing in all their low-color-depth, pre-rendered "3D" glory) bounce around the screen while firing all kinds of difficult projectile patterns that require careful and quick movement to avoid. It's a nerve-rattling test of precise mouse movement that really stresses the "survivors" part of the game's name.</p>
<figure>
    <div>
            <p>
              Just one of the many zany, pre-rendered bosses you'll discover in <em>Desktop Survivors 98.</em>

<p>Unfortunately, it can be hard to work your way up to the weapon and item levels needed to effectively take on these bosses. That's because each room effectively kicks you out after the expiration of a tight timer, setting a strict limit on how much you can farm enemies for those all-important gems you need to increase your levels.</p>
<p>This makes it crucially important to kill a lot of enemies quickly in early rooms so you can snowball into more powerful weapons that will kill enemies more efficiently, for even more power-ups to come. Some weapons are much better suited to this efficient killing than others, which makes it tough to recommend some otherwise interesting attack options.</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_XVHLj12Pik?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p>None of these balance and variety nitpicks are enough to outweigh the simple fun of <em>Desktop Survivors 98</em>, though. Wiggling your mouse around rooms full of pixelated enemies and watching the screen explode into a cacophony of low-res explosions scratches a twitch-gaming itch that's about a lot more than nostalgia. And the sheer depth of unlockable weapons and powerful pointers will keep completionists coming back for quite a while.</p>
<p>Just be sure to click that boss button before you get caught goofing off.</p>

Don’t expect any complicated mechanics like ones found in modern games like <em>Sekiro </em>or anything like that. However, there’s still plenty of fun to have with Jubei as he sets out to defeat Nobunaga. Let’s go over a few tips </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196646,196215" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h2183277"><a id="1"></a>Impale your enemies</h2><figure id="" data-id="88b3e9eda6a3723880d63059b35a71b9" data-recommend-id="image://88b3e9eda6a3723880d63059b35a71b9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A protagonist of Onimusha 2 braces for an attack from two enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A protagonist of Onimusha 2 braces for an attack from two enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="88b3e9eda6a3723880d63059b35a71b9" data-recommend-id="image://88b3e9eda6a3723880d63059b35a71b9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A protagonist of Onimusha 2 braces for an attack from two enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Whenever Jubei downs his enemies, you have the opportunity to walk over to their bodies and impale them with a downward stab simply by pressing the attack button while standing on top. This move is an automatic OHKO (one-hit-knock-out) and prevents enemies from getting back up. Enemies don’t have any health bars so it’s impossible to know how much more health they have until they disappear. But with the downward stab, you’ll know they’re gone for good.</p><p>Just be careful, though, as <strong>you can still be hit by other enemies in the middle of the animation</strong>. Sometimes you won’t get the chance to impale them. But either way, if you have the opportunity to do so, definitely take it as it’s one less enemy to deal with.</p><h2 id="h2183278"><a id="2"></a>Absorb every soul</h2><p>Early on in the game, Jubei will get the ability to absorb souls from enemies that he’s defeated. Red souls can be spent upgrading Jubei’s weapons and capabilities, while the yellow and blue ones replenish Jubei’s health and magic, respectively. Jubei can also transform into a powerful and invincible demon for a short time if he collects five purple souls.</p><p><strong>In this remaster, players can now control when Jubei enters this powerful mode</strong> whereas in the original, it automatically activated once the fifth soul was collected. So definitely take advantage of it to unleash hell at opportune times.</p><p>Also, souls disappear after a while if they aren’t absorbed, so make sure to not leave them hanging or you’ll regret it.</p><h2 id="h2183279"><a id="3"></a>Regularly switch up your weapons</h2><figure id="" data-id="be6c2bf09a4216473f472bacbeacb568" data-recommend-id="image://be6c2bf09a4216473f472bacbeacb568" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A protagonist in Onimusha 2 impales an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A protagonist in Onimusha 2 impales an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="be6c2bf09a4216473f472bacbeacb568" data-recommend-id="image://be6c2bf09a4216473f472bacbeacb568" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A protagonist in Onimusha 2 impales an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Onimusha 2</em>, there are plenty of weapons to collect, each with their own unique effects. The Buraitou is a lightning sword that’s both fast and powerful, making it a fantastic all-rounder. The Hyojin-Yari is an ice lance and it has the longest reach out of all the weapons. Use it if you want to keep a safe distance.</p><p>The general idea is to <strong>switch between weapons so that you can maintain an advantage over your enemies</strong>.

Usually, in games featuring the famous turtle crimefighters, you punch and kick a ton of goons in real-time, either alone or with some buddies. That’s not the case in <em>TMNT: Tactical Takedown,</em> which is instead a turn-based tactics game. Thankfully, the shift to turn-based mostly works for the Turtles, even if the game is a bit barebones. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197562" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="197562,196394,196599" data-current="197562"><div><p>THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23086.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In <em>TMNT: Tactical Takedown</em>, battles play out on small maps covered in grids. Each mission features one turtle fighting his way through these maps turn-by-turn, while enemies spawn throughout, also moving on their own turns across the grid. Your goal is often to clear out the baddies while reaching the end of the level. </p><p>At first, I was worried that this tactical and slower-paced turn-based gameplay wouldn’t feel <em>TMNT</em>-enough, that it would lack the kinetic excitement of most of the <em>Ninja Turtle</em> games and shows. But, developers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-strange-scaffold-black-in-gaming-1851352903&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-strange-scaffold-black-in-gaming-1851352903">Strange Scaffold</a></span> (of <em>Witch Stranding</em>, <em>E</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-max-payne-control-creepy-ps1-review-1850871547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-max-payne-control-creepy-ps1-review-1850871547"><em>l, Paso Elsewhere</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>and <em>Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3</em> fame) did a great job infusing the strategic gameplay with flourishes and ideas that make it feel plenty exciting and fast-paced. </p><p>One significant way <em>TMNT: Tactical Takedown</em> makes the action feel exciting is ensuring that you don’t hang out in one area during missions. Instead, you are pushed forward every few turns as the levels grow ahead of you and fall behind you. For example, during one mission, I entered some subway trains and as the train started, the grid outside of the train turned red—a visual warning it was about to vanish—disappearing along with some goons. Then, once the train reached its station, and I had beaten up another dozen or so Foot Clan members, I exited before the carriage itself fell into the void, taking more baddies with it.</p><p> Having levels change every few turns means I had to keep moving forward, similar to an old-school beat ‘em up. And you can even take advantage of the levels changing by kicking back enemies into the red areas and watching them fall into nothing on your next turn. However, it’s even more fun to kick them off the edge of the maps, something I did a lot<em>. </em></p><p>Another design choice I appreciated is that most of the Turtles’ moves encourage you to be aggressive, and then reward it. A lot of times in <em>Tactical Takedown,</em> I was taking out multiple enemies in one turn by chaining attacks in satisfying ways, although given this also means the game is designed around you defeating tons of enemies quickly, it leads to some missions quickly filling up with Foot Clan soldiers who can too often overwhelm your Turtles if you make a mistake. I wonder if, for those hoping for a more arcade-like experience, <em>Tactical Takedown</em> might prove too tactically challenging. </p><p>Of course, any <em>TMNT </em>game is going to star the Turtles themselves, and this is easily the best part of the <em>Tactical Takedown.</em> The Turtles are separated for the entire game, mostly, and that’s a bit strange—sure, if you do enough cool shit you can pull off a team up move—but most of the time you are playing as each turtle separately. </p><figure id="" data-id="37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-recommend-id="image://37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Strange Scaffold / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-recommend-id="image://37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But while they don’t fight side by side throughout most of the game, they do talk to each other via cutscenes, and the writing here is excellent. I won’t spoil too much, but the conflict between the brothers is the core of the tale, and it’s shocking how invested I got in the rather simple, but well-delivered story of four mutated turtle warriors dealing with grief, loss, and trying to pick up the pieces together.</p><p>Sadly, too much of<em> TMNT: Tactical Takedown</em> feels barebones. Levels look fine, but are very simple, rarely featuring varying locations or details. The Turtles all play differently, with various moves that reflect their personality, but so many sound effects are reused. Couple that with simplistic, stiff combat animations and levels that go on for too long, and <em>Tactical Takedown</em> can often feel like a game that is trying to trick you into thinking it’s more than it is.</p><p>Still, I’m happy <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> was made, and that I played it. It’s a unique spin on the franchise, and the turn-based combat is frenetic and fun. I also love the way the Turtles are depicted in cutscenes. It’s a shame that there’s not much else here, but what is there is good and feels like a solid foundation for future DLC or sequels that could add more. </p><p> <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown </em>launched on May 22 for PC. It is available now on Steam and runs great on Steam Deck. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For the duos out there though, it sounds like you'll need to be open to a third.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first">IGN's interview with Elden Ring Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki</a>, the Nightreign lead discussed the choice to lean on solos and trios as the core experience options. When asked why there's no option for a pair of players to drop in together without a matchmade third player, Ishizaki said it was overlooked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that," said Ishizaki. "As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start," Ishizaki continued. "And so we did put a lot of effort into creating this experience that was playable for solo players in as much as the rules and new systems allowed. So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if you're playing with just your favorite duos partner, be ready to accept a random third into your lives. Who knows? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-me-solo-her-elden-ring-community-hero">You might match up with someone pretty good at the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're playing solo, it does sound like Elden Ring Nightreign takes that into account. Ishizaki said the parameters of Elden Ring Nightreign "adjust dynamically depending on the number of players in that session," so lone wolves shouldn't be too overwhelmed in single-player.</p><div id="top-25-fromsoftware-bosses" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3><h3>Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll have to find and locate some self-revive options, which are incorporated for those opting for single-player. And if you're playing trios, well, that's apparently what Elden Ring Nightreign is built around. Whether duos support shows up or not, having an extra hand around can't hurt against some of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-features-bosses-from-dark-souls">the fearsome bosses</a> waiting in Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign is out on May 30, 2025 for PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox One and Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Hitman developer IO Interactive is keeping busy. In addition to a fantasy new IP, the studio is developing Project 007, which is the working title for its new James Bond game.</p><p>Announced in November 2020, Project 007 tells an origin story for James Bond. We haven't seen any footage yet, but we've still learned a fair amount about the upcoming game. Read on to learn everything we know so far about Project 007, including plans for it to potentially kick off a new trilogy.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_Project_007_be_released_">When will Project 007 be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Preorder_Project_007">Preorder Project 007</a></li><li><a href="#Project_007_trailer_information">Project 007 trailer information</a></li><li><a href="#Project_007_platforms">Project 007 platforms</a></li><li><a href="#Project_007_story__setting__and_characters">Project 007 story, setting, and characters</a></li><li><a href="#Project_007_game_engine">Project 007 game engine</a></li><li><a href="#Who_s_developing_Project_007_">Who's developing Project 007?</a></li><li><a href="#A_James_Bond_shakeup">A James Bond shakeup</a></li><li><a href="#History_of_James_Bond_games">History of James Bond games</a></li><li><a href="#The_next_James_Bond_movie">The next James Bond movie</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_Project_007_be_released_">When will Project 007 be released?</h2><p dir="ltr">There is no word yet on when Project 007 will be released. It was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-007-game-in-the-works-at-io-interactive/1100-6484609/" data-ref-id="1100-6484609">announced in November 2020</a>, and many took the reveal to be a specific strategy to encourage people to come work at IO on the IP. Announcing games early in development for the purpose of attracting talent is a comment practice in video games.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the big new hires for Project 007 is Rodrigo Santoro, a former Ubisoft veteran who joined IO in 2024 to become <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-dev-hires-ubisoft-veteran-for-new-james-bond-game-and-hes-excited-to-work-on-a-non-sequel/1100-6522538/" data-ref-id="1100-6522538">missions director for the James Bond game.</a> Santoro said he was happy to join IO to work on the James Bond game, saying most companies are making sequels, so he's excited for a new challenge.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Preorder_Project_007">Preorder Project 007</h2><p dir="ltr">Preorders for Project 007 are not available yet, but whenever that happens, we'll report back with a preorder guide.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Project_007_trailer_information">Project 007 trailer information</h2><p>So far, the only video for Project 007 was the announcement sizzle clip that was released when the game was announced in 2020.

href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. However, it's assumed the game will also come to PlayStation and Xbox consoles. IO said the game is being developed for "modern systems and platforms."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Project_007_story__setting__and_characters">Project 007 story, setting, and characters</h2><p>The Project 007 teaser video doesn't show Bond himself, so it's unclear if the character's likeness will be based on any of the actors who have played him over the years.</p><p>What is confirmed is that Project 007 tells an origin story for James Bond--the first time ever for any form of James Bond entertainment--and it will be a "wholly original Bond story." Players will "earn their 00 status" in the course of the game's story.</p><p dir="ltr">However, that's all we know so far about the plot. James Bond movies are known to be globe-trotting affairs, as Bond hunts down villains across the world. The series is also known for its action, and it's expected Project 007 will include some of this. Bond also sometimes needs to be stealthy, and IO's experience with the Hitman series would seemingly help in this department.</p><p dir="ltr">IO intends for the game to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-james-bond-game-will-focus-on-a-young-bond-aims-to-launch-new-trilogy/1100-6527203/" data-ref-id="1100-6527203">kick off a new trilogy.</a> CEO Hakan Abrak told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Project 007 won't be based on any of the existing Bond movies. Instead, the developer is being allowed to create its own version of James Bond for the game.</p><p>"What's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story," Abrak said. "So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from the ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is there together to work on this together with the family of creating a young Bond for gamers; a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Project_007_game_engine">Project 007 game engine</h2><p dir="ltr">Project 007 is being developed using IO's proprietary Glacier engine. The company is <a href="https://ioi.dk/careers?panel=job%3Fid%3D5776172" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hiring a multiplayer programmer</a>, and a previously spotted job ad called for someone with multiplayer experience to work on Project 007. This suggests, but doesn't confirm, that the new James Bond game will have multiplayer.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Who_s_developing_Project_007_">Who's developing Project 007?</h2><p>Project 007 is in "active development" at IO's offices in Copenhagen, Denmark and Malmo, Sweden.</p><p>"Creating an original Bond game is a monumental undertaking and I truly believe that IO Interactive, working closely with our creative partners at EON and MGM, can deliver something extremely special for our players and communities," Abrak said. "Our passionate team is excited to unleash their creativity into the iconic James Bond universe and craft the most ambitious game in the history of our studio."</p><p>Former MGM boss Robert Marick, meanwhile, said, "We plan to bring a new take on this legendary franchise to gamers and Bond fans around the world. IO Interactive are masters of crafting living, breathing worlds of immersive storytelling." Marick left MGM after the game was announced.</p><h2 id="A_James_Bond_shakeup"><b>A James Bond shakeup</b></h2><p>A major unanswered question about Project 007 is whether or not anything about the project changed due to James Bond stewards Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson getting bought out of their ownership, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shocking-james-bond-changes-announced-could-influence-future-games/1100-6529615/" data-ref-id="1100-6529615">Amazon MGM Studios taking over all creative decisions.</a></p><p>Broccoli and Wilson had managed the James Bond franchise for almost 60 years, following it being passed down from their father, Cubby Broccoli. The pair have been the driving force behind the entire Bond franchise during that period, including selecting the actors who would play the iconic spy. Their work has extended beyond just the movies, as Broccoli at least has been involved in decision-making for the games; it recently came to light that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-producer-didnt-want-guns-in-goldeneye-007-wii-remake-bobby-kotick-says/1100-6529397/" data-ref-id="1100-6529397">Broccoli raised a number of concerns about the GoldenEye game for Wii.</a></p><p>What impact the new leadership at Amazon MGM Studios could have on IO's game is unknown, but GameSpot has contacted the studio in an attempt to get more details. We've also reached out to Amazon MGM Studios.</p><h2 id="History_of_James_Bond_games"><strong>History of James Bond games</strong></h2><p>A number of companies have made James Bond video games over the years. One of the most memorable and iconic James Bond games was Rare's 1997 GoldenEye 007 for Nintendo 64. Electronic Arts made James Bond games, too, including Agent Under Fire, Nightfire, and Rogue Agent. Activison took over for a period of time, publishing titles like Quantum of Solace and Blood Stone. There hasn't been a new James Bond game for console since 2012's 007 Legends, though Cypher 007 came out for mobile in 2023.</p><h2 id="The_next_James_Bond_movie"><strong>The next James Bond movie</strong></h2><p>The 26th Bond movie is now in the works, with <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/amazon-mgm-studios-james-bond-producers-amy-pascal-david-heyman" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Harry Potter's David Heyman and Spider-Man's Amy Pascal signed on as producers. </a> Amazon MGM Studios will produce the film, but there is no word yet on any of the key details about it, including the biggest question of all: who will play James Bond? Aaron Taylor-Johnson was said to be the front-runner at some point. Also unknown is who may direct the new Bond movie or when it could release.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/james-bond-movies-amazon-barbara-broccoli-0b04f0db" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wall Street Journal report from December 2024</a> said Broccoli and Wilson were sparring with Amazon executives over the future of the series, causing important developments on the project to be delayed. Now that Broccoli and Wilson are out, some are theorizing that Amazon might try to get the ball rolling quickly for Bond 26.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Summerfall Studios co-founder and former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> writer David Gaider has been reflecting, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/david-gaider-interview-romanceable-companions-and-his-cancelled-planescape-sequel">not for the first time</a>, on his career at BioWare under EA. In a brisk recap of a decade-and-change of sequels, changes of direction, and mid-project reboots, he sums up EA's difficulty with Dragon Age as basically one of having no real faith in the wide appeal of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">role-playing games</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>"In many ways, Dragon Age was, I think, not a good match for EA," Gaider explained, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard/david-gaider-interview">PCGamesN</a>. "They never really knew what to make of it, or what to do with it. The expectation was always that it wouldn't do well, and when it did do well, it took people by surprise."</p>
<p>EA were far more convinced by sci-fi stablemate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, Gaider went on, despite Mass Effect sporadically falling short of expectations. "By comparison, Mass Effect was slick and it was action-driven and very much up EA's alley, so they always expected that it should do better, and every time it didn't, it got excuses like 'oh they released in the wrong timeframe, or X, Y, and Z.'</p>
<p>"The idea was that the potential for Mass Effect was more - it could get the action audience as well as the RPG audience," he said. "It wasn't until <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a> that they started to realize that 'no, there's an action RPG audience, like a crossover,' but you don't just get both audiences together." </p>
<p>Last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> certainly suggests a level of hesitancy about the value of Dragon Age as a 'pure' role-playing game. Its development was, by most accounts, hellish: originally pitched as another narrative-led RPG, The Veilguard was re-envisaged as a live service multiplayer offering, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/so-i-tied-an-onion-to-my-belt-which-was-the-style-at-the-time">as was the style at the time</a>, then rebooted as a single player action-RPG in light of Anthem's commercial failure.</p>
<p>Gaider - who left BioWare after working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, my beloved - has yet to play The Veilguard, having poured so much of himself into Dragon Age that he feels uneasy about it evolving without him. He's also wary of judging its creators, many of whom have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">laid off</a> or relocated after EA declared The Veilguard a disappointment. But he does regard the game as symptomatic of EA's on-going mistrust toward Dragon Age and role-playing.</p>
<p>"Even though Dragon Age only catered to the RPG audience - at least initially - [EA] kept wanting it to move into the action space as well - and maybe by Veilguard it has," he went on. "I think their idea was that the 'cap' on the RPG audience was only so big. Then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> comes along and proves no, it's possible that if you lean into what a genre does really well, you can grow the audience, as it turns out."</p>
<p>Gaider would have liked EA and BioWare to similarly "double down on the choice-driven narrative, double down on the production value, like the presentation of the characters and the cinematics and dialogs, and just take it to the extent where quality is the watchword." But as he concludes, it's hard to imagine a publicly traded company like EA doing what Larian did with BG3, because the two "live on two different planets".</p>
<p>It's not clear what the future holds for Dragon Age. Or indeed BioWare, who have been stripped down to a core team currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-5s-top-development-brass-includes-a-few-original-mass-effect-trilogy-veterans">Mass Effect 5</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Next year, Pokemon will celebrate its 30th anniversary, but The Pokemon Company didn't wait to find a reason to celebrate now.
