            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186645/valve-steam-controller-officially-licensed-wireless-horipad-announcement-specs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nearly five years after Valve discontinued its experimental <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price">Steam Controller</a>, a new officially licensed gamepad for Steam is on the way. The new controller is made by Hori, and it’s only coming to Japan (at least for now).</p><p>Dubbed the <a href="https://horistore.com/shop/g/gHPC-055/">Wireless Horipad for Steam</a>, the PC-centric controller matches the Steam Deck’s menu buttons and has similar touch sensors atop its sticks to activate gyro controls. It also supports Bluetooth wireless and USB-C wired connections as well as a whole bunch of custom programmability using Hori’s software. But while it shares a lot with the Steam Deck, it’s not a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022#:~:text=Valve%20wants%20a%20Steam%20Controller%202">Steam Controller 2</a> — it lacks rumble, a matching set of four back buttons, and the handheld’s signature trackpads.</p><p>The new controller is set to launch in Japan on October 31st in four colors (black, white, neon yellow, and violet), selling for 7,890 yen (about $50).</p><p>There’s no word yet if this new Steam controller is coming to the US or elsewhere, but the Wireless Horipad bears a striking resemblance to the <a href="https://stores.horiusa.com/horipad-pro-designed-for-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-one/">wired Horipad Pro</a> that’s currently available for Xbox consoles. I tested the Horipad Pro for our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025443/best-xbox-controllers-one-series-x-s">Xbox controller buying guide</a> and found it to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025443/best-xbox-controllers-one-series-x-s#:~:text=mentioned%20above%2C%20the-,Horipad%20Pro,-has%20one%20of">serviceable with fine ergonomics and a great D-pad</a> — though it was somewhat outclassed by other options that run cheaper. </p><p>However, the Wireless Horipad seems to have a whole lot more going on. For starters, it’s actually wireless, albeit limited to Bluetooth, which is usually less reliable than a USB wireless dongle. The Steam version also has four programmable buttons, although, unlike the Steam Deck, there are only two on the rear — the other two are on the front directly below the D-pad and on the right thumbstick.</p><div><p>It certainly looks familiar if you squint</p></div><p>While it seems long overdue for Valve to once again have a branded go-to gamepad for Steam and docked Steam Deck use, we’ll have to wait to see if or when it becomes more widely available. Hori’s decision to start sales in its home country makes sense, but it may also speak to the rise of PC gaming in Japan, with handhelds being such a popular choice there that Valve spun up a partnership with an entirely different company for <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/">Steam Deck distribution</a> (including <a href="https://boilingsteam.com/steam-deck-launches-in-stores-in-japan-full-coverage/index.html">in-store availability</a>). </p><p>In general, gamepad usage in Steam is on the rise — as Valve’s <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4142827237888316812">just-released statistics</a> show. Those numbers also come with a summary of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4142827237888316812#:~:text=Here%20are%20some%20of%20the%20new%20features%20we%E2%80%99ve%20shipped%20for%20Steam%20Input%20and%20controller%20users%20recently%3A">new controller optimizations</a> Valve has recently implemented in Steam. Perhaps this is setting the table for a wide swath of licensed Steam controllers from a variety of manufacturers like we see on Xbox consoles — with more wireless options, I hope. One thing I know is I’m now dying to try this Wireless Horipad.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24186512/past-lives-overwatch-zenyatta-screenplay</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/congrats-to-overwatch%E2%80%99s-zenyatta-for-getting-name-dropped-in-an-oscar-nominated-screenplay.912348/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24186512/past-lives-overwatch-zenyatta-screenplay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="lz4i87"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23767663/the-sims-4-past-lives-celine-song-the-seagull-interview"><em>Past Lives</em></a> was one of my <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23597815/best-movies-2023">favorite movies of 2023</a>. It’s a heartfelt, funny romantic drama; a nuanced depiction of grown-up love; and a remarkable first feature from writer-director Celine Song, a playwright and dedicated gamer. Before <em>Past Lives, </em>Song previously staged a production of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/10/29/21540644/sims-4-chekhov-the-seagull-new-york-theatre-workshop">Anton Chekhov’s classic play <em>The Seagull</em> within a Sims game</a> and <a href="https://www.lecinemaclub.com/journal/qa-with-celine-song/">regularly plays <em>Valorant, Overwatch</em>,<em> </em>and <em>Fortnite</em></a>.</p>
<p id="qyiSQR">Turns out <em>The Sims</em> isn’t the only video game franchise present in Song’s work: <em>Overwatch </em>makes a brief appearance in <em>Past Lives. </em>The level of detail in the script caught me by surprise. After meeting up with her childhood sweetheart Hae Sung (Teo Yoo) for the first time in years, Nora (Greta Lee) returns home to find her husband Arthur (John Magaro) playing <em>Overwatch</em>. <em>Overwatch </em>isn’t terribly relevant to the scene – it’s just the activity he’s doing when she comes home, but <a href="https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Past-Lives-Read-The-Screenplay.pdf">the Oscar-nominated script</a> is quite specific about who he’s playing and what happens in his game.</p>

<p id="ENYhn5">The <em>Past Lives </em>script specifies Arthur plays <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/13/8601353/overwatch-gameplay-video-zenyatta">Zenyatta</a>, and even adds some information about who Zenyatta is and what he’s all about. It’s also a great character detail for Arthur, a sweet man who absolutely would play a support character in a team game, and is relatively understanding about the love of his life’s childhood sweetheart suddenly entering the picture. </p>
<p id="PAfuEN">A character’s choice of who they play in a game like <em>Overwatch </em>is an under-tapped mine of personality-building in fiction. There’s also a bit of comedy in here: “DEFEAT” showing up in all-caps immediately after Nora reveals Hae Sung did indeed come to New York to see her is great stuff. (And as a coworker joked: “This is why no one wants to play support. There’s always the concern that your wife is gonna leave you.”)</p>
<p id="4ccCKw">Song’s next project is the rom-com <em>Materialists</em>, starring Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans, and Pedro Pascal. Like <em>Past Lives </em>(and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24127886/challengers-review-zendaya-luca-guadagnino"><em>Challengers</em></a>, written by her husband, Justin Kuritzkes), it reportedly focuses on a love triangle. But I know what I’m most focused on: which video game will get an unexpected mention. </p>

Here’s the content creator <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/dansgaming&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/dansgaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DansGaming</a></span> bumping into an “NPC making some very weird sounds” that turns out to be none other than Igon, a drake warrior on his final mission.</p><p>When you chance upon Igon, he’s been beaten down and scarred. He can’t really use his arms, and it seems like his legs have failed him too. For all intents and purposes, Igon is dragging himself across the Land of Shadow to kill Bayle the Dread, a traitorous dragon who wounded Placidusax—a name you might remember as the crazy dragon boss you fought in Farum Azula in <em>Elden Ring</em>—and struck Igon with a crippling fear that’s kept him from partaking in Dragon Communion, which gave his life worth.<br></p><p>Talking to him in this state provides a lot of anguished cries and repeated calls for “vile Bayle,” and kicks off a quest line following Igon’s journey. When he’s not growling every other line he utters, he’s deeply wounded and scared of Bayle, who’s inflicted a horror on Igon that literally still haunts him, and the way that voice actor Richard Lintern zips between these extremes is nothing short of impressive. He comes across like two distinct characters rather than dimensions of the same man, and people are already hailing Lintern’s full-throated performance as Igon.</p><p>Following up with Igon provides ample opportunity to continue hearing his rantings and ravings, but before long, he realizes that his body’s failing him, and he won’t physically make it to Bayle. At this point, he does the craziest thing yet and <em>gives </em>you his finger in order to summon his spirit to fuck Bayle up when you eventually get to the boss fight. And then the boss fight happens and Igon reaches hater levels previously thought unattainable.<br></p><p>The moment you summon him, Igon immediately shouts “Curse you, Bayle,” and launches into the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Bri4nF/status/1805475033998852302&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Bri4nF/status/1805475033998852302" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mother of all tirades</a></span>. He even gasses you up, saying “Behold, a true drake warrior! And I, Igon!” <em>You’re the</em> true drake warrior he’s talking up! My favorite line, though, is when he screams at Bayle that he will “riddle with holes your rotten hide,” and immediately follows it up by giddily delivering the line, “With a hail of harpoons!” Dude wants Bayle dead <em>so </em>badly, he doesn’t seem like he’ll ever shut up, but he eventually does.<em> </em>And so Igon takes up his bow made of dragon bone, and the harpoons he specifically fashioned to sink into Bayle’s “rotten hide,” and does exactly what he was put on this Earth to do, and kills that dragon.<br></p><p>Igon’s storyline is so batshit, and Lintern’s readings of every line are so unhinged, that the character has immediately become a standout of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-steam-reviews-difficulty-1851561745&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-steam-reviews-difficulty-1851561745">expansion</a></span>, as well as FromSoft’s evolving gallery of weird little guys.

Considering that <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>’s author George R.R Martin worked on the lore of <em>Elden Ring</em>, it probably shouldn’t come as a surprise that both names take inspiration from his main body of work. Bayle is a reference to a literal dread dragon named Balerion in <em>ASOIAF</em>, who’s ridden by the phonetically similar Aegon Targaryen. And so it all comes full circle. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-secret-identity-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Secret identity board games, or social deduction games, are incredibly popular among casual and hardcore audiences, and it isn’t hard to see why. Perhaps it is the thrill of lying to your friends' faces and knowing that everything will still be okay between you when the game ends, or maybe it’s the excitement of learning that the quiet one in your group secretly harbors an excellent poker face. Either way, these titles often make for some of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups"><u>best party games</u></a>, thanks to the memories they frequently create.</p><p>Most already know about genre staples like Mafia and Werewolf, but the category is incredibly deep, with diverse games for various audiences. The secret identity genre features longer epic experiences as well as quick playthroughs – games for large groups and titles for just two players. Regardless of skill level and general interest in the hobby, no matter what you’re in the mood for, social deduction games are a surefire hit to break out at your next get-together.</p><h3>TL;DR The Best Secret Identity Board Games</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="#blood">Blood on the Clocktower</a></li><li><a href="#deception">Deception: Murder in Hong Kong</a></li><li><a href="#res">The Resistance: Avalon</a></li><li><a href="#night">One Night Ultimate Werewolf</a></li><li><a href="#fake">A Fake Artist Goes to New York</a></li><li><a href="#spy">Spyfall 2</a></li><li><a href="#inhuman">Inhuman Conditions</a></li><li><a href="#feed">Feed the Kraken</a></li></ul><h2 id="blood">Blood on the Clocktower</h2><div id="202425" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Blood on the Clocktower</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 15+</li><li>Player: 6-21</li><li>Play Time: 30-120 mins</li></ul><p>While Blood on the Clocktower isn’t quite as accessible as some other titles on this list, its additional rules aren’t simply bloat, either. Instead, Blood on the Clocktower adds new wrinkles that often solve problems some players have with other games in the genre. It requires a larger group and a bit more time than some other recommendations in the space, but if you can find the time and the players, Blood on the Clocktower is easily one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games"><u>best board games</u></a> money can buy.</p><p>The core mechanics of Blood on the Clocktower play out in a manner that those familiar with the genre will immediately grasp: players each receive a secret role with accompanying abilities, the demon kills another player during the nighttime phase when players’ eyes are closed, and during the daytime phase the townsfolk get together to try and deduce who the villains are and ultimately sentence someone to death. The goal of the good team is to execute the demon, and the goal of the evil team is to survive until the end. However, things get truly interesting when Blood on the Clocktower deviates from classic secret identity games like Mafia and Werewolf.</p><p>One notable difference is that executed players remain in the game. They lose their various abilities, but they can still contribute to the deduction and even retain one final vote on who to put to death. Additionally, players can share their secret identities, but this is a double-edged sword as it will also give the demon valuable information. It’s also challenging to know who to trust because the demon gets to see three different unused identities at the beginning of the game, meaning they can pretend to be one of these characters. Blood on the Clocktower is one of those games that your group will have just as much fun discussing afterward as they did actually playing it.</p><h2 id="deception">Deception: Murder in Hong Kong</h2><div id="202426" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Deception: Murder in Hong Kong</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 14+</li><li>Player: 4-12</li><li>Play Time: 20 mins</li></ul><p>Players take on the roles of investigators hoping to solve the titular murder in Hong Kong. However, one of the investigators is secretly the murderer. As a twist, one player knows the killer's identity but cannot say it. Instead, they are only allowed to give clues concerning aspects of the crime, such as the cause of death or location. In front of each player are cards with potential murder weapons and clues, leaving the investigators to solve the rest. There is still enough ambiguity within the cards that players are left to discuss who they believe the culprit is, resulting in some classic moments of deduction and a mountain of lies. In a sense, Deception: Murder in Hong Kong plays out as a hidden identity version of Clue, making the stakes feel much more personal as a result.</p><h2 id="res">The Resistance: Avalon</h2><div id="162037" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Resistance: Avalon</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 13+</li><li>Player: 5-10</li><li>Play Time: 30 mins</li></ul><p>The Resistance: Avalon is a team-based social deduction game set against the backdrop of Arthurian legend. It’s a classic good versus evil showdown but with hidden identities. Players work to get elected to positions of power to advance their team’s goals, but they attempt to do so without revealing their alliances. Only the player taking on the role of Merlin knows who is who, but disclosing this information risks losing their team the game, meaning there are layers upon layers of deception going on simultaneously. Fans of the Secret Hitler board game will recognize many of the rules and mechanics in The Resistance: Avalon, but the latter title is far less likely to offend anyone at your next get-together.</p><h2 id="night">One Night Ultimate Werewolf</h2><div id="162031" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>One Night Ultimate Werewolf</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 8+</li><li>Player: 3-10</li><li>Play Time: 10 mins</li></ul><p>One Night Ultimate Werewolf has cemented itself as one of the most accessible party games, thanks mainly to an excellent audio app that walks players through each phase. It’s so easy to pick up and play that One Night Ultimate Werewolf has become a favorite among nongamers as well as more serious hobbyists. This bluffing game offers players a single card, each with a different role. Some are villagers, some have special abilities, and some are the titular werewolves. For the most part, the villagers want to identify the werewolves, and the werewolves want to remain anonymous.</p><p>One Night Ultimate Werewolf has two phases: night and day. During the nighttime phase, players put their heads down as the app narrates them through various card-swapping, identification, and general trickery. In the day phase, players open their eyes and attempt to deduce what happened the night before. Following the thread of who had what card at what time can get quite confusing, helping to cloak the deceit in uncertainty.</p><h2 id="fake">A Fake Artist Goes to New York</h2><div id="202427" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>A Fake Artist Goes to New York</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 8+</li><li>Player: 5-10</li><li>Play Time: 20 mins</li></ul><p>A Fake Artist Goes to New York is a fun twist on deductive games and drawing-based titles like Pictionary. Players take turns collectively drawing a single picture one line at a time. The twist is that every player except for one knows what the final drawing is supposed to look like. The fake artist must guess what the image is supposed to be and add a line to the drawing when it is their turn, using only a vague category and the picture forming in front of them. After each player draws two lines, the group can guess who they believe the fake artist is. Identifying the phony artist may seem simple, but as many people are simply bad at drawing, it is more challenging to decipher who the trickster is than you might think.</p><h2 id="spy">Spyfall 2</h2><div id="202428" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Spyfall 2</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 13+</li><li>Player: 3-12</li><li>Play Time: 15 mins</li></ul><p>Spyfall 2 is an ingeniously simple game where players try to deduce who the spy is with only a card and a location. Each player receives a single card, all of which, except for one (or two if you’re playing with multiple spies), has a location on it. The outlier card simply says the word “spy.” Players must discover who the spy is among them by asking questions about the listed location. The key is to pose questions and give answers that won’t reveal the setting so the spy doesn’t catch on. Unless you're the spy, then the goal is to bluff your way to victory. After just a few minutes, the group concludes the interrogation process and votes on who they think the spy is. Not only is the game fun and addictive, but it's also simply a joy to locate the cartoon spy lurking in the background in each card’s artwork.</p><h2 id="inhuman">Inhuman Conditions</h2><div id="202429" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Inhuman Conditions</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 12+</li><li>Player: 2</li><li>Play Time: 5 mins</li></ul><p>A true rarity in the secret identity space, Inhuman Conditions is a social deduction game for only two players. It’s not just the player count that makes Inhuman Conditions unique; it’s also that this Blade Runner-inspired bluffing game is centered around a five-minute conversation. In each game, there is one investigator and one suspect. The investigator's goal is to identify whether the suspect is a human or a robot, and the suspect's goal is to pass as a human. However, this is easier said than done, as robots are given specific prompts to follow. The trick is to naturally work these prompts into the conversation, which can quickly become tricky when every word you say is being analyzed by the other player. As Inhuman Conditions’ writing can be a bit wacky, it is best suited for two players who can embrace its sillier role-playing elements.</p><h2 id="feed">Feed the Kraken: Deluxe Edition</h2><div id="202430" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Feed the Kraken</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 12+</li><li>Player: 5-11</li><li>Play Time: 45-90 mins</li></ul><p>While most social deduction games omit the board altogether, Feed the Kraken: Deluxe Edition brings players to the figurative and literal table surrounding a beautifully constructed board and stunning minis. Players in Feed the Kraken are split between three secret roles: sailors, pirates, and cultists. The players’ goal is to simply move the ship from one side of the board to the other, but each team is secretly working to navigate toward a different game-ending location. Each game starts with one player selected as the captain, and that player chooses their lieutenant and navigator. This trio ultimately decides the direction the ship will head for that turn, but opportunities for mutiny ensure fate isn’t always left in their hands.</p><p>Along the way, the ship might move to spaces with icons that enable the captain to perform various tasks, such as seeing another player’s role or even keeping someone from talking for the rest of the game. If the ship reaches a Kraken tile, the captain will fulfill the title by feeding the sea beast a crew member. However, feeding the cult leader to the Kraken will result in victory for the cultist team, so players should tread carefully.</p><p>If you’re looking for more great titles to play with larger groups, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-6-player-board-games"><u>best six-player board games</u></a> and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players"><u>best four-player board games</u></a>.</p><p><em>Bobby Anhalt is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering board games and LEGOs.

                <p>Actor Hayden Christensen, who is best known for playing Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader in the Star Wars series, has revealed his favorite video games. Speaking to Wired, Christensen said he doesn't play as much these days, but has fond memories of a few franchises in particular.</p><p>"I used to play a lot of video games. Not so much any more, ever since I became a dad. I was big into Call of Duty, Halo, and then FIFA. FIFA was kind of my go-to. Manchester United was the team I usually played with."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-364q3clqn0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="183">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-364q3clqn0?start=183" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Christensen has one child, a daughter, whom he co-parents with his former partner, the actress Rachel Bilson. Christensen became a father in 2014, so people are theorizing what specific Halo and Call of Duty games he might have been playing before he became a father. We don't know for sure, but fans are having fun <a href="https://x.com/HiddenXperia/status/1806012436090167617" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">joking that they might have been matched up with Christensen in Halo 3 back in the day.</a></p><p>The Star Wars prequels featuring Christensen were not received very positively when they were released in the early 2000s, but Christensen and others have said fans have come around more to them in recent times. Christensen came back to play Darth Vader again in 2023's Ob-Wan Kenobi TV series and 2023's Ahsoka show.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186503/super-monkey-ball-hack-gaming-controller-tom-tilley<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gamers could get an edge in Sega’s<em> Super Monkey Ball </em>with the help of a unique DIY controller: a <a href="https://x.com/DrTomTilley/status/1805790393927450683">literal monkey in a ball</a> that can be physically rolled around instead of mashing a joystick on a gamepad.</p><p><em>Super Monkey Ball</em> requires players to tilt and roll a series of complex floating platforms to control the monkey’s movements, so Sega designed the original arcade versions of the game with an oversize trackball controller.</p><p>That wasn’t carried over to the console versions of the game, and since arcade machines typically cost thousands of dollars, developer <a href="https://tomtilley.net/">Tom Tilley</a> decided to design and build a much cheaper solution made from recycled and 3D-printed materials. “I am a software developer, but I worked for about eight years as a fax and cellular phone technician in the late 80’s, so I have some small amount of electronics knowledge that comes in handy with this sort of thing,” Tilley told <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Tilley, now a software developer in Australia, spent almost 10 years lecturing at a university while living in Thailand, where they also ran a class that challenged students to come up with unique alternatives to game controllers.</p><p>It was there that the idea for a giant trackball made from random recycled parts, an optical mouse, and a basketball, came to fruition. A base made from cardboard holds the basketball in place and allows it to freely roll in all directions with the help of three salvaged roll-on deodorant containers that serve as plastic bearings. Beneath the ball sits an inverted optical mouse upgraded with another deodorant bearing that rolls whenever the ball does, making it easier for the mouse’s sensor to detect its movements.</p><p>The original version of the trackball was built to play a 1986 Japanese arcade game called <em>Armadillo Racing</em>, but it has since been modified by Tilley to play other games, including <a href="https://x.com/DrTomTilley/status/1613846131175469057"><em>Katamari Damacy,</em> with a soccer ball</a>. Using it to play the Nintendo GameCube version of <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> through emulation required an additional modification, Tilley told <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>A 3D-printed recreation of the game’s main character, a monkey named AiAi, rides inside a transparent plastic sphere on a weighted wheeled base that keeps him upright at all times. It’s a charming upgrade, but the clear plastic created a new problem. The sphere’s smooth finish didn’t offer enough friction to move the deodorant roller on the mouse. To fix that, Tilley had to swap that part out for a small rubber ball rolling on metal bearings so the mouse’s optical sensor could detect AiAi’s movements.</p><p>To make the GameCube version of <em>Super Monkey Ball </em>work with a DIY trackball, Tilley uses a scripting tool called <a href="https://andersmalmgren.github.io/FreePIE/">FreePIE</a> (Programmable Input Emulator) that inverts the signals coming from the mouse and maps them to a virtual joystick that’s compatible with the emulator software.</p><p>The first new game in the <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> series in a decade releases on the Nintendo Switch this week. If Tilley can make the DIY trackball work with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/27/24142562/cant-wait-to-be-top-banana"><em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em></a>, he just might dominate the game’s multiplayer mode.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> consultant and former Dragon Age executive producer Mark Darrah has published a Youtube video addressing the question: "why do AAA games take so long?" It's a tidy 25 minutes or so, and gets a fair way into the weeds of a variety of topics, from the current enthusiasm for live service "forever games" over 'finite', narrative-led affairs, to the "misleading" announcement of highly-demanded sequels years before they enter full production, in order to pump up a publisher's brand during a dry spell.</p>
<p>One thing I wanted to fish out and drop on your plate is Darrah's discussion of what he terms "the fidelity death cult" - that is, the desire for ever greater levels of lifelike visual detail and "intricacy".</p><!--more-->

<p>"We are also in a period of something I've called the fidelity death cult,"  Darrah explains in the vid, around the eight minute mark, "where a lot of games are trying for hyper-realistic art styles, hyper-high fidelity, hyper-customisation, hyper-intricacy. These things, while they don't contribute to a larger size, while they don't help you make a forever game, they still take a lot more time. When you are concerned about the way people's hair moves on their back, that's going to take time that you in the past wouldn't have done. You would have just spray-painted their hairdo on, or given them a hair cap, or something pretty static. Now, you're introducing new avenues of complexity."</p>
<p>He extends the point to encompass player dislike of things in games they consider to have been "recycled", from chunks of recurring environment to animation systems. "Similarly, we currently see from players quite a bit of pushback on the reuse of systems and assets, so even though I might be making a sequel to a game that came out just a couple of years ago, I might feel within the dev team that we can't reuse any of our assets, because we're going to get pushback from the players. And so while I might have been able to reuse some of those animations, or some of those models, or some of those areas, I might feel the need to recreate them to avoid that backlash. So I'm introducing additional time into the development process that otherwise would have allowed the game to come out sooner."</p>
<p>Interestingly, Darrah notes that while the emphasis on giving players endless things to do, access and consume in "forever games" reflects audience research showing that this makes the game more enticing, the "fidelity death cult" and avoidance of asset reuse comes "more from a fear of backlash, as opposed to any more specific research that says that this is necessary". He suggests that prioritising original asset creation and fidelity is "a trap that dev teams are kind of laying upon themselves", pointing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> as the "perfect example" of a game that has gotten away with downplaying "minor visual fidelity things that at the end of the day, often don't matter that much".</p>
<p>That the creed of ever-quantifiably-higher fidelity sponges up a lot of time and energy without really adding anything to games is a familiar argument, but always worth repeating. To slide into a bit of journalist navel-gazing, I'll add that games that valorise fidelity for its own sake can be boring to write about, albeit partly because enthusiast readerships tend to want us to write about them in a certain way.</p>
<p>The associated traditions of realism and photorealism are, in themselves, complex, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/photorealism-is-crucial">exciting</a> and evolving, but within video game culture, those traditions are typically boiled down to numbers and buzzwords - higher polygon counts, more animated objects per scene, more lens flare per NPC tear, with a corresponding need for more potent, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/examining-the-game-industrys-hidden-impacts-on-climate-change/">dirtier</a> pieces of hardware to run games on. Mind you, if there's a preference for interpreting realism and photorealism this way, that reflects the audience tastes that both "AAA" developers and journalists have cultivated for themselves over the decades, by consenting to the whim of the marketing machine. I've written my share of articles about higher resolutions and posh new species of shader. One thing I'd like to ask Darrah is: how exactly should blockbuster game developers unravel the "fidelity death cult"? How should they persuade more tech-devoted players to get over the sight of some sprayed-on hair?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24186644/dead-rising-remaster-capcom-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9ZEfZk">Capcom is giving the original <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/1/5/14178650/dead-rising-dead-rising-2-off-the-record-guide-strategy"><em>Dead Rising</em></a> a new remaster, the publisher announced Wednesday in a surprise teaser trailer for <em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em> — or <em>DR DR</em>. The remastered version of <em>Dead Rising</em> will be available for “the newest generation of platforms,” according to the trailer, likely meaning PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.</p>
<p id="Nc0n0y">Details on <em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em> are scant, but the remastered game will launch sometime this year, Capcom says in the trailer. The teaser promises an “updated release with a brand-new look.” Indeed, freelance photojournalist Frank West looks completely remodeled — and sounds like he’s sporting a new voice actor. The town of Willamette, Colorado looks much crisper, more detailed, and more overridden with zombies.</p>
<p id="wet5lh"><em>Dead Rising</em>, like the original <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/19/7550887/resident-evil-hd-remaster-review-pc-xbox-one-ps4-playstation-4-360-3"><em>Resident Evil</em></a>, draws inspiration from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23784627/best-zombie-movie-george-romero-day-of-the-dead">George A. Romero’s zombie films</a>, specifically <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>. As Frank West, players spend three in-game days in the zombie-infested Willamette Parkview Mall, using anything and everything one can find in a shopping mall as a weapon to survive. As Frank investigates the outbreak and snaps photos, he comes to the aid other survivors, helping them escape while fending off hordes of undead and evil humans known as psychopaths.</p>
<p id="U1Y8C5">Created by longtime Mega Man creatives Keiji Inafune and Yoshinori Kawano, <em>Dead Rising</em> was lauded for its unique, real-time gameplay structure and campy combat scenarios. Frank could dispatch the zombie masses with a gun or chainsaw, or battle while riding on a skateboard or wearing a full Mega Man battle suit. Or he could beat zombies into submission with a flaming-hot frying pan from the food court while sporting a Servbot head as a helmet.</p>
<p id="PEKaym">The original <em>Dead Rising</em> was released for Xbox 360 in 2006. An HD re-release followed in 2016, for PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. Capcom released three mainline sequels to <em>Dead Rising</em>, but we haven’t seen a new entry in the franchise since 2016’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/12/5/13797380/dead-rising-4-review-xbox-one-pc"><em>Dead Rising 4</em></a>, which also starred Frank West. The studio behind the Dead Rising franchise, Capcom Vancouver, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/19/17878380/capcom-vancouver-dead-rising-studio-closed">shut down in 2018</a>.</p>

One of these is Dagda, and… look, I didn’t play <em>Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse</em>, so I’m not going to pretend I can give a lesson on Dagda’s backstory. However, I’ve read enough comments that end with his catchphrase “kid” to get the picture. While Dagda does return in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em>, he’s locked behind the new Holy Will and Profane Dissent DLC. Let’s break it down.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Holy Will and Profane Dissent is a level 75 quest in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em></strong>. However, you don’t <em>have </em>to be level 75 to complete it, as you’ll meet the raw unlock conditions for the quest fairly early in your adventure. As long as you’re strong enough to defeat Dagda, your level is irrelevant. Much like the other quest you can purchase as DLC, Holy Will and the Profane Dissent adds 15 minutes of gameplay <em>at most</em>. The main reason you’d want to drop $5 for this is to use Dagda, who will join your party once the quest is cleared.<br></p><p>If you’ve purchased the Holy Will and Profane Dissent DLC, or you own the Digital Deluxe edition of the game, here’s how to access this extra boss fight.<br></p><h2 id="h48674"><a id=""></a>How to unlock the Holy Will and Profane Dissent quest in Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</h2><p><strong>The unlock conditions for Holy Will and Profane Dissent are identical to </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/shin-megami-tensei-5-sakura-cinders-of-the-east-1851561744&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/shin-megami-tensei-5-sakura-cinders-of-the-east-1851561744"><strong>Sakura Cinders of the East</strong></a></span>. In fact, if you’re purchased the two packs together, this quest is probably already in your quest list. However, in case you’re the world’s biggest Dagda fan and you purchased this pack a la carte, we can start from the beginning.</p><p>To begin the quest, you’ll have to return to the <strong>Tokyo Diet Building</strong>. If you haven’t gotten to the Tokyo Diet Building yet, then you’re <em>definitely </em>too low level to be doing this quest. Just keep playing and you’ll get there sooner than later.<br></p><p>Once you return to the Tokyo Diet Building, go through the exit on the south side of the Terminal Room. In the next room, keep running down the hallway and go down the staircase. Talk to the Head Researcher, and select the “Offer assistance” option. As long as the Holy Will and Profane Dissent DLC is registered to your account, the Head Researcher should point you towards a Researcher in the same area who will give you the titular quest.<br></p><p>After this, the quest directions become self-explanatory. Follow your quest marker back to the Shiba region in Minato, and ride the Magatsu Rail to where the demon Danu is. Long story short, Dagda did some dimensional hopping to come to this world, and he plans to become a god unshackled by responsibilities like taking care of humans. Danu doesn’t like that too much, and it’s your job to confront Dagda about it.<br></p><p>Follow the new quest marker to the north side of Minato, and you’ll find Dagda there. <strong>Approaching Dagda will begin the boss encounter against him, so make sure to save and finish your battle preparations first</strong>. Also, make sure you have an open slot in your party.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="dc5e51e853180a99960a5f19d30f5f43" data-recommend-id="image://dc5e51e853180a99960a5f19d30f5f43" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from the Dagda fight.

That said, for as strong as Dagda is, it’s possible to clear him far below the recommended level 75. For example, if you’ve long since min-maxed all the challenge out of <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance </em>on the Normal difficulty, and you only feel alive when solving turn-based battles above your level, you can easily clear Dagda before you hit level 60. </p><p>I, of course, don’t know anything about this. Don’t look at the screenshots.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="241a23446f60597d34ed5387743f1b33" data-recommend-id="image://241a23446f60597d34ed5387743f1b33" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dagda's moveset." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dagda's moveset." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="241a23446f60597d34ed5387743f1b33" data-recommend-id="image://241a23446f60597d34ed5387743f1b33" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dagda's moveset." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At first glance, Dagda’s moveset looks <em>very </em>scary. <strong>Not only can he use physical attacks, he can exploit weaknesses to Fire, Ice, Lightning, and Force</strong>. <strong>Luster Candy </strong>and <strong>Debilitate </strong>also allow him to buff and debuff stats respectively. Even scarier is the <strong>Magic Harp </strong>passive ability, which effectively enables his <strong>Lost Hit </strong>and <strong>Power Punch </strong>attacks to sleep or instantly KO any party member if he’s charged Magatsuhi (and Lost Hit <em>already </em>has a chance to instantly KO). </p><p>That said, Dagda is very easy to exploit. <strong>His AI heavily biases him towards using Lost Hit and Power Punch</strong>, presumably because they inflict much more base damage than the elemental attacks. Because of this, <strong>the Phys Block spell and Phys Dampener items massively counter Dagda</strong>. His turn will get cut short whenever you nullify his attacks, potentially letting you go the entire battle without ever taking a single hit. That said, you should cover up weaknesses to the elements Dagda can target as a precaution.<br></p><p>To play it even safer, consider saving your own Magatsuhi skills for when Dagda charges <em>his </em>Magatsuhi. Holding abilities that remove a Press Turn icon from the enemy - such as <strong>Fountain of Chaos </strong>or <strong>Tides of Chaos</strong> - will completely prevent Dagda from landing a physical attack through a Phys Block barrier. This, in turn, will eliminate any chance of you getting defeated via an unlucky attack that activates Magic Harp.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="d03dbf82486d4be02a145493f3dd8158" data-recommend-id="image://d03dbf82486d4be02a145493f3dd8158" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from the Dagda fight.

Apply a suite of party buffs, keep Dagda’s stats debuffed, and <strong>exploit his weakness to Light attacks</strong>. Though he nullifies several elements, Physical attackers who can reliably land Critical Hits also excel in this fight.</p><figure id="" data-id="cf6706c298c5fc52312385fcd01dec74" data-recommend-id="image://cf6706c298c5fc52312385fcd01dec74" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The choice you face after the Dagda fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The choice you face after the Dagda fight." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cf6706c298c5fc52312385fcd01dec74" data-recommend-id="image://cf6706c298c5fc52312385fcd01dec74" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The choice you face after the Dagda fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h48676"><a id=""></a>What happens if you finish off Dagda or stow your weapon?</h2><p>After the battle resolves, Danu will appear and celebrate your victory. After an exchange of words, you’ll be given the choice to either <strong>finish him off</strong> or <strong>stow your weapon</strong>. <strong>There are differences between the two choices, but the end result will remain the same</strong>.</p><p>If you <strong>finish him off</strong>, the Nahobino will deliver a killing blow to Dagda. Danu will approve of your choice, and you’ll find an <strong>Oak Staff </strong>on the ground. After you turn in the quest to the researcher in the Tokyo Diet Building, you’ll be told that the Oak Staff can be studied. The item will be removed from your inventory, but by talking to the Head Researcher afterwards, you’ll see a new menu option. Select this, choose to summon Dagda, and the fearsome foe will instantly join your party. You’ll also unlock the option to fuse him.<br></p><p>If you <strong>stow your weapon</strong>, Danu will explain that if Dagda can run free in this world, then the world will also reject her. Accordingly, Danu will leave, and Dagda will acknowledge that you’ve caught his interest. As a result, he’ll join your party on the spot, and the option to fuse him will appear as well.<br></p><p>In other words, <strong>Dagda can join your party regardless of which option you choose</strong>. The mechanics of how it will happen just differ between the two options. <strong>It’s unclear if this choice affects your alignment, so take that into consideration</strong>. If it does, “Finish him off” is presumably the Law-aligned choice, whereas “Stow your weapon” would be the Chaos-aligned choice.</p><h2 id="h48677"><a id=""></a>Dagda’s stats and abilities</h2><p>Unlike his in-battle counterpart, Dagda’s default moveset features no elemental coverage. Fortunately, that doesn’t matter in the face of Dagda’s sheer power. <strong>Lost Hit </strong>is his unique move, which inflicts severe Physical damage <em>and </em>has a chance to instakill foes. <strong>Hades Blast</strong> inflicts heavy damage to the enemy party, and <strong>Freikugel</strong> deals severe Strength-based Almighty damage with a high critical hit rate. This alone ensures Dagda won’t be stopped by an enemy with Physical resistance or immunity.</p><p>The <strong>Magic Harp </strong>passive ability works exactly as it did in the boss encounter, letting you potentially instakill common foes or put an enemy to sleep if an Omagatoki effect is active. <strong>High Phys Pleroma </strong>boosts his physical damage even further, and <strong>Null Phys</strong> combines with Dagda’s resistances to form a powerful wall of immunities. Luster Candy is a great party buff move, assuming you aren’t using the likes of Idun or Konohana Sakuya to fill that void.<br></p><p>Considering that it’s possible to grab him several hours before you’re intended to by cheesing his boss fight, Dagda offers a frankly insane power boost to your team.That’s good news if <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance </em>is giving you trouble. The bad news is that he might make your team building less exciting when he clearly outperforms so many damage dealers. So whether he’s worth the $5 or not is ultimately up to you.<br></p><p>Personally, I can’t believe Atlus would paywall quality dialogue such as this:<br></p><figure id="" data-id="674480b2c8b7889e88062a69bf833108" data-recommend-id="image://674480b2c8b7889e88062a69bf833108" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A line from Dagda that reads, &quot;can't go calling youa kid.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dan-houser-the-risk-of-a-grand-theft-auto-movie-never-made-sense<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>The former Rockstar boss explains his plan for Absurd Ventures</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Former Rockstar Games head writer and co-founder Dan Houser says that the economics behind a Grand Theft Auto movie "never made sense."</p>
<p>Speaking in a <a href="https://theankler.com/p/dan-houser-absurd-ventures-hollywood-videogames">wide-ranging interview with The Ankler </a>(subscription required), the former Rockstar leader discussed the state of Hollywood and his new company's efforts to develop new IP that could eventually turn into blockbuster movies and games.</p>
<p>Houser <a href="https://theankler.com/p/dan-houser-absurd-ventures-hollywood-videogames">told the publication</a> that there were numerous conversations about turning Rockstar's games, such as GTA and Red Dead Redemption, into a movie.</p>
<p>He said: “After a few awkward dates, we’d ask [the executives], why would we do this?”</p>
<p>And those execs would reply that it would be an opportunity to make a movie, which Houser would respond with: "no, what you've described is you making a movie and us having no control and taking a huge risk that we’re going to end up paying for with something that belongs to us.</p>
<p>“They thought we’d be blinded by the lights and that just wasn't the case. We had what we considered to be multi-billion-dollar IP, and the economics never made sense. The risk never made sense. In those days, the perception was that games made poor-quality movies.”</p>
<p>However, Houser said "it's a different time now", which has led to the formation of Absurd Ventures.</p>
<p>The idea of Absurd Ventures, which also includes former Rockstar leaders Lazlow Jones and Mike Unsworth, is to build potentially major franchises via cheaper formats, such as audiobooks and graphic novels.</p>
<p>The firm's first project is the 12-part audio project A Better Paradise, which kicked off earlier this month and stars the likes of Andrew Lincoln and Paterson Joseph. Its second project is called American Caper, which will begin as a crime and political graphic novel. A third project will be 'lighter and more comedic', but little else was shared.</p>
<p>“If one of [these projects] just stops at the graphic novel or audiobook point, but it's still good and made with integrity, that's fine,” he said. “The end goal is always, always to make cool shit, make the next thing as good as it can be. It's only worth doing each bit if it doesn't feel like marketing.”</p>
<p>Of course, the view is that some of these will eventually lead into a video game project that can cross between interactive and linear entertainment.</p>
<p>"Part of why we’re doing the company this way is our belief that [gaming and traditional entertainment] are going to continue to meld and cross-pollinate,” he said. “The question is, can our business model and theirs collaborate?"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/26/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-announced-with-teaser-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Capcom has revealed Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, a remaster of the Xbox 360 game that first launched in 2006. Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Revealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/dead_rising_triple_pack/b/playstation4/archive/2016/08/09/dead-rising-re-releases-confirmed-for-september-launch.aspx">the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017</a>. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186473/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-update-difficulty-nerf<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> is gonna get easier. Bandai Namco has seemingly heard the great hue and cry from reviewers and players alike that <em>Erdtree </em>is far too difficult. In response, the publisher <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-calibration-update-1122">is implementing a “calibration update”</a> that will reduce the level of difficulty by making players stronger. According to the patch notes for this update:</p><div><blockquote><p>The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of&nbsp;blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual.</p><p>The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased.</p></blockquote></div><p>The key to understanding this update is the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment">Scadutree Fragments</a>. They are DLC-specific upgrade materials that increase a player’s attack and defense. The fragments are scattered throughout the map, requiring considerable exploration to find, but the increased power they grant makes them a high-priority resource. </p><p>There are 20 tiers of Scadutree Blessings in the game. The calibration update will increase the power granted by the first 10 levels, while the power granted by the second 10 will taper off a bit. This means players in the first part of the DLC should see a sharper increase in power, making the early game bosses (including the dreaded <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rellana+Twin+Moon+Knight">Rellana</a>) a bit easier. Finally, the last blessing will also get a buff ostensibly to help out those struggling against the brutal final boss. I’ll not name that boss here because it’s too soon for a spoiler like that, but rest assured, such a buff is warranted.</p><p>There’s a second note in the update dealing with a bug related to ray tracing settings. Loading a previous save from a previous version of the game might automatically enable ray tracing. The notes suggest that if you have issues with your frame rate, check to see if ray tracing has been turned on accidentally.</p><p><em>Erdtree</em>’s difficulty has been dominating the discussion of the DLC. Game director Hidetaka Miyazaki himself said that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24183692/hidetaka-miyazaki-interview-shadow-of-the-erdtree-difficulty">the difficulty level is intentional</a>, and lowering it could potentially “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/21/hidetaka-miyazaki-fromsoftware-elden-ring-shadow-erdtree">break the game</a>.” Some players, streamers, and reviewers have countered that even for a Soulsborne game, it’s a little too much. There are even <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/most-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-mods-just-make-the-dlc-easier-including-a-journalist-mode-which-lets-you-take-50-less-damage/">mods that artificially lower the difficulty</a>, including one that halves all incoming damage bearing the unfortunate name of “<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5225">journalist mode</a>.”</p><p>Hopefully, this little buff will squash the difficulty discourse but will probably serve only to exacerbate it, as now there will be a class of players who can gloat that they beat the game before the nerf... like game journalists.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The device looked like a miniature Xbox Series S, a small white box that was dedicated to accessing Xbox games over the company’s Xbox Cloud Gaming service. Microsoft eventually canceled its plans to launch Keystone, but a new patent gives us the best look at what the Xbox cloud console would have looked like.</p><p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/the-xbox-that-never-was-our-first-detailed-look-at-the-keystone-cloud-streaming-console-design"><em>Windows Central</em></a>, the <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/D1009161">patent reveals</a> that Keystone would have shipped with an HDMI port, ethernet, and a power connector. At the front, there was an Xbox button, a controller pairing button, and a USB-A port. Underneath, Microsoft had a circular “Hello from Seattle” plate that the console sat on, similar to what it uses on the larger Xbox Series X.</p><p>The patent, filed in 2022, is assigned to Chris Kujawski, a principal designer at Microsoft. Kujawski led the design for the Xbox Series S / X consoles.</p><div><figcaption><em>The front and rear of the Xbox Keystone device.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div><p>Microsoft&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527420/microsoft-xbox-tv-app-streaming-stick-xcloud">first announced</a>&nbsp;it was planning an Xbox streaming device in 2021 but eventually canceled its Keystone device because it couldn’t quite get the price to around $100. Xbox chief Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/10/23396891/microsoft-xbox-keystone-game-streaming-box">revealed Keystone on his office shelf in 2022</a>, with the official Xbox account on X claiming it was an “old prototype.”</p><p>“It was more expensive than we wanted it to be when we actually built it out with the hardware that we had inside,” said Spencer in an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/15/23460485/microsoft-xbox-streaming-console-keystone-delay-price">interview with <em>The Verge</em></a> in late 2022. “We decided to focus that team’s effort on delivering the smart TV streaming app.”</p><p>Microsoft went on to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/9/23159460/microsoft-xbox-tv-app-samsung-2022-tv-xbox-cloud-gaming-streaming">launch an Xbox TV app</a> instead. Available on 2022 and above Samsung TVs and monitors, the Xbox TV app launches games from Xbox Cloud Gaming and supports streaming games at 1080p at up to 60fps.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The studio behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-pals-ranked">Palworld</a> never received any formal complaint or threat of legal action from Nintendo or The Pokémon Company despite widespread debate over the open-world ‘Pokémon with guns’ survival game earlier this year.</p>

<p>That’s the claim from Pocketpair CEO Takuro Mizobe in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/palworld-pocketpair-takuro-mizobe-interview">GameFile</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-never-followed-up-on-palworld-legal-threat-developer-reveals">Eurogamer</a>), where the dev was asked about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pokemon-company-statement-on-palworld-copyright-allegations-sounds-a-lot-like-please-leave-us-the-hell-alone">a pointed statement made by The Pokémon Company</a> in the wake of Palworld’s release saying they would “investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon”.</p>
<p>The rare - if indirect - public acknowledgement came amidst <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-palworld-break-pokemons-copyright-we-asked-a-lawyer">endless debate</a> over how closely Palworld toed the line between “inspiration” and straight-up copyright infringement on Pokémon creature designs, inspiring fervent comparisons of character models, concept art and more across the internet following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-monster-collector-with-machineguns-will-launch-in-early-access-this-month">its launch into early access</a> back in January.</p>
<p>Still, despite the strong words, Mizobe said that Pocketpair heard “nothing at all” from the Pokémon makers.</p>
<p>“Nintendo and the Pokémon Company didn't say anything to us,” he confirmed.</p>

<p>Mizobe himself worked briefly at Nintendo as part of a training programme in 2020, tasked with creating a unique game design for the dual-screen DS handheld. His apparent takeaway from the experience was that “mak[ing] new things is very hard”, inspiring the developer to instead draw from existing ideas and combine them together - something that can be seen fairly explicitly in Palworld.</p>
<p>“In game development, of course, sometimes we have to do it, but, as much as possible, I try to avoid creating new things,” Mizobe added.</p>
<p>With no legal storm in sight, Palworld’s popularity continues apace, apparently going as far as to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-ceo-says-many-clones-of-pokemon-with-guns-game-are-coming-with-genshin-impact-level-successors">inspire its own Palworld-likes</a>. The blend of survival game, monster-catching adventure and ruthlessly efficient capitalism simulator in which you task caught creatures with manufacturing guns will add a new island in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-sakurajima-update-adds-a-new-island-and-lots-more-and-i-can-only-assume-thats-a-good-thing">its incoming Sakurajima update this week</a>, along with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-is-getting-new-pals-this-summer-and-there-are-plans-for-many-more">new pals</a> - including a whole new subspecies - a new raid and an extra boss to challenge. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-is-adding-its-own-pokemon-stadium-mode-with-multiplayer-pvp-arenas-later-this-year">Pokémon Stadium-like PvP arena mode</a> is also set to arrive this year, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24186545/warhammer-40k-tank-scale-model-build-night-shift<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="KdKUR9">While fans of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/warhammer-40k">Warhammer 40,000</a> and other miniatures games like to spend a lot of time on their tiny little war machines, their commitment to the craft pales in comparison to dedicated scale modelers. One such modeler, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/unclenightshift/">Martin Kovac</a>, recently published a video to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NightShiftScaleModels">YouTube</a> that makes that abundantly clear. It also raises the question: Why aren’t hobby painters paying more attention to these incredible artists?</p>
<p id="zCYr9L">A little over a year ago I took a break from painting up a bunch of minis for <em>40K</em> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23153625/horus-heresy-age-of-darkness-price-availability-release-date-review"><em>Warhammer: The Horus Heresy</em></a> to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23580330/painting-warhammer-40k-miniatures-model-airplane">try my hand at a model airplane</a>, my first in nearly three decades. The experience taught me so many things about tools, materials, and organization — lessons that continue to influence my hobby time even today. But the experience also broadened my perspective, adding several scale modelers to my YouTube subscription list. Kovac’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NightShiftScaleModels">Night Shift</a> was among them, and I’ve enjoyed his work on World War II-era armor and dioramas for more than a year now. So color me surprised when he showed up a little over a week ago with a plastic <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/legiones-astartes-sicaran-battle-tank-2022">Sicaran Battle Tank</a>.</p>
<p id="aSYkyU">In a nearly 30-minute video posted on June 14, Kovac details his entire process from start to finish. In addition to showing how he used oil paints and enamel washes to develop the Sicaran’s delicate patina, he also gives lots of examples of how to add more realistic textures to different parts of the model. I was especially blown away by the handmade weld lines that he created completely from scratch, as well as all the work he put into making the tank’s largest body panels look more like metal.</p>
<p id="ynsm2i">There’s just one catch: Some of the fine detail work that Kovac did at the end makes it so that the final model can’t be touched with bare human hands. So while this tank looks amazing, it’s not at all suitable for play. Regardless, it’s one of the best videos I’ve ever seen about the modern scale modeling hobby. If you have a pile of plastic slowly rising in your workspace, this might be just the dose of inspiration you need to dig back into it. </p>

I did not finish the most recent expansion until just before <em>Dawntrail</em>, rather than in the weeks and months following its 2021 release, even though I started the expansion with everyone else. And that has to do with one of<em> Endwalker</em>’s major flaws: pacing.</p><p>The stakes of <em>Endwalker </em>were incredibly high. It was positioned as the end of the Hydaelan/Zodiark saga that began in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-realm-reborns-ending-was-kind-of-a-letdown-1846382285&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-realm-reborns-ending-was-kind-of-a-letdown-1846382285"><em>A Real Reborn</em></a></span>. While it wouldn’t be the end of the MMO, it did signal the end of an era. That means a lot of story threads had to be tied up in <em>Endwalker</em>, and not all of them are done so cleanly. Jumping from Old Sharlayan to Thavnair to Garlemald to the Moon to the past back to Old Sharlayanand then to the end of the universe is a lot of mileage in one expansion. Each of these locations includes its own characters and stories that depict how the world is preparing for the end times, but none of them get the room to breathe they so desperately need. While moments in Elpis with Venat and the other ancients stand out as a high point in the expansion, my time in the other locations is mostly a forgettable blur. </p><p>The slog is what held me back from completing <em>Endwalker </em>until only recently. After the high of Elpis, players are forced into an extensive marathon in Sharlyan that amounts to the most mundane fetch quests. Elpis ends with a high-adrenaline cascade of story reveals and emotional moments and the player then has to put that on the shelf to go carry boxes. This back-and-forth between engaging design and tedious mundanity makes <em>Endwalker </em>a rough expansion to get through—even if it is a sort of perfect encapsulation of <em>FF14</em>.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="3dca14566eb14a4ecfd328797b998000" data-recommend-id="image://3dca14566eb14a4ecfd328797b998000" data-format="jpg" data-width="1215" data-height="683" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Citizens walk through Old Sharlayan" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Citizens walk through Old Sharlayan" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3dca14566eb14a4ecfd328797b998000" data-recommend-id="image://3dca14566eb14a4ecfd328797b998000" data-format="jpg" data-width="1215" data-height="683" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Citizens walk through Old Sharlayan" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h48280"><a id=""></a><strong>The end of the world as we know it</strong></h2><p><em>Endwalker </em>boldly tried to subvert players’ expectations for a grand finale. Within the first third of the expansion players do the impossible: Defeat Zodiark. The big bad is gone. But the end of the world is still coming. The rest of the expansion then slowly reveals Meteion as the true villain, a creation of an ancient that has spent years becoming disillusioned with life due to the never-ending suffering and death she has witnessed across the universe. It becomes a story about resilience in the face of the base evils of existence. Essentially it’s <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>’s take on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em></a></span>. Yeah, we know life kind of sucks and everything ends, but we still hope and dream that there are better things. </p><p>One moment stands out as the high point in the expansion: The cutscene after players complete The Mothercrystal trial. In it, Hydaelyn reveals that to send players to the end of the universe to face Meteion she will give up her aether, essentially leaving her children alone for the first time. “Long after I have gone, though not even my souls remaineth,” Hydaelyn says in her final goodbye, “My love will be with you forever, my dearest children.” In that goodbye, we can call her by her true name, Venat. We can see her as no longer a god, but a woman finally able to rest at ease knowing we are safe in each other’s hands.</p><figure id="" data-id="d51864e5d91b89cb24611b64565413c2" data-recommend-id="image://d51864e5d91b89cb24611b64565413c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hydaelyn floats in front of the mother crystal" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hydaelyn floats in front of the mother crystal" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d51864e5d91b89cb24611b64565413c2" data-recommend-id="image://d51864e5d91b89cb24611b64565413c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hydaelyn floats in front of the mother crystal" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sadly I find that the <em>Endwalker</em>’s ending is a messier conclusion that fails to reach that same height. After finally facing down Meteion, players have one last battle against another villain, Zenos that leaves the player tired. I genuinely sighed in exasperation when I had completed the final dungeon, then the final trial, and had to face Zenos in an instanced event. It’s a letdown compared to the operatic encounter with Meteion and it undermines the expansion’s last moments.<br></p><p><em>Endwalker</em> was always going to be a hard expansion to pull off. It was the follow-up to <em>Shadowbringers</em>, generally considered the height of <em>FF14 </em>and one of the best <em>Final Fantasy</em> stories period. In addition, it had to wrap up a decade-long story but not wrap it up so conclusively that the MMO couldn’t continue in later expansions (such as <em>Dawntrail</em>). That’s a lot to accomplish and I’m not sure anything could have lived up to players’ sky-high expectations. And yet within the flawed mess of <em>Endwalker</em> is so much beauty.</p><p><em>Endwalker</em>’s successful moments<em> </em>are owed to the years-long relationship players have built with this world, its characters, and each other. Watching my Warrior of Light face down the end of times with the Scions of the Seventh Dawn pulls at the heartstrings in a way no other game can. The central conflict against Meteion is an extreme test of their (and my) convictions. As heroes of the realm, our mission has always been to find hope even in the darkest of times. <em>Endwalker </em>is the extreme of that. Do I really think going through all these boring quests is worth it to get to the end of the expansion, to save the world, to see these characters earn those happy endings? Yes. I do.</p><figure id="" data-id="2e13810258964876c1c9a0a9949c9d17" data-recommend-id="image://2e13810258964876c1c9a0a9949c9d17" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Scions of the Seventh Dawn pose in a group shot" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Scions of the Seventh Dawn pose in a group shot" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2e13810258964876c1c9a0a9949c9d17" data-recommend-id="image://2e13810258964876c1c9a0a9949c9d17" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Scions of the Seventh Dawn pose in a group shot" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I love <em>Endwalker </em>and all of its flaws because I love <em>Final Fantasy 14 </em>and all of its flaws. In that sense, <em>Endwalker </em>epitomizes the MMO I love. It also sends it out on a beautiful note. When asked what the Warrior of Light will do next, my character gives a wry smile and looks to the sky. She’s clearly looking forward to the next adventure. Even if I never saw her and the Scions again after this, I’m content. </p><p>With <em>Dawntrail </em>just around the corner, I’m conflicted. My love for <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> has been reaffirmed by <em>Endwalker</em>, but the stories of the characters I love were wrapped with such a fine bow that I don’t know what else the game can offer me. I think of Venat’s final words about sending her children out into the world without her. They don’t need her anymore. I don’t know if they need me, or any player anymore.</p><hr><p><em>Dawntrail </em>promises to pave the way for new stories to come, only time will tell if they are still worth telling.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In less than a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-4-being-delisted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full day since the announcement</a> of the delisting of Forza Horizon 4, the gaming community has exhibited unprecedented enthusiasm, with players eagerly lining up to dive into the game. Within mere hours of the announcement, Forza Horizon 4 achieved a new all-time player peak record on Steam; learn more below.</p>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1293830/charts/#48h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, as soon as the news of Forza Horizon 4 getting delisted surfaced online, players instantly started hopping on to the game, probably to get as much out of the digital copy before the game is eventually removed. Intriguingly, the number of players that have arrived in the past 2 hours has broken Forza Horizon 4’s all-time player peak record set in 2021. At the time of writing, the game’s new all-time peak was set around 2 hours ago, with 48,437 concurrent players, absolutely smashing the previous number of 40,399.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The surge in players clearly demonstrates the community’s love for the title. Not only are old players returning to the game, but new ones are trying it out before it disappears. Additionally, the fact that the game is offered at a whopping <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293830/Forza_Horizon_4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">80% discount on Steam </a>helps their case, too. At the same time, it is worth noting that the game will still be accessible through physical copies. However, in today’s digital gaming era, the sudden disappearance of games raises questions about the best approach for game preservation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once upon a time, Microsoft had plans to produce a streaming-based console that would have minimal hardware and rely entirely on a SOIP operating model to play games through Xbox Game Pass. It was later scrapped because of pricing issues – but it was rumoured that it ‘should have’ cost between $100 and $130, coming bundled with a controller. </p>



<p>In a recent discovery, a long-lost patent filing has been discovered bearing some ‘blueprint’ images of Project Keystone, which was the codename for the streaming-based Xbox console.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-small-but-mighty">Small but Mighty</h2>



<p>Windows Central has dug up some documentation that showcases Project Keystone, which would have been small enough to fit under any television set or tuck neatly behind a monitor, relying on nothing more than a controller and an internet connection to stream games.</p>



<p>In the images, we’re treated to a few angles of Keystone:</p>

<p>It’s nothing too stunning to look at, but it does line up quite nicely with the current generation of Xbox consoles. It has the blocky aesthetic of an Xbox Series X|S unit and boasts all the trappings of a low-energy, low-resource gaming device. To the rear of Keystone, there’s a power port, an HDMI port, and an ethernet port – simple. There’s a single USB port on the front of the console to accommodate an accessory or a charging cable for a controller, and that’s it.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ftc-leak-xbox-cloud-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">last year’s massive FTC leaks</a>, it was suggested that Keystone was still on the cards at Microsoft, sitting in a project list and being tagged as ‘Funded’. It’s not known what happened to that claim, but the consensus is that it was outdated information.</p>



<p>Do you think Project Keystone would have been a good idea, or would it have gone the way of Google Stadia and the Ouya?</p>

<section><p>Between 14 player characters with different abilities, a bunch of guns, and hundreds of loadout customizations, The First Descendant brings a lot of variety to its gunplay.</p></section>

                <p dir="ltr">When it launches on July 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-first-descendant/" data-ref-id="5000-567980">The First Descendant</a> will enter a genre that, lately, has had more failures than successes. High-profile games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/anthem-review-two-halves/1900-6417093/" data-ref-id="1900-6417093">Anthem</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/redfall-review-half-staked/1900-6418062/" data-ref-id="1900-6418062">Redfall</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review-loot-world-order/1900-6418174/" data-ref-id="1900-6418174">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-avengers-review-/1900-6417560/" data-ref-id="1900-6417560">Marvel's Avengers</a> all operated in the same space that the upcoming loot shooter is hoping to enter, and all struggled to make lasting positive impressions. Even the king of loot shooters, Destiny 2, has struggled--though developer Bungie just put out an acclaimed expansion, the game might have been at its lowest point ever just a year ago. Loot shooter players can be a tough crowd.</p><p dir="ltr">I recently played about an hour of The First Descendant at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/summer-game-fest-2024/">Summer Game Fest 2024's Play Days event</a>, which wasn't enough to get a full sense of whether developer Nexon will avoid the pitfalls that seem to doom so many of these games. It did, however, give a sense of moment-to-moment gameplay that seems to change significantly depending on which of the 14 characters you play throughout the game. The huge amount of customizations that come with guns, characters, and modifications you can make to your loadout suggest that The First Descendant will offer a whole variety in ways to play it. That, coupled with what sounds like a large amount of content at release, including for its endgame, has me cautiously optimistic that The First Descendant can succeed where so many other recent games have failed.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The First Descendant - Xbox Extended Gameplay First Look</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">I played as Eseimo in the demo, one of the three new "Descendants" that Nexon is adding to the game at launch, who focuses on using high explosives and tanky, overwhelming force. The demo also included some new content coming at launch, and I was able to jump into one of the game's dungeons on my own and fight through it. The mission sends you into a snowy facility overrun by enemies, culminating with a boss fight at the end. It gave a pretty good sense of Eseimo's high-damage, crowd-controlling capabilities, and how he might contribute in a group.</p><p dir="ltr">The core of The First Descendant is third-person shooting, the kind where you do a lot of running around and dodge-rolling as you fight. The shooting felt solid generally, capturing the same vibes as something like Outriders, with punchy guns that can easily mow down smaller enemies but require a little extra effort against beefier opponents. I mostly used an assault rifle that kept the bullets flying as much as possible, but The First Descendant includes 11 firearm classes that give some variety to players and their loadouts.</p><p dir="ltr">As you might expect, Eseimo's abilities include whipping grenades into crowds--these came in clutch in the dungeon, where tougher opponents joined a flood of enemies. The trek through the facility included a portion in which I had to defend a large room that had a big dome forcefield in the center while waiting for a door to unlock. The room flooded with enemies, including heavy units carrying large medieval-like shields and even larger, tougher enemies that took a lot of fire to bring down.</p><p dir="ltr">You get both a recharging shield and a health bar in The First Descendant, with the latter becoming vulnerable while the former is broken. The recharge on my shields took quite a while, however, which meant that tactical repositioning (running away) is often extremely important to keeping alive as a solo player. It made for a fast and frenetic experience throughout the dungeon, and one that I had a pretty good time with.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325192-tfd_worldmisson_003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4325192" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325192-tfd_worldmisson_003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4325192"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325192-tfd_worldmisson_003.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325194-tfd_worldmisson_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325195-tfd_worldmisson_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4325194,1300-4325195" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4325194-tfd_worldmisson_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4325195-tfd_worldmisson_001.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325194-tfd_worldmisson_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325195-tfd_worldmisson_001.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">During that fight, success required keeping clear of smaller melee troops while focusing on the shield-bearing troopers to thin out the numbers of tougher, more dangerous enemies, all while being conscious of positioning because characters could pass through the big forcefield, but it would block bullets and other attacks. When things really got tough, I could activate Eseimo's most powerful active ability, which essentially turned him into a truck. You charge forward with a dash move that lets you smash through enemies, but you're unable to stop until you trigger the ability again to let loose a powerful explosion all around you. It was great for cutting through tons of enemies and putting massive hurt on some of the tough-to-kill variants.</p><p dir="ltr">The dungeon culminated in a boss fight that gave me some sense of what mechanical elements The First Descendant will employ to make its gunfights a little more interesting. The seven-foot-tall, minigun-wielding fighter was tough to take head-on and, to make matters worse, was flanked by snipers, more of the roving melee troopers, and enemies carrying shields, which required a lot of running around the arena.</p><p dir="ltr">That arena was also oddly shaped, making the already tough fight even tougher. The boss came up an elevator attached to a cliff face, its path winding around along the side of a mountain. Staying put wasn't an option, as the boss would continuously launch mortars that would stun and pummel you if you didn't clear out before they landed. Yet venture too far to one side and it was a deadly fall. However, if you followed the snaking path upward, you’d reach a position where you could clear out enemies and shoot down at the boss and his minions as they flooded up the path.</p><p dir="ltr">The toughest part of the fight came about halfway through, when the boss summoned a set of drones that shielded him from damage. This was where things got a bit more technical; to destroy the shield, I had to shoot the drones, yet only one was vulnerable at a time and only briefly. Zooming in for a quick sniper shot or two was enough to bring the drones down, but with the constant reinforcements of enemy troops and the mortar and minigun attacks from the boss, a lot of coordination was required just to stay alive. As a team, the boss fight might have been easier, given they used careful coordination to keep everyone alive and fighting. For a single player, however, it could get pretty challenging. However, after two rounds of destroying drones, and several close calls, I finally toppled the boss.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325193-tfd_dungeon_f05_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4325193" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325193-tfd_dungeon_f05_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4325193"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325193-tfd_dungeon_f05_002.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The hour-long demo gave me enough time to mess with one character and complete one mission. What I played felt good, if a little fleeting and hard to pin down. From the sounds of things, though, The First Descendant will offer a lot of different content. A presentation during the demo noted that Nexon has expanded and deepened the story content in the game from what was previously shown in its beta tests, and will be adding specific stories for each of its 14 characters as well.</p><p dir="ltr">For loot shooters like this, endgame is a major consideration--it's the content that will keep players coming back long-term. The dungeon I saw is one of the game's higher-level areas, and Nexon said there will be 16 of those dungeons available at launch. They'll include normal and hard difficulty levels, with the tougher versions dishing out better loot. There are also Void Intercept missions, which are The First Descendant's real claim to fame. These are battles against absolutely massive creatures and look like they have the ability to create some intense, memorable moments that'll help keep The First Descendant interesting over the long term.</p><p dir="ltr">I didn't really get a sense of the loot system in my limited play time, but I was impressed by the level of customization and build-crafting that The First Descendant seems to make available. In addition to all the guns and the many characters with their own special abilities, there are "modules." The First Descendant has something like 560 of these, which you can equip in different combinations to further customize how you play with a series of passive bonuses and alterations to your guns and abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">On paper, all of that sounds very strong, and I enjoyed my short time with the game and the one mission I was able to play. If nothing else, the demo left me with the impression that The First Descendant is launching with a lot to do, solid third-person shooter gunplay, and character-specific elements that mix things up pretty significantly.</p><p dir="ltr">The First Descendant launches on July 2 for PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, and PS4.</p>
