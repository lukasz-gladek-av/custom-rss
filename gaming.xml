            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ecco-dolphin-remasters-new-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>creator Ed Annunziata has revealed that remasters of the first two games in the series are on the way, and that a brand new entry in the franchise is also in the works.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> as part of Xbox's Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, Annunziata says that remasters of&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>and its 1994 followup&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin: The Tides of Time&nbsp;</em>are on the cards, although it's not clear whether work on said remasters has begun yet.</p>

<p>He then says a "new, third game" that features "contemporary play and GPU sensibilities" will be made, although it's not clear whether he means a third modern project or a third&nbsp;<em>Ecco&nbsp;</em>game overall.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ecco-the-dolphin-remasters-new-game-website-countdown.jpg?itok=mKGlFMeC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ecco-the-dolphin-remasters-new-game-website-countdown.jpg?itok=P3-AdhKD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>At time of writing, this is what you see if you visit the&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>website.</figcaption></figure><p>If it's the latter, then Annunziata is perhaps unfairly skipping over 1995's&nbsp;<em>Ecco Jr.</em>, its rather odd Sega Pico-only sequel, and 2000's Dreamcast game&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future</em>, which was due to get its own sequel before the Dreamcast's demise.</p>

<p>Either way, Annunziata says interested fans should keep an eye on the official&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>. At time of writing, said website shows only a counter that seems to promise some kind of announcement or reveal at the end of April next year, counting down around 8,500 hours to do so.</p>

<p>In the interview, Annunziata says he believes that "gamers possess a higher than average IQ" when compared to "the average human". This he puts down to gamers' "socially connected" nature, as well as the fact (as he says) that they're "frequently fully engaged and challenged mentally with real-time systems and information technology".</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>revival will surely bring at least a modicum of joy to those who were hoping that&nbsp;<em>Dolphin Quest</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intellivision-amico-reveals-new-game-from-ecco-dolphin-team" rel="nofollow">spiritual successor</a> originally touted for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/leaked-intellivision-amico-documents-paint-grim-picture" rel="nofollow">ill-fated</a> Intellivision Amico, would come to fruition. There's a much better chance of&nbsp;<em>Ecco&nbsp;</em>happening than&nbsp;<em>Dolphin Quest</em>, that's for sure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dolphin-quest-ecco-the-dolphin-team.jpg?itok=W_vhp-6T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dolphin-quest-ecco-the-dolphin-team.jpg?itok=L9yoNdqR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dolphin Quest&nbsp;</em>probably isn't happening, is it?</figcaption></figure><p><em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>is just one of the many classic IPs Sega is currently in the process of reviving. Others include the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-new-virtua-fighter-game" rel="nofollow"><em>Virtua Fighter</em></a>, ninja platformer series&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinobi-movie-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Shinobi</em></a>, and wacky arcade racer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crazy-taxi-reboot-open-world-mmo" rel="nofollow"><em>Crazy Taxi</em></a>.</p>

<p>It's likely we'll get to hear more about the&nbsp;<em>Ecco the Dolphin&nbsp;</em>revival in the coming months, although it's not clear whether the above timer is counting down to a release or just a reveal. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Then we will make a new, third game with contemporary play and [graphics] sensibilities. Stay tuned."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is, of course, already a "third" game. As the last mainline Ecco instalment, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ecco-the-dolphin-defender-of-the-future"><u>Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future</u></a> was released on Dreamcast 25 years ago in 2000. However, creator Annunziata wasn't involved. A further sequel, Ecco 2: Sentinels of the Universe, which had been written as a direct sequel to Defender of the Future, was cancelled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I just want to finally be able to enter my secret password from the end of Tides of Time. I still have it written in the codes section of the game manual," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1kfj391/comment/mqsd37c/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a> one fan, while another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1kfj391/comment/mqshuvr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reminded</u></a> us: "I wonder how many people know how completely bonkers the plot of the games are."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">10 (Unintentionally) Terrifying Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Annunziata didn't provide any additional details as to when we'll get to be reunited with Ecco, but a countdown on the official <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ecco the Dolphin website</u></a> is set to expire in 8,508 hours' time — that's about a year from now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ecco the Dolphin originally launched in 1992 on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, and was followed by a sequel, Ecco: The Tides of Time, in 1994. Ecco Jr. and Ecco Jr. and the Great Ocean Treasure Hunt were released in 1995, although they were "edutainment" games and primarily developed as learning tools.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ecco the Dolphin sees you play as the titular dolphin, as your underwater world has been devastated by a swirling gust of air and water. You must help him navigate back through treacherous tropical reefs and freezing polar ice floes to reunite him with his dolphin pod. We thought the 2000 remake was okay, writing: "Ecco the Dolphin is a classic from SEGA. But sometimes classics should stay in the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For those who have played Ecco before, there's really no reason to come back to it," we wrote of the 2007 remake in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/17/ecco-the-dolphin-review"><u>IGN's Ecco the Dolphin review</u></a>. "There are no extras offered and the Achievements are junk. If you've never played Ecco, then you may want to give it a go. It really is one of the more innovative titles of its time. But, again, that time has long passed, and Ecco's gameplay doesn't stand the test of time like Sonic's."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last Ecco the Dolphin game fared much better, getting a 7.6 score in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ecco-the-dolphin-defender-of-the-future"><u>IGN's Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future review</u></a>, saying: "If you thought Flipper had personality, wait until you get a load of Ecco the Dolphin. Experience amazing visuals and an engrossing story, and defend the ocean that is rightfully yours."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

this content!</p></div><p>During the day, players have a number of options for how they want to prepare for the fights ahead--they can take on enemies to level up, search for powerful loot and weapons, infiltrate enemy strongholds in search of information, or challenge more dangerous enemies and dungeon-like lairs to unlock unique items. In all of this, players can choose to travel together, or split up and try to cover more ground. Throughout the day, players may encounter random events or be interrupted by unexpected enemies.</p><p>When night falls, the focus shifts to survival--an ever-contracting ring of fire pushes the player-characters towards a boss fight, which on the final night will be the challenging Nightlord. Whether players triumph against the Nightlord or fall short, they will be able to return to the hub world, the Roundtable Hold, with relics and currency to upgrade and equip their character for the next run.</p><p>Players can pick from one of eight classes, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-trailer-news-everything-we-know/2900-6095/" data-ref-id="2900-6095">four of which</a> were available to try in the Nightreign network test--Guardian, Duchess, Recluse, and Wylder. The gameplay overview goes into more detail about two more classes--a ranged archer known as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-new-ironeye-class-is-an-agile-archer-that-deals-death-from-afar/1100-6530523/" data-ref-id="1100-6530523">Ironeye</a>, and a heavy-hitting melee fighter called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/elden-ring-nightreign-raider-character-gameplay-trailer/2300-6465900/" data-ref-id="2300-6465900">Raider</a>. Two more Nightfarers are shown in the trailer, but are not detailed. The Executor's name is briefly revealed in a clip of the character selection screen, but not much else has been revealed about the katana-wielding warrior. The final Nightfarer is shown to be a pale woman with a harp, but not much is known about this final character, including her abilities or even her name.</p><p>Players will be able to customize their Nightfarers to a degree with skins--including some based on other From Software games, with Faraam, Solaire, and Leonhard-inspired skins shown off in the gameplay video. There will also be a narrative aspect to the Nightfarer, with players undertaking a journey to recover their characters' lost memories.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign releases on May 30 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC via Steam.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive have announced that JRPG-inspired adventure&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has hit another big sales milestone less than two weeks after its initial release.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1919701863491838316" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the two studios reveal that&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has reached two million sales since its launch in late April. The figure means the game has picked up another million and a half sales since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k" rel="nofollow">very quickly hitting 500,000</a>&nbsp;on launch day.</p>

<p>Sandfall says it's "watched in awe" as players flocked to&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, "feeling every step, every emotion, every revelation" alongside those playing through the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>-style RPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m-boss.jpg?itok=USkaGTri 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m-boss.jpg?itok=83SgQxfC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Turn-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>is selling pretty well.</figcaption></figure><p>As before, the two million figure is particularly impressive when considering that&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>is also available on Game Pass (as part of the PC and Ultimate tiers, at least), so two million people have bought it rather than opting to play it via the subscription service.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, it's a turn-based RPG inspired by the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>series, and it's also a pretty strong argument against&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>producer Naoki Yoshida's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/final-fantasy-16-ditched-turn-based-combat-to-appeal-to-younger-generations-producer-says/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">assertions</a> that gamers don't want turn-based games anymore.</p>

<p>The game follows the titular Expedition 33 as it sets out to put an end to the Paintress, a solemn and terrifying figure who paints increasingly low numbers each year, with everyone of the equivalent age perishing as she paints.</p>

<p>It features staples of the JRPG genre like an overworld map with plenty of optional locations to explore, party members that can be swapped out on the fly, and turn-based battles (albeit with real-time elements and a parry system).</p>

			<p>The price of video games started rising in 2020, but even if that didn't happen five years ago, a price increase would have happened sooner or later for a few reasons, according to former PlayStation president Shuhei Yoshida.</p>
<p>Speaking in a lengthy interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://playstationinside.fr/interview-shuhei-yoshida-playstation-inside-english-version" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Inside</a>, Yoshida-san was asked about the increase in video game prices, which may become more normalized with the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. According to the former PlayStation president, this price increase would have happened sooner or later, regardless of who would have been the initiator. Inflation is real and significant, Yoshida-san continued, and the fact that players expect ever more ambitious games with rising production costs is a combination that can only increase the price of games.</p>
<p>To keep production costs under control and continue producing the AAA games the public buys, Shuhei Yoshida added, industry actors are keen to diversify their revenues. This is the reason behind the proliferation of remasters, remakes, and PC ports, as they are an easy solution to bring in profits to finance new games. Subscription services and GAAS titles also help finance AAA games.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the former PlayStation president feels that a balance between production costs and game prices must be found. GTA 6 will obviously be a case in point, but the recent Clair Obscure: Expedition 33 has shown that it is possible to release an excellent game with tighter teams and budgets without compromising quality.</p>
<p>It isn't just Nintendo that is increasing the price of its games in the near future, but also Microsoft. While the publisher did not increase game prices when the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S generation began, some of its games will be priced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">$80 starting this holiday season</a>. The price of the Xbox Series X has also been increased worldwide, with the steepest increase in the United States.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-bored-ubisoft/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For all the hate Ubisoft gets for its formulaic games, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 fans should definitely thank the French publisher, as director Guillame Broche started working on the project because he was bored with his job at the publisher.</p>
<p>Speaking in a recent interview with the<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c078j5gd71ro.amp"> BBC</a>, the director of the popular role-playing game released late last month revealed that the idea for the game came while he was working at Ubisoft. Bored at his job, he wanted to do something different and eventually left the publisher to bring his ideas inspired by his favorite childhood series, Final Fantasy, to life.</p>
<p>Even more interesting is to learn how people were recruited to develop Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Jennifer Svedberg-Yen initially replied to a Reddit message from the game's director looking for voice actors to record something for a free demo. Originally cast as one of the main characters, Jennifer Svedgerb-Yen became the game's main writer. Similarly, composer Lorien Testard, who had never worked on a video game before, was discovered on SoundCloud. While this was generally attributed to a <em>"Guillaume effect"</em> by the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 writer, the director more modestly admitted that his success rate was due to the COVID-19 pandemic and people looking for a creative outlet at the time and massive luck, although he did not message people randomly, but only those who seemed to be in line with the direction of the process.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Guillaume Branche's approach to game development paid off immensely, as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is quickly becoming one of the most successful role-playing games released in recent times. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:kazma5qkd2r37qfwftqh3lct/post/3loiolfljys25?ref_src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just today</a>, it was confirmed that the game sold 2 million copies worldwide in only 12 days of availability, which is an incredible result considering it's also available as part of the Xbox Game Pass library. This massive success is wholly deserved, as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is an excellent game that no fan of the genre should pass on, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">review.</a></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <p>Nowadays everything is an Xbox, and that includes Sony's PS5. Last month, the console's best-selling games all came from its rival publisher.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/05/playstation-store-april-2025s-top-downloads/?sf277169095=1">shared by Sony</a>, the number one downloaded game on PS5 for April in Europe was the newly-released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>, followed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> and Minecraft.</p>
<p>In the US and Canada it was a similar story: Oblivion top, followed by Minecraft and Forza Horizon 5.</p>

<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> was also a best-seller (fourth in Europe, sixth in the US) - a game that has been heavily promoted by Xbox and is also available on Game Pass.</p>
<p>Additionally, the previously Xbox exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> has been selling well on Sony's console, too.</p>
<p>Microsoft began its <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">"This is an Xbox" campaign</a> in November last year as it builds a "future defined by player choice".</p>
<p>It's been heavily memed, but clearly it's working as games previously exclusive to Xbox consoles make their way to PS5 and top the charts.</p>
<p>Indeed, as we reported back in January this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-the-top-selling-game-on-xbox-and-playstation-last-quarter">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was the best-selling game across both Xbox and PlayStation</a> over the previous quarter. Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">notoriously acquired Activision</a> - and the rights to Call of Duty - back in 2023 for $68.7bn.</p>
<p>Oblivion Remastered released at the end of April and has seen big success on Steam as well as on consoles - within its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-off-to-a-good-start-on-steam">first day it reached a peak of 182,298 concurrent players</a>, which has since risen to 216,784.</p>
<p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> is deservedly one of Xbox's most successful franchises," wrote Eurogamer's Tom Orry on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-now-has-one-of-the-greatest-racing-games-of-all-time-and-it-feels-like-im-cheating-on-my-xbox">one of the greatest racing games of all time</a>.

So, we know that Oblivion Remastered is a sales hit despite also being available on Microsoft's Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this success, it seems inevitable that more remasters of Bethesda games will follow, with most suggesting either Fallout 3 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document">it was leaked back in 2023</a>) or Fallout: New Vegas are next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If either game is indeed next, what should players expect?

That will tell you what they felt was necessary to change from Fallout 3,” Nesmith said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know in Fallout 4 there was a lot of work done on the gun combat, because Fallout 3 is the first time they ever tried to do a shooter-style game.

            <p>Someone has already decoded the strange, banana-like text in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. They have found the mon-key to unlocking it all, if you will. </p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/random-youtuber-cracks-donkey-kong-bananzas-secret-language-before-launch">Nintendo Life</a>, last week YouTuber 2Chrispy released a video detailing how he had gone about deciphering the strange text seen throughout Donkey Kong Bananza's trailers, gameplay footage, website and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">even the Nintendo Today app</a>.</p>

<p>The YouTuber said after he spotted the language in Donkey Kong Bananza, he began to wonder if Nintendo had in fact hidden a secret alphabet in its upcoming game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/imagining-and-deciphering-writing-systems-for-games">much like it had done in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>. And, it turns out it has.</p>
<p>Thanks to more patience than I could ever hope to possess and a good recollection of the Nintendo Treehouse presentation, 2Chrispy used the in-game term 'Chip Exchange' as a starting point. As a reminder, because I had forgotten, during Nintendo's Donkey Kong Banaza Treehouse stream, a notice appeared when the player picked up a Banandium Chip. "Trade these for bananas at any Chip Exchange," this pop up read.</p>
<p>2Chrispy realised the symbol for the Banandium Chip also showed up in the game above a sign with that strange text. The YouTuber noticed the text beneath this symbol had the same number of characters as the word 'Exchange'. Additionally, the text started and ended with the same symbol, which looked a bit like a back to front E. Using this new found information, he started to fill out his "Bananabet", looking for recurring patterns in the game's text and using tools such as a word finder to keep the decoding efforts going.</p>
<p>Other words 2Chrispy managed to find included the likes of 'Welcome' and 'Hint'. There is even an in-game sign players will be able to find, which according to 2Chrispy's translations reads:</p>
<p>"Message. Thank you for reading. Someone."</p>
<p>All in all, this really is quite an impressive feat from the YouTuber, and if you are interested in Donkey Kong Bananza's world building, I really suggest checking out 2Chrispy's video (see below). It's a fascinating and really rather engaging watch.</p>

			<p>Captain Blood is a name that conjures up nostalgic memories for older gamers, the title being first used for a critically acclaimed Amiga game featuring a galactic storyline. That’s not the Captain Blood that’s going under the microscope today, though this is still a game with its own fascinating history. Originally planned for release in 2010, the game had already been affected by delays and a shift from the original Xbox to the 360, but was cancelled due to legal issues and the team disbanding. Jump ahead a decade and a full build was leaked online to spark a small amount of interest, and no, in the grand old year of 2025, Captain Peter Blood is set to finally ship out, sail the seas and bring piratical justice to the Spanish on behalf of good old Blighty. Does that tortured history mean that this is a treasure being brought to the light or is it a dodgy mug of grog that’ll see you heaving over the side of the boat?</p>
<p><iframe title="CAPTAIN BLOOD RELEASE DATE ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DvC9RGxq68w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First up, Captain Blood looks its age. It is presented in a higher resolution than would originally have been possible, but the textures and character models have a chunkiness that scream of the mid-2000s. Personally I really dig that as it’s an artstyle that has been somewhat lost to time – most nostalgic aesthetics go back to an earlier date. It reminded me a lot of the Toby Gard cult classic Galleon, but with a PS2-era God of War makeover. This is very much an old school beat ’em up with hundreds of cannon fodder enemies and a vast amount of blood to be spilled.</p>


<p>I was impressed by the music here, with many of the background tunes having just enough of a Hans Zimmer Pirates of the Caribbean vibe to feel perfectly suited whilst clearly being legally distinct. The same praise can’t be granted to the voice acting, however. Not because it’s bad per se, but because the mix is bloody awful and you’ll mostly miss out on whatever is being said and have to rely on subtitles instead. This is ironically a problem that mostly affects modern film and TV, so it’s not something that can be put down to the nostalgic presentation.</p>


<p>Despite his ominous moniker, Captain Peter Blood is very much the scoundrel hero in this story. Taking place in the 17th century during the various skirmishes and sea battles over control of the Caribbean, the narrative is surprisingly down to earth and lacking the kind of supernatural aspects I was expecting after years of Disney’s takes on the setting. The enemies are made up of dastardly pirates and the even more despicable Spanish (within the game of course) with a limited range of enemy types and several boss battles. Blood is happy to serve the orders of the British, but is more concerned with riches than patriotism.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay, the majority of the action is a very standard early God of War clone with far more simple mechanics and little in the way of subtlety and sophistication. Ironically this makes it stand out far more nowadays than it would have if it was released when originally planned since this is a genre that has fallen out of fashion – especially considering the direction Kratos himself has taken in recent years. While clearly a fully 3D title, the combat has a lot in common with traditional lane-based beat ’em ups and button mashing combos are the order of the day.</p>

<p>The vast majority of your fighting will take place with your trusty cutlass, but secondary weapons can be picked up and used for a limited time, with the two-handed sword being great for clearing out groups of enemies. There are some oddities here, though, with one weapon labelled a hatchet but clearly being a large sword. You can even find the odd musket to give you a ranged approach alongside your normal pistol – a rechargeable gun that is mostly used to stagger enemies and interrupt their attacks.</p>
<p>There are a decent amount of combos to unlock with the gold you’ll find along your journey but I found that a couple of these were far more useful than others – especially ones that have an unblockable component so much of the game involved spamming the same two or three attacks. There was even a trophy to unlock for only using one combo for a whole level which seemed as if the developers knew this was a valid approach. Despite the effectiveness of such combos, it is far too easy to get stunlocked and killed by mobs of enemies and I died more to this than the boss battles. There are several ship battle sections which see you manning cannons to sink your foes whilst fighting off any that board your vessel. These are fine but don’t add much other than variety.</p>

<p>Bosses are often puzzles to be solved, with environmental aspects needing to be considered and a couple being mostly QTE sequences – did you forget this was a mid-2000s game? These sequences are fine but definitely feel like an aspect that add little to the experience. Another thing that hasn’t aged gracefully is the representation of women here. There are a grand total of two female characters, one being a stereotypical damsel in distress and the other a femme fatale (the whole spectrum of femininity in games of this era) but both are dressed in skimpy outfits and have built in buoyancy aids. This actually makes Disney seem progressive in comparison!</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Captain Blood is an odd release as it feels like a relic of its original release context. This does leave it being a nostalgic experience for those old enough to remember this era of games, but there isn’t much that isn’t done much better by its influences. Releasing decades later actually does it a favour as it feels very different to the expansive open world experiences that dominate modern gaming. As a curiosity it makes for an interesting time but it mostly confirms why such games belong in the past. Not so much buried treasure, but it's certainly better than walking the plank.	</p></div>

		<p>One of the most beloved, if slightly odd, franchises from the Sega Megadrive era is going to return with Ecco the Dolphin creator, Ed Annunziata, heading up a team that will remaster the first two games and create a third title.</p>
<p>An 8,500 hour countdown started on <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eccothedolphin.com</a>, that is equivalent to&nbsp; almost a year so we will be getting the full reveal, or perhaps even the games, at the end of April 2026.</p>


<p>“Me and the entire original team are going to remaster the original Ecco the Dolphin and Tides of Time games,” Annunziata <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/">says.</a> “Then we will make a new, third game with contemporary play and GPU sensibilities. Stay tuned to eccothedolphin.com.”</p>
<p>Annunziata’s involvement may surprise some as he sued Sega for ownership rights of the Ecco IP when he tried to make a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/03/26/ecco-the-dolphin-creator-kickstarting-the-big-blue/">sequel via Kickstarter</a>.&nbsp; A settlement was reached, but the details were never revealed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ecco the Dolphin - Mega Drive - Gameplay" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnHg210DDnQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The original game had you playing as Ecco as he swam through the seas and travels to the Arctic Ocean where he meets a whale called Big Blue. Its here things start to get a bit odd as Ecco then has to collect orbs of power from Atlantis to charge up Asterite, the oldest life form on Earth.&nbsp; The dolphin then uses a time travel machine to nip back to meet some dinosaurs, learns to talk to a Pteranodon, then zips through a portal in to outer space where he fights and alien queen. Not THE Alien Queen, but that is a movie I want to see, Ripley the Dolphin!</p>

<p>A sequel, Ecco: The Tides of Time was released, and Ecco games continued to be made in later years, but these were for educational porpoises.</p>
<p>The first two games were also ported to numerous system and could be played as part of the Sega Genesis Collection on PlayStation and Xbox.</p>

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida has addressed the debate around rising game prices, and discussed the "impossible equation" of inflation and expensive development costs.</p>
<p>Nintendo has been criticised by some fans for the increased price of its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a>, with launch game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> costing £75/$80 - something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">Nintendo has called an example of "variable pricing"</a>. Microsoft, meanwhile, has said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">some new first-party Xbox games will rise to $80 beginning later this year</a>. Reports have also suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">the forthcoming GTA 6 could cost as much as £80/$100</a>. </p>
<p>Speaking to French outlet <a href="https://playstationinside.fr/interview-shuhei-yoshida-playstation-inside-english-version">PlayStation Inside</a>, Yoshida gave his view on the current situation.</p>

<p>"I think it was going to happen sooner or later, maybe not from Nintendo, but it was going to happen eventually," he said. "We live in contrasting times, where inflation is real and significant, but people expect games that are ever more ambitious and therefore expensive to develop to cost the same. It's an impossible equation."</p>
<p>Yoshida stated the "heart of the matter lies in production costs", as nowadays games are "more technologically demanding than ever before".</p>
<p>He suggests that the "proliferation of remasters and remakes" is a way for the industry to diversify, with these projects being "a kind of 'easy' solution to bring in profits that ultimately help finance new games".</p>
<p>"So I don't know if Rockstar will jump at the chance to set the price of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> at €90 or more, to speak with your currency, but the situation is this," said Yoshida. "And we could even add subscription platforms and games as a service, which, while providing huge revenues in their own right, also help to finance AAA down the line."</p>
<p>He then pointed to the recent release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> from French studio Sandfall Interactive as an example of AA success. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day">hit a million sales within three days</a> and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-calls-clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-shining-example-of-french-audacity">praised by French President Macron</a>.</p>
<p>"In any case, a balance must be found between production costs and game prices," said Yoshida. "GTA 6 will obviously be a case in point, but if you take the example of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the game is just as phenomenal visually, despite the fact that the team only has around thirty people. This is one of the ways forward, I think, because you can make excellent games with tighter teams and budgets without compromising quality."</p>
<p>One potential way of reducing costs is using AI, which Yoshida discussed elsewhere in the interview. He believes AI can be used "creatively to improve games" but stated "AI are tools, not ends in themselves".</p>
<p>"AI will become a very important tool in the future if developers learn to use its good features," he said. "We're already seeing this today, and in any case it should be seen as a simple continuation of what has always been done in video games, because AI has been used in video games for as long as they have existed in reality.</p>
<p>"Designers and developers therefore need to master these new generative tools. It's just a matter of time, as long as we keep human artists at the heart of the project. Generative AI and its other emanations can and should be used to speed up processes and tedious tasks that don't impact on the artistic aspect of games, especially for small studios that don't have the manpower. This could also help to lower game production costs, making the video game economy more viable – as long as it doesn't lead to redundancies, of course."</p>
<p>As for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, he's most looking forward to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-focus-hasnt-shifted-to-multiplayer-miyazaki-says-despite-elden-ring-nightreign-and-the-duskbloods">Duskbloods from FromSoftware</a>. "I'm curious to see what FromSoftware will do with a Switch exclusive on a technical level, and it's always interesting to see what they come up with, especially after Elden Ring," he said.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">Yoshida left PlayStation last year</a>, he's been particularly vocal with his views on the industry: he stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-losing-their-identity-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida-shares-damning-switch-2-verdict">Nintendo is losing its identity</a> following the Switch 2 reveal, he admitted to playing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-was-great-former-playstation-exec-says-but-naughty-dog-couldnt-make-it-alongside-new-ip">Naughty Dog's ill-fate The Last of Us Online</a>, and claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-automata-revived-the-japanese-games-industry-says-former-sony-exec-shuhei-yoshida">NieR: Automata revived the Japanese games industry</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is a big game with a lot of side characters and you can traverse its world relatively freely - so freely that, 40 hours since you last saw someone, it can often be difficult to remember who they were, and why they wanted you to go kill that dude. 
</p>
<p>
Well, today's 1.0.4 update for Assassin's Creed Shadows addresses this by adding in Codex entries for the game's main cast of characters, sidekicks, antagonists and supporting antagonists, which will unlock as you meet them.
</p>
<p>
It's something that previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a> had previously but which Shadows eschewed, keeping its Codex more for historical and cultural details. Now it's back, following feedback from fans.

<p>
Today's Assassin's Creed Shadows update is set to go live at 2pm UK time (10am Eastern, 7am Pacific) and weigh in at around 4.6GB on PS5, 8.5GB on Steam or 20GB on Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>
As previously announced, today also brings the first of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-features-regular-new-story-missions-parkour-updates-new-game-plus">Shadows' free post-launch story missions that add more moments with some of the game's secondary characters</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The Works of Luis Frois centres on Yasuke's Jesuit friend who you meet a couple of times during Shadows' existing runtime. Today's new quest can be played by either Yasuke or Naoe, and also features Lady Satoko. Who is she? Well, you can now go remind yourself in the Codex.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's post-launch roadmap for Assassin's Creed Shadows looks set to offer another of these free story quests on a monthly basis - similar to the Lost Tales of Greece offered for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a> back in the day. Shadows' first paid expansion, meanwhile, will launch later in 2025.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the changes in today's patch are mostly minor bug fixes, though it's interesting to see Ubisoft further tweak the ability for environmental destruction around religious buildings in the game. "All props near an altar or a religion building will now be static, preventing any destruction," Ubisoft notes, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-day-one-patch-detailed-includes-destructible-shrine-changes-after-concern-over-copycats">previously locking down larger items at these in-game sites</a>.
</p>
<p>
Last month, a website leak suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pegi-website-leak-suggests-assassins-creed-shadows-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">Assassin's Creed Shadows would launch on Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Last week, Eurogamer published an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/working-in-the-shadows-how-an-assassins-creed-researcher-braved-the-backlash">interview with a historical researcher who worked on Assassin's Creed Shadows and braved the game's cultural backlash</a>.

            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> series is celebrating its third anniversary this week. The first video game in the series launched to critical acclaim on 5th May 2022, with a sequel - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector">Starward Vector</a> - then releasing earlier this year.</p>
<p>As part of its anniversary celebrations, developer Jump Over The Age has released a free to download solo tabletop game known as Spindlejack.</p>

<p>Spindlejack "puts players into the seat of a courier on the space station Far Spindle, a familiar location from Starward Vector. Players will navigate the station, earn Cryo, build their reputation, make their mark on the courier scene, and try to survive in a hostile system".</p>
<p>As shared by Jump Over The Age, the free tabletop game mirrors "the hard decisions and emergent storytelling that fans have come to know and love from the series". If that all sounds like your thing, <a href="https://jump-over-the-age.itch.io/citizen-sleeper-spindlejack">you can download Spindlejack here</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to releasing a new Citizen Sleeper tabletop game, the developer has also shared some interesting Citizen Sleeper-related stats. Since the series debut in 2022, the games have welcomed over two million players.</p>
<p>26 percent of the first game's players joined a commune, while 19 percent made bootleg booze from mushrooms (actually assumed this would be higher). Six percent went on to become a part of the fungal network and 1.5 percent left Lem and Mina waiting on the dock as they instead set off for a new life alone. To quote Jump Over The Age, "you monsters".</p>
<p>As for the second game in the series, 29 percent of Starward Vector players adopted a stray cat. Again, I really assumed this would be higher. 35 percent of the sequel's players got lucky with a glitched dice, 18 percent allowed Surya to turn their ship  into a flying billboard and 1.5 percent managed to complete the game on dangerous difficulty. "You heroes," says the Citizen Sleeper team. Can confirm, I am absolutely not part of that 1.5 percent.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the developer has said it will be adding French, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese localisation to Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector later this year.</p>

<p>Citizen Sleeper received <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-review-a-gentle-cerebral-game-of-belonging-and-survival">very positive reviews</a> on its release, and was nominated for a number of BAFTAs. Its sequel similarly received positive reviews, with our Bertie calling it "terrific".</p>
<p>"With a new found sense of tension, and showpiece Contract missions, Citizen Sleeper is transformed. This follow-up has improved the RPG formula in every way," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-review">Eurogamer's Citizen Sleeper 2 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In late April, Sucker Punch <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the release date of Ghost of Yōtei. The sequel to 2020's Ghost of Tsushima will be released on October 2, 2025, for Sony's PlayStation 5 console.</p>
<p>There's no doubt that it's one of the most anticipated games of the year. After all, its predecessor was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an excellent action/adventure game</a> that also set a new sales record for PlayStation 4's first-party debut. The superb reception pushed Sony to fast-track not only a sequel but also a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-in-production-to-be-directed-by-john-wicks-chad-stahelski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">movie adaptation</a> that will be directed by John Wick's Chad Stahelski.</p>
<p>Can Ghost of Yōtei meet&nbsp;<span>fans' lofty expectations, though?&nbsp;<a href="https://playstationinside.fr/interview-shuhei-yoshida-playstation-inside-english-version" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to the French website PlayStation Inside</a>, former head of PlayStation Studios Shuhei Yoshida revealed that he played the game, and fans can be assured that </span>it'll be even better than the first installment.</p>
<p><em>In the case of Ghost of Tsushima, Sucker Punch worked extensively with a Japanese producer at SIE, as well as colleagues at Japan Studio. This was a great help to the studio because the developers could show them their ideas and these Japanese people would tell them internally whether or not they were respectful of Japan and correct. The teams also visited Tsushima Island and made a real effort to immerse themselves in its history and traditions. They managed to capture the island’s unique atmosphere, which can be felt in the game, for example in the wind system, and I think that’s why it’s so successful. The game has even boosted tourism on Tsushima Island, which says a lot.</em></p>
<p><em>So, if you want to sell well in Japan, especially when you’re making a game about Japan, it’s important to have a development process that seeks to understand the country throughout. Ghost of Tsushima felt incredible to play, and having played Ghost of Yotei at several stages of its development, I can assure you that it will be even better and that Sucker Punch has done it again!</em></p>
<p>Shortly after the launch date news, Sucker Punch <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-ghost-of-yotei-details-from-sucker-punch-dig-into-yoteis-non-linear-campaign-story-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> new details about this new game. The developers said this is their biggest world with the greatest amount of player freedom. The campaign where protagonist Atsu seeks her revenge will be non-linear, meaning that players can take on the Yōtei Six (who killed Atsu's family) in any order.</p>

I'll, uh, be right back.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new Ecco the Dolphin game is in development, alongside remasters of the original two Mega Drive games.</p>
<p>The new game will have "contemporary play and GPU sensibilities" and has been revealed alongside a new countdown on the <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/">game's website</a>. It's unclear if this is counting to a final release date or further news, but either way it's currently 8510 hours away - that's 354 days and 14 hours from now, which points to 25th April 2026.</p>
<p>News of a new entry was confirmed by series creator Ed Annunziata in an interview with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/">Xbox Wire</a>, as part of a celebration of Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.</p>

<p>Annunziata and the entire original team are behind both the remasters and the new project.</p>
<p>Ecco the Dolphin was first released in 1992 for the Mega Drive and was followed by a sequel, The Tides of Time, in 1994.</p>
<p>Both games are 2D side-scrollers focused on the titular Ecco, who explores vibrant ocean environments with his sonar abilities. I still have my copy of the first game from when I was a kid: its shimmering oceans are gorgeous, but the puzzle gameplay gets very hard very quickly - not to mention its incredibly weird, alien story.</p>
<p>It's unknown yet if the new game will be 2D or 3D, but the original games were followed by the 3D Defender of the Future on the Dreamcast, though Annunziata wasn't involved with this one.</p>
<p>That game is not as well regarded and its proposed sequel was cancelled due to declining sales of the Dreamcast. Annunziata attempted to raise a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ecco-the-dolphin-creator-launches-kickstarter-for-spiritual-successor-the-big-blue">Kickstarter for a spiritual successor back in 2013</a>, but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Speaking to Xbox Wire, Annunziata discussed the role of the gaming community in raising awareness about global issues.</p>
<p>"I feel gamers possess a higher than average IQ than the average human," he said. "Not only because they are frequently fully engaged and challenged mentally with real-time systems and information technology, but they are highly socially connected as well. Like the ocean, a gaming community is an ecosystem – games like Ecco can and should be a conduit to join these realms.</p>
<p>"I have high expectations of gamers for all the above-stated reasons. But there is something else gamers possess that can make the difference, and that is love. A universal love of games and gaming gives us all something we all share, when games like Ecco reach the hearts of gaming communities, that love can really make things happen in the real world."</p>
<p>Back in January of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/freshly-filed-sega-trademarks-hint-at-the-return-of-another-classic-series-25-years-after-its-last-entry">Sega filed a new trademark for Ecco the Dolphin</a>, hinting a new project was on the way.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I have an unhealthy habit of throwing money at several solo tabletop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> projects a year, whether or not I actually plan on playing them: tables and lists corresponding to dice rolls are one of my favourite ways to consume microfiction, and I get a real buzz out of TTRPGs as discrete creative writing artefacts, if not necessarily functioning games. Naturally, I'm all over Spindlejack - a print and play solo game set in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> universe that you can download for<a href="https://jump-over-the-age.itch.io/citizen-sleeper-spindlejack"> free here on itch.io</a>.</p>

<p>You play as a space courier delivering packages across the Starward Belt, a role inspired by Citizen Sleeper 2's Kadet. To play, you'll need 10 six-sided dice, a pencil and eraser, and some counters. You'll be using those dice to randomly map out the intersections you travel through as you complete deliveries and upgrade your trusty airbike. Here's a big ol' setting chunklet:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the Far Spindle, in the Starward Belt, Spindlejacks are notorious. Slicing across the station with their custom airbikes, they courier messages, packages, and anything else too sensitive to be fed into the station's crumbling and haunted networks. Sharing the cavernous transit tunnels with hulking cargo haulers, they are also widely assumed to have some kind of deathwish. But, as one of their number, you know it's the rush, the competition, and the community that keeps you riding.</p></blockquote>
<p>You'll also need a printer, of course - horrific devices one and all. Not even speculative science-fiction has dared to imagine a future where one exists that doesn't make me want to break down in angry tears any time I have to use one, nor one that doesn't try to sell me italics DLC or whatever. Still, if you can brave the intricacies of a medieval torture device posing as benign office equipment, this looks like great fun. You can read Brendy's interview with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/can-you-guess-which-australian-tv-sci-fi-of-the-early-2000s-inspired-citizen-sleeper-2">creator Gareth Damian Martin here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
