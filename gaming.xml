<p>Since then, an FAQ page for this title has gone live on the official Dragon Quest website in Japan, and it's confirmed there is no upgrade path currently available or planned for the Switch version. Here it is in full:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Additionally, save data from the Switch version of Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cannot be transferred or carried over to the Switch 2. Download codes for in-game bonus items are also tied to the platform you purchase the game on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Switch 2 version and Switch version are treated as seperate games, so save data cannot be transferred or shared between them. (This also applies to transferring data from the Switch 2 version to the Switch version.)"</p>

You might not think of it as one, but Wikipedia is a game. It has untold numbers of characters and stories, each page an interactive slate with your mouse and hand acting as the choice maker for what you learn next, thus impacting your following choices. This is, admittedly, a bit of a wanky, thinkpiecey way of talking about Wikipedia, so instead of that let's talk about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neurocracy">Neurocracy</a>, a game that could quite easily fool you into thinking it is another version of Wikipedia.
</p>
<p>
It first launched a couple of years ago now, in 2023, and started its third season earlier this year. In fact, its final episode for season three is coming next week on September 17th, so now seems like a pretty good time to get started with diving into it.
</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPwWYRQUQso" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
There is is no main character in Neurocracy so to speak, other than you, and you are browsing <a href="https://omnipedia.app/wiki/2049/10/09/Main_Page">Omnipedia</a>, a very real but still fictitious website you can head to right now to view everything, though the full version of the game has a virtual conspiracy pin board you can use to unravel the mystery with - we'll come back to that.
</p><p>
Omnipedia, according to its in-world description, is an "English-language online encyclopedia founded by internet entrepreneur Tony Hsiung in June 2049. Intended as “a general reference work and trusted source of information,” Hsiung initially conceived of Omnipedia as a successor to Wikipedia, which was discontinued in 2048." 
</p>
<p>
We've already learned a few things here - that we're a good couple of decades into the future, and Wikipedia is dead. Gathering bits of information like that is the name of the game, though you're after juicier pieces than that, as there's a murder mystery to be solved. As you find actually useful pieces of information, within the full version of the game you can add particular links and bits of text to build this conspiracy for yourself.
</p>
<p>
I've only dipped my toe into Neurocracy's world, it's impressively expansive, though it does feel like the kind of thing you should add to slowly, with only the occasional day of falling through the rabbit hole here and there.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned, Neurocracy's third and final season wraps up next week, September 17th, but you can pick it up on <a href="https://pyrofoux.itch.io/neurocracy">Itch.io</a> now to start getting yourself ready for it.

            <p>
Getting your game a publishing deal has never been an easy thing to do. Right now, it's especially hard given that for many publishers, if it doesn't seem like a guaranteed hit, it likely isn't something they'll take on. This is something that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/poncle">Poncle</a>, or rather the actual person, Luca Galante, takes great issue with, and in a recent interview he spoke more broadly of his issues with publishers, and his thoughts on now being one.
</p>
<p>
"I see a lot of publishers I don't like, and I think that's my way to define what a good publisher should be, probably," Galante explained to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/i-see-a-lot-of-publishers-i-dont-like-vampire-survivors-creator-made-his-own-publisher-to-share-the-luck-and-says-too-many-companies-try-to-exploit-the-platforms-just-to-make-money/">GamesRadar</a>. "I see a lot of publishers that try to exploit the platforms just to make money, basically, because the video game industry is very obviously an industry that makes a lot of money. There is a lot of money to make. I see that these publishers will try and just exploit platforms for money."
</p>
<p>
He went on to note how there are publishers who will put out simply incomplete games, or early access games that never get finished, and that for him, "what a publisher should do is, first of all, make genuine games, genuine products, something that has some real value, and then understand that not everything can be a breakout hit." Galante also spoke of the importance of post-launch support, and for him this is "definitely a big thing from my point of view that publishers should be able to offer."
</p>
<p>
As of now, Poncle has published two games, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a> or Die, a beat 'em up where you have to mash your keyboard to beat enemies, and Kill the Brickman, a Brick Breaker-esque, turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> game, both of which are cheap as chips (£3 and £4 respectively).
</p><p>
It's these kinds of affordable games with smaller teams that Galante wants to lean towards in publishing, and in particular his priority is to find devs "that are very transparent in what they do, they want to talk with their community, and they have a real, genuine passion for making games." Not only that, it's important to him that these devs get to realise their vision by enriching it, as opposed to forcing in things like microtransactions or season passes.
</p>
<p>
Galante is, perhaps most importantly, fully aware with how lucky he got with Vampire Survivors, and that's why he wants to publish other games. "We definitely made some mistakes when it comes to putting the game out there, but we learned a lot, and wanted to try to sort of share what we learned with other indies. It was a way to try and give something back to the indie community, share the luck." Good luck indeed! At this point in time, every dev needs every ounce of the stuff they can get.

              <p>For a long time, the word “Nintendo” was synonymous with video games, and Nintendo has always been shorthand for Mario. The Japanese console mainstay has published dozens of platformers starring the overall-loving plumber since his original debut in 1981’s <em>Donkey Kong</em>, and we’re here to tell you which ones are the worst and best.</p> <p><em> This ranking was originally published on March 31, 2023. We are re-publishing it today in honor of the 40th anniversary of the </em>Super Mario Bros.<i> series.&nbsp;</i></p> <p>After connecting with his brother Luigi in 1983’s single-screen arcade hit <em>Mario Bros.</em>, Mario made the jump to consoles—and scrolling—in 1985’s NES adventure <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> Nearly 40 years and 25 games later, the <em>Super Mario</em> games comprise one of the longest running and most predictably spectacular series ever. From 2D to 3D, on good hardware and bad, Mario running, jumping, and collecting coins has been a constant not just for Nintendo, but in the fabric of the medium itself, driving it forward, inspiring it, reacting to what’s worked, and pushing back against what hasn’t.</p>

 <p>Trying to rank the<em> Super Mario</em> games is like trying to rank flavors of ice cream. Some are clear favorites. Others are acquired tastes. Most are still better than whatever the alternative is. In putting together this list, which includes input from across <em>Kotaku</em>’s staff, as well as direct contributions from many of us, we tried to consider the games holistically: their historical context, their revolutionary or creative innovations, how well they hold up now, and the impressions they’ve left with us.</p> <p>The ranking we arrived at is not beyond reproach and is far from scientific, but it is correct. Here we go!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Randy Pitchford has responded to complaints about the console version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> lacking a field of view (FOV) slider, suggesting fairness may have something to do with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S players of Borderlands 4 were shocked to discover not only a lack of a FOV slider in-game, but no motion blur toggle, either. The PC version of Borderlands 4 has settings for both — in the case of FOV you can increase the value in degrees up to 110 for both first-person play and vehicle use, and for motion blur you can change the amount and the quality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lack of a FOV slider is the biggest issue right now with Borderlands 4 on console, if anecdotal evidence across the internet is anything to go by, with some complaining that not being able to tweak the FOV value is causing them motion sickness.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Man, I've tried to play it twice today,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1nffex7/comment/ndwq95u/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor xInsaneAbilityx</a>. “Both times I get that ‘car-sick’ feel after about 15 minutes and have to stop.” “Yeah I’m pretty sensitive to motion sickness and a narrow FOV in first-person makes me really dizzy. Combining that with motion blur just churns my stomach,” added <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1nffex7/comment/ndx69um/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dallywack3r</a>. “This game feels almost zoomed in, it‘s really not pleasant to play,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1nffex7/comment/ndy99ih/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said christophlieber</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also suggestions the console version of Borderlands 4 lacks a FOV slider in order to maintain certain performance levels. By increasing the FOV, you’re putting the hardware under more strain and potentially impacting things like framerate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But social media posts from Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford suggest one of the considerations is fairness.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Quickie for console friends: FOV settings,” Pitchford began. “There's some dreams I have where an FOV setting might affect fairness. I can't really talk about it yet, but I see this is important to you so we're looking at it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford included a vote in his social media post, which, after nearly 25,000 votes, reveals just how important a FOV slider is to his followers. At the time of this article’s publication, the option “FOV slider or GTFO!” had 72% of the vote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The outspoken Gearbox boss went on to say players “have no idea what the team and I were planning and how FOV slider might affect fairness with such a thing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: “That said, I've always want to commit to and prioritize what Borderlands should be versus try to turn it into something it should. My hope is for my/our ambitions to be additive, not subtractive.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Quickie for console friends: FOV settings: There's some dreams I have where an FOV setting might affect fairness. I can't really talk about it yet, but I see this is important to you so we're looking at it. Vote here:</p>— Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966626024235434322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">So, what is Pitchford actually saying here? The “fairness” quote has caused some confusion. Could it relate to an upcoming PvP mode? If so, why would the PC version have it? Right now, Borderlands 4 is a PvE co-op game, so the line about “fairness” has raised more than a few eyebrows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are wondering if Pitchford is talking about fairness in terms of the performance of the game giving some players an advantage. The higher the FOV, the more the player can see, versus the lower the FOV the more stable the frames are. Perhaps both give some level of advantage?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What does ‘fairness’ even mean?’ asked redditor buddachickentml. “Basically being impartial to all players without favoritism. Fairness to all,” suggested Wolf-O7. “Funny enough it's completely backwards though. Because console players aren't being treated fairly compared to their counterpart on PC. (Especially since this sort of sounds like a PVP mode the way he makes it seem).” Then, from Airaen: “Yeah, how is it fair that PC players can change the FoV and console players can't?” “Fairness in a PvE game? Will you ban ultrawide monitors?” said on social media user.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 supports crossplay between all platforms at launch, so Pitchford’s comments are doubly confusing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for motion blur, in another social media post Pitchford told console players "we aren't down with motion blur and do not support it." He continued: “If you're seeing what seems to be motion blur, maybe check your television settings for whatever automatic BS it might be doing to your image? It's not us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But again, that comment is confusing given there are motion blur settings in Borderlands 4 on PC.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/13/randy-1757782577055.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Randy Pitchford has addressed Borderlands 4 console complaints.

It’s approaching a peak concurrent player count of 300,000 on Valve’s platform, where it is one of the most-played games. No other Borderlands game has come close to that in terms of concurrent player numbers on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-am-that-confident-randy-pitchford-says-its-impossible-for-borderlands-4-players-to-break-the-games-servers-this-weekend-challenges-them-to-try">Pitchford declared it impossible to break the <u>Borderlands 4</u> servers this weekend through sheer weight of player numbers alone</a> — and he’s so confident he’s publicly promised that Borderlands 4 won’t join the long list of big AAA games whose online systems fail at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Borderlands 4 is off to a big start in terms of player numbers, it’s not entirely plain sailing for Gearbox. The release was marred by complaints about PC performance that have resulted in a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Valve’s platform. The complaints revolve around poor performance even on high powered PCs, with some affected by crashing that makes the game difficult to even start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Gearbox posted a Borderlands 4 Nvidia Optimization guide on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/679602429802577921" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a>, advising players how to optimize their graphics settings for “better performance and framerates” on PC with the Nvidia app.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox then issued a piece of advice to PC gamers that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-asks-pc-gamers-to-keep-playing-for-at-least-15-minutes-after-they-tweak-settings-to-see-how-performance-has-changed-as-negative-steam-reviews-pile-up"><u>to me reads like an effort to prevent players from making knee-jerk reactions to the game's performance as soon as they’ve changed their settings</u></a>: “Please note that any time you change any of your graphics settings, your shaders will need to recompile.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario’s 40 year history is a testament to all the different ways you can make a little guy run from left to right across a screen. Nintendo’s line of 2D Mario platformers has gone through three distinct eras since 1985 – the original game revived the video game industry and, for a while, the series was a pioneer in side-scrolling platforming. After laying dormant for a few years, the series returned in the 2000s with the New Super Mario Bros. series, games that were steady and safe but soon turned stale. Thankfully the triumphant age of the Switch brought with it Mario Wonder, where Nintendo reinvented what these games could be. Once again, side-scrolling Mario feels genuinely magical.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">2D Mario games, when executed well, perfectly balance the limitations of Mario's moveset with building your confidence to make increasingly ambitious jumps. They also introduce power-ups that are difficult to master while still being fun to play around with. The very best ones are those that can completely change your approach to platforming without trivialising the challenge. But the most important aspect of a Mario platformer is the process of dying and trying again – the strongest games perfect this loop, ensuring you develop lifelong muscle memory and, by that final flag, feel like a true platforming god. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the original Super Mario Bros. game turning 40 this year, it’s time to look back on which games nail those core tenants and which struggle to make it past the first goomba. Here’s every 2D Super Mario Bros. game, ranked. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">13. Super Mario Bros. : The Lost Levels</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/super-mario-bros-the-lost-levels-1756905327916.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Platformers are at their best when they strike a perfect balance between challenge and fun. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-bros-the-lost-levels">The Lost Levels</a>, Nintendo frustratingly forgot about that second part. The sequel to Super Mario Bros. is straight up mean – so mean, in fact, that it was not released in the West until Super Mario All Stars on the SNES seven years later. Its poison mushrooms and spitefully placed enemies only serve to build frustration, never giving you the satisfying relief of finally beating a level, and making you want to lock your controller in a safe and throw it to the bottom of the ocean. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Video games from the NES era are known for their difficulty, as increasing the challenge somewhat artificially extracted hours and hours of play from games that were inherently limited in scope because of the technology of the time. And there <em>is </em>merit to the idea of a Mario sequel that picks up the difficulty of the first game’s final levels and only ramps up from there, especially compared to today’s relatively easy Mario projects. If you squint hard enough, this is a fun novelty in the Mario library… but one that nobody ever wants to play, unless you <em>really </em>want to be ragebaited by Miyamoto. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">12. New Super Mario Bros. 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/new-super-mario-bros-2-1756904367771.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If the main gimmick in each Mario game is supposed to aid or increase the difficulty of the platforming, then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/new-super-mario-bros-2">New Super Mario Bros. 2</a> is one of the series’ biggest failures. The oddly named third entry in the New Super Mario Bros. franchise marks the moment when the series became dull. Lacking ideas and unwilling to take any big risks, Nintendo landed upon <em>coins </em>as the big gimmick for this one. The coins themselves are no different from the coins we’ve had in Mario since 1985, there’s just a lot of them this time. And that’s it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Putting so many coins into a level trivialises their single use. If you collect 100 coins, you get a life, and losing all your lives means you get kicked back to the start of a level and your checkpoints disappear. By making 100 coins so easy to collect, New Super Mario Bros. 2 removes that vital bit of jeopardy and adds little else to make up for it, with the only new power-up being the coin-farming Golden Flower. Then there’s the overall goal to collect a million coins, which is just tedious. Mario controls beautifully, as is standard for these games, but the feel of the platforming is no different to any other game in the series. So why chase that frustrating goal when you could get what New Super Mario Bros. 2 is good at in any of the game’s better siblings?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">11. Super Mario Land</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/super-mario-land-1756904436757.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If this was a list of the ugliest Mario games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-land">Super Mario Land</a> would be first with a bullet. The characters, the items, the backgrounds... they’re all so <em>unpleasant</em>. Even modern emulation technology that can elevate the scruffy visuals of the GameBoy can’t quite rescue Mario Land from its ugliness. And this isn’t just a retro tech thing – just compare Mario Land to its sequel on the same console, a game where mushrooms look like mushrooms, Koopas look like Koopas, and Mario doesn’t look like a weird little alien. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite those visual blemishes, the gameplay is still pretty solid and fairly recognisable as what a Mario game should feel like. You don’t get the same sense of speed you can achieve when you master the levels of stronger Mario games, but there’s still a good sense of flow when you hit the highest gear the GameBoy is capable of. Mario Land is a serviceable platformer if you’re really in a pinch, but everything it does is done better elsewhere. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. New Super Luigi U</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/new-super-luigi-u-1756904496507.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Year of Luigi ended up being a financial disaster for Nintendo, but at least we got a fun little Luigi game out of it. This is a stripped down version of New Super Mario Bros. U starring Luigi, complete with his trademark slippier running style and higher jumping abilities. It’s super cool to experience the game through a character with a slightly different moveset, and redesigned levels that provide a bigger challenge. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact that the game is more streamlined also has appeal, balancing out the higher difficulty and giving you the satisfaction of making quick progress through the levels. There’s not much else to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/new-super-luigi-u">Luigi U</a>, though. There’s little spectacular about it, nor is there anything it does gravely wrong. It’s a fun addition to an era of Mario platformers that were growing stale and a bit dull, and this doesn’t do quite enough to differentiate itself from that unfortunate trend. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Super Mario Bros. 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/super-mario-bros-2-1756904582538.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you come to it with no knowledge of its background, Mario 2 feels like an odd sequel to the original game. Deeming the <em>actual </em>Mario 2 too difficult for Western audiences, Nintendo basically reskinned the game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yume-kojo-doki-doki-panic">Doki Doki Panic</a> with Mushroom Kingdom paraphernalia, and the North American and European version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-bros-2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a> was born. While Mario 1 focuses on sidescrolling platforming, Mario 2 introduces more verticality – a great idea that doesn’t always hold up in execution. Having to find a way to climb and fall through levels means you don’t develop that smooth, flowing muscle memory which makes the best Mario games so great. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another mechanic introduced in this odd sequel is being able to pull plants out of the ground and throw them at enemies. Some enemies can even be picked up and thrown themselves, rather than the classic Mario move of squishing them. This works really well to make the world feel less like a flat background you’re running through and more like a living ecosystem, but again it just doesn’t feel very Mario. There are great ideas here, but they work against the core of what the first game established. It is, however, a preferable experience to the original, super-difficult version of Mario 2, which finally arrived in the West as the aforementioned Lost Levels.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. New Super Mario Bros. Wii</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/new-super-mario-bros-wii-1756904667025.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can look at the second entry in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/new-super-mario-bros-wii">New Super Mario Bros.</a> series in two ways. On one hand, it was a solid evolution of what the first game did, introducing multiplayer and a couple of neat power-ups. On the other hand, later games in the series would do that exact thing better, leaving this one without a unique flavour among the 2D Mario catalogue. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To its credit, there was no better console to introduce four-person multiplayer to the franchise than the Wii, a system that captured the imagination of the whole family. NSMB Wii also introduced the Propeller Mushroom power-up that added some more strategy to the platforming, as well as the Penguin Suit whose sliding ability made the timing of jumps even more important. There’s more here to appreciate today than with New Super Mario Bros. 2, but the latest release in the series (more on that later) overwrites a lot of what the previous entries contributed with better ideas. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/super-mario-land-2-6-golden-coins-1756904729707.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to its predecessor, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-land-2-6-golden-coins">Super Mario Land 2</a> feels like a miracle. Graphically, it’s way beyond anything you’d expect the original GameBoy to muster, with character sprites that appear enjoyably cartoonish and expressive despite very minimal animations. The structure of the game also gives it a sense of scope that handheld titles typically lacked at the time. Instead of travelling from one world to the next, all levels are located on the overworld, which feels like a single town. Whether you’re at the Tree Zone, the Space Zone or the Pumpkin Zone, their individual themes are expressed so well by the limited graphics available to them. On top of that, the fact that you can tackle these zones in any order just makes the world feel a bit more of a genuine place that you can explore. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of the actual platforming, it's a definite improvement on its predecessor in terms of flow and speed, with far more interesting level design to boot, but it just doesn’t feel quite as good as the main console games of the time, or future handheld titles. The new Carrot power up is fun, but is really just an alternate Tanuki suit from Mario 3. Still, the spirit of what makes Mario great is definitely present here, and it more than justifies itself as a unique entry in the series. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Super Mario Bros.</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/super-mario-bros-1756904821105.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The original game in Nintendo’s most important series still holds up after 40 years for one simple reason: because every <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-bros">Super Mario Bros</a>. game since has been built off its back. The series hasn’t deviated from this basic structure because it still feels incredible to play. Mario is so dynamic as a character right from the off, even with the limited skillset of running, jumping and throwing the odd fireball. His ability to build momentum opens up the game beyond just being about getting from one end of a level to the other. A lot of joy can be found in discovering all the secret passages through the Mushroom Kingdom that can both lead you to the Princess in seconds, or make you prove your skills by dropping you head first into the toughest levels without a steady build up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over time, Mario’s movement has gotten significantly smoother and his arsenal of platforming tools has expanded, making it hard to place the original higher on this list. Also, being one of the first NES games ever made means it's not the prettiest thing you’ll ever lay your eyes on. However, Super Mario Bros. stands up as more than just a museum exhibit. It's a fun game that will always be worth booting up.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. New Super Mario Bros.</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/new-super-mario-bros-1756904889005.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/new-super-mario-bros">New Super Mario Bros.</a> had the task of reintroducing the world to 2D Mario after over a decade of focus on the 3D games. And despite kicking off an era of the franchise that's not always looked fondly upon, it does a great job of maintaining the core of what Mario was while making modernising additions. Mario can now triple jump, a move ripped from the 3D games that works so well even with one less dimension. It's the kind of evolution that brings out the best of what made Mario great to begin with, giving you a new tool to make more ambitious jumps and allowing the developers to make more well-hidden secrets and more expansive level designs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">New Super Mario Bros. also introduces the Blue Shell power up, which is sneakily one of the series’ best. It serves as both a tool for destroying blocks and enemies and is the only way to access secret passages which test your ability to control a very erratic power up. The other new additions, like the Mega Mushroom and the Mini Mushroom, aren’t so effective, even if the former made for some iconic box art. They both feel like gimmicks rather than offering a new skill to master. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. New Super Mario Bros. U</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/new-super-mario-bros-u-1756904952137.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/new-super-mario-bros-u">New Super Mario Bros. U</a> is sort of the inverse of New Super Mario Bros. Wii – a game that was harder to appreciate at the time of its release than it is now. The final game in the New Super Mario Bros. franchise carried the baggage of the three previous entries looking and playing almost identically, something that made Nintendo fans exhausted by anything with the word “New” attached to it. New Super Mario Bros. U doesn’t reinvent the formula, but exemplifies the best version of it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taken in isolation, it’s much easier to appreciate the game’s polish and its moments of genius level design. Its most famous level, Painted Swampland, inspired by Vincent Van Gogh's Starry Night, is the exact kind of form-breaking inventiveness fans were crying out for (and eventually got more of through Mario Wonder.) With some really lovely visuals, smooth gameplay, and a couple of fun power ups, this is the definitive New Super Mario Bros. title. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Super Mario Bros. 3</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/super-mario-bros-3-1756905015112.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-bros-3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a> is a miracle of a game. It has no right looking as good as it does, especially when compared to the first Mario on the NES. Mario 3 is a textbook example of squeezing a console for every ounce of power it has, and is one of the great achievements of sprite art in gaming history. It also helps that it's heaps of fun to play, despite being really hard. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are so many moments in Mario 3 where you’ll run into an enemy placed specifically to make you mad, but instead of throwing your controller at the wall, you’re only motivated to go again – to run through the level faster, to make that jump even cleaner, to get more air time in the Tanuki suit and sail right over that Boomerang Bro who killed you 20 times before. It's the true successor to Mario 1 on the NES, finding that perfect balance between frustration and satisfaction.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Super Mario Bros. Wonder</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/super-mario-bros-wonder-1756905105096.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-bros-wonder">Mario Wonder</a> is so darn joyful. The animation of Mario forgetting his hat as he jumps through a warp pipe is just one example of how much this game pops with personality. The exclamation of “wowie zowie!” when you transform into an elephant, the singing chorus of Piranha Plants... everything is so silly and so cartoonish, perfectly representing the inherent absurdity of Mario’s existence as a plumber beefing with a giant turtle. It’s impossible to play this without a smile on your face.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s not just personality that Wonder boasts. There is a treasure trove of mechanics that are constantly thrown at you. Through the Wonder Flowers, the level design takes on a dynamism no existing Mario game can match, feeding you increasingly insane 2D platforming challenges built around a unique theme every time. The Badge system means Wonder has the biggest library of power-ups in a Mario game ever, allowing you to platform in a way that suits you, or equip something that purposefully hinders your abilities for that extra bit of challenge. Mario Wonder is a sugar rush of a platformer, and one of Nintendo’s crowning 2D achievements.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Super Mario World</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/super-mario-world-1756905238528.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-world">Super Mario World</a> is the best 2D Mario has ever felt to play. It inherits some of Mario 3’s difficulty, but instead of making it near impossible to beat a level on the first go, it eases up slightly, giving you enough room to fly through a level at top speed while still having the chance to dodge that final enemy. That’s why Mario World is the most satisfying game in the series – you’ll die again and again and again, until you hit that one level you nail on the first go and think to yourself “Wow, I’m really good at Mario.” The Cape power up is so difficult to master but stands as the best power up the series has ever had because the reward for getting it right is such a high. It’s something the modern games have yet to capture, thanks to the difficulty of these games having decreased over time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another thing World captures beautifully is the vibrancy and personality of Dinosaur Land, squeezing the SNES’ sprite-rendering abilities for everything it's got to produce astoundingly expressive characters. There’s still a strong case for World being the best looking Mario, as the game feels like running through a Saturday morning cartoon. Super Mario World is the peak of the Mario formula – challenge, fun, platforming flow, and personality all in perfect harmony. </p><div id="2d-mario-games-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">2D Mario Games, Ranked</h3><h3>2D Mario Games, Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What do you think of our ranking of 2D Mario platformers?

            <p>
In general these days it's never a good time to release a video game unless you're Rockstar, but in recent months it's been made even harder due to numerous payment processors cracking down on digital storefronts like Valve and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">Itch.io</a>. There's a host of reasons this is problematic, but one less spoken about how this is also an issue of preservation. GOG, another digital storefront, this one owned by The Witcher developer CD Projekt, is known for their preservation efforts, and in a recent interview they shared a bit of their thoughts in relation to these recent issues regarding payment processors.
</p>
<p>
When asked about GOG's stance on what's been happening with payment processors in recent months in an interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/earning-the-trust-of-major-japanese-developers-like-capcom-is-not-an-easy-task-but-gog-is-getting-there-one-classic-at-a-time-we-ask-gog-about-preservation-and-censorship/">Automaton</a>, senior PR rep Piotr Gnyp had this to say: "At GOG, as a platform devoted to Good Old Games and video game preservation, we see it as a game preservation issue. Every year, many games are disappearing, for various reasons. Every game that disappears from distribution is potentially lost to game preservation efforts. It is particularly worrying when games are potentially vanishing due to external pressure."
</p>
<p>
While possibly not quite as strong or confident an answer as I might like - after all, GOG has plenty of reasons to be wary of pissing off these same payment processors - there is something worth honing in on. 
</p>
<p>
Steam and Itch.io are obviously not some kind of beautiful digital landscapes where games become hits after hits, both are much too saturated for that to happen. Plus, a majority of games on Steam are not DRM-free, meaning they require a connection to the storefront in question in order to be played. Most games on Itch and GOG are DRM-free, however.
</p><p>
The issue comes from the fact that, unfortunately, developers are forced into relying on third-party platforms to sell their games. It is incredibly hard to tell someone to come to your dedicated website to buy your game, and that only works insofar that you've found a payment processor to use that allows something like an adult game.
</p>
<p>
So what happens to these games when they have no place to call a home? How do we ensure that they continue to be available, when they might be hosted on the developer's personal website, which in some cases few people might be aware of? It's a difficult question to answer.
</p>
<p>
In this same interview, Gnyp notes that GOG is a "curated storefront," continuing on to explain that this means "not every game submitted to us is accepted - we select titles based on quality, relevance, and alignment with our values and audience." Again, that line about values feels like it could be a bit of a cop out, but the idea of curation is one worth exploring. It's not a perfect solution, though it could be one way to at least keep some aspect of these unfairly shunned works alive. The question becomes how to do this, and right now, I'm still figuring it out, for myself at least.

            <p>
I don't play online games particularly often, mostly the only ones that I do enjoy are the kind of games I can play with just my friends. People are mean, you see, and I have a sensitive soul, and also I often find them deeply boring conceptually and in practice. Take of that what you will in relation to this story about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>! Moving on swiftly to a topic that I promise connects to this intro, Gabe Newell! He is a co-founder of Valve, and a noted Dota 2 lover. He also, apparently, is someone who is often subjected to ridicule while playing the very same game his company makes.
</p>
<p>
The man himself made a pre-recorded experience at this year's Dota 2 International, opening exactly how you'd expect him to: "Hi, I'm Gabe Newell." After clearing that up, he waxes not quite poetically about how he fell in love with the MOBA quite deeply thanks to the first International. But, he says says, "It's not just the game I love, but the community.
</p>

<figure>

<p>
"Sure, people talk s**t at me in chat, and about once a week people say, hey noob, uninstall the game and [censor blip]. But that's really about their enthusiasm, and the energy that they bring, and that's why, after all these years, I still play Dota every day."
</p><p>
Now, I do feel I have to say that this is a pretty subtly horrendous way to endorse quite toxic behaviours that many people are often subjected to in online games. I don't care if you're enthusiastic! We're all here to have fun, right? Try a friendly word of advice before you make your way to the arcade's basketball machine for some easy dunks.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, I find it quite an amusing, if brief, anecdote about the ways in which we don't know who we're playing with online. I fully believe that Newell regularly gets lambasted by strangers online, and it tickles me to imagine how they might change their behaviour if they had the relevant context.
</p>
<p>
Not to say that it's good many of them would likely be kinder with said context, I just think there's a lesson to be had here in how we encourage certain kinds of communication in game spaces. One that Valve, even now, still should probably learn how to do better.

<p>But the Switch experience is reportedly "worse"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Everybody's Golf: Hot Shots" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0927536caea58/everybodys-golf-hot-shots.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/everybodys_golf_hot_shots">Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</a> can be a fun experience on Switch, but there are admittedly certain areas of its game that could be improved (like performance). Fortunately, developer Hyde and Bandai Namco seem to already be addressing some problems.</p>
<p>As highlighted by the <a href="https://youtu.be/z93sHPDsli0">YouTube channel Good Vibes Gaming</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JonComms">former Nintendo Life video presenter Jon Cartwright</a>, this title has received a new patch since its release last week, bumping it up to Version 1.1.1. It apparently uncaps the frame rate on both the Switch and Switch 2 (it was previously fixed at 30fps across both systems).</p>
<p>According to the results so far, it's said to have enhanced the performance of the game on Switch 2, enabling the title to now hit 60fps "most of the time" but some weather effects might impact this.</p>
<p>The downside of this? The game experience on the original Switch hardware is now supposedly "worse". As the frame rate is unlocked (and there are no frame rate toggle options), it's now running at "around 35fps" on this platform, but this results in "a very inconsistent timing frame" when taking a swing, compared to when the game was capped at 30fps.</p>

<p>This patch for Everybody's Golf also happens to follow a recent 60fps performance update for the Clap Hanz title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/easy_come_easy_golf">Easy Come Easy Golf</a>. If the official patch notes for this latest Hot Shots update are shared online, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Borderlands 4 launched two days ago, it immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set a new franchise record for concurrent players on Steam</a>. That record has since been broken as recently as thirteen hours ago, when SteamDB <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1285190/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">registered</a> 252K concurrent players playing the latest entry in the looter shooter series. That number is likely to go up even further between today and tomorrow, as it often does in a popular game's initial weekend, even if most user reviews on Steam are currently Mixed due to performance issues. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the newly created Borderlands 4 page on Nexus Mods already hosts 20 mods for the game. Some of them are the usual Unreal Engine tweaks that, more often than not, turn out to be snake oil, promising decreased hitching or stuttering without actually delivering. A couple aim to remove the start screen and introductory videos, but there are better ways than using mods for this purpose. Just go to the OakGame\Content\Splash and OakGame\Content\Movies folders (within the main Borderlands 4 folder) and delete or rename the Splash.bmp, 2KLOGO.bk2, and GBXLOGO.bk2 files. </p>



<p>Since those files will be restored with any new update, though, it is even better to add the following command line argument to the game's launch options within your PC launcher, be it Steam or Epic Games:</p>



<p>-nostartupmovies -nosplash</p>



<p>But there are quite a few useful mods well worth downloading from the Nexus. For example, Akelaphobia <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/11?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made</a> a ReShade add-on that allows players to toggle various effects on and off based on predefined keybindings:</p>



<ul>
<li>Toggle HUD (Caps Lock) </li>



<li>Toggle Damage Numbers (F1) </li>



<li>Toggle Speed Lines (F2) </li>



<li>Toggle Almost All Outlines (F3) </li>



<li>Toggle Loot Outlines (F4) </li>



<li>Toggle Loot Beams (F5) </li>



<li>Toggle Loot Glow (F6) </li>



<li>Toggle Hurt/Bloody Vignette (F7) </li>



<li>Toggle Healing Vignette (F8) </li>



<li>Toggle Healing Orbs (F9) </li>



<li>Toggle Tracers (F10) </li>



<li>Toggle Bloom (OEM [) (Left Bracket) </li>



<li>Toggle Fog (OEM ]) (Right Bracket)</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>The mod is extremely easy to install. Users just need to extract the contents to the game root's folder, then boot up the game and use the keybindings to toggle off the effects as desired. To change keybinds, press the Home key to bring up the ReShade UI, go to the Add-ons tab, select Edit under ShaderToggler to pick a new hotkey, and save all Toggle Groups.</p>



<p>User Caites also created several Borderlands 4 mods that aim to tweak the game's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulty</a> (experience, damage dealt and received, loot, and cash can be tweaked separately), increase <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapon stats</a> (improving fire rate and decreasing recoil), <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mission rewards</a> (2x or 4x), <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve repkits</a> (a new gear type that heals and buffs characters), and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands4/mods/16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removes the fog of war from the in-game map</a>.</p>



<p>Many more Borderlands 4 mods will undoubtedly be released in the coming days and weeks, and we'll report on anything significant, such as the much-needed removal of the dreadful 30 frames per second cap on in-game cutscenes.</p>

            <p>
Whenever there is word of a video game's release date being changed, it's hardly ever surprising because nine times out of ten, it's because it has been delayed. That's just the way things are these days, no one can have the luxury of Team Cherry, who took so long making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> just because they were having fun. However, in this case, the release date shifting news is actually a positive one, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> will be launching just that little bit earlier.
</p>
<p>
By little bit, I truly do mean only a tiny amount. The game was originally slated for release on September 19th, and now it's coming out… September 18th! I do genuinely wonder how such a miniscule change will make any difference to Techland's bottom line, but I'm no accountant, or, I don't know, money line go up predictor, whatever that particular job might be called.
</p>
<p>
In a press release, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light">Dying Light</a> franchise director Tymon Smektała said that because they know the game is ready, they wanted to "do something special for our players," so they pushed themselves to "make the impossible possible," which translates to one day less that everyone has to wait for it. Feels like a slightly hyperbolic way to present such a tiny release date bump, but I suppose it is always nice to see this as opposed to yet another delay.
</p>
<p>
Also, as another form of thanks to those who have or will pre-order the game, some kind of "exclusive new reward" will be in store for them. Can't tell you what that is, not because it's a secret, but because proper details will be coming during launch week, i.e. next week.
</p>

Our own Edwin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-the-beast-wants-to-make-you-afraid-of-the-dark-again">got to have a little jaunt</a> through the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a> earlier this year which he described as "on the whole, quite jolly."
