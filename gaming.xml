<p>Yes, the latest addition to the 'Switch 2 Edition' line-up has performed predictably well in its debut week, bumping up to second place, with a 59% split of console sales coming from the new hardware — the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/everything-included-in-the-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-and-free-3-0-update">ver. 3.0 update</a> likely helped the S1 sales too.

            <guid>1409764</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's apparently leak day in the games industry: after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-launch-date-is-march-5-xbox-store-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon launch date leak</a>, there's also the first in-game look at <strong>ZeniMax</strong>'s canceled <strong>Project Blackbird</strong>. Insider eXtas1s <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/2012971422679765352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared it on X</a>, and Tom Henderson later <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blackbrird-footage-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> it was real, adding that it was used internally to show off the <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong>-powered lighting. It is unclear whether the game was still running on Unreal Engine 4 when it was canceled, had already updated to Unreal Engine 5, or was planned to.</p>



<p>To be honest, that footage isn't very impressive. I'm not crazy on the character designs, for example. That said, it could be old, and of course, it doesn't tell us anything about how the game actually played. I've played a ton of <strong>The Elder Scrolls Online</strong> and was definitely looking forward to ZeniMax Online's new project, so I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt on that count, especially given the reports.</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="es" dir="ltr"><p>👀🔥 LEAK ⚡️</p><p>Nuevo metraje de "Project Blackbird", el MMO de Zenimax Online cancelado hace meses por Xbox.</p><p>Qué ganas le tenía 🥺. <a href="https://t.co/4Nz1G22l2F">pic.twitter.com/4Nz1G22l2F</a></p></div>— eXtas1s 🎮 Noticias &amp; Rumores (@eXtas1stv) <a href="https://twitter.com/eXtas1stv/status/2012971422679765352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In November 2022, the game, based on a new intellectual property, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-game-has-been-in-development-for-4-5-years-now-with-200-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already been in development for <strong>over four and a half years</strong></a> and boasted a manpower of <strong>more than 200 employees</strong>. We didn't really hear anything further about Project Blackbird until <strong>Microsoft</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suddenly announced its cancellation in July 2025</a>, as part of a major round of layoffs that also affected <strong>Rare</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Everwild</strong> was canceled</a>) and <strong>The Initiative</strong> (the whole studio was shut down, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Perfect Dark</strong> was canceled as well</a>).</p>



<p>A couple of days later, Bloomberg's <strong>Jason Schreier</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Microsoft Gaming CEO <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> had loved his hands-on time with the game just a few months ahead of the cancellation. The journalist also viewed some gameplay footage of Project Blackbird and confirmed it looked impressive. This backs up the public-facing statement of ZOS Lead Graphics Programmer Alex Tardif, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-zos-mmorpg-was-heading-in-a-great-direction-and-new-engine-had-found-its-footing-says-lead-graphics-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the new engine had found its footing and the game was heading in a 'great direction'.</p>



<p>Another report by TrueAchievements <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided a few more details on the game itself</a>: it <span>would be a third-person online shooter in which players would become&nbsp;<strong>Revenants</strong>, bio‑enhanced operatives employed by alien syndicates to navigate the underworld of <strong>Soteria</strong>, a tidally-locked planet with</span> extreme biomes. Throughout Project Blackbird, players would rise through criminal/corporate ranks and uncover a murder conspiracy.</p>



<p>Former ZeniMax Online founder and studio head <strong>Matt Firor</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-blackbird-was-the-game-i-had-waited-my-entire-career-to-create-says-ex-zos-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged</a> earlier this month that the cancellation of Project Blackbird led to his resignation, adding that this was the game he had waited his entire career to make. Following the cancellation, at least two different studios have been formed by the fired employees: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-zenimax-online-devs-form-sackbird-studios-working-original-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sackbird Studios</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ironroot-games-established-former-zenimax-online-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ironroot Games</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Nowadays, ZeniMax Online has returned to focus solely on <strong>The Elder Scrolls Online</strong>, recently<a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-zenimax-interview-free-content-battle-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> revealing a major shift to a seasonal model and free content updates</a>.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Factory production lines in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/satisfactory/" data-ref-id="5000-483395">Satisfactory</a> will grow to immense sizes the longer you play, and it can be hard to manage. A good friend, though, will cut that work in half. Satisfactory offers both peer-to-peer multiplayer and server-based multiplayer, and each of them has their disadvantages. We'll talk about how to get each of them going here.</p><p dir="ltr">There are three ways to host games in Satisfactory: Peer-to-peer games, self-hosted servers and rented servers. Peer-to-peer and self-hosted server options are both free, while a rented server option will have a monthly cost associated with it. Meanwhile, peer-to-peer is the easiest to set up, followed by rented servers, and finally self-hosted servers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1603/16030002/4627915-satisfactory-multiplayer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4627915" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1603/16030002/4627915-satisfactory-multiplayer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4627915"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1603/16030002/4627915-satisfactory-multiplayer.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Peer-to-peer</h3><p dir="ltr">A peer-to-peer session has to be initiated by whoever has the save game you're playing in. Sessions can be private, meaning that you'll need an in-game invite to join, or set to Friends Only, meaning that anyone on your friend list can hop in via Satisfactory's Join Game menu. Each game has a Session ID. If you share this with someone, they can join a Friends Only game regardless of whether they're on your friends list. Each time you initiate a session, though, the Session ID will be reset.</p><p dir="ltr">This is, by far, the simplest option, and will be sufficient for most players, but it assumes your schedules will line up enough that the host can always be on when you feel like playing.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Self-Hosted Dedicated Server</h3><p dir="ltr">A self-hosted dedicated server is something you set up on a computer you have access to, and leave it to run indefinitely, allowing multiple users to join it whenever they wish. The software itself is free, and comes with the game. This is the most complex option in terms of setup and maintenance, and you'll want to refer to the <a href="https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Dedicated_servers" rel="nofollow ">Satisfactory wiki on Dedicated Servers</a> for the details--it's more than we can reasonably go into here. Your ability to do this can also depend on hosting rules set by your internet service provider, meaning that depending on who supplies your internet connection, this may not even be an option at all.</p><p dir="ltr">If you have the know-how or the patience, this option will give you the most freedom at the lowest price.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Rented Dedicated Server</h3><p dir="ltr">A rented dedicated server gives you all the freedom of a self-hosted server, but on someone else's hardware. Most people don't just have a computer that sits around left on and unused all the time that they can set a server up on, so this is going to be a better option for most than the self-hosted option. You have a lot of set-up options, so it will take some patience to set up, but if you have a few friends with different schedules who want to play together, this is a great option. Hosting starts at around $10 a month, though reliable and performant hosting will likely be closer to $15. The more people you intend to have playing, the more important that will be. We're not going to call out any specific providers here, but there are many, many options out there through your favorite search engine.</p><p dir="ltr">This option is expensive, but is ideal for a group with multiple players who don't mind pitching in a few dollars to keep things going.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Early indicators that advertisements are coming to the Xbox Cloud Gaming service have been spotted by users, with messages stating that "ad-supported playtime" popping up for users when launching games.</p>
<p>One such user, The Verge's Tom Warren, <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/2012346097465782273">posted their own experience seeing this message firsthand</a>. Ad-supported Xbox Cloud Gaming has not been confirmed by Microsoft as of writing, nor its scope across the service. However, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/arts/halo-playstation-microsoft-xbox.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">last year an Xbox official confirmed </a>that the company would be experimenting with free ad-supported cloud gaming.</p>
<p>This hint at advertisement rollout across Xbox Cloud Gaming comes at an interesting time too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-developer-direct-showcase-january-2026">with an Xbox Showcase set to take place on the 22nd January</a>. While it's been stated that the show will focus primarily on a handful of games including Fable and Forza, rumours have been circulating that such a shift with the company's cloud gaming service <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version">could be rolled out this year</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>It's also coming at an interesting time for cloud gaming in general. With the AI boom ongoing, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">hardware prices have skyrocketed for consumers</a>. This will, or perhaps already has, curbed the ability of gaming enthusiasts to buy their own machines, potentially leading a new wave to Cloud Gaming services such as what Xbox is offering. While not especially great news for the consumer, there's no doubt that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers-can-now-stream-select-games-from-their-own-library-via-cloud-gaming">Microsoft has positioned itself into a leading position as far as cloud gaming is concerned</a>.</p><p>Microsoft too has faced heavy criticism when it comes to its gaming output, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">laying off significant portions of its workforce last year</a> and cancelling several projects as a result. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-suffers-worst-year-on-record-for-console-sales-in-the-uk">2025 was also the worst year on record for Xbox console sales in the UK</a>, though competitors like the PS5 also saw a drop during the same period.</p>

            <p>Happy new week of PC game releases, all! First, the customary paragraph of Maw musings. What we refer to as the Maw goes by many other names in different regions, as different cultures react to its cosmic incursions. Across the channel in Normandy, generations of monks have addressed the creature as La Bête des Trous. The Finnish know the Maw as Tuleva Syöjä. In the United States, meanwhile, they call it Friday Night at Applebee’s. 
</p>
<p>The Maw reacts to every naming with delight, for each name is a fresh morsel of News. By all means add your own invention to its plate, once you’re done reading about some of those forthcoming PC games.</p>
<h2>Monday 19th January</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1972450/Earth_of_Oryn/">Earth Of Oryn</a> is a pretty medieval kingdom builder, out this day in early access, with some real-time military elements and changing seasons.</li>
<li>Also coming to early access, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1031080/Lunars/">Lunars</a> is one of those multiplayer family boardgames where every board node is a minigame. In this case, it’s zodiac-themed, and the minigames seem relatively chaotic and Fall Guys-ish. </li>
<li>In autobattler roguelike <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3907920/CARNEDGE/">Carnedge</a>, you are that one dude who has to carry the eternal flame to the lighthouse and save the world. The visuals remind me of North American dark fantasy animated films like The Secret of NIMH.</li>
<li>Only you and the Sylvester Stallone of hamsters can fight back the apocalypse in kawaii doomsday sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3596670/MOCHIO/">MOCHI-O</a>.</li>
<li>Point-and-click survival horror <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4249940/Bad_Eye_Deer/">Bad Eye Deer</a> is about surviving for three nights in the Arctic. There are deer and their eyes are indeed bad. Wield your laser barrier with discretion and try not to freeze.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 20th January</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mio-memories-in-orbit">Mio: Memories In Orbit</a> is a lucent, painterly metroidvania in which you explore a huge colony spaceship.</li>
<li>Protect the Earthglass Crystal! Deliver it to the Infernal Rift! Destroy the demon overlord Korghul! Shatter the Blightstone! In the turn-based strategy roguelike called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2832280/Blightstone/">Blightstone</a>!</li>
<li>Hark, the vaguely Latinate bellowing of male choirs! It can only be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3064810/Strategos/">Strategos</a> (pictured), the historical RTS in which 120 factions clang their shieldwalls together. There’s no world map functionality as such – I wonder if MicroProse will get mad at me for calling this Partial War.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3597060/Hack_And_Climb/">Hack And Climb</a> is a physics-based platformer in which you play a bunch of self-throwing weapons.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3104600/Observa/">Observa</a>, you are trapped on an island observatory floating in outer space. Point your telescope, print your findings, and monitor the darkness for an approaching... Something.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 21st January</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3838370/TR49/">TR-49</a> is the archive-diving World War investigation sim with the spooky computer from Inkle, creators of Heaven's Vault and A Highland Song.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1804470/Duel_Corp/">Duel Corp</a> is a Souls-inspired action-RPG in which cursed immortals wander an MMO-lite open world. I like the grainy chibi characters and chunky little towns.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 22nd January</h2>
<ul>
<li>Come see the big city through an 18-year-old’s eyes while nurturing their personality in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2088810/Perfect_Tides_Station_to_Station/">Perfect Tides: Station to Station</a>, a thoughtful point-and-click adventure. If you are an actual 18-year-old living in the big city, watch out, playing this might trigger some kind of Being John Malkovich scenario.</li>
<li>Escape a very fancy magical boardgame by fitting inventory tiles into your board to defeat another player in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3802470/Turnbound/">Turnbound</a>. “Like if Inventory Tetris and Hearthstone Battlegrounds had a baby”, apparently.</li>
<li>Maketh swords and experienceth the story of the last human citadel in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305640/Bladesong/">Bladesong</a>.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3155570/Decollate_Decoration/">Decollate Decoration</a> you are a dead girl haunting her resolutely skeptical beloved. Make him believe.</li>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1996390/Escape_from_Ever_After/">Escape from Ever After</a> is a Paper Mario-like RPG about a real-world corporation colonising the realm of fairytales. What, are you just going to sit back and let them turn the dragon’s castle into a godforsaken <em>touchdown space</em>? Quest forth, foe of human resources!</li>
</ul>
<p>As for what we in the Treehouse are doing this week: there is a complicated calamity unfolding that involves office keycards and toxic ramen. Could be Maw-related - I will leave you to speculate. On the brighter side, Jeremy is back from holiday. Hello Jeremy! Please, do something. As for the rest of you, let us know if there’s a new PC game we’ve ignored in our zealous pursuit of yet another dang roguelike or pre-industrial wargame.</p>

                <p>The Forge has one of the deepest crafting experiences you will find in any of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/" data-ref-id="2900-6830">most popular games in Roblox</a>. You are able to not only find ore throughout the world, but you are then able to take it and create gear to use for battles against zombies and more. There are so many different armor recipes you are able to craft in The Forge.</p><p>The general idea for how to craft in The Forge is pretty simple. You mine the ore using your pickaxe and then take it to the titular forge to create gear using a couple of enjoyable minigames. Depending on how many pieces of ore you use and what types they are, you will get various gear. If you want to know how to make all of the armor recipes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-forge-quest-guide-how-to-complete-all-main-quests/1100-6537007/" data-ref-id="1100-6537007">The Forge</a> Roblox, check below.</p><h2 id="The_Forge_All_Light_Armor_Recipes">The Forge All Light Armor Recipes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629286-img_5322.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629286" data-ratio="0.57233626588465" data-width="2046" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629286-img_5322.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629286"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629286-img_5322.jpeg"></figure><p>Light armor is the most basic type of armor you can make in The Forge. It is also the easiest, but you won’t get nearly any of the protection that the other armor types offer. That said, for beginners, light armor is what you want to start with.</p><p>In general, unless you are using a specific type of armor recipe, the ore type doesn’t matter all that much. Instead, it is all about how many pieces of ore you use. Fortunately, you don’t need many at all to make light armor.</p><p>Here are all of the light armor recipes that are available in The Forge and how to make them:</p><ul><li>Light Helmet: 1 in 1 chance of crafting with 3 ores of any kind</li><li>Light Leggings: 1 in 2 chance of crafting with 7 or more pieces of ore</li><li>Light Chestplate: 1 in 3 chance of crafting using roughly 10 pieces of ore</li></ul><h2 id="The_Forge_All_Medium_Armor_Recipes">The Forge All Medium Armor Recipes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629287-img_5325.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629287" data-ratio="0.56591796875" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629287-img_5325.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629287"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629287-img_5325.jpeg"></figure><p>Medium armor is where the boosts to your stats and the money you can make from selling starts to really kick off. This is the intermediate type of armor that you should focus on once you get past the tutorial of The Forge.</p><p>Here are all of the medium armor recipes that are available currently in The Forge:</p><ul><li>Medium Helmet: 1 in 1 chance of crafting when using more than 10 pieces of ore but less than 17</li><li>Medium Leggings: 1 in 2 chance of crafting when using more than 17 pieces of ore</li><li>Medium Chestplate: 1 in 3 chance of crafting when using 17 or more pieces of ore</li></ul><h2 id="The_Forge_All_Heavy_Armor_Recipes">The Forge All Heavy Armor Recipes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629288-img_5324.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629288" data-ratio="0.59228515625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629288-img_5324.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629288"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629288-img_5324.jpeg"></figure><p>Heavy armor, also known as knight armor, is for the players who are trying to get the most out of their ore. As you might expect, this has some of the highest stats in the game and sell price, but it has harsh requirements at the same time.</p><p>Here is how to make all of the heavy armor recipes in this Roblox experience:</p><ul><li>Knight Helmet: 1 in 1 chance when crafting with roughly 30-35 pieces of ore</li><li>Knight Leggings: 1 in 2 chance when crafting with 35 or more pieces of ore</li><li>Knight Chestplate: 1 in 3 chance when crafting with roughly 35 or more pieces of ore</li></ul><h2 id="The_Forge_All_Special_Armor_Recipes">The Forge All Special Armor Recipes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629307-img_5321.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629307" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629307-img_5321.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629307"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629307-img_5321.jpeg"></figure><p>There are special versions of the medium and heavy armor sets that you are able to make. They are generally better than their base versions, but they require highly specific sets of ore to make them.</p><p>Here is how to make the Samurai version of the medium armor set:</p><ul><li>Samurai Helmet: 1 in 2 chance of crafting with 3 Eyes Ore, 3 Obsidian Ore, 3 Uranium Ore, and 7 Mythril Ore</li><li>Samurai Leggings: 1 in 2 chance of crafting with 2 Eye Ore, 5 Obsidian Ore, 5 Uranium Ore, and 5 Mythril Ore</li><li>Samurai Chestplate: 1 in 2 chance of crafting with 2 Eye Ore, 5 Obsidian Ore, 5 Uranium Ore, and 5 Mythril Ore</li></ul><p>Dark Knight armor, on the other hand, is a special version of the heavy armor set. It, too, has special requirements for how to make it:</p><ul><li>Dark Knight Helmet: 1 in 2 chance when crafting with 2 Demonite Ore, 3 Eye Ore, 3 Mythril Ore, 6 Obsidian Ore, and 6 Uranium Ore</li><li>Dark Knight Leggings: 1 in 2 chance when crafting with approximately 10 Demonite Ore, 2 Eye Ore, 8 Mythril Ore, 9 Obsidian Ore, and 9 Uranium Ore</li><li>Dark Knight Chestplate: 1 in 2 chance when crafting with approximately 8 Demonite Ore, 5 Eye Ore, 8 Mythril Ore, 8 Obsidian Ore, and 8 Uranium Ore</li></ul><p>There is so much to see and do in Roblox The Forge, so the thrills don’t end with the main quests.

			<p>A few hours ago, the <strong>New York Videogame Critics Circle</strong> (NYVGCC) unveiled the winners of the <strong>2026 New York Game Awards</strong>, starting with Sandfall Interactive's <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong>, which won the top prize of best game of the year.</p>



<p>It's yet another meaningful award for the highly acclaimed single player JRPG, following <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the win at <strong>The Game Awards</strong> last month</a>. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-third-most-goty-wins-in-single-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already surpassed Baldur's Gate 3</a> as the third game to earn the most GOTY wins, and the award season is far from over, with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 well-positioned to win other prizes, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/"><strong>D.I.C.E. Awards</strong></a>, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-awards-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dominates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDC Awards</a></strong>, and our own Wccftech Awards, which will be announced imminently. It only lost to <strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-2025-goty-award-goes-to-hollow-knight-silksong-beating-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the <strong>Steam Awards</strong></a>, although those were voted on by the public.</p>



<p>Anyway, the so-called '<strong>Big Apple Award</strong>' wasn't the only one that the French developer brought home, so to speak. Jennifer English was once again recognized for her work as Maelle with the <strong>Great White Way Award</strong>, which rewards the Best Acting in a Game. Here's the rest of the prizes that were given during the 2026 New York Game Awards:</p>



<p><strong><em>Off Broadway Award for Best Indie Game<br></em></strong><em>Blue Prince</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Herman Melville Award for Best Writing in a Game<br></em></strong><em>Blippo+</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Statue of Liberty Award for Best World<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades II</a></em></p>



<p><strong><em>Tin Pan Alley Award for Best Music in a Game<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight</a></em></p>



<p><strong><em>Excelsior Award for Best NY Game<br></em></strong><em>Ball x Pit</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Coney Island Dreamland Award for Best AR/VR Game<br></em></strong><em>Lumines Arise</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Central Park Children’s Zoo Award for Best Kids Game<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em></p>



<p><strong><em>A-Train Award for Best Mobile Game<br></em></strong><em>Is This Seat Taken?</em></p>



<p><strong><em>High Line Award for Best Remake<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a></em></p>



<p><strong><em>Chumley’s Speakeasy Award for Best Hidden Gem<br></em></strong><em>News Tower</em></p>



<p><strong><em>NYC GWB Award for Best DLC<br></em></strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lies of P: Overture</a></em></p>



<p>This year's edition of the <strong>Andrew Yoon Legend Award</strong> went to a company rather than a person (last year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was the recipient): <strong>The Pokémon Company</strong>.</p>

            <p>Young Alfie Williams reckons <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> should introduce his character from 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple into the multiplayer slasher-fest.</p>
<p>Williams was chatting with IGN's lovely social producer Mat Jones about the 28 Years Later sequel, when conversation turned to video games and Dead by Daylight. Now, when I say young Alfie Williams, I really do mean young. Williams is, at the time of writing, only 15.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>However, the actor - who plays Spike in both 28 Years Later and the newly-released sequel The Bone Temple - says that the previous inclusion of Stranger Things' characters by in Dead by Daylight proves that minors can be part of the bloody fray, so, really, why shouldn't the team include him?</p>
<p>"I know they bring Stranger Things in, so they can have minors in the game," Williams reasoned. He added he believes Dr. Ian Kelson, played by Ralph Fiennes in both films, would probably be quite a good fit for a Dead by Daylight survivor.</p>
<p>You can check out the full exchange with Williams and Mat below.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>28 Years Later: The Bone Temple star Alfie Williams wants to get a collab with Dead by Daylight:</p><p>"I know they're bringing Stranger Things in, so they CAN have minors in the game." <a href="https://t.co/DCdKMGWujc">pic.twitter.com/DCdKMGWujc</a></p></div>— IGN (@IGN) <a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/2012351328685556026?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>As well as Stranger Things, other Dead by Daylight collaborations have included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-details-its-walking-dead-collaboration-as-public-test-build-go-live">The Walking Dead</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-celebrates-ninth-anniversary-with-five-nights-at-freddys-and-the-witcher-collaborations">Five Nights at Freddy's, The Witcher</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nicolas-cage-is-now-available-in-dead-by-daylight">Nicolas Cage</a> (who was able to fake his own death).</p>
<p>Given all that, a 28 Years Later collaboration is hardly out of the question, though I do think I would feel a little uneasy hunting down a child. What do you think of Williams' idea to feature Spike in Dead by Daylight?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marathon-launch-date-is-march-5-xbox-store-leak/</link>
            <guid>1409722</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Bungie</strong> has so far <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungies-marathon-launches-march-2026-developers-provide-updated-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that <strong>Marathon</strong> would launch in March, but not exactly when. An <strong>Xbox Store</strong> leak may have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qgsa0y/marathon_release_date_discovered_on_xbox_store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed it to be <strong>March 5</strong></a>, so at the very beginning of the month.</p>



<p>Later, an Xbox user even <strong>captured the pre-order trailer</strong> and posted it on Streamable. You can find it embedded below - hurry up, though, as parent company <strong>Sony</strong> is likely to issue a DMCA takedown soon. Anyway, there's a <strong>Deluxe Edition</strong> that includes the so-called <strong>Midnight Decay bundle</strong> (two weapon skins) and more. No doubt, Bungie will share additional details when pre-orders open. It could be in just a few hours, as companies tend to follow up quickly on leaks to definitively confirm or refute the information.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Marathon returns almost exactly thirty years after the previous franchise entry, Marathon Infinity. This new game is very different from the old ones, though. It's modeled after the growing trend of <strong>PvPvE </strong><span><strong>survival-extraction</strong>&nbsp;<strong>games</strong>, played in first-person</span> only. </p>



<p>In each session, you'll infiltrate the derelict colony of <strong>Tau Ceti IV</strong>, a world whose inhabitants mysteriously vanished and is now contested by rival Runner crews and corporate security forces. Runners are <strong>bio‑cybernetic mercenaries</strong> who use a synthetic body built to survive extreme environments, hunting for weapons, upgrades, and valuable resources across repeated runs. </p>



<p>As with other extraction games, treats come from both NPCs (PvE) and other human players (PvP), <strong>making each session unpredictable</strong>. Additionally, Bungie has included <strong>dynamic events</strong> and <strong>environmental hazards</strong> that should keep players constantly on their toes.</p>



<p><strong>Successful exfiltration advances your character's seasonal power</strong>, earns cosmetics for your achievements, and lets you assemble stronger builds with the stolen loot. In Marathon, players customize their Runner's playstyle using weapons, implants, and equipment they collect.</p>



<p>The most recent official Deep Dive from last week <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-deep-dive-runner-shells-gameplay/">showed off the game's <strong>Runner Shells</strong></a>, or classes if you prefer:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Destroyer </strong></li>



<li><strong>Assassin </strong></li>



<li><strong>Recon </strong></li>



<li><strong>Vandal </strong></li>



<li><strong>Thief </strong></li>



<li><strong>Triage</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>There is a seventh Shell, the <strong>Rook</strong>, which can only be used in solo queues and has the advantage of coming with a free standard loadout, allowing newcomers to play without much fear of losing their own items.</p>



<p>The base game will be available at <strong>$39.99 / €39.99 / £34.99</strong>. The Deluxe Edition will certainly be more expensive, although we'll have to wait for the full pre-order announcement to know exactly how much. Marathon will be released on <strong>PC</strong>, <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, and <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> and <strong>X </strong>with full <strong>cross-play</strong>.</p>

The primary goal of the test is to verify server stability and identify critical bugs. While some content will be limited, the test aims to provide a gameplay experience that closely resembles the live service. The Server Slam Test will run for 72 hours, from February 19, 2026, 18:00 p.m. to February 22, 2026, 18:00 p.m. (PDT).</p><p>The test build will feature a variety of new content previously introduced in developer notes. This includes the new boss mutant “Yacha,” along with newly added normal and elite mutants, and the implementation of an elite / boss-exclusive equipment system. In addition, players can experience enhanced anti-cheat measures, user interface / user experience improvements based on player feedback gathered during Steam Next Fest, overall optimization updates and new cosmetic content.</p><p><em>THE CUBE, SAVE US</em> previously gained significant attention during Steam Next Fest, achieving 3rd place in peak concurrent players and “Top 8” in the global popular demo rankings. Taking these results into account, XLGAMES plans to further refine the game’s overall quality through the Server Slam Test.</p><p>Meanwhile, XLGAMES has scheduled Steam Early Access for Q1 2026. The upcoming Server Slam Test will serve as a final comprehensive evaluation of both service stability and gameplay quality ahead of Early Access.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

<p>Nintendo always keeps a careful eye on its branding and the face of its company, Mario. Even when collaborating with a partner like Sega.</p>



<p>Of course, the relationship between Sega and Nintendo is much different today than it was 30 years ago at the height of the console wars. As many know, Sonic, Sega’s mascot, was designed specifically to make Mario seem slow and outdated, so more players would gravitate toward the Sega Genesis home console. However, Sega left the console war in 2001 and, in later years, appeared alongside Mario in Super Smash Bros. games and in their own game, where Mario, Sonic, and many of their side characters from their respective franchises participated in Olympic sports.</p>







<h2 id="h-mario-can-t-appear-to-be-a-step-behind">Mario Can’t Appear to Be a Step Behind</h2>



<p>Ryoichi Hasegawa, a former Sega producer, worked on the Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games franchise. Now, he’s sharing a fun story that offers insight into how protective Nintendo is of its mascot.</p>



<p>He was recently interviewed by Adrian of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r6XcQF_pBI&amp;pp=0gcJCU8KAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Arcade Attack Retro Gaming Network,</a> and during the interview, explained that Nintendo once was upset that Sonic’s foot was ahead of Mario’s in the key art for the Mario and Sonic at the Beijing Olympics video game</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“But there was one funny story. There was, of course, artwork of Mario, Sonic, and other characters standing on the field. Those artworks were used for the package, the instruction manual cover, and the cartridge label, and things like that. There was one small error. Sonic’s foot was in front of Mario’s foot. Nintendo demanded us to change the priority. I still remember that. We were like, ‘Oh my God! We have to change it, or there’ll be no deal.'”</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>That’s right, blast processing be damned! Mario will always be one step ahead. There were six games featuring the Mario and Sonic characters at the Olympics. However, the series has remained dormant since the 2019 release of Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020.</p>

<p>Two minutes of in-engine footage of ZeniMax Online Studio’s cancelled Project Blackbird has leaked online.</p>







<p>The footage, which Insider Gaming can verify is legitimate, was used internally at ZeniMax to showcase the game’s lighting in Unreal Engine 4. You can see the two minutes of footage below:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="es" dir="ltr"><p>👀🔥 LEAK ⚡️</p><p>Nuevo metraje de "Project Blackbird", el MMO de Zenimax Online cancelado hace meses por Xbox.</p><p>Qué ganas le tenía 🥺. <a href="https://t.co/4Nz1G22l2F">pic.twitter.com/4Nz1G22l2F</a></p></div>— eXtas1s 🎮 Noticias &amp; Rumores (@eXtas1stv) <a href="https://twitter.com/eXtas1stv/status/2012971422679765352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Project Blackbird was cancelled by Microsoft in July 2025 as a part of Microsoft’s mass layoffs, which also saw other projects at the publisher cancelled.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources on Blackbird, the game was targeting a 2028 release date and had amazed Microsoft Gaming executives just months earlier during a presentation. As of the time of writing, Microsoft Gaming still haven’t given a reason as to why Blackbird was cancelled.</p>



<p>The game’s cancellation led to the layoff of some 300 developers and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/matt-firor-quit-zenimax-project-blackbird-cancelation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">departure of studio president Matt Firor</a>. </p>

<p>The live-action Legend of Zelda movie will stream exclusively on Netflix after its theatrical and home entertainment releases.</p>



<p>Very little is known about the Legend of Zelda movie, aside from the fact that it is slated to release in May 2027. However, as part of Sony Pictures’ Pay-1 licensing deal with Netflix, the upcoming Legend of Zelda movie will join Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse and the forthcoming quartet of Beatles movies, directed by Sam Mendes, in streaming exclusively on Netflix.</p>



<p><a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-and-sony-pictures-entertainment-enter-new-global-pay-1-deal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a press release, </a>Paul Littmann, EVP of Global Distribution at Sony Pictures Television, praised the partnership with Netflix and cited the new deal as the next step in that relationship.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Our partnership with Netflix has always been incredibly valuable. This new Pay-1 deal takes that partnership to the next level and reinforces the enduring appeal of our theatrical releases to Netflix’s global audience. It also further underscores the strength of our independence and unique ability to create meaningful opportunities that benefit our creative stakeholders, consumers, and world-class partners.”</p>

<p>In November 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-live-action-images-reveal-link-and-zelda-in-costume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official images</a> of Zelda and Link in the film were revealed. Bo Bragason will play Princess Zelda, and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth will play Hyrule’s protector, Link. Filming began in 2025, but there’s still over a year until the actual release, and much remains to be learned about the casting, plot, and more. Recently, it was suggested that a star of the popular Apple TV series, Severance, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zelda-movie-leak-impa-severance-actor-filming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">could be joining the cast.</a></p>







<p>2026 is also the 40th anniversary of the The Legend of Zelda franchise as a whole. In celebration, a new LEGO set is on the way.

            <guid>1409491</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In 2025 Marc-Alexis Côté, the head of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-mirage-red-hexe-multiplayer-delays-1850442019"><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise </a>and a 20 year veteran of Ubisoft, abruptly left the publisher following the <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-sales-ubisoft-politics-culture-war-2000641428">launch of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a>. Three months ago he broke his silence to claim that he didn’t leave voluntarily but was pushed out of the company. Now he’s suing Ubisoft for nearly $1 million over what he alleges was a “constructive dismissal” after being demoted from leading the publisher’s biggest franchise.</p> <p><a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed">Radio-Canada reports</a> that the lawsuit was recently filed in the Superior Court of Quebec and claims $1.3 million Canadian dollars in damages, or roughly $935,000. In it, Côté details the events leading up to his departure from the company, including a meeting in the summer of 2025 when it apparently became clear that he would no longer remain in charge of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, the franchise he had led sine <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-infinity-live-service-mirage-valhalla-1849518253">a 2022 strategy reboot</a> outlined its ambitious future.</p>

 <p>Last year, Ubisoft launched a <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-charlie-yves-guillemot-tencent-far-cry-7-1851786421">subsidiary called Vantage Studios</a> backed by $1.25 billion in funding&nbsp; from Tencent that would house the publisher’s most profitable franchises: <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. It’s led by North American studios head Christophe Derennes and CEO Yves Guillemot’s son,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-guillemot-son-of-ubisoft-s-ceo-is-leaving-the-1846986415">Charlie Guillemot</a>. Prior to the move, Côté reported directly to Yves Guillemot.</p>

 <h2>An <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> veteran allegedly demoted</h2> <p>But under this new model, Ubisoft was looking to hire a Head of Franchise that would oversee all of its major IP, including <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, effectively demoting Côté, according to his lawsuit. The new position would also only be located in France, meaning Côté wouldn’t be eligible unless he was willing to relocate his life across the Atlantic.</p>

 <p>The veteran developer was reportedly offered a new position of franchise production head or an ambiguous role leading a “Creative House” overseeing a separate, lesser franchise within the company’s portfolio. When he declined and requested his severance for effectively losing his position in October, he alleges that Ubisoft took the surprise step of <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/i-did-not-walk-away-former-assassins-creed-boss-says-he-didnt-resign-he-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft/">both internally</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft">and publicly</a> announcing his “voluntary” departure the next day.</p>

 <p>“The past 24 hours have been deeply emotional,” he <a href="https://kotaku.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-says-he-didnt-jump-ubisoft-pushed-2000636542">wrote on LinkedIn at the time</a>. “Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it. The truth is simple: I did not make that choice.”&nbsp;Côté is now asking the Quebec court not only for damages and his severance, but to be released from a non-compete clause that limits the roles he can take elsewhere in the video game industry.</p>

 <h2>Longer dev cycles, fewer games</h2> <p>The lawsuit comes on the eve of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>‘ one-year anniversary, the last game in the franchise to ship with Côté, who has been working on the historical action series since 2010’s<em> Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood</em>, at the helm. That game was originally supposed to come out in 2024 but was delayed to provide additional development time after already marking the longest lull ever between new releases in the series.</p>

 <p>“We’re also shifting our development model to make it more sustainable for our teams, as previously we used to average about three years for each development cycle on <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>,” Côté <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/227nBAMiGtBTXKouvVkNyF/the-future-of-assassins-creed-feudal-japan-standalone-multiplayer-much-more">announced</a> back in 2022. “So we’re moving to longer dev cycles to make them more sustainable from a human and technological point of view, so that we can truly build on the shoulders of one another and then support our games for a longer period of time.”</p> <p>He said the franchise would evolve along two separate tracks, with <em>Shadows</em> representing the continued evolution of the open-world RPG formula that began with <em>Assassin’s Creed Origins</em> and the next entry, <em>Assassin’s Creed Hexe</em> directed by Clint Hocking, taking an approach that would feel “fresh and different.” Years later, however, some projects like the multiplayer spin-off <em>Invictus</em> and the mobile “AAA” game <em>Jade</em> remain MIA. A remake of <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em>, meanwhile, is rumored to be launching in the next few months.</p> <p>Ubisoft and Côté did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

The game arrived under immense expectation, and it’s fair to say it ultimately proved more divisive than Nintendo and developer Retro Studios had hoped.</p>
<p>If <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/metroid-prime-4-beyond/">Metacritic scores</a> are anything to go by, Prime 4 reviewed well but stopped short of the near-universal acclaim enjoyed by the original trilogy. It’s been described as a game of ‘high highs and low lows,’ a characterisation that I feel broadly holds true. In hindsight, though, it’s a game I wish I could have experienced with less of the noise that surrounded it.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4celpmohx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>I was initially quite riveted by the game’s opening hours, but was taken aback after going online to find much of the gaming commentariat lambasting the title as an epic disappointment, if not an outright failure. As I pushed on with my playthrough, that narrative began to colour the experience itself, becoming almost as intrusive as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-so-now-the-dust-has-settled-how-did-you-find-myles-mackenzie">Prime 4’s NPCs</a>.</p>

<p>Algorithm-chasing YouTube critiques, searing post-mortems, finger-pointing at its troubled development history, and a relentless focus on what Prime 4 <em>wasn’t</em> seemed to characterise the mood following its release, making me feel like I was playing a fundamentally different game from the one being litigated online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I found myself mentally auditing and second-guessing my own enjoyment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s not to dismiss criticism of the game, because there are certainly aspects that deserve it. Too often, though, the discourse felt less like measured appraisal and more like performative dunking. It felt like not enough was being said about what Prime 4 does right, such that I found myself mentally auditing and second-guessing my own enjoyment.</p>
<p>The backlash was initially surprising because I felt it was generally delivering exactly what a Metroid Prime game should: It’s a technical showcase; its controls are sublime; its world design is visually stunning; it offers exploration, scanning, and plenty of well-hidden items; its boss fights stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the best the series has ever produced.</p>
<p>Having recently revisited the series with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>, Prime 4 feels like it takes gameplay cues from that lauded entry while opting for far more linear biomes that feel more approachable to newcomers. Still, moment to moment, I found it harder to put down than any other major first-party release of the current hardware generation.</p>

<p>I even enjoyed Sol Valley, the desert hub world routinely derided as an empty, 'half-baked' open world. People misread the <em>intent</em> of this space – it exists as a palate cleanser to blast through on the fun-to-control Vi-O-La bike between tense sessions of dungeon-crawling in tight corridors. With a few collectibles, lore, and story beats to discover, it does what it should.</p>
<p>Admittedly, Prime 4 manages to repeatedly break its own spell with its narrative choices. Metroid’s traditional strengths of isolation, atmosphere, and player-driven discovery are all there, but it really fumbles in delivering a coherent character-driven story. Its attempts to do so more often than not felt like tonal misfires that broke my immersion.</p>
<p>That dissonance was, for me, most apparent in the game’s use of NPC companions whose quips and chatter just felt <em>wrong</em> in a Metroid game. After decades of largely solitary adventures, there’s an obvious temptation to push Metroid toward a more character-driven structure, especially in a game positioned as an entry point to the series.</p>

<p>But in this case, the execution of that premise — along with sequences that felt closer to a conventional, dialogue-driven campaign shooter — understandably felt like too much of a departure from what defines Metroid. While I don’t believe Prime 4 deserved the pile-on it received, I won’t deny feeling somewhat conflicted once I rolled the credits.</p>
<p>I have my own qualms with the game, but I still struggled to reconcile them with how much of the conversation had already settled on Prime 4 as a disappointment. The conclusion I’ve reached is that the game was judged both on what it actually is <em>and</em> on what it was supposed to represent as the long-awaited successor to a near-mythic trilogy.</p>
<p>After years of anticipation, the bar wasn’t simply high. Prime 4 was expected to justify its own resurrection, to reaffirm the legacy of its namesake series, and to reward years of fan patience with something transformative. Anything less than a series-defining triumph was always going to be framed as a letdown. Being 'good enough' was never going to be enough.</p>

<p>Stripped of the hype and the scrutiny, though, this is a game that succeeds far more often than it stumbles, one that repeatedly compelled me to keep going long after I should have stopped, one that I deeply enjoyed playing. How it will be remembered remains to be seen, but I wouldn’t be surprised if hindsight proves kinder than the moment it was released into.</p>
