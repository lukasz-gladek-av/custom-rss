			<p>On September 26, Inworld AI, the creators of the <a href="https://inworld.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading AI engine</a> for gaming, gave creators an in-depth look into the AI-powered tools that creators will get to access in the future, supposedly to spark a new generation of innovation in gaming. Creators got a 90-minute keynote presentation that announced new products and demos, detailed discussions with industry leaders from companies such as NVIDIA and Xbox, and an indie game studio named Playroom. They have a new social multiplayer game titled Death by AI, which has had more than 20 million players since the game launched in May.</p>
<p>Inworld has a modular platform of Primitives, which allows game developers to generate complex and context-aware behaviors that are more advanced than scripted responses or traditional game AI. Inworld has no limitations on genre, and players can build an FPS or an RPG, with Inworld being able to respond to the evolving game world in a way that feels lifelike and dynamic for the players and the creators.</p>
<p><iframe title="Companion quests with AI game companions | Inworld AI Unreal Engine Demo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A7iBmND9L-c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Primitives include specialized input and output models, as well as Systems that can orchestrate the models, coordinating them to create intelligent game behaviors. The input models are utilized to inform sensory and perception models such as Listen, Vision, State, Ingestion and Recognition. Planners are used to generate and execute plans to ensure that everything is working together as it should be.</p>
<p>There are plenty of tools within the Inworld AI system, such as the Narrative Graph, which has been co-developed with Xbox, helping visualize and manage interactive narratives by auto-generating branching storylines from uploaded content. There is also a Mass Character Generator available to help speed up the NPC creation process, using an asset library which is linked to the placeholder NPC template.</p>
<p>The games industry is troubling at the moment, with&nbsp;more layoffs&nbsp;and closures than ever. Talented developers are losing their jobs and struggling to find another, with some having to decide to leave the industry entirely. Inworld AI is aiming to help ease some of the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/peter-molyneux-says-ai-will-be-a-real-game-changer-in-the-future-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">burden in the industry</a> and&nbsp;allow people to create games without the astronomical cost of game development.</p>
<p>Whether a tool like this will be successful enough remains to be seen, as it hasn't been stated what Inworld's AI has been trained on and whether it is stealing assets from other games and artists, as seen with many AI tools that are currently on the market. Inworld has uploaded a <a href="https://inworld.ai/blog/beyond-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> that details some of the tool's features and how it aims to aid game development, with many videos listed to showcase the features that creators can access in the tool.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-unite-shutting-down-in-belgium-and-the-netherlands.994467/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-unite-shutting-down-belgium-netherlands<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company and developer TiMi have announced that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite&nbsp;</em>is shutting down in Belgium and the Netherlands, effective late next year (yes, you read that correctly).</p>
<p>According <a href="https://www.serebii.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to Serebii.net</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-themed MOBA will no longer be taking registrations and membership renewals after October 31st this year, nor will it continue selling in-game Aeos gems.</p>
<p>Following that, the game will become unavailable for play in Belgium and the Netherlands on November 30th next year. That means you'll have around 13 months to continue playing it after registrations end if you're in either of those countries.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-unite-shutting-down-belgium-netherlands-pikachu.jpg?itok=jZeJSw1t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-unite-shutting-down-belgium-netherlands-pikachu.jpg?itok=BN2oiEDF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Unite&nbsp;</em>is shutting down in Belgium and the Netherlands next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Serebii's account is corroborated by a number of Dutch and Belgian&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite&nbsp;</em>players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonUnite/comments/1fqgclh/goodbye_unite_belgium/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">over in this Reddit thread</a>, many of whom say they received a notice that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite&nbsp;</em>is shutting down shortly after applying a new update to the game.</p>
<p>While the notice itself doesn't seem to give any reason for the game's shutdown in these countries, it's almost certainly due to their especially strict laws regarding loot boxes and gacha mechanics in games.</p>
<p>Games as high-profile as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-backs-down-versus-belgium-loot-box-laws-removes-fifa-points"><em>FIFA</em></a> (now known as&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>)&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocket-league-loot-boxes-can-no-longer-be-opened-in-belgium-and-netherlands"><em>Rocket League</em></a>, as well as titles developed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/loot-box-laws-are-shutting-down-two-nintendo-mobile-titles-in-belgium">Nintendo</a>, have fallen foul of Belgian loot box laws in the past.</p>
<p>Things aren't much different in the Netherlands on this front; back in 2020, the Dutch government <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netherlands-heavily-penalises-ea-over-loot-boxes-ea-appeals">heavily penalized EA</a> over the presence of loot boxes in the Ultimate Team mode of what was then known as&nbsp;<em>FIFA</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-ultimate-team-loot-boxes.jpg?itok=VxK5Yq9p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-ultimate-team-loot-boxes.jpg?itok=ZokPFf9p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Companies like EA have also fallen foul of Benelux's loot box laws.</figcaption></figure><p>Again, The Pokemon Company and TiMi haven't explicitly stated that Belgium and the Netherlands' restrictive loot box laws are the reason for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite</em>'s shutdown in those areas.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that this won't affect&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite</em>'s operation in other areas, so if you're still playing the game in the US, the UK, or anywhere else it hasn't yet been discontinued, you'll be fine.</p>
<p><em>Pokemon Unite&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-unite-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> and mobile devices. Stay tuned for more.</p>

		<p><em>While it's true talking about video games for a living forges a different relationship with the medium, all of are living through an age of bounty. There are too many video games to play, and it's impossible to ever feel "caught up."</em></p><p><em> The concept of "choice" and the overabundance of "choice" has been a reoccurring theme in this ongoing letter series with Rob and Patrick, and comes up here, too. This can often lead to a situation where you spend time with an excellent game and move on, creating a weird sense of guilt. It's my free time, I should spend it how I like? And yet, as you watch the games pile up, it can feel a little weird!</em></p><p><em>Rob and Patrick couldn't be more different in terms of the types of games they play, too. Which is probably a good place to transition to the conversation itself...</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>So Rob, I’m not sure about you, but at any given time, I’m trying to juggle between three or four games that I’m playing at the same time. Some games require patience and focus and a dark room, others can be played with one eye while still chatting with one of my daughters. I took inventory before writing this, and here are the games I’m in the middle of at the moment:</p><ul><li><em>Arco </em>(93.9 hours. I’m guessing you’re wrong about that one, Steam. Probably 10?)</li><li><em>UFO 50</em> (Steam says 81.3 hours, which is also incorrect. More like two hours.)</li><li><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> (2 hours)</li><li><em>Star Wars: Outlaws </em>(3 hours)</li><li><em>Iron Meat</em> (1 hour)</li><li><em>The Plucky Square</em> (5 hours)</li><li><em>NFL Retro Bowl 25</em> (5 hours)</li><li><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> (4 hours)</li><li><em>Arranger </em>(2 hours)</li></ul><p>That is not three for four games, but if I’m being honest, I’m not actually juggling all of those games, either. Some of those games—<em>Arranger, Black Myth: Wukong, Star Wars Outlaws</em>—are prime candidates for being left behind entirely. I will, inevitably, tell myself I’ll “play them over the holidays” to feel better.”<em> NFL Retro Bowl 25 </em>is something I pluck at when I want to push my brain further into mush after the Bears have disappointed me yet again on Sunday. It also doesn’t have an “ending,” really, so there’s nothing to work towards except feeling done with it.</p><p>One of my ongoing flaws is finishing games that I start, which at its best means I’m playing 7/10 games and having experiences that better inform my view of the medium, while other times it means I begin to look like a gaming hoarder who can’t make up their mind. My two children are now old enough to take care of themselves through broad swathes of the day, which is opening up more hours for me to play games, but I seem to be amassing more video games, instead?</p><p>A few weekends ago, my wife was out of town and I had five children in the house at once, but they were all playing nice with one another and I managed to play Astro Bot on my couch, beer in hand, for two hours straight without being meaningfully interrupted. One of the neighborhood parents asked if I needed help, but I declined it because I did not want to interrupt the universe.</p><p>Anyway, it reminds me of an ongoing conversation we’ve had this year about overwhelming choice. Now, it’s true that our line of work means that we’re playing more games than the average person because we need something to talk about on a podcast, but I find myself doing this with television and movies all the time, too! Every time I boot up our family room Apple TV and see how many shows my wife and I have left lingering four episodes in, I turn the TV off.</p><p>I simply do not see it. And then I start a new TV show. How is <em>Slow Horses</em>?&nbsp;</p><p>But then eventually, the guilt catches up. I managed to see the endings to <em>Nine Sols</em> and <em>Valley Peaks</em> a few weeks back because I finally said “fuck it” and dedicated an evening to both of them. I’ll probably do the same with <em>Arco</em>, because I can feel the ending of that on the horizon.</p><p>You and I couldn’t be more different when it comes to the games we play, though. There is a little bit of overlap, though, but you tend to play more evergreen-ish games, experiences where there is no definitive ending to signal “hey, you could move on if you want to.” Obviously, I’m on the other end of the spectrum, where I’m put off by games that can’t be wrapped up in a bow. I get the sense that you don’t feel nearly as much of a hangup about leaving a game behind.</p><p>But it also means I end up dipping between lots of games and not finishing many of them. How do you manage feeling “full” on a game? What do you take as a signal to move on?</p><figure><figcaption><i><em>Frostpunk 2</em></i><span> is the kind of game that has an ending, and yet, there's plenty of reason to keep going.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>A thing I got from my time covering esports was a recognition that some games you can dedicate your life to and keep learning new things, and there are people out there who will and do. I might have a fairly broad view of strategy games but I will never understand <em>StarCraft </em>a fraction as well as someone who is moved to write an essay over on Team Liquid. So there are a lot of games you could never really finish in terms of mastering them or fully understanding them. So you can’t say, “I’ll be finished with this when I really understand it.” You might never get there, because the more you understand the more you’ll realize you don’t know.</p>

For PC players, things are getting more compact. For console users, updates are beginning to be improved in a significant way. Here’s everything you need to know about all the changes happening in the Xbox ecosystem.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h7672"><a id=""></a><strong>Compact Mode</strong></h2><p>As an<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/25/xbox-update-september-game-bar-compact-mode/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/25/xbox-update-september-game-bar-compact-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Xbox blog post</a></span> detailed, PC players can now use a compact version of the Game Bar. This feature allows you to select recently played games, explore the widget store, and navigate common game launchers. The compact mode had been available to “Insiders,” and is now open to all, designed to make it less cumbersome to use when playing on smaller screens, especially if you’re streaming to mobile.</p><p>In addition to using a controller, users can now quit a running game by going to the Home widget, selecting the game, and pressing “Close.” If this sounds familiar, it’s because this feature is built into the Xbox consoles.</p><p>Turning on Compact Mode is fairly simple. To do so, all users need to do is go to the Game Bar, select “Settings,” then go under the “General” tab and switch “<strong>Compact Mode</strong>” on.</p><h2 id="h7673"><a id=""></a><strong>Game Management</strong></h2><p>Now, we can view and install all add-ons to the game they’re downloading, regardless of when they were first bought, and whether on PC or via the Xbox App. If a game that you’re installing has add-ons, they’ll be displayed in one place for you to see.</p><p>To take advantage of this feature, you need to right-click any game you have installed or visit the left navigation panel. Once there, click on “Manage” and then “Add-ons,” and you’ll be able to see it in there.</p><h2 id="h7674"><a id=""></a><strong>Xbox App</strong></h2><p>If you’re an Xbox beta member, you’ll already be able to start using features from the Xbox Game Pass app within the Xbox app, as Microsoft attempts to streamline the two. Beta members can now look through Game Pass and manage their memberships from the Xbox App. If they’re subscribed to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, they’ll be able to claim their perks and stream specific games via Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS or Android devices. This will all soon be arriving for the rest of us, too.</p><p>Because of this, the Xbox Game Pass app will no longer support new downloads starting in November. Coo, it’s going to app heaven.</p><h2 id="h7675"><a id=""></a><strong>Xbox Consoles</strong></h2><p>If you’ve ever sat down on your couch to enjoy some Xbox gaming, and then been notified that what you want to play requires a 75GB update (hello, <em>Fortnite</em>), then this feature should give you hope. There’s a new setting that will pre-download updates, and set them live as soon as the developer says “go.”</p><p>To enable this new feature, to go to “My Games &amp; Apps” and then “Manage” and select “Updates.” From there, you’ll see all the pre-downloads, which at the moment is not very many. This feature currently only works with <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, and <em>Cassette Beasts</em>, but “many more” titles will soon support it.</p><h2 id="h7676"><a id=""></a><strong>Wish list notifications</strong></h2><p>If a game on your wish list becomes part of a Free Play Day, hits its release date, or joins Game Pass, you’ll now be notified. What a novel concept. And you can, of course, switch off this notification, although if you want to, it’s not clear why you were wishlisting things in the first place.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Perfectionism is a great source of misery for me. It's the thing that keeps me from writing a book, striking up more conversations, and trying my hand at woodcrafting. And it's what makes me hyper-critical of the things I <em>do </em>do (if you think internet commenters can be mean about someone's writing, you would weep at what I make of my own work). But from a standpoint that I'm sure no therapist would endorse, perfection can also be <em>delightful</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to playing games, there is no shortage of ways you can achieve greatness and soak in the enjoyment that comes with that. Clearing the screen in Tetris, pulling off a sick 360 no-scope, or turning the tables and eking out a victory with a sliver of health can all be immensely satisfying experiences.</p><p dir="ltr">But there's something I've always found about Into the Breach--and, more recently, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tactical-breach-wizards-review-breach-and-cast/1900-6418270/" data-ref-id="1900-6418270">excellent Tactical Breach Wizards</a>, which shares some design DNA with Into the Breach--that transcends the satisfaction I've ever found with any other game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374876-tsb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4374876" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374876-tsb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4374876"></a><figcaption>Tactical Breach Wizards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374876-tsb.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As in Into the Breach, Tactical Breach Wizards centers around the manipulation of spacing and reacting to the certainty of knowing what comes next. Within its turn-based and grid-based format, you're given insight into what your opponents will do next, meaning you know precisely what dire future awaits as soon as you click End Turn. Maybe you're going to lose a unit, fail an objective, or have to restart entirely. Not being a roguelike, as Into the Breach is, the stakes are much lower in Tactical Breach Wizards, but that clarity of the consequences of your failure elevates the impact of your choices. You can clearly see the doom to come--and then you get to bask in the pleasure of having figured out how to upend that outcome.</p><p dir="ltr">And it's the way in which you do that in Tactical Breach Wizards that makes it so enjoyable. You can directly inflict damage on foes, and that is a reliable means of dealing with them in many cases. But quite often, you have to rely on adjusting their positioning and upcoming actions to facilitate your desired outcome. Oh, you planned to attack me? Actually, you're going to spend the next turn knocking out your teammate who would have dealt me a fatal blow, after watching as half of your allies are thrown out of windows.</p><p dir="ltr">Because you can preview the result of your choices, you can play out every move on the chess board to find the best option. And that result is often so wildly beyond my initial expectations of what is possible, particularly as the game gives your characters more and more upgrades to navigate and alter the battlefield.</p><p dir="ltr">Tactical Breach Wizards eventually became a constant exercise in twisting things around on <em>every</em> turn of each level. I would spend my time in this almost zen-like state of flowing to and fro within the constraints and threats around me, manipulating enemies, probing for different possibilities until finding that absolute perfect series of moves.</p><p dir="ltr">Any time I start to find a game too easy, I'm quick to jack up the difficulty until I can be sufficiently miserable. Yet in Tactical Breach Wizards, while the thought crossed my mind periodically, I found that I ended up positively giddy with the end result of so many levels, cackling in disbelief, and I didn't want to rob myself of that sensation. I never fail a level, something that in most games would elicit boredom, due to the fact that it's usually the act of standing on the precipice of failure that generates excitement for me. Instead, the excitement here comes from seeing if I can thread the needle in a way that feels impossible when first examining a new level--and successfully managing to do so is a thrill unlike almost any other. Combine this with the number of times I would recoil at the sight of a challenging level, only to find a way to flawlessly complete it in a <em>single turn</em>, and Tactical Breach Wizards plays right into my perfection-obsessed brain.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not possible to complete every level in one turn--or at least I don't think so, though the way in which you can chain abilities to extend a single turn is one of the big gameplay differentiators from Into the Breach. But it is possible far more often than those first glimpses, even at the larger-scale maps from late in the game, would suggest. The prospect of victory seems daunting, and the notion of achieving success in one turn is laughable, but it is frequently possible and leads to an incredible feeling when managing to pull it off.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374877-tsbdefenestrate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4374877" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374877-tsbdefenestrate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4374877"></a><figcaption>A good ol' defenestration</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374877-tsbdefenestrate.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My total playtime in Tactical Breach Wizards ended up far above the norm from those I've spoken with. Some of that is from doing so many of the bonus objectives and all of the side missions, none of which I was willing to miss thanks to both the game's stellar, hilarious writing and another opportunity to do what initially seemed impossible. But the bigger factor in my playtime was the excessive amount of time I'd spend on each turn, examining what approach I could take, the different outcomes that could be achieved, and the wide range of possibilities that exist. (The fact that it never gets old blasting enemies out of windows--<em>defenestrating</em> them, as the game happily teaches you--didn't hurt, either.)</p><p dir="ltr">Perfectionism might be one of my biggest challenges in life, but in Tactical Breach Wizards, it's the key to making the most of one of my favorite gaming experiences ever.</p>

                <p>StarCraft has largely been dormant since Blizzard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starcraft-2-content-updates-have-ended-so-blizzard-can-focus-on-the-franchises-future/1100-6483434/" data-ref-id="1100-6483434">stopped updating StarCraft II in 2020</a> to focus on the future of the franchise. But now, there's a report that Blizzard is taking another stab at making a StarCraft shooter after two previous attempts failed.</p><p>Jason Schreier, who wrote the upcoming book, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-co-founder-founder-left-because-he-was-tired-of-fighting-bobby-kotick-report/1100-6526714/" data-ref-id="1100-6526714">Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment</a>, appeared on IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crazy-blizzard-stories-with-jason-schreier-unlocked-661" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Unlocked podcast</a> where he revealed that the remnants of the team behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-untitled-survival-game-has-been-canceled-after-president-leaves-report/1100-6520603/" data-ref-id="1100-6520603">Blizzard's canceled survival game</a> are "incubating" a StarCraft shooter. Additionally, the project is reportedly being overseen by Dan Hay, who is a veteran developer with experience on Ubisoft's Far Cry games.</p><p>Although StarCraft has a rich mythology that is ripe with storytelling potential, Blizzard hasn't been able to fully translate that into a shooter yet. The first attempt, StarCraft: Ghost, started development in 2001 and it languished in development for years before Blizzard finally pulled the plug. A second shooter, StarCraft: Ares, was reportedly canceled in 2019.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-game-pass-titles-announced-at-xbox-tgs-2024-starcraft-remastered-legend-of-mana-and-more/1100-6526725/" data-ref-id="1100-6526725">StarCraft Remastered and StarCraft 2</a> were announced as upcoming titles on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.

			<p>The<a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-mod-removes-the-psn-account-requirement-patch-2-fixes-nvidia-dlss-frame-gen/"> God of War Ragnarok PC port</a> is most definitely solid, but it offers few options to scale visual settings beyond the PlayStation 5 version and sometimes looks worse than it as well.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Digital Foundry provided an in-depth look at the port, highlighting how the new version of the game is a great way to play it, thanks to shader compilation issues being pretty much non-existent, thanks to the move to DirectX 12 over its predecessor, great support for ultra-wide and super-wide aspect ratios, NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS upscalers, complete with frame generation where applicable and more.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, besides hitting higher resolutions with smoother performance, God of War Ragnarok cannot look much better than the console release, as the port doesn't offer many options to scale beyond it. In some instances, the PC port even looks worse than the PS5 version in Quality Mode, due to the PC release missing the cubemap tracing system, and some effects, such as moving mist in a certain dream sequence. Portal transitions also aren't as smooth as on consoles, which is most definitely weird, as they look better even on PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>The God of War Ragnarok PC port also has some performance issues on Ryzen 3000 series CPUs and some tessellation setting issues, among other things, which could definitely be fixed with future patches. You can find Digital Foundry's full analysis <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-a-quality-port-with-small-issues-and-here-are-our-best-settings-selections">here</a> and its video version below.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fender Monster Hunter Guitar Lets You Rock Out With Rathalos]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fender-monster-hunter-guitar</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fender-monster-hunter-guitar-lets-you-rock-out-with-rathalos.994434/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fender-monster-hunter-guitar<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fender and Capcom have announced a collaboration to create a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>-themed guitar, with the King of the Skies himself, Rathalos, providing the principal inspiration for the instrument.</p>
<p>In a press release, Fender and Capcom describe the Rathalos-themed guitar as an "extraordinary instrument for both game enthusiasts and music lovers", which I suppose it had better be, given that it'll cost you a whopping $2000.</p>
<p>The guitar is a special-edition Telecaster, but unlike most Telecasters, it's got a humbucker for its neck pickup and a single coil for its bridge, so you can choose between heavy, chunky tones "perfect for pairing with distortion pedals" and the thinner twang for which the Telecaster is known.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-rathalos-telecaster-guitar.jpeg?itok=7kP3yZFL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-rathalos-telecaster-guitar.jpeg?itok=RMSTcUix 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>Telecaster is a thing of beauty.</figcaption></figure><p>The basic model of this Telecaster features a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>-inspired design on both the body of the guitar and its twelfth fret marker, so you can rock out and pay tribute to Rathalos at the same time.</p>
<p>On the special Japan-only Limited Edition model, you'll find "Rathalos' distinctive wings and flame patterns", and the pickguard features "claw marks", as if Rathalos himself has attacked your guitar (or as if he's been playing it).</p>
<p>You can also expect a glow-in-the-dark effect for the fretboard's side dots and twelfth fret marker on the Limited Edition model, so if you're playing this one during a gig and you want the lights to go down, you'll still create a striking impression.</p>
<p>If you pick this one up, you won't just get the guitar; you'll get a black hardshell case as well, in addition to a certificate of authenticity proving that you own a genuine version of the instrument rather than a replica.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fender-monster-hunter-rathalos-telecaster.jpeg?itok=wBd6DZc_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fender-monster-hunter-rathalos-telecaster.jpeg?itok=pETo26XY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just look at that finish.</figcaption></figure><p>This guitar is just one part of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-series-sales-100-million-anniversary">20th-anniversary celebrations</a>, and the franchise is still very much going strong today; the latest installment,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date">set for release in February</a>.</p>
<p>Fender's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>Telecaster will be available <a href="https://www.fender.com/en-US/electric-guitars/telecaster/monster-hunter-rathalos-telecaster-rosewood-fingerboard-rathalos-red/5602600899.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via Fender.com</a> and via "authorized Fender dealers worldwide" starting from March next year. The Limited Edition model will only be available via Fender Flagship Tokyo and Fender's official Japanese online store.</p>

In <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4696781406111167992?utm_source=SteamDB">an update on Thursday</a>, Steam says <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsubscriber_agreement%3Fsnr%3D2_groupannouncements_detail_%2310">its subscriber agreement</a> “now provides that any disputes are to go forward in court instead of arbitration.”</p><p>Many companies include a forced arbitration clause in their user agreement, waiving a person’s right to a trial in court. Arbitration involves settling a dispute outside a legal system before an impartial third party.

The company argued that because the widower agreed to a forced arbitration policy when signing up for Disney Plus, he didn’t have the right to sue (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224277/disney-wrongful-death-lawsuit-waiving-arbitration">Disney later conceded</a>).</p><p>Previously, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240901011847/https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/">Steam’s user agreement</a> said that “you and Valve agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us in individual binding arbitration” for all disputes related to Steam, your account, hardware, or the company’s content and services. The new agreement eliminates any mention of a binding arbitration policy.</p><p>Steam doesn’t say why it decided to suddenly remove the forced arbitration clause. <a href="https://www.404media.co/steam-removes-forced-arbitration-clause-gamers-can-now-sue-valve/">As pointed out by <em>404 Media</em></a>, a group of plaintiffs recently challenged Valve’s forced arbitration policy and were able to file a class action lawsuit over Steam’s dominance.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Oh, and all of these Pokémon are regularly just found in the wild, some of them in the game <em>right now</em>.</p><p>The path choice will also give you a different set of Pokémon for a collection challenge, although both include the Galarian starters, Grookey, Scorbunny and Sobble, then bizarrely just swaps out the banal gang that make up the rest to be a trade challenge for the opposite path. Imagine having to trade to get a Seedot—that’s a thing here! And the reward for completing the catch challenge? A SKWOVET. You know, the squirrel thing that you see seventeen of every time you play, and <em>was the prize for collecting the eight Pokémon at the start of this bloody thing</em>.</p><p><em>However</em>, there is one aspect about which I don’t feel scorn, beyond that Niantic is at least not charging for this bizarre anticlimax: it’ll be possible to encounter shiny Zacian for the first time, and that’s a cool, blue dog-lion-thing. Zacian is in 5-star raids, so load up Poke Genie and start grinding for your shiny.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pokemongolive.com/post/galarian-expedition-2024?hl=en&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/galarian-expedition-2024?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shiny Zamazenta is arriving in raids October 4</a></span>, with the start of Galarian Expedition, along with yet another $8 Master Ball research task.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">ScarlettVixen has officially released Mario Adventure 3, a ROM hack (the legality of playing games with ROMs is nebulous at best) for Super Mario Bros. 3, which has been in development for 20 years. The developer stated, "It's been an extremely long project, but after 12 years, it's finally here. Many of this game's elements are iterations and polishes on concepts found in prior projects. Mario Adventure 3 is more than a 12-year project, it's a 20-year amalgamation of ideas waiting to see fruition."</p><p dir="ltr">The first version of Mario Adventure debuted in 2002, and subsequent hacks like Luigi's Coin Quest and Luigi vs. Mario continued to build on its foundation. In Mario Adventure 3, ScarlettVixen integrates features from earlier projects, while adding new elements to the game. Check out a trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN1ORLvuamI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VN1ORLvuamI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The hack includes a variety of features, such as a day-and-night cycle, weather effects, an item shop, and exploration-heavy mechanics. Players can traverse and backtrack through worlds without cutscenes, a concept introduced in Luigi's Coin Quest. Hidden collectibles unlock access to otherwise blocked areas, encouraging players to explore deeply.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition, Mario Adventure 3 features major technical upgrades, including a custom level format, an optimized tile-collision system, and rebuilt enemies. ScarlettVixen shared in an <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&amp;t=127986" rel="nofollow ">SMW Central forum post</a> that "roughly 75% of the game has been rewritten from the ground up." New power-ups, like the Ninja Mushroom that allows wall-jumping, and a revamped item system are also introduced. The hack pushes NES hardware by displaying up to 28 colors on screen at once and features a full save system, allowing players to revisit completed levels.</p><p dir="ltr">The game's plot centers on the Malice Mushrooms invading Bowser's Kingdom, with Bowser blaming Princess Peach's kingdom for the infestation. Mario must clear the Malice to prevent a war between the kingdoms.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The PlayStation Store has reportedly disclosed more PS5 Pro Enhanced games than originally known, revealing big-name games like Fortnite and Madden NFL 25 will look better on the upcoming system. All together, it now appears 54 titles will take advantage of the PS5 Pro so far.</p><p dir="ltr">This discovery comes from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1fq8jo5/every_ps5_pro_enhanced_game_confirmed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit user ZXXII</a>, who says they checked "the PS Store page for a new PS5 Pro Enhanced label." GameSpot checked out <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/228748" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">store pages for Fortnite</a>, for example, that showcase a PS5 Pro Enhanced tag. The same is true for Madden NFL 25, EA Sports College Football 25, and Warframe. A full list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5758">every PS5 Pro Enhanced game so far</a> can be seen below:</p><p dir="ltr">The PS5 Pro can apparently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-looks-sharper-and-more-detailed-on-ps5-pro-report/1100-6526560/" data-ref-id="1100-6526560">make games look sharper and more detailed, like with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>. There is also another feature called PS5 Pro Game Boost, which can help titles run at a higher resolution.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/" data-ref-id="1100-6526357">Sony revealed the PS5 Pro for $700</a> earlier this month. The upgraded console is planned to come out in November, with the company saying that 40-50 PS5 Pro Enhanced games should be available at launch. The initial catalog of titles touted for PS5 Pro included Demon's Souls, The First Descendant, and Marvel's Spider-Man 2. Assassin's Creed Shadows will also be supported, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">Ubisoft just delayed the action-adventure game to early 2025</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-time-with-the-ps5-pro-reaffirmed-i-shouldnt-spend-700-right-now-my-base-ps5-is-still-enough/1100-6526684/" data-ref-id="1100-6526684">GameSpot spent time with the PS5 Pro</a> and wasn't necessarily swayed to shell out $700 for the upgraded console. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sold-out-ps5-pro-bundles-are-already-up-on-ebay-and-scalpers-want-to-sell-them-for-thousands/1100-6526729/" data-ref-id="1100-6526729">PS5 Pro

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-real-time-combat-mod-now-allows-party-to-get-involved/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Since the release of Patch 7 for Baldur's Gate 3, the modding scene has been inundated with new projects, as Patch 7 saw the release of the official modding toolkit. As previously covered, one particular modder named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tinybike" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tinybike</a> is working on turning the combat into <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-modder-working-on-real-time-combat-mod/">real-time combat</a>. Originally, they shared a video of how their progress was coming along, and it only showed the main character facing off against an enemy with no sort of party in sight.</p>
<p>There have been many new mods released for Baldur's Gate 3, as well as many being showcased as they are in production. This includes mods such as making new maps, and taking players to lands such as Avernus. This particular mod has been in production since the toolkit came out, and tinybike has released a new YouTube video that shows off the mod in detail, and how the mod has evolved since last time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Real time combat test 3 - companions &amp; timers (Baldur's Gate 3)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C0FBQknd0mU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the description of the one-minute video, TinyBike stated that this was a "very rough draft" and started testing out the companion and ally AI battles in a new campaign on Balanced difficulty. While they've said that this is a rough draft, it still seems rather detailed and actually allows cutscenes to happen without the possibility of imminent death while you're trying to have a conversation. However, the video does take place on the Nautiloid, which doesn't exactly harbor a ton of danger. In the video, the combat is incredibly fast-paced and chaotic, with enemies dying quickly.</p>
<p>"Many people have commented that combat seems really imbalanced, which is 100% true," they stated in a previous test video also posted on their YouTube. Even in the latest test video, this also seems to be true, as combat seems to be swayed in your team's favor. In a previous test video, tinybike commented, saying, "The main challenge right now is that the built-in BG3 combat AI is only accessible during turn-based combat. Just to test things out, I'm using some simple handrolled 'AI' logic, but I suspect this won't work well for more complicated encounters."</p>
<p>The beginning combats are relatively simple to some of the ones that players encounter later on, where it's possible to end up in combat with up to twenty enemies at once. Of course, it only gets harder once you change the difficulty, which would most likely add some extra complications to coding a project as big as this. The project is progressing nicely, but features like multiple attacks, stealth, and initiative all need to be added to this mod.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-survivors-studio-poncle-moves-into-publishing.994374/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-survivors-studio-poncle-publishing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>developer Poncle has announced that it's opening a publishing wing, but it sounds like the indie studio doesn't want to do things the way most traditional publishers do.</p>
<p>Speaking at an investor and publisher event in Liverpool in the UK yesterday (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/vampire-survivor-developer-poncle-opens-publishing-arm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via GamesIndustry.biz</a>), Poncle says that although it's moving into publishing, it doesn't "want IP" in the same way most publishers do.</p>
<p>Instead, Poncle wants to allow developers to "make their games", with the emphasis on "their"; the studio says it wants, in GI.biz writer Vikki Blake's words, to "work more as a label or fund" rather than as a publisher in the traditional sense.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/poncle-vampire-survivors-publisher-gameplay.jpg?itok=UVYz61Sp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/poncle-vampire-survivors-publisher-gameplay.jpg?itok=CiIn3jRt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>dev Poncle is branching out into publishing.</figcaption></figure><p>Poncle says it's looking for games made with "sincerity, passion, and depth", according to the GI.biz report. It'll offer those games support for funding, platforms, localization, and more, as well as development advice.</p>
<p>Additionally, Poncle wants to offer its signings marketing support, helping them to create what Poncle says will be "replayable, affordable, and fun" games, akin to the philosophy that birthed&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>.</p>
<p>However, Poncle also says it doesn't want to sign <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathfinder-gallowspire-survivors-10-release-date">"Survivor-like" games</a>; that's one of the studio's "insta-nos", so if you've got a&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/temtem-swarm-announced-mashing-together-pokemon-like-creatures-and-survivors-style">esque game</a> to pitch, you might want to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>The newly-minted publisher's other major no-nos include Web3 games, as well as anything that uses generative AI and any kind of free-to-play mobile game. It sounds like Poncle's publishing heart is very much in the right place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/soulstone-survivors-gameplay.jpg?itok=l75cprht 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/soulstone-survivors-gameplay.jpg?itok=AxQaScjW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Got a&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-style game to pitch? Don't pitch it to Poncle's new publishing wing.</figcaption></figure><p>Poncle has yet to announce what its first major publishing project will be, but in the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>is still very much firing on all cylinders.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://x.com/poncle_vampire/status/1838926583823831488" rel="noopener" target="_blank">major update "that no-one knows about" for the game</a> is in the works, and&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>is also getting the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-survivors-getting-animated-tv-show" rel="noopener" target="_blank">animated series treatment</a>, although I'm not entirely sure how production company Story Kitchen is going to handle this one. We'll have to wait and see, I suppose.</p>

It’s an unexpected difficulty spike in a game that’s mostly about the simple joys of carving up mob after mob of brutal alien hordes, at least if you’re playing solo with AI-controlled allies.</p><figure id="" data-id="645dc3357e022956dea6d3b8b4600238" data-recommend-id="image://645dc3357e022956dea6d3b8b4600238" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Space Marine fights gargoyles.

In addition to the PVP Sparring Arena, private matchmaking, and ultrawide support on PC, the update tinkers a lot with the AI bots that accompany you during the campaign in single-player. The biggest change is that your space marine brothers will more aggressively aid your during fights without stealing too much glory for themselves:<br></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Various inhibiting restrictions were lifted, allowing bots to be more helpful and effective, while still not beating the game for the player</li><li>Bots will now help focus-firing zoanthropes when the player attacks them.</li><li>Heavily eased restrictions on bots finishing of enemies instead of leaving them for the player, to reduce annoyance.</li><li><strong>Bots are now allowed to help with Gargoyle objectives</strong></li><li>Fixed a variety of bugs related to bots getting stuck</li><li>Fixed a bug where bots can run out of ammo on weapons without a magazine</li></ul></blockquote><p>While this has consequences for the entire campaign, the developers at Saber Interactive specifically call out the Gargoyle objectives. Previously, the AI bots would follow you around and hang back even when the health bar on one of the towers was plunging to zero. Now, they’ll actually join in the fight, similar to if you were playing with real humans. It’s also interesting to see the restriction “heavily eased” on bots finishing off enemies. Brutal finishers are a way to quickly restore your character’s shield in the middle of a tense fight. I’ll be curious to see if that becomes harder with the renewed bloodlust of the bots. </p><p>The rest of the patch deals primarily with bugs and map fixes. It also improves the customization options for dressing up your marine. Operations Mode spawns for Chaos enemies have been nerfed a lot as well, though elsewhere, enemies like the Hive Tyrant have been made more difficult in the regular campaign. A lot more content is on the way for<em> Space Marine 2</em>,&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http:// https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-faq-pvp-spawns-servers-veteran-co-op-1851652630&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http:// https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-faq-pvp-spawns-servers-veteran-co-op-1851652630" target="_blank">including new classes</a></span>, but for now this looks like a nice set of tweaks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/remedy-entertainment-gets-e15-million-loan-from-tencent/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Remedy Entertainment, the developers behind Control and Alana Wake, have entered a loan agreement with Tencent for €15 million ($16.76 million). </p>



<p>The announcement comes <a href="https://news.cision.com/remedy-entertainment-oyj/r/inside-information--remedy-enters-into-a-eur-15-million-convertible-loan-agreement-with-tencent,c4043667" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via press release</a> from Remedy on Friday morning. It’s a move that Remedy CEO Tero Virtala says allows the company to move forward with development of games as well as self-publish future titles.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-remedy-partners-with-annapurna-to-bring-control-and-alan-wake-to-film-and-television">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/remedy-partner-annapurna-control-alan-wake/">Remedy Partners With Annapurna To Bring Control and Alan Wake To Film and Television</a></h6>



<p>“Part of Remedy’s long-term strategy has been to strengthen our position in the value chain, to have more control over how our games are commercialized, and to grow our share of the value these games can create,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As we move towards self-publishing, this financing will support us in developing and fully realizing the potential of the games we have in development and successfully carrying out the commercial activities of our next self-published games. Tencent’s investment demonstrates strong confidence in Remedy’s long-term vision and strategy.”</p>



<p>Remedy currently has a number of games in development, including Control 2 and Control spin-off game Project Condor. The studio is also working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-2-is-now-playable-as-max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake</a> that is in full production.</p>



<p>The convertible loan agreement carries an 8% annual non-cash interest rate that will convert at €27.2($30.40) per share. The price will allow the loan to be converted up to 811,100 new Remedy shares. That represents roughly 5.98% of all shares in the company.</p>



<p>Tencent currently owns 15% of Remedy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-fans-up-in-arms-over-playlist-consolidation-ahead-of-black-ops-6-launch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Activision has been accused of “butchering” the playlists available for battle royale Warzone after developer Raven Software announced a consolidation ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a>.</p><p>Warzone typically rotates different modes, squad sizes, and even maps every week, much to the annoyance of some fans who just want to play the battle royale in their favorite way, or with a specific number of friends.</p><p>With Black Ops 6’s release just a few weeks away, <a href="https://x.com/RavenSoftware/status/1839349500017861077" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raven announced</a> it’s making “preparations” for the future of Warzone. As part of that, has consolidated the current playlist selection into the following:</p><p> • Battle Royale Solos &amp; Quads</p><p> • Resurgence Duos &amp; Quads</p><p>Plunder, Bootcamp, and active Limited-Time Modes will remain available, and Trios will continue to be available via Ranked Play, with the current season ending on Thursday, October 17.</p><p>However, it’s what Warzone has lost, rather than what it now has, that has sparked a backlash from fans, with Duos and Trios no longer available in Battle Royale mode, and Solos and Trios unavailable in Resurgence.</p><p>This means that from now until at least the launch of Black Ops 6 on October 25, Urikztsan (the current Battle Royale map) only supports Solos, Quads, and Plunder Quads, and Resurgence has a Duos and Quads map rotation, with Trios available in Ranked Play only via Rebirth Island (by far the smallest map in the game).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It’s fair to say this announcement has sparked a backlash from Warzone’s hardcore community. “This might be one of the worst decisions I’ve ever seen,” said YouTuber Westie. “You’re essentially sunsetting core branches of your game and giving no real explanation at the time the change is being made.</p><p>“Some added context/information would be wonderful.”</p><p>Here’s some more reaction:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is no Way hahahahah</p>— James - JGOD (@JGODYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/JGODYT/status/1839350258339631537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 isn’t even out you don’t have to butcher the playlists till it drops lil bro🙏😭</p>— HunterTV☄️ (@itsHunterTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/itsHunterTV/status/1839350382679773642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just say you dont want us to play Warzone till BO6 drops… this is hilarious</p>— Chris (@STYLERZ97) <a href="https://twitter.com/STYLERZ97/status/1839358649078362262?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m 100% positive people would rather wait 5 minutes to get into a trios or duos than be forced to play quads man down or with randoms. Worst decision I’ve ever seen. Sheesh.</p>— Ral (@Rallied) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rallied/status/1839360922349097070?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">RIP to the social media guy posting this who had zero influence over this decision 😭 <a href="https://t.co/KwmvHqz3gd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KwmvHqz3gd</a></p>— Isaac (@IceManIsaac) <a href="https://twitter.com/IceManIsaac/status/1839354342027211162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Raven has yet to offer an explanation for its decision, but some are speculating it has to do with a need to maintain fast-filling lobbies amid a perceived shrinking playerbase. Players are also wondering why Raven namechecked the release of Black Ops 6 in its announcement — Warzone is set to incorporate the upcoming shooter’s mechanics, weapons, and gear into the game, but there’s no explanation for why this would require a playlist consolidation.</p><p>For now, Warzone players have no choice but to play with this new, consolidated playlist offering, or, as some are threatening, quit until their favorite ways to play return.</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-is-finally-returning-to-call-of-duty-warzone-and-fans-are-delighted">Activision announced that Warzone is bringing back the map that started it all, Verdansk, in spring 2025</a>. Verdansk is the most beloved map in Warzone’s four-year history, and it returns to the battle royale complete with iconic points of interest such as Stadium, the Train Station, and Superstore. Fans are now hoping their favorite playlists will be available in time for Verdansk’s release.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-and-white-guardian<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Koei Tecmo has announced&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian</em>, a followup to this year's&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana: Forgotten Alchemy and the Polar Night Liberator</em>.</p>
<p>According to Koei Tecmo, the new game will be "a new adventure from the world of&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana</em>", but it'll feature "new protagonists and an original story", so don't expect to follow up with the characters from the previous game.</p>
<p>All we know about&nbsp;<em>The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>so far is that it's currently in development for PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch (sorry once again, Xbox users), and that it's intended to launch next year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-resleriana-the-red-alchemist-and-the-white-guardian-path.jpg?itok=V_03tia3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-resleriana-the-red-alchemist-and-the-white-guardian-path.jpg?itok=oqgzv6fG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>sure looks like an&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>For what it's worth, though, the teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>sure makes it look like an&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<p>It's got all the idyllic locations, mysterious-looking caverns, and wide, sweeping expanses you'd expect from the series, plus plenty of cozy-looking villages.</p>
<p>The new protagonists look like they fit the bill, too; there's a studious-looking anime boy who wears glasses, and a girl with cat ears who looks like she's going to take the role of&nbsp;<em>Atelier</em>'s familiar sassy protagonists.</p>
<p>You can check out the teaser reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>right here. It doesn't give too much away, but we're not expecting the game until next year, so that makes sense.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo says this game will "build on the experiences of the&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>series while also evolving", and also that it'll be "completely offline", so you won't need an online connection to play it.</p>
<p>It's not yet clear whether the game will be a free-to-play title with microtransactions <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/free-to-play-all-star-jrpg-atelier-resleriana-announced-for-west-by-koei-tecmo">like its predecessor</a>, but given that it's totally offline, it sounds like it'll be a premium JRPG instead. Let's hope so!</p>
<p><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch sometime in 2025. Stay tuned for more.</p>

For the past decade and a half, the studio has largely positioned itself as, above all, a maker of games in which choices matter, and that’s extended across multiple series. Both <em>Dragon Age </em>and its space opera franchise, <em>Mass Effect</em>,<em> </em>have given players universe-bending choices that have carried over between games through save data transfers and external apps that let you craft your world state. In <em>The Veilguard</em>, however, only three decisions from previous games will carry over, and that has fans concerned about the sequel’s handling of continuity.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

In this menu, you’ll have the chance to create your version of the Inquisitor, the protagonist of 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. Then you’ll be able to make three key decisions (or report which decisions you made in these situations when playing <em>Inquisition</em>) that will be reflected in the story: who did the Inquisitor romance, did they disband or maintain the titular organization, and are they still friends with Solas, the party-member-turned-antagonist of <em>The Veilguard</em>? Given Solas and the Inquisitor’s past relationship, these will obviously play key parts in how that character reacts to events in <em>The Veilguard</em>, as you won’t be controlling them this time around. But given how many big events have happened throughout three previous games, fans are wondering just how much, if any, impact their previous decisions will have on the story.<br></p><p>In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>, <em>Veilguard</em> creative director John Epler explained that the trimming down of imported choices was partially because the fourth game takes place in a distant region of its universe. <em>The Veilguard </em>is set in northern Thedas, whereas previous games were in the south. So maybe it doesn’t matter whether you ended up with the traditionalist Cassandra or the more progressive Leliana as the church’s leader at the end of <em>Inquisition</em>, because that’s all happening elsewhere.</p><p>On its face, I buy that explanation for why a large swath of choices from previous games are seemingly not brought up in <em>The Veilguard</em>. If BioWare doesn’t bring up these choices in any dialogue or codex entry, does it really matter what, specifically, is going on elsewhere in the world? This approach worked for <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>, which was set in a different galaxy from its predecessors, allowing it to carefully write around which of the galaxy-changing choices you made at the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435">end of <em>Mass Effect 3</em></a></span>. What I and several other fans are left wondering is how this will affect returning characters in <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p><p>There are two major figures in this discussion: The Inquisitor and Morrigan, a party member from the original <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> and a major supporting character in <em>Inquisition</em>. Both characters have been confirmed to return in <em>The Veilguard</em> and both were part of one of the biggest decisions in <em>Inquisition</em>. Near the end of the game, there is a questline in which either the Inquisitor or Morrigan drinks from the Well of Sorrows. This magical well is said to house elven knowledge, but it will come at a price. Regardless of which of the two of you drinks from the well, one of you is forever tied to Mythal, an elven goddess who has possessed Flemeth, Morrigan’s mother.</p><p>Flemeth is seemingly killed and absorbed by Solas at the end of <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> and the decade-long theory has been that Solas may have some kind of magical control of either the Inquisitor or Morrigan after being revealed as a traitor at the end of the game. Now, without the ability to import this decision into <em>The Veilguard</em>, fans worry it might be going absolutely nowhere, which is strange for a game that centers on Solas and the elven gods. The lack of choices that specifically refer to Morrigan is also strange considering she may have a son depending on if the player romanced her in <em>Origins</em> or conducted a ritual to conceive a child in the endgame. In any case, the inability to import any choices pertaining to her has taken fans by surprise.</p><p>The Inquisitor, meanwhile, is one of the biggest question marks leading up to<em> The Veilguard</em>. BioWare has confirmed the character will appear in the game (I may have spent a good 30 minutes trying to recreate mine in the character creator when I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-bioware-rook-solas-rpg-1851648350&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-bioware-rook-solas-rpg-1851648350">played the game earlier this month</a></span>), but has been tight-lipped on what their deal is this time around. But the fact that you only answer three questions about their journey has fans concerned about both the substance of their role in <em>The Veilguard</em> and whether it’s possible for the game to represent all the variations of the hero players have made over the years.</p><p>That’s a tall order, of course. But it understandably matters to players, given that the conflict between the Inquisitor and Solas is one of the most personal in the series. (I’d even argue that they should have still been the protagonist of the game in which you face him, but I digress.) Now, we’ll be meeting a version of our old hero entirely defined by BioWare’s writing team with very little input on our part. If the only questions about them we’re allowed to answer are “Who did they romance?” and “Are they still friends with Solas?” that doesn’t leave a lot of room for nuance. There’s a question now of whether players who weren’t especially invested in Solas are going to get a character who’s a little too different from their own Inquisitor for their comfort level.</p><p>But even if you don’t put the Inquisitor and Morrigan under a microscope, it is questionable that the only choices that seem to have any impact on <em>The Veilguard </em>come from <em>Inquisition</em>. This may make sense in context of the full game, but it does feel diametrically opposed to a series that once let you use an app to import every decision from earlier games, big and small, into <em>Inquisition</em>.</p><p>Though a lot of fans are understandably concerned, others have been more understanding, saying that <em>The Veilguard</em> should focus more on new relationships and choices as they pertain to new protagonist Rook rather than being overly referential. Others are taking the wait-and-see approach, hoping that once the game is actually out these decisions will make better sense in context or that those choices will come up in another <em>Dragon Age </em>project down the line.</p><p>Epler explains that, in selecting which choices <em>The Veilguard </em>would import, the team wanted to pick details that could result in more than just a cameo and some altered dialogue. I could see things like the status of the Inquisition and the Inquisitor’s relationship to Solas having major ramifications, but like many others, I am surprised that some very significant choices aren’t going to be brought up in a game <em>about</em> those related characters and factions. What I played of <em>The Veilguard </em>felt like it had a lot of strong connective tissue between the games of old even without explicitly referencing my choices, but I never met Morrigan or the Inquisitor in my demo. I don’t know how I’ll feel about their roles when all is said and done. We’ll see how it all pans out when <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>launches on October 31.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
