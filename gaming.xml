			<p>One of the best features of Nintendo has been announced that it will be discontinued. This is the Nintendo Gold Points program, where you would be able to<a href="https://wccftech.com/six-weeks-of-activities-discounts-rewards-start-today-on-nintendo-switch/"> accrue Gold Points</a> with digital or physical purchases you made for the Nintendo Switch. However, it's now been announced by Nintendo that the company will be discontinuing the Gold Points program on March 24, 2025. The <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/67660#s1q4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official statement</a> is available on the Nintendo website, where the details of the discontinuation are listed. While points won't be added to your total after March 24, you will have a year to redeem the points you've stored or 12 months from the purchase date of the item.</p>
<p>This is the typical amount of time that Gold Points were available for previously, with them expiring after a year. So, while Nintendo is discontinuing the points program, you won't lose them early. However, if you forget to use them or simply decide not to use them, they will be removed from your account after the expiration date.</p>
<p>Up until March 24, you are still able to earn Gold Points if you redeem your physical product or if you purchase a digital product. After this date, consumers won't earn Gold Points from purchasing digital content.</p>
<p>After the cut-off date, Nintendo has also noted that "some retailers may continue to sell Nintendo eShop cards that disclose earning Gold Points." However, this will not be the case. You will still be able to purchase and redeem the Nintendo eShop cards as normal, but you won't earn any Gold Points when using the cards for purchases.</p>
<p>For those who pre-ordered digital content or purchased a physical copy of a game that would typically come with Gold Points, the specified amount of Gold Points will be available for the consumers as long as the purchases and pre-orders were made before the cut-off date. Physical games that were released on or before March 24 will also still be eligible to earn the Nintendo Gold Points, even if the game was purchased after the cut-off date. However, if the game was released after the cut off date, you will not be able to get the Gold Points.</p>
<p>It's not been specified by Nintendo as to why the company has decided to discontinue the Nintendo Gold Points program, which was utilized by many. However, the Platinum Points will continue to be available, which was a significantly less beneficial program than those of the Gold Points.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/konami-to-raise-base-domestic-employee-salary-for-fourth-consecutive-year.1113225/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-raising-salary-fourth-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced that it will raise base employee salaries in its home country of Japan for the fourth consecutive year.</p>

<p>In a news <a href="https://www.konami.com/news/ja/release/2025/0219/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website (for which we're using machine translation, since the original post is in Japanese), Konami says it will raise employee base salaries for all "full-time employees at domestic group companies" in order to create a "rewarding work environment".</p>

<p>Not only that, but new graduates' starting salaries will be raised from 300,000 yen to 305,000 yen per month. The changes will take effect starting from March 2026, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-salary-increase" rel="nofollow">last year's base salary increase</a> set to go into effect next month.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/konami-salary-increase-2026-silent-hill-2.jpg?itok=7X2dlvbK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/konami-salary-increase-2026-silent-hill-2.jpg?itok=iUPKDcjC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Konami had a pretty good year last year thanks to&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Konami says that its staff are the "source" of its "competitive edge", and that by increasing salaries, the company is hoping to "improve employee engagement and continue to strive to create better products and services".</p>

<p>As with last year, Konami does add the proviso that "some domestic group companies and some job types are not included", but it doesn't go into detail regarding which jobs these are.</p>

<p>All in all, Konami had a pretty solid 2024, it seems. The&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake was released in October last year, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">sell a million copies</a> within its first three days on launch and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">reaching two million</a> as of late January.</p>

<p>Not only that, but in October, FIFA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fifa-konami-esports-partner" rel="nofollow">picked Konami as its new esports partner</a> after the organization's well-publicized split with EA, although it's worth noting that this doesn't mean Konami will be developing whatever FIFA's&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC&nbsp;</em>competitor turns out to be.</p>

<p>Set to launch in August (as revealed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-recap-february-2025" rel="nofollow">the State of Play presentation last week</a>), the game represents the first major entry in the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>series since 2018's&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Survive&nbsp;</em>(discounting 2023's&nbsp;<em>Master Collection</em>).</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/615075/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-review-test-benchmark</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/615075/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-review-test-benchmark<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia’s new RTX 5070 Ti graphics card is the most intriguing entry in the 50-series lineup so far, promising to outperform last-gen cards that were even more expensive. At $749, it comfortably beats AMD’s $899 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499697/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xt-xtx-review-benchmarks-price">RX 7900 XT</a>, trades blows with the $999 RX 7900 XTX, and is closer than I was expecting to Nvidia’s own $999 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5080</a>. It’s a capable card for a relatively good price, and that makes the RTX 5070 Ti an ideal choice if you’re tempted to move to 4K gaming or want a card that can deliver high frame rates for 1440p. </p><p>But like the rest of the 50-series cards, the RTX 5070 Ti is not as much of an upgrade as we’ve come to expect from Nvidia. The card is around 14 percent faster at 4K than the last-generation <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23538558/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-review-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">RTX 4070 Ti</a> and 22 percent faster at 1440p. It’s nearly as fast as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24055394/nvidia-rtx-4080-super-review-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">RTX 4080 Super</a>, which launched at $999, and it’s more than 80 percent faster at 4K than the two-generations-old RTX 3070 Ti. Those are decent numbers, but it’s mostly because the 40 series was such a big leap. </p><p>All of this makes the RTX 5070 Ti a good deal at its $749 MSRP, but only if it stays there — and prices are already going up.</p><p><em>Editor’s note: We aren’t scoring the RTX 5070 Ti until the pricing situation is clear at launch on February 20th.</em></p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->749</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>RTX 4080 levels of performance</li><li>Power draw isn’t significantly higher than the RTX 40 series</li><li>$50 less than the RTX 4070 Ti</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>I wish it had more than 16GB of VRAM</li><li>Not a huge performance boost over the RTX 4070 Ti</li><li>Unlikely to stay at $749 MSRP</li></ul></div></div></div><div><p id="1440p-and-4k-benchmarks"><h2>1440p and 4K benchmarks</h2></p></div><p>I’ve been testing MSI’s RTX 5070 Ti Ventus 3X OC edition, which looks almost identical to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24046652/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-super-review-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">RTX 4070 Ti Super I reviewed last year</a>. MSI’s tried-and-true Ventus 3X OC cards use a triple-fan layout with a copper baseplate and heat pipes to cool the GPU and memory modules. </p><p>For both my 4K and 1440p testing, I paired MSI’s RTX 5070 Ti with AMD’s latest Ryzen 9 9800X3D processor and Asus’ 32-inch 4K OLED PG32UCDP monitor. I also put the RTX 5070 Ti up against the $999 RTX 5080 — the next step up in the RTX 50 series — as well as the RTX 4080, RTX 4070 Ti, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and AMD’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499697/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xt-xtx-review-benchmarks-price">Radeon RX 7900 XT</a>.</p><p>The RTX 5070 Ti delivers what you’d expect from a modern GPU: playable frame rates at both 4K and 1440p with all the settings maxed out. While the hardware isn’t quite as sleek as Nvidia’s Founders Edition cards, MSI’s GPU will fit well into most gaming rigs.</p><p>Without DLSS or ray tracing enabled, the RTX 5070 Ti is nearly 13 percent faster than the RTX 4070 Ti Super at 4K and 1440p, enough to make it practically identical to the RTX 4080 at 4K and not far behind at 1440p. You could even overclock the RTX 5070 Ti with the click of a button in Nvidia’s app or by using MSI’s Afterburner utility and get slightly ahead of the RTX 4080 Super. </p><p>The RTX 5070 Ti makes for a great 1440p experience and solid 4K gaming, especially if you’re willing to turn the settings down slightly or overclock the card to squeeze out a little more performance. The next step up in the RTX 50-series line, the $999 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5080</a>, is around 12 percent faster than the $749 RTX 5070 Ti at 1440p and around 15 percent faster at 4K resolution — but you have to pay an extra 33 percent in cash for not much more performance.</p><p>The RTX 5070 Ti, much like the RTX 5080, makes the most sense if you’re upgrading from the RTX 30-series models or earlier. At 4K without DLSS or ray tracing, the RTX 5070 Ti is nearly 84 percent faster than the RTX 3070 Ti. It will be a noticeable upgrade if you’re using an RTX 30-series card or older, and you’ll also get access to Nvidia’s Frame Generation technology.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22524897/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-ti-review-test-benchmarks">Nvidia’s RTX 3070 Ti</a>, which launched in 2021, was only suitable for very entry-level 4K gaming, in part because it shipped with just 8GB of VRAM. The limitations were especially noticeable in the <em>Forza Motorsport</em> benchmark, where the RTX 3070 Ti averaged a measly 33fps compared to the 109fps on the RTX 5070 Ti.</p><p>I’m hoping we won’t see those same limitations further down the line with the RTX 5070 Ti’s 16GB of VRAM. The original RTX 4070 Ti only had 12GB of VRAM, which Nvidia bumped up to 16GB with the RTX 4070 Ti Super. If there was a little more VRAM on the RTX 5070 Ti, then it would help avoid any video memory limits at 4K gaming in the future.</p><div><p id="dlss-4-and-multi-frame-gen"><h2><strong>DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Gen</strong></h2></p></div><p>I’ve also been testing DLSS 4 and Nvidia’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337402/nvidia-dlss-4-upscaling-announcement-ces-2025">Multi Frame Generation technology</a> with the RTX 5070 Ti. Multi Frame Gen uses the latest AI graphics models, powered by an updated transformer architecture, to generate up to three additional frames per traditionally rendered frame, pushing the RTX 5070’s frame rates beyond what it’s normally capable of at 4K and 1440p. </p><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> has been a great test title for DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Gen, demonstrating how Nvidia’s new technique can provide motion clarity improvements with higher frame rates. Without DLSS 4, <em>Cyberpunk </em>runs at an unplayable 15fps average with ultra settings and full ray tracing enabled on the RTX 5070 Ti at 4K resolution. I was able to push that all the way up to 110fps thanks to 4x Multi Frame Gen.</p><p>As I’ve argued in my previous RTX 50-series reviews, this still doesn’t feel like a real 110fps because it maintains the same input latency it has after DLSS Super Resolution is applied. Super Resolution renders the game at a lower resolution and then uses AI to upscale it — in this case, from 15fps to 33fps. Multi Frame Gen then creates the three extra frames to make the motion of gameplay look smoother, but it still feels like a sluggish 33fps, so it’s less reactive than a real 110fps when you hit a button or click to shoot.</p><p>DLSS Multi Frame Gen still makes the most sense at 1440p with the RTX 5070 Ti, simply because the base frame rates (once Super Resolution is applied) are high enough to make the input latency less of an issue.</p><p>While there still aren’t many games that support Multi Frame Gen and DLSS 4, you can force these techniques on with Nvidia’s new app. DLSS 4’s new transformer model even works on existing RTX cards, so you’ll get the benefits of improved image quality if you force DLSS 4 on in games before developers have patched them. </p><p>Like the rest of the RTX 50 series, the RTX 5070 Ti is also a capable card if you want to do video editing or run AI workloads. I found that the RTX 5070 Ti was nearly 14 percent faster than the previous RTX 4070 Ti in PugetBench’s DaVinci Resolve test and Procyon’s AI XL (FP16) test.</p><div><p id="power-draw-and-heat"><h2><strong>Power draw and heat</strong></h2></p></div><p>Nvidia recommends a 750-watt power supply for the RTX 5070 Ti, which is only 50 watts more than for the RTX 4070 Ti and 4070 Ti Super. The 300W total graphics power is just 15 watts more than the 4070 Ti.</p><p>At 4K resolution, the RTX 5070 Ti averaged 271 watts across the nine games tested — a little more than the 245-watt average draw of the RTX 4070 Ti but less than the RTX 4080’s 282W average for almost identical performance.</p><p>I only noticed the RTX 5070 Ti hit its max power draw of 300 watts during the <em>Metro Exodus</em> extreme benchmark, and it also maintained the exact same max GPU temperature (68 degrees Celsius) of the RTX 4080 in my open bench testing. It’s great to see Nvidia hasn’t massively increased power or cooling requirements here. </p><p>The RTX 5070 Ti continues the 50-series trend of modest generational improvements. At 1440p, the RTX 5070 Ti delivers a good deal more performance than the RTX 4070 Ti and 4070 Ti Super, but I was really hoping for more at 4K. That would have pushed this firmly past the RTX 4080 and 4080 Super to make 4K gaming even more affordable.</p><p>Whether the RTX 5070 Ti is a good value will come down to pricing and availability. Without a Founders Edition to put pressure on board partner pricing, I think it’s going to be very hard to find an RTX 5070 Ti at $749. Micro Center is <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?N=0&amp;NTX=mode+MatchPartial&amp;NTT=5070+ti&amp;NTK=all&amp;sortby=pricelow">already listing</a> overclocked models at $999, the same price as the RTX 5080, and only a single card is listed at $749 out of the 12 available. Nvidia insisted that the MSI card we tested has an MSRP of $749, though it was listed as $909 at Micro Center just hours before this review went live. </p><p>I suspect it will come down to availability, too. It looks like there’s a real shortage of GPUs in the market. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603863/nvidia-rtx-5090-out-of-stock-paper-launch">RTX 5090 was barely in stock</a>, and restocks are rare right now. Even the RTX 5080 is sold out at most places, and one retailer in the UK says it won’t be getting more for at least six weeks, with some models even further out. 40-series Nvidia cards and AMD’s 7900 XT series also look thin on the ground.</p><p>AMD might help with keeping pricing under control, as long as it has stock available. It’s about to enter the market with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336246/amd-radeon-rx-9070-series-rdna-4-fsr-4-ces-2025">two new GPUs</a> that look like they’re going to compete directly with Nvidia’s RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070. Nvidia has even delayed the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612650/nvidia-delays-rtx-5070-after-amd-9070">debut of its RTX 5070 until March</a>, which suggests a GPU pricing battle is about to take place at this important part of the market. </p><p>The RTX 5070 Ti is a good purchase if you can actually get one at $749, but it might be worth waiting a few weeks to see how AMD’s performance, price, and availability shape up against Nvidia’s latest GPU.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That isn’t to say it’s pointless. <strong>You <em>can</em> feasibly defeat Lu Bu when you first see him, and it has a significant effect on the rest of the level if you manage to pull it off</strong>. But no matter how you slice it, the only real reason you should fight Lu Bu early on is the satisfaction of telling everyone you meet that you did it.</p><p>There is a bit more to all of this, though. So if you want to get into the weeds of Lu Bu’s appearance in Chapter 2, here’s the full breakdown.</p><figure id="" data-id="1426b22cf6ae30dbefe71e1ca93ba787" data-recommend-id="image://1426b22cf6ae30dbefe71e1ca93ba787" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors Origins.

You’re quite silly to try. But since you’re here, if you want to fight Lu Bu come hell or high water, here are a few tips to help you claim victory:</p><p>1: All of Lu Bu’s attacks have elaborate telegraphs. For example, it’s impossible to miss when he jumps into the air and gets ready to use his dive attack, and the timing to perfect dodge it is the same every time. Conversely, Lu Bu leaves himself open after he finishes his attacks, which gives you windows to start piling on damage before you need to watch out for his next move.</p><p>2: You might get tripped up by Lu Bu’s two unique attacks that start with him swinging his halberd in front of him. Normally, he’ll attack twice in a row, so the safest move is to dodge away to avoid the second attack. However, if he glows red, he’ll only take a single swing. Use this to your advantage.</p><p>3: Lu Bu’s most difficult attack to dodge is his bow and arrow move. Lu Bu will attack twice in a wide-reaching cone in front of him, and after a delay he’ll launch one final attack at you. Since you can stagger Lu Bu during this attack, you’ll ideally want to use a skill like Palm Strike so you don’t have to worry about dodging at all. However, if that’s not possible, using a quick special move (like Palm Strike, actually) after you dodge the first strike will interrupt the dodge roll animation, allowing you to immediately dodge the second part of the attack. From there, Lu Bu will finish the attack about 2.5 seconds later.</p><p>If you’d like a visual aid, an especially handsome writer uploaded his first clear of this fight on Hero difficulty, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/dynasty-warriors-origins-goaded-me-into-spending-an-hour-trying-to-beat-lu-bu-then-gave-me-nothing-for-winning-and-i-loved-it/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/dynasty-warriors-origins-goaded-me-into-spending-an-hour-trying-to-beat-lu-bu-then-gave-me-nothing-for-winning-and-i-loved-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as seen on PC Gamer</a></span>. You can check out the video for yourself below:</p><h2 id="h10429"><a id=""></a><strong>What happens if you defeat Lu Bu?</strong></h2><p>If you defeat Lu Bu in the Assassination of Dong Zhuo mission, both Lu Bu and Cao Cao will react to your surprising strength. Lu Bu will retreat, and the entire enemy army will suffer a huge morale loss that will make the rest of the mission a total cakewalk. In other words, you take on a huge challenge at the start to make the rest of the mission easier.</p><p>This is true of Lu Bu’s second appearance in Chapter 2 during the Battle of Hulao Gate mission. Normally, Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei will hold off Lu Bu shortly after he appears. However, if you defeat Lu Bu here, Liu Bei’s party can rejoin the main battle and you won’t have to worry about how long they can fend off the beast of a man. So, again, a huge challenge so you can make the rest of the mission easier.</p><figure id="" data-id="8ac66eb86200cb93385d014610fd28b0" data-recommend-id="image://8ac66eb86200cb93385d014610fd28b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors Origins.

This will only ding on <em>this </em>mission specifically, so beating Lu Bu during the Assassination of Dong Zhuo mission <strong>will not</strong> unlock it.</p><p>That said, <strong>not only can you go back to this mission during the postgame of <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, you’ll need to beat Lu Bu here on a postgame-exclusive difficulty setting to unlock one of the strongest weapons in the game</strong>.</p><hr><p>While there aren’t compelling rewards for beating Lu Bu early on beyond the sheer satisfaction and achivement, it is a good opportunity to get some practice in against him. You <em>will </em>have to fight Lu Bu later on, and these earlier appearances have simpler movesets that you can study and learn. This will make future Lu Bu encounters go a little smoother, since you can focus on dodging the stuff you’ve memorized while you pay attention to the new tricks he has up his sleeve. You can also choose to lower the difficulty or level up if Lu Bu is giving you trouble too, so play your way and don’t stress out about missing anything important!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To release and support The Last of Us Online we’d have to put all our studio resources behind supporting post launch content for years to come, severely impacting development on future single-player games. So, we had two paths in front of us: become a solely live service games studio or continue to focus on single-player narrative games that have defined Naughty Dog’s heritage.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naughty Dog went on to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-heads-to-space-with-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-the-game-awards-2024">announce single-player adventure Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet at The Game Awards 2024</a>, its first new franchise in over a decade.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Naughty Dog Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, speaking to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sacred-symbols-122597374" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sacred Symbols+</a> (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/yoshida-i-played-the-last-of-us-online-and-it-was-great" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Square</a>), Shuhei Yoshida touched on the internal decision-making that led to The Last of Us Online’s cancelation, saying feedback from Destiny developer Bungie, which Sony had acquired, helped to convince Naughty Dog to scrap the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The idea for The Last of Us Online came from Naughty Dog and they really wanted to make it,” Yoshida said. “But Bungie explained [to them] what it takes to make live service games, and Naughty Dog realised, ‘Oops, we can’t do that! If we do it, we can’t make Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.’ So that was a lack of foresight.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This tallies with prior reports that indicated Naughty Dog had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-needs-more-time-naughty-dog"><u>scaled back</u></a> development of The Last of Us Online due to an internal review from Bungie. In October 2023, Naughty Dog reportedly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dogs-troubled-the-last-of-us-multiplayer-spin-off-reportedly-on-ice-amid-layoffs"><u>suffered a round of layoffs</u></a> and that the multiplayer project was “put on ice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cancelation of The Last of Us Online came as part of a sweeping pull back from live service at Sony Interactive Entertainment following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstations-10-live-service-games-will-be-from-different-genres-and-for-different-audiences">a huge internal push to make more of these types of games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Arrowhead’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> was a breakout hit, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks, Sony’s other live service games were either canceled or suffered disastrous launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s live service hero shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a> is one of the biggest video game disasters in PlayStation history, lasting just a couple of weeks before it was brought offline amid eye-wateringly low player numbers. Sony later decided to kill the game entirely and shut its developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concord's initial development deal was around $200 million according to a report by <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kotaku</u></a>. It said the $200 million was not enough to fund Concord's entire development, nor did it include the purchase of the Concord IP rights or Firewalk Studios itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And just last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony canceled two unannounced live service games</u></a>, one a God of War title in development at Bluepoint, the other in the works at Days Gone developer Bend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a prior interview, Yoshida, who was President of SIE Worldwide Studios for Sony Interactive Entertainment from 2008 to 2019, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-wouldve-tried-to-resist-sonys-live-service-push">said he would have tried to resist Sony’s controversial live service video game push</a> and that Sony always knew its investment in live service games was risky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, speaking to Sacred Symbols+, Yoshida said that as far as he was aware, no first-party PlayStation Studio was forced to make a live service game. Rather they saw an opportunity to successfully pitch a live service game given Sony’s video game strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“From my experience, when studios see the company has a big initiative, [they realise] riding on that gives them a better chance of getting a project approved and supported,” Yoshida said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s not like [current PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst] is telling teams they need to make live service games, it’s likely mutual.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of Sony’s live service push and pull is hundreds of millions of dollars wasted, widespread layoffs, studio closures, and years of work that will never see the light of day. Developers face enormous gaps in their CVs with nothing to show for it, and PlayStation 5 looks set for a light period for first-party games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there are a number of PlayStation Studios live service games Sony has yet to cancel, including Guerrilla’s multiplayer Horizon project, Bungie’s extraction shooter Marathon, and the multiplayer heist game Fairgames.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Composer Jack Wall wrote the music for Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2, but he did not return for Mass Effect 3 and has not worked with developer BioWare since. What gives? We don't know the whole story, but Wall said in an interview that Mass Effect director Casey Hudson "was not particularly happy with me at the end."</p><p>Despite that, Wall told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/feb/14/the-making-of-mass-effect-2-music-soundtrack" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a> he was "so proud" of the score for that game, going on to note that it received a BAFTA nomination, even if the game overall "didn't go as well as [Hudson] wanted." The music for Mass Effect 3 was written by a team including Sascha Dikiciyan, Sam Hulick, Christopher Lennertz, Cris Velasco, and Clint Mansell.</p><p>Discussing what sounded like a strained relationship with Hudson, Wall admitted, "Fallouts like that happen; it's just part of the deal." This type of working experience was a rarity for Wall, though. "It's one of the few times in my career that's happened, and it was a tough time, but it is what it is," he said.</p><p>As for Hudson, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-key-bioware-leads-leave-the-studio/1100-6485118/" data-ref-id="1100-6485118">he left BioWare after the disappointing launch of Anthem.</a> He started a studio that was making a new IP before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-veterans-new-studio-which-was-making-aaa-sci-fi-game-is-shutting-down/1100-6528039/" data-ref-id="1100-6528039">the game was canceled and the studio shut down. </a></p><p>Also in the interview, Wall discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-2-suicide-mission-how-to-get-the-best-ending/1100-6491482/" data-ref-id="1100-6491482">Mass Effect 2's much-heralded Suicide Mission</a>, saying helping put it together was the "biggest mind-f**king thing I've ever done in my entire life." He said the developers were "freaking out trying to finish the game," so he didn't have much help on the music side. But he praised the developers at BioWare for turning in something special in the end.</p><p>"They had to do a lot of massaging on their end in order to get it to work, but they did it … and the result is still one of the best ending sequences to a game that I've ever played. It was worth all that effort," he said.</p><p>After Mass Effect 2, Wall began his work on the Call of Duty series, starting with 2015's Black Ops 3. He also wrote music for Black Ops 4, Black Ops Cold War, Call of Duty: Vanguard, 2023's Modern Warfare 3, and Black Ops 6 most recently.</p><p>As for the Mass Effect series, BioWare is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">now working on the next entry in the franchise</a>.

            <p>
Streaming giant Netflix has laid off staff at Oxenfree developer Night School Studio.
</p>
<p>
According to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">Game Developer</a>, an unspecified number of workers were told their services were no longer required last month, which came as a shock to the indie games company.
</p>
<p>
Netflix declined to comment on the report.
</p>
<p>
Best known for its Oxenfree games, Night School Studio was bought by Netflix in 2021 as part of the streaming giant's ongoing plans to expand into interactive entertainment. 
</p>
<p>
Night School Studio's first game Oxenfree was acclaimed upon its initial launch in 2016. The side-scrolling narrative adventure story featured a group of teens caught up in some creepy sci-fi shenanigans, and received praise for its dialogue and atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
The studio's 2019 follow-up Afterparty, about a character who tried to best Satan in a drinking game, did not seem to hit the same level of recognition. In 2023, Night School Studio returned to Oxenfree with a direct sequel - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-one-restless-night-of-mysteries">Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals, which was well received</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's currently unclear what Night School Studio is working on next, though today's report states that the company's layoffs will not change its product pipeline.
</p>
<p>
In October 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-closes-aaa-internal-studio-led-by-halo-creative-head-joseph-staten">Netflix closed a major internal game studio led by Halo creative head Joseph Staten</a>, and seemingly scrapped its big budget game before it was ever announced.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-celebrates-its-biggest-quarter-yet-by-putting-uk-prices-up-again">Netflix celebrated its biggest quarterly subscriber increase in history by increasing UK prices yet again</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-preview-%E2%80%93-the-last-great-wii-u-switch-port.1113192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/19/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-preview-the-last-great-wii-u-switch-port/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Xenoblade franchise has weaved an unusual path through Nintendo’s recent history, each new entry in the series being both separate and at once part of the greater whole. While Switch fans have been treated to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/05/27/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-review-future-connected-switch/">Definitive version of the original game</a>, two <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-2-review/">stellar</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/26/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review/">sequels</a>, and even <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/09/21/xenoblade-chronicles-2-torna-the-golden-country-review/">a whole game’s worth of DLC</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review/">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> has remained an oddity that, until now, remained cast out on the commercially unsuccessful Wii U.</p>
<p>However, the entire Xenoblade franchise will now be available in one place, with Xenoblade Chronicles X arriving as a swan song to the Nintendo Switch. That’s nice, because it’s one of the greatest RPG stories of our time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition — The Year is 2054 — Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ah9JgFGdqWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X is, in itself, an atypical example of the franchise. While the rest of the series feel like a merging of fantasy and sci-fi, Chronicles X leans far more heavily on science fiction, creating a universe-spanning adventure that sees humanity stranded on an alien planet.</p>
<p>Earth was caught up in a battle between two titanic extraterrestrial foes, forcing the survivors to escape on giant colony ships, with alien foes destroying many of humanity’s last hopes. Your ship, the White Whale, made an initial escape, but was soon brought down to an alien world filled with danger. At the opening, you’re busted out of your escape pod by soldier Elma, and you make your way to the city while learning the ropes of the game’s combat and basic systems.</p>

<p>Anyone that’s played the original Xenoblade Chronicles will recognise the action palette running across the bottom of the screen. You can set up to eight different arts here for your character to utilise, many of which will have different effects and interplay between one another, helping you to cause massive damage if they’re used in the right order. It’s an MMO-influenced system that I’ve loved since the original game, and it still works fantastically here.</p>

<p>Set in our future, Xenoblade Chronicles X feels more grounded and realistic than the other Xenoblade titles. The lost colony and the city of New Los Angeles within it, showcase a community trying to hang onto the trappings of their home, despite having crash-landed in the midst of a hostile and utterly alien world.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition has taken a sensible approach to remastering, and right from the the outset, the performance is much better than it was on the Wii U. It’s not gone crazy with improvements to the visuals or changes to make the art direction more cohesive, though this is the sharpest and clearest the game has ever looked. The scale and design of the world remain the key highlights, and though the contrast between realism and fiction might surprise people who’ve only ever played the central trilogy, it’s nonetheless an attractive and engaging experience.</p>
<p>There’s a further contrast in the different musical styles that the soundtrack hops between, one moment rock, the next hip hop, before settling into the swells of a vocal orchestra. I’ve always loved the weird, almost irrational approach to audio in Xenoblade Chronicles X, and it has continued to delight, even if, at times, it feels as though it might have been slightly more of-the-moment than I realised.</p>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X does make you wait for one of its best, and most integral features, the giant mech suits known as Skells. These huge units open the world up, being able to transform between their central robotic form and a super-fast wheeled vehicle, while giving you the firepower to get past Mira’s most powerful foes. It’s a treat you have to earn though, and you’ll be chomping at the bit to get your hands on one.</p>
<p>Thanks to its launch on the Wii U, and its change in outlook and direction from the original game, Xenoblade Chronicles X has always been the series’ outlier. However, it’s one of the most exciting and untamed RPG worlds, has a great story to tell, and fully deserves for its charms to be discovered by more players. Thankfully, that time is nearly here.</p>

			<p>Infold Games has confirmed that its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/infinity-nikki-what-dreams-are-made-of/">cozy open-world adventure gacha game</a>, Infinity Nikki, will be making its way to Steam. This is an ongoing effort from the developers to help make the game more accessible to a wider audience, as well as continue its efforts to engage with its community. For those who are excited about Infinity Nikki, the game is already available to wishlist on Steam. At the moment, there isn't a set release date for when the title will be playable via Steam, but it will be coming in the future.</p>
<p>Since the game was initially released on December 5, 2024, Infinity Nikki has taken the gaming world by storm. Players worldwide have been gathering in Mirawish to unlock new outfits and complete the story. So far, there have been over 20 million downloads worldwide. With the release of the game on Steam, that number will surely grow, with more players being able to access Infinity Nikki for the first time. The Steam version will also include seamless integration with the Infold account system, which will allow players to access their accounts and continue their progress across all available platforms.</p>
<p>Once the game is released on Steam, players will have access to the full range of features, which includes achievements, controller support, and social integration. Thus far, there is no mention on the Steam page about whether this game will be playable on Steam Deck, or whether there will be plans to make the game compatible with the Steam Deck at a later date.</p>
<p>Since its launch, Infinity Nikki has been incredibly popular, receiving critical acclaim for the blend of gameplay, merging dress-up gameplay with open-world questing, platforming, and puzzles along the way. Players will get to explore the expansive world of Miraland, where there are beautiful landscapes providing many opportunities for virtual photography, along with some fun and simple combat. Players can also expect to solve puzzles to get Whimstars, get to fuss over adorable pets, and uncover some of Miraland's hidden secrets, such as the paper cranes and ghost trains.</p>
<p>Updates are released frequently for Infinity Nikki, adding new outfits, quests, and banners to pull from for those who engage with the gacha mechanics. The game is entirely free to play, with optional microtransactions that have the potential to provide you with more outfits and customization for Nikki.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Infinity Nikki once it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164330/Infinity_Nikki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releases on Steam</a>? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oxenfree-night-school-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>developer Night School has been hit by layoffs, although how many staff have been affected by the move is unclear at the moment.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>, an "undisclosed number of employees" have been laid off at Night School, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-acquires-oxenfree-developer-studio" rel="nofollow">acquired by parent company Netflix</a> back in 2021 as part of a wider expansion into the gaming industry.</p>

<p>While the layoffs apparently won't affect the games Night School is currently working on, Game Developer says that "current and former Night School employees" were "shocked" by the layoffs, which were revealed to the team in January.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oxenfree-2-night-school-layoffs.jpg?itok=lUgP6FZk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oxenfree-2-night-school-layoffs.jpg?itok=8CbhHT5D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Night School is best known for the&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>games.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite these layoffs, Night School <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/night-school-studio_come-make-some-rad-games-with-us-were-hiring-activity-7297698599251910657-OACv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted on LinkedIn just yesterday</a> that it's hiring a lead artist, a game director, and a senior producer, which probably isn't going to be particularly comforting to those who have been let go.</p>

<p>Game Developer says that Netflix declined to comment on the situation, so these layoffs haven't officially been confirmed by Night School's parent company, but a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stephanie-bedford-pmp_opentowork-activity-7297678853500506112-exik" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">couple</a> of ex-Night School <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7290496710072512512/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">employees</a> have posted about the situation on LinkedIn within the past couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Night School isn't the only studio to be targeted by Netflix's apparent desire to slim down its gaming industry presence in recent months. Back in October, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">reportedly shut down star-studded AAA studio "Team Blue"</a>,&nbsp; which counted luminaries like&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>'s Joseph Staten and&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>'s Chacko Sonny among its ranks.</p>

<p>That was shortly before Netflix announced it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">go all-in on generative AI</a> for its gaming division, appointing a dedicated AI VP in Mike Verdu, who previously worked as Netflix's overall gaming VP.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/night-school-layoffs-afterparty.jpg?itok=1viJV-PD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/night-school-layoffs-afterparty.jpg?itok=BM0dRAh8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Night School also developed 2020's supernatural adventure comedy&nbsp;<em>Afterparty</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Frustratingly, Netflix has never been particularly transparent when it comes to its gaming metrics, so we don't know exactly why these layoffs are happening.</p>

<p>We can, however, assume that it's probably part of a wider industry trend that has also seen studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/liquid-swords-layoffs-just-cause-creator" rel="nofollow">Liquid Swords</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumbleverse-and-killer-instct-studio-iron-galaxy-suffers-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Iron Galaxy</a>, and even bigger companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">BioWare</a>&nbsp;letting staff go in recent months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/annapurna-interactive-showcase-february-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Annapurna Interactive has announced that it will hold a new Showcase presentation next week, showing off some of its upcoming games as well as some extra "surprises".</p>

<p>The studio, which has published indie hits like&nbsp;<em>Outer Wilds&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em>, will air its latest Annapurna Interactive Showcase on February 24th at 9am Pacific (that's around 12pm Eastern and about 5pm GMT).</p>

<p>According to a press release, the presentation will include information on upcoming 2025 Annapurna releases. Games getting more info include cozy adventure&nbsp;<em>Wanderstop</em>, cycling game&nbsp;<em>Wheel World</em>, and photography sim&nbsp;<em>Lushfoil</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wheel-world-annapurna-interactive-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=fp3sKS3O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wheel-world-annapurna-interactive-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=NSeGa89k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Annapurna will reveal new info about some of its upcoming projects next week.</figcaption></figure><p>We'll also get to learn more about FPS&nbsp;<em>Skin Deep</em>, "procedurally generated audiovisual experience"&nbsp;<em>Faraway</em>, and&nbsp;<em>to a T</em>, the 3D narrative adventure designed by&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>creator Keita Takahashi, as well as creature-collecting roguelite <i>Morsels</i>.</p>

<p>All of this will come alongside "a few more surprises", as Annapurna says, so if you're a fan of offbeat indie games, you're not going to want to miss this one. The showcase is set to air on Annapurna's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AnnapurnaInteractive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> and will last around 30 minutes.</p>

<p>This will be Annapurna's first major showcase since a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/annapurna-interactive-staff-resign-after-company-spin-off-talks-fail" rel="nofollow">mass staff exodus at the studio</a> back in September, which took place after negotiations with the main Annapurna company to spin the interactive division off into its own entity broke down.</p>

<p>Following that, a report emerged in January this year which claimed that ex-Annapurna staff had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-annapurna-staff-private-division-ips" rel="nofollow">banded together to form their own company</a>, and that their first purchase was the former Take-Two indie <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-private-division-sale" rel="nofollow">publishing outfit Private Division</a>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out the new Annapurna Interactive Showcase when it airs on February 24th at 9am Pacific. Stay tuned for more.</p>

It first released via a five-day early access period for those who pre-ordered the premium edition. But that ended on February 18. </p><h2 id="h2234055"><a id=""></a><strong>Where can I play <em>Avowed</em>? </strong></h2><p><em>Avowed </em>is out now on PC and Xbox Series X/S.</p><h2 id="h2234056"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Avowed </em>On PS5?</strong></h2><p>Nope! But I’d bet a dollar that it will arrive on PS5 in the future. Obsidian’s next RPG, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gematsu.com/2024/12/the-outer-worlds-2-adds-ps5-version-launches-in-2025&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/12/the-outer-worlds-2-adds-ps5-version-launches-in-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, is coming to PS5 in 2025</a></span>. And Xbox is bringing many of its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-ceo-phil-spencer-console-wars-over-ps5-switch-era-1851765304&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ceo-phil-spencer-console-wars-over-ps5-switch-era-1851765304">old and new games to PS5</a></span>. So <em>Avowed </em>will likely arrive on Sony’s console one day.</p><h2 id="h2234057"><a id=""></a><strong>Will <em>Avowed </em>be on Switch 2? </strong></h2><p>No port has been announced. But if the Switch 2 can run it, I’d expect Xbox will bring it to the Nintendo’s next-gen machine in the future alongside a PS5 port, too. </p><h2 id="h2234058"><a id=""></a><strong>Is it on Game Pass? </strong></h2><p>Yup! <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-companion-barks-battles-obsidian-xbox-1851764675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-companion-barks-battles-obsidian-xbox-1851764675"><em>Avowed</em></a></span><em> </em>is available to play via Game Pass Ultimate or Game Pass PC. </p><h2 id="h2234059"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Avowed </em>On Steam? </strong></h2><p>Yes. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Avowed </em>is on Valve’s popular digital storefront</a></span>. And you don’t need to install a seperate launcher or link your Xbox account to play it. </p><h2 id="h2234060"><a id=""></a><strong>Can I play it on Steam Deck? </strong></h2><p>Yes... <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/avowed-may-run-on-a-9-year-old-gpu-but-steam-deck-looks-like-a-no-go-unless-you-like-sub-30fps-upscaled-at-minimum-settings/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/avowed-may-run-on-a-9-year-old-gpu-but-steam-deck-looks-like-a-no-go-unless-you-like-sub-30fps-upscaled-at-minimum-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but be prepared for rocky performance and some major quality issues</a></span>. </p><p>Really, I’d avoid playing <em>Avowed </em>on Steam Deck. If you want to play the game on the go, you might be better off streaming it on your phone via Xbox Game Pass Cloud. </p><h2 id="h2234061"><a id=""></a><strong>Does <em>Avowed </em>support cross-save and cross-buy? </strong></h2><p>Yes! <em>Avowed </em>is an Xbox Play Anywhere game, which means you can hop between your Xbox and your PC freely, assuming your PC can run the game. The Steam version even supports Xbox cloud saves, too. </p><h2 id="h2234062"><a id=""></a><strong>How much space does <em>Avowed </em>take up?</strong></h2><p>75 GB on Xbox Series X/S. About 72 GB on PC. </p><h2 id="h2234063"><a id=""></a><strong>Does it support 60FPS on Xbox? </strong></h2><p>Yes! <em>Avowed</em> includes a performance mode that lets you play the game at 60FPS. However, this is only available on Xbox Series X and not the smaller, cheaper S console. The game also has a 30FPS mode and a 40FPS option that works with 120hz TVs. </p><h2 id="h2234064"><a id=""></a><strong>How long is <em>Avowed?</em></strong></h2><p><em>Avowed </em>will take most players about 30 to 40 hours. I was able to complete most side quests and finish all of the main quests in about 36 hours, though I was rushing to reach the end as I got closer to the finale. </p><p>If you take your time, explore each map completely, and do everything, you can easily spend over 50 hours in <em>Avowed</em>. </p><h2 id="h2234065"><a id=""></a><strong>Can you keep playing after you finish the last quest?</strong></h2><p>No! Once you reach the final big questline of the game, you are warned that there is no going back from that point. So if you want to do everything, you’ll need to save before starting the last quest and load that up later to go back and explore the world fully. Or you can just avoid the final quest while you do other things. </p><h2 id="h2234066"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Avowed </em>an open-world game? </strong></h2><p>Yes, but it’s broken up into separate maps that you can explore freely as you progress through the game. </p><h2 id="h2234067"><a id=""></a><strong>Does it have co-op?</strong></h2><p>No. There is no multiplayer in <em>Avowed</em>. </p><h2 id="h2234068"><a id=""></a><strong>Can I switch from first-person to third-person?</strong></h2><p>Yup! It’s in the settings. </p><figure id="" data-id="957254442debe30537079d85b5fda23e" data-recommend-id="image://957254442debe30537079d85b5fda23e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox / Obsidian / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="957254442debe30537079d85b5fda23e" data-recommend-id="image://957254442debe30537079d85b5fda23e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h2234069"><a id=""></a><strong>Is Garrus from <em>Mass Effect</em> in Avowed? </strong></h2><p>No, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-kai-mass-effect-garrus-voice-brandon-keener-1851765192&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-kai-mass-effect-garrus-voice-brandon-keener-1851765192">but his voice actor, Brandon Keener, is</a></span>, and as a result Kai is the best character in the game. </p><h2 id="h2234070"><a id=""></a><strong>Do I need to play<em> Pillars of Eternity</em> first?</strong></h2><p>Nope. However, if you do play <em>Pillars of Eternity </em>(and its sequel, <em>Deadfire</em>) first, you’ll likely pick up on the lore faster. I never played those games and within a few hours I was fully immersed in <em>Avowed </em>and its worldbuilding. </p><h2 id="h2234071"><a id=""></a><strong>Are there multiple endings?</strong></h2><p>Oh yeah. There are a lot of ways to save or control the Living Lands. </p><h2 id="h2234072"><a id=""></a><strong>Will there be any DLC for <em>Avowed</em>?</strong></h2><p>Maybe. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/avowed-director-confirms-the-game-follows-the-outer-worlds-lead-to-skip-new-game-plus-but-dlc-is-still-a-maybe/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/avowed-director-confirms-the-game-follows-the-outer-worlds-lead-to-skip-new-game-plus-but-dlc-is-still-a-maybe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That’s the official answer from Obsidian Entertainment</a></span>, the studio behind <em>Avowed</em>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shuhei-yoshida-thought-the-last-of-us-online-was-great-when-he-played-it.1113171/</guid>

<p>It’s been a rough couple of years for PlayStation and its live-service game slate, with around 75% of the projects being cancelled for one reason or another. </p>



<p>One such game was The Last of Us Online, or better known to the community as Factions. The game was publicly cancelled in 2023, with Naughty Dog saying it would be shifting its focus to single-player games instead. On paper at least, The Last of Us Online could have argubly been one of PlayStation’s live-service cash cows and according to Shuhei Yoshida, the game played great.</p>



<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/LastStandMedia/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sacred Symbols+</a> podcast (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/yoshida-i-played-the-last-of-us-online-and-it-was-great" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pushsquare</a>), Yoshida said “the idea for The Last of Us Online came from Naughty Dog and they really wanted to make it, nut Bungie explained [to them] what it takes to make live service games, and Naughty Dog realised, ‘Oops, we can’t do that! If we do it, we can’t make&nbsp;Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.’ So that was a lack of foresight.”</p>



<p>Yoshida went on to explain that from his experience at least, no development team at PlayStation has been forced to develop a live-service game and that the games are pitched by the studios based on the direction they believe the industry is going. </p>



<p>“From my experience, when studios see the company has a big initiative, [they realise] riding on that gives them a better chance of getting a project approved and supported,” he explained. “It’s not like [current PS Studios boss Hermen Hulst] is telling teams they need to make live service games, it’s likely mutual,” he said.</p>



<p>As for PlayStation’s current slate of live-service games, that has been cut drastically in the past couple of years. Bungie’s Marathon, Haven Studio’s Fairgame$, and a Horizon live-service game are still in development, but as of the time of writing, no firm release dates have been set.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-go-niantic-saudi-rumor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that Niantic, the developer behind hit games like&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Now</em>, is in talks to sell its gaming business to a company backed by the Saudi Public Investment Fund.</p>

<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-19/-pokemon-go-maker-nears-3-5-billion-deal-to-sell-games-unit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a>&nbsp;(which, as ever, cites the old "several people familiar with the discussions" chestnut), a deal between Niantic and the PIF-backed Scopely Inc "could be announced in coming weeks".</p>

<p>Bloomberg reporters Michelle Davis and Cecilia D'Anastasio say that the deal could be worth "about $3.5 billion", and that the agreement between Niantic and Scopely would include&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em>&nbsp;as well as other games developed by the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/niantic-saudi-deal-rumor-monster-hunter-now.jpg?itok=Qlce0fml 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/niantic-saudi-deal-rumor-monster-hunter-now.jpg?itok=YtxcAIbm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Niantic is responsible not only for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em>, but also for games like&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Now</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>However, Davis and D'Anastasio also emphasize that "there's no assurance an agreement will be reached", so it's entirely possible Niantic will remain independent.</p>

<p>If the deal does go through, Niantic will become one of many video game pies in which the Saudi PIF has its fingers. Others include Nintendo, of which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-pif-becomes-nintendos-largest-outside-shareholder" rel="nofollow">the PIF is now the largest external shareholder</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-arabia-pif-adds-stakes-in-capcom-nexon" rel="nofollow">Capcom</a>&nbsp;and <em>King of Fighters&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-arabian-crown-prince-to-buy-controlling-stake-in-snk" rel="nofollow">SNK</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, rumors are currently swirling that new&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC is on the way courtesy of Saudi PIF funding sent Ubisoft's way, although Ubisoft itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-report-ubisoft" rel="nofollow">declined to comment on these rumors</a> back in late January.</p>

<p>As Bloomberg points out, while&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>remains a major hit for Niantic, the company's other games have had some trouble replicating that success. Niantic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-go-creator-niantic-cancels-4-projects-lays-off-staff" rel="nofollow">canceled four in-development projects</a> and laid off a number of staff back in 2022.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-go-dhelmise-niantic-saudi-sale-rumor.jpg?itok=9F6uqmW7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-go-dhelmise-niantic-saudi-sale-rumor.jpg?itok=U68qNVjW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>remains a big hit for Niantic.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether or not operations will change if the deal goes through remains to be seen, but it's likely that, at least at first, Niantic will continue to operate just as it always has.</p>

<p>Of course, we'll have to wait and see what happens; the deal is far from confirmed, after all. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Niantic-related.</p>

Based on previous collaborations, these bundles are expected to cost 2,400 COD Points, or $19.99, each. So, if you want all four turtles you face the prospect of handing over $80’s worth of COD Points.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/bo6-s02-reloaded-announcement-027-1739968994419.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Leonardo Tracer Pack is expected to cost 2,400 COD Points, or $19.99. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all. As it did with the controversial Squid Game crossover, Activision has created a premium event pass for the Turtles crossover, which costs 1,100 COD Points / $10. This includes a number of eye-catching cosmetics, chief among them Splinter. Again, there is no other way of getting Splinter than paying the $10 for the premium track of the event pass. The free track includes two Foot Clan soldier skins, among other cosmetics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As many have pointed out, the Turtles crossover is heavy on the cosmetics but does not feature gameplay affecting items. No-one has to buy any or all of it to compete in Black Ops 6 multiplayer. And there are many within the community saying it's easy to ignore Call of Duty crossovers like the Turtles one and leave those willing to spend more to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that hasn’t stopped some players within the community from criticizing Activision once again for the high cost of these cosmetics, and are saying this second ever Call of Duty premium event pass suggests Black Ops 6 is now being monetized as if it were a free-to-play game like Fortnite.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/bo6-s02-reloaded-announcement-025-1739969056586.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Turtles event pass is just the second ever in Call of Duty. Image credit: Activision Publishing. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Activision casually glossing over the fact that they want you to pay $80+ if you want the 4 Turtles, plus another $10+ if you want the TMNT event pass rewards,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/1isjv5b/activision_casually_glossing_over_the_fact_that/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor II_JangoFett_II said</a>. “Call of Duty's Gross greed strikes again... DESPICABLE!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Guess we can expect an event pass sold every season now,” Hipapitapotamus suggested. “Remember when events were good and got you cool universal camos for free.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Turtles don’t use guns," APensiveMonkey declared. "Their fingers wouldn’t even... I hate this..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth going into more detail on how Activision monetizes Black Ops 6. Each season brings with it a new battle pass, the base version of which costs 1,100 COD Points / $9.99. There’s an extra premium version of the battle pass, called BlackCell, which costs $29.99 (you can’t buy this one with COD Points). Then there is a constant stream of cosmetics available to buy from the store. The Turtles crossover, with its premium event pass, is on top of all this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So they expect the playerbase to buy the game itself, buy the battle pass/black cell and now this? Na that's too much,” PunisherR35 added. “If this is gonna be the norm moving forward, CoD needs to move to a FTP model (campaign, MP).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-ops-6s-squid-game-season-2-crossover-and-call-of-dutys-controversial-relationship-with-microtransactions">Activision’s aggressive monetization of Call of Duty is nothing new</a>. It’s just that the new premium event pass, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-dutys-squid-game-crossover-event-locks-its-best-rewards-behind-a-new-premium-battle-pass">which made its debut with Black Ops 6’s Squid Game crossover</a>, has pushed some fans over the edge. And as has been pointed out many times before, the standardized monetization across the $70 Black Ops 6 and the free-to-play battle royale Warzone does Black Ops 6 no favors. What might be acceptable for Warzone given it’s free-to-play isn’t necessarily acceptable for Black Ops 6, given it costs $70 just to be able to play Multiplayer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s where the calls for Black Ops 6 Multiplayer to go free-to-play come from. With each new microtransaction Call of Duty Multiplayer feels more and more like Fortnite, Apex Legends, Marvel Rivals, and of course Warzone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision and parent company Microsoft will of course stick to its guns, given Call of Duty’s incredible popularity. Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty launch ever, and set a new single day Game Pass subscription record. Sales on PlayStation and Steam jumped 60% compared to 2023's Modern Warfare 3. Clearly, Call of Duty is doing the business for Activision and new owner Microsoft, which the financial officers will no doubt be delighted with given the Xbox maker paid an eye-watering $69 billion for the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

And so perhaps it comes as no surprise to see the community go into release date speculation mode with only an official create a character competition to go on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/2KceBLysMenA9JY9LsnSL3/bid-on-a-chance-to-create-a-character-for-the-elder-scrolls-vi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bethesda announced its next Make-A-Wish project</a>: you can bid on a chance to work with Bethesda Game Studios to create a character to appear as an NPC in The Elder Scrolls 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For the last several years, we have been lucky enough to work with Make-A-Wish to grant wishes, support some of their local events, and provide items and experiences, all to benefit children who are fighting life-threatening illnesses,” Bethesda said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This year, for their <a href="https://my.onecause.com/event/organizations/sf-0018000000bK8c8AAC/events/vevt:fd137384-5aab-481b-bcc9-95db4365f38b/auctions/silent-auction" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silent Auction</a> we are giving one winner the opportunity to work with Bethesda Game Studios to create a character to appear as an NPC in The Elder Scrolls 6. All of the money made from the auction goes directly to Make-A-Wish.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a wonderful cause and a great initiative from Bethesda, but for The Elder Scrolls 6 fans it could mean a whole lot more. And that’s because the community is comparing this Make-A-Wish project to the one Bethesda ran for Starfield, and have determined the point in development The Elder Scrolls 6 may be in currently, and thus its potential release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I know, the community has gone off the deep end here. But let’s run with it… for science.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The appropriately named redditor ‘FartingSlowly’ <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TESVI/comments/1is8evx/the_chance_to_design_a_starfield_character_post/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out</a> that Bethesda’s equivalent 'chance to make a Starfield character' post was published two-and-a-half years before Starfield came out in September 2023. Ergo, The Elder Scrolls 6’s release date is set for September 2027. More specifically, September 27, 2027.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is not a good indicator or metric for release by any standards,” FartingSlowly admitted. “Do not take this too seriously. But. It is finally something. It isn't just a piece of junk speculation based on nothing, it's based on something from Bethesda themselves. Yeah, it's not something to actually care about but it is a refreshing change in the world of speculation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, many within the community have cast similar doubt on the release date suggested by FartingSlowly. Some have pointed out that Starfield’s Make-A-Wish competition was announced when the game was due out November 11, 2022. Does that mean Bethesda is looking at releasing The Elder Scrolls 6 in November 2026?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been a long, long time since Bethesda announced The Elder Scrolls 6. In January, The Elder Scrolls 6’s June 10, 2018 announcement <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced">became as old as predecessor Skyrim was when The Elder Scrolls 6 was announced</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-officially-in-early-development-but-dont-expect-to-hear-about-it-soon"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 had entered "early development" in August 2023</u></a>, and "early builds" were available in March 2024. The six year anniversary of the announcement arrived in June last year and even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-teaser-is-now-6-years-old-and-even-todd-howard-paused-to-say-oh-wow-that-has-been-a-while"><u>Bethesda development chief Todd Howard paused to say, "oh wow, that has been a while."</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls 6 was thought to be set for 2028 at the earliest, presumably on the next-generation of consoles as well as PC. If it does launch then, it’ll do so an incredible 17 years after Skyrim.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> maker Valve has handed over the game's full client and server code to fans, encouraging them to "change, extend or rewrite" TF2 in any non-commercial way possible.
</p>
<p>
The code is now available via a "massive" update to the Source SDK [Software Development Kit], <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=238809">Valve announced last night</a>, making "anything from small tweaks to complete conversions possible".
</p>
<p>
For content creators, modders and fans, this means completely new TF2 games can be put together - as long as they're released for free.

<p>"TF2 mods may be published on the Steam Store, and after publication will appear as new games in the Steam game list," Valve wrote.</p>
<p>
Other updates to the Source SDK include 64-bit binary support, a scalable HUD/UI and other fixes for all other multiplayer Source engine games, including Counter-Strike: Source, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/day-defeat-source">Day of Defeat: Source</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a>: Deathmatch, and Half-Life Deathmatch: Source.
</p>
<p>
"Players have a lot of investment in their TF2 inventories, and Steam Workshop contributors have created of a lot of that content," Valve added. "The majority of items in the game now are thanks to the hard work of the TF2 community. 
</p>
<p>
"To respect that, we're asking TF2 mod makers continue to respect that connection, and to not make mods that have the purpose of trying to profit off Workshop contributors' efforts."
</p>
<p>Valve largely handed the reigns to TF2 over to fans some time ago, as it focuses on Steam and its Steam Deck hardware. The company is still developing games, however - and there have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">multiple reports over the past year</a> that a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam">fresh Half-Life entry looks to be on the way</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-and-dishonored-art-lead-viktor-antonov-dies-aged-just-52">tributes poured in for Half-Life 2 art director and Dishonored designer Viktor Antonov</a>, who sadly died aged 52.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Having the most powerful console is a message that no longer works in the current console market, according to the creator of Xbox, as it was a story that only worked in the past for a few reasons.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/xbox-creator-seamus-blackley-narrative-around-being-more-powerful-not-helpful-today/?callback=in&amp;code=MZY2ZJDMZDUTOWJKMY0ZYMRHLWE4YZUTZDU1ZWE2ZMQ5YMMZ&amp;state=f568e241a61f4d22b9243c504e3ba67e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VideoGamer,</a> the creator of the original Microsoft console Seamus Blackley commented on how having the most powerful console back in the original Xbox and PlayStation 2 generation was important, but not so much nowadays, as in that console generation, we were still in the <em>"nascent stages of graphics,"</em> and taking a hit in the cost of goods of the cogs was critical to position the system against the Japanese consoles, one-up them in this regard, and bet on the games being better.</p>
<p>Despite the narrative that having the most powerful console may have helped, the reason to buy any console has always been about the content, and the Xbox creator thinks this hasn't changed at all. What has changed is that this battle for the content has moved away from any sort of technical achievement and is now centered on creating a sort of experience that gets people to want it, regardless of what sorts of visuals it can push. The Nintendo Switch is the prime example of this, as with its content, Nintendo managed to get people to purchase a console released in 2017 powered by underclocked 2013 hardware.</p>
<p>The Xbox creator's statements don't come as a surprise to anyone who has been keeping tabs on the gaming industry. With Microsoft pushing its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/">multiplatform strategy</a>, bringing former Xbox exclusives to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch, and some developers suggesting <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-will-eventually-abandon-console-exclusives/">Sony may follow suit</a>, the importance of content over hardware is becoming increasingly clear, and with future home consoles unlikely to offer <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-smaller-performance-gains-higher-prices/">massive leaps in visual fidelity without significant price increases that could limit their appeal</a>, making compelling content is set to become more crucial than ever, regardless of the platform.</p>

<p>Avowed reached Steam’s Top Seller list <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-tops-steams-best-sellers-chart-days-before-full-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four days before its full release</a>, becoming America’s number-one-selling game on Steam. Now, spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/529298/article/avowed-launches-as-steams-1top-seller-in-the-us-and-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, an <a href="https://x.com/aarongreenberg/status/1891957370902728762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post by Aaron Greenberg, VP of Games Marketing at Microsoft, reveals Obsidian has clinched the top spot in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Finland, and more, making the game the number one selling game globally on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Avowed’s becoming a global top seller on Steam is an exciting achievement for Obsidian, considering the game is available for free through Game Pass. If players head over to <a href="https://steamdb.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, they will see that Obsidian’s new action RPG is topping the charts for ‘Trending Games’ and ‘Popular Releases’, too.

<p>For those wondering, Avowed is Obsidian’s latest fantasy action RPG, which takes players to Eora’s mysterious world, first seen in the Pillars of Eternity franchise. You enter the Living Lands, an island filled with ancient magic and many mysterious secrets.&nbsp;Your decisions here will shape the fates of the inhabitants of this world. You will also face off against some nasty foes, but don’t worry; your arsenal is filled with swords, spells, guns, and shields, and your trusty grimoire will get you out of any sticky situations.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Sometimes, NPCs in games are just a way for the developers to communicate with players in the context of the story. Those in-game discussions are usually meant to guide players to their next step, but apparently the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/avowed-review-too-close-to-the-sun/1900-6418335/" data-ref-id="1900-6418335">Avowed</a> community really wants the companions to shut up about their character getting upgraded gear. Obsidian Entertainment has released a day-one patch for Avowed, and near the top of the community requests was a note that companions will be making a lot fewer comments about players needing better armor or weapons.</p><p>One of the other community-requested changes is that players can no longer sell upgrade materials to merchants because it makes it harder to upgrade their characters without those resources. According to Obsidian, there is a plan to make a long-term solution that would allow players to buy those materials back from the merchants.</p><p>Most of the changes are quality-of-life improvements, including making companions more viable in combat situations by starting them out with increased health and by letting them be revived with 75% of their maximum health instead of the previously set amount of 50%. Only two of the new changes are directly related to crashes, specifically when casting Corrosive Siphon on destructible objects as well as some "rare leaks and crashes" when the game is paused.</p><p>Avowed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-not-being-open-world-is-a-good-thing-devs-say/1100-6529022/" data-ref-id="1100-6529022">isn't an open-world game</a>, but there is still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-is-full-of-discoveries-and-the-freedom-to-find-them-or-not/1100-6527918/" data-ref-id="1100-6527918">a lot of territory that can be explored</a>. Since this title is a Xbox Games Studio release, it's already on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-members-can-upgrade-to-avoweds-90-premium-edition-for-a-fraction-of-the-price/1100-6529257/" data-ref-id="1100-6529257">with an option to upgrade to the premium version</a> at a greatly reduced cost. The complete Avowed day-one patch notes are below.</p><h2>Community-Requested Fixes</h2><ul><li>Updates to Equipment Tier difference feedback and penalties/bonuses:<br><ul><li>Changed Tier penalty system from a hard tier to tier system and made it dynamic based on players equipment and the tier (and sub-tier) of the enemy.

We have a longer-term fix involving buying back from merchants in the works.</li></ul><h3>Missing NPCs</h3><ul><li>In specific situations, some NPCs weren’t where they should be.

            <p>Wizards of the Coast has unveiled more of its Magic: The Gathering and Final Fantasy crossover, including the cards set to shake up gameplay and the first ever summonable Saga Creatures.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-crossover-first-cards-revealed">reported on the four Commander decks based on Final Fantasies 6, 7, 10, and 14</a>, with lead characters Terra, Cloud, Tidus, and Y'shtola headlining each deck.</p>
<p>Now more cards have been revealed to show mechanics of the game and beautiful artwork.</p>

<p>For instance, the Final Fantasy crossover includes double-faced cards to represent iconic characters, minigames, and story moments. That might reflect, for instance, the journey of Cecil in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-iv">Final Fantasy 4</a> from Dark Knight to Paladin.</p>
<p>That also includes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy 15</a>'s fishing minigame - yes, you can now go fishing in Magic: The Gathering - which can be flipped to form a cooking campsite, used to add a food token to your deck.</p>

<p>Summons will also be included, combining elements of a Saga and Creature card for the first time, and can be called upon to aid in battle for a few turns - as you'd expect. So far, only Shiva has been revealed.</p>
<p>More new mechanics will be revealed in future.</p>

<p>Other revealed cards include boss monsters and cute creatures, like Jumbo Cactuar, Sin, Tonberry, and Moogle cards. Some cards will also be borderless to truly show off the artwork.</p>

<p>Then there are the Final Fantasy Through The Ages cards, featuring classic artwork from across the series, including from legendary artist Yoshitaka Amano and character designer Tetsuya Nomura. As a whole, the crossover is the largest collection of Final Fantasy artwork ever in a single game.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> is this year's current free-to-play PC game success story, attracting many millions of players over its opening weekend and making regular appearances in the Steam Most Played top 10 ever since. It garnered <a href="http://www.gamelook.com.cn/2025/01/562110">an estimated $136 million</a> in January. So naturally, it's time to start laying people off. 
</p>
<p>
Last night, one of the project's game directors, Thaddeus Sasser, revealed that an undisclosed number of US-based NetEase Games employees had been dismissed, including level designers Gary McGee and Jack Burrows. NetEase have now confirmed the news, calling it a move to "optimize development efficiency" and assuring players that they "are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game". Just not so much the people working on it.
</p><!--more-->
<p>

"This is such a weird industry..." Sasser wrote in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7297672154060361729/">a LinkedIn post</a> last night. "My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games...and were just laid off! Oh well! Times are tough all over - Let's find these incredible people new jobs, because we all need to eat, right?"</p>
<p>In that post, Sasser named McGee as one of the departing team members. Burrows has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jack-burrows-b7896399_opentowork-yacantwinthemall-activity-7297445172118724608-mTi7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAANxzosB8Nu3u0E3e0D-T9TYAyXUCoJsByM">announced</a> the loss of his job separately. "Was an enormous pleasure to work my American coworkers who join me in this sad culling," he wrote. "Just couldn't dodge that big boot, I guess, no matter how big the success of the gig."
</p>
<p>The cutbacks appear to be part of worldwide cost-cutting at NetEase, who are headquartered in China. Last November, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-writers-studio-worlds-untold-are-pausing-operations-in-what-staff-call-a-studio-closure">pulled funding for Worlds Untold</a>, the studio co-founded by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> developer Mac Walters. Last month, they also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jar-of-sparks-halts-production-on-debut-game-as-it-looks-for-new-publisher">broke up with Jar Of Sparks</a>, the studio co-founded by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> head of design Jerry Hook. And just this week, we learned of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">layoffs</a> at Liquid Swords, founded by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a> creative director Christofer Sundberg.
</p>
<p>

Some more context: the average cost of living and, by extension, the average salary in the USA and Sweden are dramatically higher than in China. I guess if I were a Chinese publisher looking to make a few spreadsheet cells turn green, I would start by making reductions overseas. Still, going after Marvel Rivals seems absolutely perverse.
</p>
<p>
The obvious difference between the previous NetEase-backed studio funding cuts and the Rivals situation is that the former had yet to release a game, while Rivals appears to be a colossal bread-winner. It's the only recent release in the Steam most played top 10 at the time of writing, sharing a screen with eternal fixtures such as DOTA 2 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>. If a live service project can do this well and still undergo pruning, we might ask, what hope is there for anybody else?
</p>
<p>
In their statement confirming the layoffs (<a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1892090498803696046?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">passed on by Stephen Totillo of Game File</a>), NetEase say they have "made the difficult decision to adjust Marvel Rivals' development team structure for organization reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game". Without sharing exact numbers, they comment that the 'adjustments' apply to "a design team based in Seattle that is part of a larger global design function in support of Marvel Rivals". They will be treating those affected "confidentially and respectfully".
</p>
<p>
The statement then switches the focus to Marvel Rivals itself, while quietly reminding readers that Rivals development is based primarily in China - an interesting show of a publisher managing perceptions of a game that is based on comicbooks and movies from the States, and thus easily read as an American cultural project. 
</p>
<p>
"We want to reassure our fanbase that the core development team for Marvel Rivals, which continues to be led by Lead Producer Weicong Wu and Game Creative Director Guangyn Chen in Guangzhou, China, remains fully committed to delivering an exceptional experience," it continues. "We are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game. We're excited to deliver new super hero characters, maps, features, and content to ensure an engaging live service experience for our worldwide player base."

The games industry continues to weather <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">a phase of mass reductions</a>, which have been variously attributed to rising interest rates, disappointing returns on new 'n' crappy technologies such as NFTs, and above all, a 'market reset' following over-ambitious expansion during the boom period created by Covid pandemic lockdowns.

Just yesterday, Sony's out-going indie gaming boss Shuhei Yoshida summarised it all as an "overreaction" to Covid. "Companies invested too much, including ourselves," he told <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/shuhei-yoshida-looks-back-at-31-years-at-sony-playstation-exit-interview/">VentureBeat</a>. "Then we had to face reality and make adjustments." Ah, that word 'adjustment' again. It's possible NetEase's desire for efficiency also has something to do with newly precarious trade relations between the US Trump administration and China, which saw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-us-just-added-worlds-biggest-games-publisher-tencent-to-their-list-of-chinese-military-companies">world's biggest publisher Tencent being added to a list of Chinese military companies</a>.</p>
<p>The Covid reset argument and other explanations risk being used as distractions from the banal reality that video game publishers are always going to want to cut costs and increase profits, even when times are good. Thankfully, Marvel Rivals is here to clear things up.
