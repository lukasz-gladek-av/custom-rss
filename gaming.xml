For the first time in a WWE video game, Jesse "The Body" Ventura will be available alongside Paul "Mr. Wonderful" Orndorff, Junk Yard Dog, Tito Santana, and Sid Justice... whom long-time wrestling fans may remember as both Sid Vicious and Sycho Sid.</p><p>There are a few guest characters whose names have yet to be released, including two "special celebrity guests" and three NBA players.

                <p>NordVPN is running a limited-time discount that saves you 70% on its two-year subscription plans. Four different plans are available for NordVPN--Basic, Plus, Complete, and Prime. Each one is more expensive than the last, but all four are currently on sale. You’ll get the best deal when signing up for its most expensive package, Prime, which is down to $201.36 for 24 months (normally $743.76 per 24 months), but even the standard <strong>Basic plan is a great deal at just $81.36 for 24 months (was $278.16)</strong>. As a bonus, <strong>signing up for a two-year deal on the Plus or Complete plans will get you an additional six months for free</strong> via an emailed coupon code. Opt for the Prime plan, and this gets bumped to one year. You can use the code to extend your plan or gift it to a friend and get them some free added privacy or a way to access the catalog of other countries’ streaming services.</p><p>Here's a closer look at the costs of each two-year plan:</p><h2>NordVPN Plans</h2><ul><li>Basic -- $81.36 (<del>$278.16</del>)</li><li>Plus --$105.58 (<del>$359.76</del>)</li><li>Complete -- $129.36 (<del>$438.96</del>)</li><li>Prime -- $201.36 (<del>$743.76</del>)</li></ul><p>All four plans get you access to the secure NordVPN network and threat protection through its DNS servers. They also support 10 simultaneous connections, so you should have no problem running all your favorite gadgets through the VPN at once.</p><p>Stepping up to the Plus plan introduces perks like ad and tracker blockers, advanced browsing protection, and anti-malware protection. There’s even a password manager that works across all your devices automatically.</p><p>The Complete plan provides 1TB of encrypted cloud storage--for an extra $24, that’s not a bad offer. Prime is the most comprehensive plan offered by NordVPN, getting you NordProtect--an identity protection service that scans the dark web for your data, offers credit freeze assistance, and even provides you with up to $1 million in identity theft coverage.</p><p>NordVPN is a pretty popular service, and getting access to it at these low prices is mighty enticing. And since three of the four plans get you additional months for free, it’s a great time to sign up.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-x-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-set-is-available-to-preorder/1100-6529819/">Spider-Man X Magic: The Gathering Trading Card Set Is Available To Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-biggest-upcoming-games-that-you-can-preorder-now/2900-6285/">The Biggest Upcoming Games That You Can Preorder Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sandisk-1-5tb-microsd-card-is-steeply-discounted-at-amazon-expand-your-steam-deck-storage/1100-6527841/">SanDisk 1.5TB MicroSD Card Is Steeply Discounted At Amazon - Expand Your Steam Deck Storage</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-owners-can-save-big-on-western-digitals-1tb-expansion-card/1100-6527818/">Xbox Series X|S Owners Can Save Big On Western Digital's 1TB Expansion Card</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-exclusive-pokemon-tcg-premium-collection-gets-huge-limited-time-discount/1100-6528386/">Amazon-Exclusive Pokemon TCG Premium Collection Gets Huge Limited-Time Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-steelbook-collectors-edition-preorder-for-best-ever-price-at-amazon/1100-6529671/">Lord Of The Rings Trilogy Limited Edition Steelbook Box Set Returns Next Month</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-alarmo-now-available-at-major-retailers-mario-will-wake-you-up-for-100/1100-6529653/">Nintendo Alarmo Now Available At Major Retailers - Mario Will Wake You Up For $100</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nintendo-switch-oled-value-bundle-comes-with-super-mario-bros-wonder/1100-6529632/">New Nintendo Switch OLED Value Bundle Comes With Super Mario Bros.

		<p>After a few years of hinting that The Last of Us Part 3 might be in the works, Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann seems to have a change of heart.&nbsp; In an interview with Variety about Season 2 of the The Last of Us television show Neil is asked about a third game.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I was waiting for this question,” Druckmann says, sighing, when I bring up the prospect of a third game. “I guess the only thing I would say is don’t bet on there being more of ‘Last of Us.’ This could be it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Neil himself had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/03/the-last-of-us-3-ps5-naughty-dog-interview/">previously said </a>he does have a idea for Part 3. “I don’t have a story, but I do have that concept,” he stated back in February 2024. “That, to me, is as exciting as one, as exciting as two, is its own thing, yet has this through line for all 3. So it does feel like… there’s probably one more chapter to this story.”</p>


<p>Further back in 2021 Druckmann said he had the outline of a story and there had been “quite a bit” of discussion about the game.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Naughty Dog have done this, after the release of Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, Naughty Dog Creative Director Shaun Escayg<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/22/naughty-dog-doubt-that-they-are-finished-with-uncharted/"> said</a> “To say the Uncharted world is done… I doubt that highly,” and then a few years later, we were told quite bluntly they were<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/26/naughty-dog-uncharted-5/"> “done” with franchise.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Naughty Dog’s next new game and franchise is Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, a game that will see the studio leap into the realms of science fiction with a setting thousands of years in the future. However they have stated they are working on “multiple” single player games but clearly not Uncharted or The Last of Us.</p>

<p>The Variety interview also gives us a few hints of what to expect from Season 2 of the television show and from what Bella Ramsey is saying, <em>that scene</em> will be in this series.</p>
<p>“I’m scared of some of the bigger emotional scenes, leaving not satisfied with my performance,” she says, before explaining that that for “the darkest scene this season”, they listened to the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRBOgtp0Hac">Peanut Butter Jelly Time. </a>&nbsp;Why they did that is not explained, it’s a very shouty upbeat song and certainly not what would pop in to your head when someone’s head is po…. let’s not finish that sentence. “I was on the floor, my eyes absolutely burning with these menthol tears, and I’m just saying, ‘Peanut Butter&nbsp;<em>Jelllll-y</em>,’” adds Bella.</p>
<p>It is also revealed we will meet Eugene, played by Joe Pantoliano, a character who is only referenced in the game as the owner of the canabis den in which&nbsp; Ellie and Dina spend a night in.</p>

            <p>
Until Dawn remake studio Ballistic Moon has reportedly "effectively closed", amid claims only a handful of employees "at most" remain - none of them developers.
</p>
<p>
Ballistic Moon, which is based in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-studio-ballistic-moon-lays-off-staff-ahead-of-the-games-release-in-october">confirmed a round of redundancies last year</a>, saying it had made the "tough decision to significantly scale down our team to secure the future of our studio." However, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/">new report by Insider Gaming</a> claims the studio quietly made a second round of redundancies toward the end of last year.
</p>
<p>
According to the publication's sources, roughly 40 employees were let go in October, with remaining staff kept on to provide post-launch support for Ballistic's Until Dawn remake. However, it's claimed these developers - equating to around 20 employees - lost their jobs in December, leaving only the studio's founders and "possibly" a handful of employees "at most". Reportedly, Ballistic's entire PR, marketing, and development teams are now gone.

<p>
"People are sharing bugs they've found in the game to make the team aware," a source told the publication, "but there is no one working on patch support for the game anymore."
</p>
<p>
Insider Gaming claims the job losses follow unsuccessful attempts by Ballistic's founders to pitch new projects, secure funding, and keep things "moving forward". It's also said discussions were had with Sony to secure funding for additional Until Dawn updates, possibly even another game, but they never reached fruition. Eurogamer has reached out to Ballistic for comment.
</p>
<p>
Word of additional redundancies at Ballistic comes as job cuts and studio closures continue across the games industry. February alone saw the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros. Games San Diego shut their doors</a>, with layoffs also confirmed at Marvel Rivals' US development team, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/callisto-protocol-studio-confirms-layoffs-as-former-employee-claims-most-of-the-devs-affected">The Callisto Protocol developer Striking Distance</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surgeon-simulator-developer-suffers-more-layoffs-says-it-will-scale-back-operations">Surgeon Simulator studio Bossa Games</a>.

The senior executive has a long and storied history within the tabletop space, including selling and promoting the most beloved games ever.</p>

<h2>Heiko Windfelder's Retirement Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a report from <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/03/05/veteran-kosmos-senior-exec-heiko-windfelder-who-oversaw-rise-of-catan-exit-games-at-german-publisher-is-retiring/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Board Game Wire</a>, Heiko Windfelder is retiring from Kosmos a mere two years after long-time managing director Michael Fleissner retired. When this occ urred, operational management fell to Windfelder alongside Thilan Tran and Matthias Kienzle. Both Tran and Kienzle will continue managing in a dual leadership position.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kosmos-catan-box-art.jpg?itok=e9ruoc2z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kosmos-catan-box-art.jpg?itok=2rF9XKqp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Both Tran and Kienzle issued the following statement regarding Windfelder's retirement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Over the past 30 years, Kosmos has developed into the highest-selling games publisher in the field of family and adult games.</p>

<p>“During this time, Heiko Windfelder has played a very influential role in shaping the fortunes of the company.</p>

<p>“With his passion for special stories, his creativity and his feel for special titles and exceptional authors, he has made a significant contribution to leading the publishing house to this pole position.</p>

<p>“For this, we thank him from the bottom of our hearts on behalf of the management and the entire Kosmos team.”</p>

<p>When Heiko Windfelder joined Kosmos in 1995, it was the same year they published <em>Catan</em>, one of the most popular board games in the business with over 45 million copies sold, not counting certain <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-masterpiece-kickstarter-fully-funded-within-hour-promoting-bespoke-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">prestige artisanal component</a> sets.</p>

<p>A second popular board game series nurtured by Windfelder was the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/exit-game-gate-between-worlds-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Exit</em></a> family series. This is a series of small box escape room board games. Each entry is themed around a different scenario like a sunken ship, a Sherlock Holmes mystery, and even an officially licensed <em>Lord of the Rings</em> scenario where you must escape the temptations of The One Ring.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Windfelder served as program manager with responsibility for the company's toy and game lines. These included <em>The Crew</em>, <em>Imhotep</em>, and the Spiel des Jahres winning <em>Sky Team</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-the-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the real achievements of tabletop crowdfunding has been the freedom to experiment with ambitious ideas. Instead of needing to target a mainstream audience with wider appeal, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">video-game-to-board game adaptations</a> have been able to aim at more niche audiences whose hobby identity overlaps between both mediums. This has allowed a game like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. The Board Game to thrive, offering a full-blown analog experience that is enormously rich and full of life, just as the original franchise fully deserves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a complex and expensive game chock-full of content. In it, up to four players take on the role of STALKERs, cooperating to achieve mission objectives such as rescuing a prisoner, retrieving an artifact, or hunting a massive beast in the irradiated environs of Chernobyl. Setting up the tiles, tokens, overlays, and cards can take a solid 20 minutes. Sneaking or fighting your way through the zone while handling all of the necessary aspects of play is another two or three hours. These estimates are for players who are familiar with the game and its rules as your first session is likely to stretch even longer. This experience is the inverse of the recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-the-board-game-priority-hagalaz-review"><u>Mass Effect board game</u></a>, instead seeking to offer an entire world to immerse yourself in at the cost of accessibility. Fortunately, all of this effort is absolutely worth it, for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a marvelous experience on the tabletop.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/05/stalker-playerboard-1741205445258.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The default mode of play is a story-focused campaign that lasts three scenarios. This is a more modest and reasonable commitment than popular <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign board games</a> such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion-review"><u>Gloomhaven</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-review"><u>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game</u></a>. Crucially, it means players are far more likely to actually finish the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It plays like a mashup of a traditional <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">dungeon crawler</a> with adventure game aspects. Each player controls a different STALKER outfitted with a variety of firearms, armor, and supplemental items. You then take turns performing one of several actions, including the expected moving and shooting, but also more unusual options like tossing bolts to distract enemies or interacting with terrain elements on the map.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fortunately, the effort is absolutely worth it, for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a marvelous experience on the tabletop.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The environment is dynamic and unpredictable. This is a key quality of the game, as it seeks to capture the danger and mystique of the Zone. You accumulate radiation moving through certain areas, hopefully possessing some kind of suit to offer protection. You also manipulate objects depending on the scenario and your goals. This may mean you have to locate a hidden trapdoor and pry it open, or choose between climbing a shaky ladder and descending into a drainpipe to enter a ruined building cut off from your approach. Often these environmental challenges are displayed on cards that are laid atop the map tiles. After spending an action to trigger or interact with their features, you flip the card over and reveal the outcome. There’s a strong sense of the unknown, particularly on your first playthrough of each scenario. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This core element of mystery is most strongly conveyed through anomalies. These swirling elemental entities are a significant detail of the video game’s setting, and they’re fundamental in establishing the character and personality of the post-apocalyptic surroundings. The board game adaptation of these oddities is spectacular. They’re represented by a standee and sit atop a translucent template on the board. The template contains various symbols spread across multiple map spaces, establishing a tense threat for any who would approach. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/05/stalker-anomaly-1741205445255.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Any figure that enters such a space must roll a die. If the symbol rolled matches one in the current space, it triggers the anomaly’s reaction. The effects depend on the specific type of anomaly, but often this means substantial damage with occasional detrimental status afflictions. To successfully navigate the area of threat, STALKERs must toss bolts to cover the face-up symbols and find a safe path through the chaos. This system is fantastic, as it captures the tone and atmosphere of the source material in a way that's not overly cumbersome. It also uses a unique set of components that is unusual in the board game space, which adds an esoteric quality and emphasizes its alien nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The enemy AI is also well implemented. After all of the STALKERs have activated, a card is flipped and a menu of actions is performed. Different enemy types, such as mutants and humans, behave somewhat differently, and they also take into consideration whether the protagonists were overly loud or acted with stealth. Players running and gunning like lunatics draw more attention and receive a higher degree of aggressive response. This system provides strong incentives to conduct stealthy operations, and the tools afforded as well as the construction of the scenarios themselves make this a satisfying strategic approach. Much like the anomalies and environment facets, the intersection of enemy behavior and player conduct is a well considered system that is surprisingly satisfying.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/05/stalker-miniaturesvsstandee-1741205445258.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The story-focused campaign is interesting, with its own quirks worth exploring, but its lifespan is limited. The narrative offers two branches of missions you can embark on, which means you can replay the game to pursue the pathway you neglected. Each playthrough consists of only a few missions, but you may even find some joy in replaying scenarios you’ve already bested. Some terrain elements are randomized, and most scenarios offer multiple viable solutions to accomplishing the objective. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The campaign also offers some neat between-mission diversions. You can visit scavenger camps, interact with armorers, and unearth forgotten stashes. This is handled through an overland map of the nearby area, with newly discovered location nodes applied to the map via sticker. Two blank maps are included in the game as a fresh sheet is needed for each campaign you embark upon. These small location visits are executed fairly well, as they bring in a more macro view of the setting and help add context to the more zoomed-in missions.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The single best feature in this box is the Zone Survival module.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If that’s all S.T.A.L.K.E.R. The Board Game was, it would still be a solid entry into the tabletop gaming space. Fortunately, there's more: the single best feature in this box is the Zone Survival module. This is a full-fledged scenario generator that combines several randomized components to create a unique procedurally crafted mission. The event deck is constructed from a random allotment of cards, and your objective is either randomized or chosen from a list. You select the map from one of 10 layouts, and various environmental details are created through card draw. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This system is <em>bonkers</em>. Nearly half the cards and tokens in the game are dedicated to this fully developed and robust system. The story-driven campaign could have been removed wholesale, and this mode alone would have established S.T.A.L.K.E.R. as one of the year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games</a>. Yes, the setup here is even more finicky and detailed, but the ensuing one-off scenario is full of surprises and drama. The degree of variability here is wild, and the game looks to support near endless play.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/05/stalker-allexpansions-1741205655039.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. The Board Game is a complete and hefty package, but it’s also one with an enormous amount of future potential. The core game comes with miniatures for the STALKERs, and cardboard standees for all foes and anomalies. Optional miniatures sets can be purchased, alongside several content expansions that add more detailed personal narratives to the characters, factions to interact with, and new narrative campaigns to embark upon. The commitment by the publisher is staggering, and this game looks to have long legs.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7EjD8?object_uuid=16530774-cc07-48ed-b16f-c2a511d60a13&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See it at Board Game Bliss</a></li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Check Out More Board Games Based on Video Games: </h2></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> boss Neil Druckmann has cast doubt on the possibility of third The Last of Us game, telling fans, "Don't bet on there being more."
</p>
<p>
Fans have been dreaming of a potential third entry in the series ever since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-a-gut-wrenching-sequel">release of The Last of Us Part 2 in 2020</a>. And while Naughty Dog and Sony have managed to remaster both the original The Last of Us (for a second time) and The Last of Us Part 2 since then, there's been no concrete word of a third series instalment.
</p>
<p>
Which isn't to say Naughty Dog has been entirely quiet on the matter. Back in 2021, Druckmann <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-3-has-a-story-outline-neil-druckmann-hopes-will-one-day-see-the-light-of-day">confirmed he'd penned a story outline for a potential The Last of Us Part 3</a> and admitted there'd been "quite a bit" discussion about a sequel. He <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-moving-on-from-uncharted-open-to-the-last-of-us-part-3-if-it-has-a-compelling-story">addressed a possible third series entry again</a> in 2023 - while Naughty Dog's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">now-canned The Last of Us multiplayer game</a> was still in the works - saying he was open to it, but only if the team could come up with a "compelling story".

<p>
And if that wasn't enough, Druckmann <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-3-could-be-one-more-chapter-to-this-story-says-co-creator-druckmann">returned to the subject of The Last of Us Part 3 again last year</a>, explaining that while he'd struggled to come up with a worthwhile concept for the game previously, "recently that's changed". And just to hammer home the point, he added, "So it does feel like there's probably one more chapter to this story."
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say that Druckmann's left enough of a breadcrumb trail over the last few years, that The Last of Us Part 3 feels like it might be closer to happening than not. And even though Naughty Dog is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">currently full steam ahead on its single-player sci-fi game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, the studio's previous confirmation it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">had "multiple single-player projects" in the works</a> still left room for hope.
</p>
<p>
In a new <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/">interview with Variety</a>, however, Druckmann has cast doubt on a possible The Last of Us Part 3. When asked about a potential third game, he replied, "I guess the only thing I would say is don't bet on there being more of Last of Us. This could be it."
</p>
<p>
It's unclear why Druckmann is suddenly less keen to fan the flames of speculation where a third The Last of Us title is concerned, but even if another game never happens, there's still new The Last of Us material on the way. HBO's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-wins-eight-emmys-including-outstanding-guest-actor-for-nick-offermans-bill">critically acclaimed TV show</a> returns for a second season soon, and it'll begin adapting the events of the second game. However, Druckmann and show runner Craig Mazin previously confirmed the series will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">likely take two or three seasons to cover all of The Last of Us Part 2</a>, and it's already clear plenty of new material will be in there.
</p>
<p>
Recent season two casting news, for instance, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-additions-reveal-how-show-is-expanding-upon-the-game">suggested the show will be more explicitly tackling events only mentioned in passing during the second game</a>. And, of course, even if Naughty Dog never gets around to making The Last of Us Part 3, that doesn't mean Druckmann's story treatment for post-Part 2 couldn't eventually make it to the small screen.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us season two runs for seven episodes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">starting on 13th April in the US</a>. And as for Naughty Dog's Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, there's no hint of a release date for that yet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/volcano-high-mtv-english<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hwasango</em>, AKA <a href="https://archive.org/details/volcano-high-mtv_202311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Volcano High</em></a>, is a&nbsp; 2001 Korean martial arts film heavier on comedy than action. It follows a delinquent student named Kim struggling with his temper and psychic powers. After transferring to Volcano High, a preppy high school with students proficient in martial arts, Kim is dragged into a turf war between a gang of students and substitute teachers. But we’re here to talk about MTV’s 2003 English dub, which stars hip hop artists like André 3000, Lil Jon, Snoop Dogg, comedian Tracy Morgan, and Mr. Miyagi himself, Pat Morita.&nbsp;</p><p>I forget how the hell I even stumbled upon this time capsule of East meets West. Despite the film’s Korean version ranking as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120130024255/http://koreanfilm.org/kfilm01.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9th highest-grossing Korean film in 2001</a>, the American version of <em>Volcano High</em>’s plot (which cuts 80 minutes of content) doesn’t have a remarkable story by any stretch of the imagination. Outside of some neat wire stunt work and special effects on par with <em>Donnie Darko</em>, <em>Volcano High</em> is a cheesy kung-fu movie that only stands to gain from having a goofy-sounding dub.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Volcano High School: MTV's rapper dub" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-xKg2meXFnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>After watching the trailer of the American version, I assumed the film’s grab bag of hot-and-happening early aughts rappers would be hamming up their vocal performances. To my surprise, <em>Volcano High</em>’s cast played things pretty straight. Morita’s vocal performance is objectively better than everyone else’s because he perfectly matches the lip flaps and over-the-top gesticulations of <em>Volcano High</em>’s conniving vice principal, Ko.&nbsp;</p><p>But the absolute cream of MTV’s weird little assortment of actors is Lil Jon and Snoop Dogg. While Snoop Dogg is criminally underutilized, he earns whatever MTV cut him a check for as the school’s level-headed “big homie.” Many of his lines as class president Kwon Sang-woo (localized as Hakrim) have him pontificating circular phrases that pass for sage wisdom, such as “knowing your enemy is to know yourself” and “your biggest weakness is your greatest strength.” If it weren’t for how smoothly he delivers every line like an Instagram-worthy caption, his character wouldn’t have made me lean forward toward my laptop to hear him talk game to Andre Three Stacks’ Kim.&nbsp;</p><p>Lil Jon was born to play Volcano High’s resident bully, Jang Yang. Lil Jon has two volumes: a low grumble and full-throated shouts. <em>Volcano High </em>lets him ping pong between both poles of his vocal range; he shouts all the air out of his lungs whenever he routinely reminds people of his entire government name, and he growls like an anime villain whenever someone challenges him or gets the upper hand in their bouts of fisticuffs. If there ever was a film that would get the party rapper closer to EGOT status, it’s here.&nbsp;</p><p>Other memorable moments from <em>Volcano High</em> include Kelis’ “Milkshake” playing moments after Tracy Morgan’s dreadlocked Woo Ping faceplants his two-story window leap of faith, Jang Yang throwing hands in a cafeteria because a classmate dared to eat cheonggukjang (his least favorite food) in his presence, and an Ada Wong-looking lady calling Kelis’ character “bacon head” for her gaudy super-gelled hairstyle. If you have an affinity for cheesy martial arts movies with dubbing work on par with localized <em>Godzilla </em>movies, <em>Volcano High</em> is a pretty comfy, dumb fun watch.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/fiio-ft1-review-sennheiser-hd6xx-best-midfi-headphone-canjam"><h3>I Went To A Fancy Headphone Convention And Fell In Love With The Basics</h3></a><p>The classic Sennheiser HD 6XX and the new Fiio FT1 are the budget kings of headphones, beloved by many.

A Switch could potentially go from $300 to $400. A PS5 Pro could see its price leap from $700 to $1000. And the Switch 2 could be slapped with a higher-than-expected price tag due to the ongoing tariffs, making a console that was potentially already going to be hard to buy in its first year even trickier and more expensive to obtain.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      For $549 and $599, AMD comes close to knocking out Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070.

<p>AMD is a company that knows a thing or two about capitalizing on a competitor's weaknesses. The company got through its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/amd-on-ropes-from-the-top-of-the-mountain-to-the-deepest-valleys/">early-2010s nadir</a> partially because its Ryzen CPUs struck just as Intel's current manufacturing woes began to set in, first with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/03/amd-ryzen-review/">somewhat-worse CPUs that were great value for the money</a>&nbsp;and later with CPUs that were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/hands-on-zen-3-testing-with-amds-ryzen-9-5900x-and-5950x/">better than anything Intel could offer</a>.</p>
<p>Nvidia's untrammeled dominance of the consumer graphics card market should also be an opportunity for AMD. Nvidia's GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards have given buyers very little to get excited about, with an unreachably expensive high-end 5090 refresh and modest-at-best gains from 5080 and 5070-series cards that are <em>also</em> pretty expensive by historical standards, when you can buy them at all. Tech YouTubers—both the people making the videos and the people leaving comments underneath them—have been almost uniformly unkind to the 50 series, hinting at consumer frustrations and pent-up demand for competitive products from other companies.</p>
<p>Enter AMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 graphics cards. These are aimed right at the middle of the current GPU market at the intersection of high sales volume and decent profit margins. They promise good 1440p and entry-level 4K gaming performance and improved power efficiency compared to previous-generation cards, with fixes for long-time shortcomings (ray-tracing performance, video encoding, and upscaling quality) that should, in theory, make them more tempting for people looking to ditch Nvidia.</p>

<p>AMD's high-level performance promise for the RDNA 4 architecture revolves around big increases in performance per compute unit (CU). An RDNA 4 CU, AMD says, is nearly twice as fast in rasterized performance as RDNA 2 (that is, rendering without ray-tracing effects enabled) and nearly 2.5 times as fast as RDNA 2 in games with ray-tracing effects enabled. Performance for at least some machine learning workloads also goes way up—twice as fast as RDNA 3 and four times as fast as RDNA 2.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>We'll see this in more detail when we start comparing performance, but AMD seems to have accomplished this goal. Despite having 64 or 56 compute units (for the 9070 XT and 9070, respectively), the cards' performance often competes with AMD's last-generation flagships, the RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT. Those cards came with 96 and 84 compute units, respectively. The 9070 cards are specced a lot more like last generation's RX 7800 XT—including the 16GB of GDDR6 on a 256-bit memory bus, as AMD still isn't using GDDR6X or GDDR7—but they're much faster than the 7800 XT was.</p>

<p>The 9070 series also uses a new 4 nm manufacturing process from TSMC, an upgrade from the 7000 series' 5 nm process (and the 6 nm process used for the separate memory controller dies in higher-end RX 7000-series models that used chiplets). AMD's GPUs are normally a bit less efficient than Nvidia's, but the architectural improvements and the new manufacturing process allow AMD to do some important catch-up.</p>
<p>Both of the 9070 models we tested were ASRock Steel Legend models, and the 9070 and 9070 XT had identical designs—we'll probably see a lot of this from AMD's partners since the GPU dies and the 16GB RAM allotments are the same for both models. Both use two 8-pin power connectors; AMD says partners are free to use the 12-pin power connector if they want, but given Nvidia's ongoing issues with it, most cards will likely stick with the reliable 8-pin connectors.</p>


<p>AMD doesn't appear to be making and selling reference designs for the 9070 series the way it did for some RX 7000 and 6000-series GPUs or the way Nvidia does with its Founders Edition cards. From what we've seen, 2 or 2.5-slot, triple-fan designs will be the norm, the way they are for most midrange GPUs these days.</p>
<h3>Testbed notes</h3>

<p>We used the same GPU testbed for the Radeon RX 9070 series as we have for our GeForce RTX 50-series reviews.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>An AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D ensures that our graphics cards will be CPU-limited as little as possible. An ample 1050 W power supply, 32GB of DDR5-6000, and an AMD X670E motherboard with the latest BIOS installed round out the hardware. On the software side, we use an up-to-date installation of Windows 11 24H2 and recent GPU drivers for older cards, ensuring that our tests reflect whatever optimizations Microsoft, AMD, Nvidia, and game developers have made since the last generation of GPUs launched.</p>
<p>We have numbers for all of Nvidia's RTX 50-series GPUs so far, plus most of the 40-series cards, most of AMD's RX 7000-series cards, and a handful of older GPUs from the RTX 30-series and RX 6000 series. We'll focus on comparing the 9070 XT and 9070 to other 1440p-to-4K graphics cards since those are the resolutions AMD is aiming at.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>At $549 and $599, the 9070 series is priced to match Nvidia's $549 RTX 5070 and undercut the $749 RTX 5070 Ti. So we'll focus on comparing the 9070 series to those cards, plus the top tier of GPUs from the outgoing RX 7000-series.</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>Some 4K rasterized benchmarks.</span>
                </p>
  </div>

<p>Starting at the top with rasterized benchmarks with no ray-tracing effects, the 9070 XT does a good job of standing up to Nvidia's RTX 5070 Ti, coming within a few frames per second of its performance in all the games we tested (and scoring very similarly in the 3DMark Time Spy Extreme benchmark).</p>


<p>Both cards are considerably faster than the RTX 5070—between 15 and 28 percent for the 9070 XT and between 5 and 13 percent for the regular 9070 (our 5070 scored weirdly low in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, so we'd treat those numbers as outliers for now). Both 9070 cards also stack up well next to the RX 7000 series here—the 9070 can usually just about match the performance of the 7900 XT, and the 9070 XT usually beats it by a little. Both cards thoroughly outrun the old RX 7900 GRE, which was AMD's $549 GPU offering just a year ago.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The 7900 XT does have 20GB of RAM instead of 16GB, which might help its performance in some edge cases. But 16GB is still perfectly generous for a 1440p-to-4K graphics card—the 5070 only offers 12GB, which could end up limiting its performance in some games as RAM requirements continue to rise.</p>
<h3>On ray-tracing improvements</h3>
<p>Nvidia got a jump on AMD when it introduced hardware-accelerated ray-tracing in the RTX 20-series in 2018. And while these effects were only supported in a few games at the time, many modern games offer at least some kind of ray-traced lighting effects.</p>
<p>AMD caught up a little when it began shipping its own ray-tracing support in the RDNA2 architecture in late 2020, but the issue since then has always been that AMD cards have taken a larger performance hit than GeForce GPUs when these effects are turned on. RDNA3 promised improvements, but our tests still generally showed the same deficit as before.</p>
<p>So we're looking for two things with RDNA4's ray-tracing performance. First, we want the numbers to be higher than they were for comparably priced RX 7000-series GPUs, the same thing we look for in non-ray-traced (or rasterized) rendering performance. Second, we want the size of the performance hit to go down. To pick an example: the RX 7900 GRE could compete with Nvidia's RTX 4070 Ti Super in games without ray tracing, but it was closer to a non-Super RTX 4070 in ray-traced games. It has helped keep AMD's cards from being across-the-board competitive with Nvidia's—is that any different now?</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>Benchmarks for games with ray-tracing effects enabled. Both AMD cards generally keep pace with the 5070 in these tests thanks to RDNA 4's improvements.</span>
                </p>
  </div>

<p>The picture our tests paint is mixed but tentatively positive. The 9070 series and RDNA4 post solid improvements in the <em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>benchmarks, substantially closing the performance gap with Nvidia. In games where AMD's cards performed well enough before—here represented by&nbsp;<em>Returnal</em>—performance goes up, but roughly proportionately with rasterized performance. And both 9070 cards still punch below their weight in&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, falling substantially behind the 5070 under the punishing Cinematic graphics preset.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>So the benefits you see, as with any GPU update, will depend a bit on the game you're playing. There's also a possibility that game optimizations and driver updates made with RDNA4 in mind could boost performance further. We can't say that AMD has caught all the way up to Nvidia here—the 9070 and 9070 XT are both closer to the GeForce RTX 5070 than the 5070 Ti, despite keeping it closer to the 5070 Ti in rasterized tests—but there <em>is</em> real, measurable improvement here, which is what we were looking for.</p>

<h3>Power usage</h3>


<p>The 9070 series' performance increases are particularly impressive when you look at the power-consumption numbers. The 9070 comes close to the 7900 XT's performance but uses 90 W less power under load. It beats the RTX 5070 most of the time but uses around 30 W less power.</p>
<p>The 9070 XT is a little less impressive on this front—AMD has set clock speeds pretty high, and this can increase power use disproportionately. The 9070 XT is usually 10 or 15 percent faster than the 9070 but uses 38 percent more power. The XT's power consumption is similar to the RTX 5070 Ti's (a GPU it often matches) and the 7900 XT's (a GPU it always beats), so it's not <em>too</em> egregious, but it's not as standout as the 9070's.</p>
<p>AMD gives 9070 owners a couple of new toggles for power limits, though, which we'll talk about in the next section.</p>
<h3>Experimenting with “Total Board Power”</h3>
<p>We don't normally dabble much with overclocking when we review CPUs or GPUs—we're happy to leave that to folks at other outlets. But when we review CPUs, we do usually test them with multiple power limits in place. Playing with power limits is easier (and occasionally safer) than actually overclocking, and it often comes with large gains to either performance (a chip that performs much better when given more power to work with) or efficiency (a chip that can run at nearly full speed without using as much power).</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Initially, I experimented with the RX 9070's power limits by accident. AMD sent me one version of the 9070 but exchanged it because of a minor problem the OEM identified with some units early in the production run. I had, of course, already run most of our tests on it, but that's the way these things go sometimes.</p>
<div>

    <p><span>By bumping the regular RX 9070's TBP up just a bit, you can nudge it closer to 9070 XT-level performance.</span>
                </p>
  </div>

<p>The replacement RX 9070 card, an ASRock Steel Legend model, was performing significantly better in our tests, sometimes nearly closing the gap between the 9070 and the XT. It wasn't until I tested power consumption that I discovered the explanation—by default, it was using a 245 W power limit rather than the AMD-defined 220 W limit. Usually, these kinds of factory tweaks don't make much of a difference, but for the 9070, this power bump gave it a nice performance boost while still keeping it close to the 250 W power limit of the GeForce RTX 5070.</p>
<p>The 90-series cards we tested both add some power presets to AMD's Adrenalin app in the Performance tab under Tuning. These replace and/or complement some of the automated overclocking and undervolting buttons that exist here for older Radeon cards. Clicking Favor Efficiency or Favor Performance can ratchet the card's Total Board Power (TBP) up or down, limiting performance so that the card runs cooler and quieter or allowing the card to consume more power so it can run a bit faster.</p>
<figure>
    
          <figcaption>
        <div>
    
    <p>
      The 9070 cards get slightly different performance tuning options in the Adrenalin software. These buttons mostly change the card's Total Board Power (TBP), making it simple to either improve efficiency or boost performance a bit.

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>For this particular ASRock 9070 card, the default TBP is set to 245 W. Selecting "Favor Efficiency" sets it to the default 220 W. You can double-check these values using an app like <a href="https://www.hwinfo.com/">HWInfo</a>, which displays both the current TBP and the maximum TBP in its Sensors Status window. Clicking the Custom button in the Adrenalin software gives you access to a Power Tuning slider, which for our card allowed us to ratchet the TBP up by up to 10 percent or down by as much as 30 percent.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>This is all the firsthand testing we did with the power limits of the 9070 series, though I would assume that adding a bit more power also adds more overclocking headroom (bumping up the power limits is common for GPU overclockers no matter who makes your card). AMD says that some of its partners will ship 9070 XT models set to a roughly 340 W power limit out of the box but acknowledges that "you start seeing diminishing returns as you approach the top of that [power efficiency] curve."</p>
<p>But it's worth noting that the driver has another automated set-it-and-forget-it power setting you can easily use to find your preferred balance of performance and power efficiency.</p>

<h3>A quick look at FSR4 performance</h3>

      There's a toggle in the driver for enabling FSR 4 in FSR 3.1-supporting games.

  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>One of AMD's headlining improvements to the RX 90-series is the introduction of FSR 4, a new version of its FidelityFX Super Resolution upscaling algorithm. Like Nvidia's DLSS and Intel's XeSS, FSR 4 can take advantage of RDNA 4's machine learning processing power to do hardware-backed upscaling instead of taking a hardware-agnostic approach as the older FSR versions did. AMD says this will improve upscaling quality, but it also means FSR4 will only work on RDNA 4 GPUs.</p>
<p>The good news is that FSR 3.1 and FSR 4 are forward- and backward-compatible. Games that have already added FSR 3.1 support can automatically take advantage of FSR 4, and games that support FSR 4 on the 90-series can just run FSR 3.1 on older and non-AMD GPUs.</p>
<figure>
    
          <figcaption>
        <div>
    
    <p>
      FSR 4 comes with a small performance hit compared to FSR 3.1 at the same settings, but better overall quality can let you drop to a faster preset like Balanced or Performance and end up with more frames-per-second overall.

                  </span>
          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>The only game in our current test suite to be compatible with FSR 4 is&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, and we tested its performance using both FSR 3.1 and FSR 4. In general, we found that FSR 4 improved visual quality at the cost of just a few frames per second when run at the same settings—not unlike using Nvidia's recently released "transformer model" for DLSS upscaling.</p>
<p>Many games will let you choose which version of FSR you want to use. But for FSR 3.1 games that don't have a built-in FSR 4 option, there's a toggle in AMD's Adrenalin driver you can hit to switch to the better upscaling algorithm.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Even if they come with a performance hit, new upscaling algorithms <em>can</em> still improve performance by making the lower-resolution presets look better. We run all of our testing in "Quality" mode, which generally renders at two-thirds of native resolution and scales up. But if FSR 4 running in Balanced or Performance mode looks the same to your eyes as FSR 3.1 running in Quality mode, you can still end up with a net performance improvement in the end.</p>
<h3>RX 9070 or 9070 XT?</h3>
<p>Just $50 separates the advertised price of the 9070 from that of the 9070 XT, something both Nvidia and AMD have done in the past that I find a bit annoying. If you have $549 to spend on a graphics card, you can almost certainly scrape together $599 for a graphics card. All else being equal, I'd tell most people trying to choose one of these to just spring for the 9070 XT.</p>
<p>That said, availability and retail pricing for these might be all over the place. If your choices are a regular RX 9070 or nothing, or an RX 9070 at $549 and an RX 9070 XT at any price higher than $599, I would just grab a 9070 and not sweat it too much. The two cards aren't&nbsp;<em>that</em> far apart in performance, especially if you bump the 9070's TBP up a little bit, and games that are playable on one will be playable at similar settings on the other.</p>

<h2>Pretty close to great</h2>

      If you're building a 1440p or 4K gaming box, the 9070 series might be the ones to beat right now.

<p>We've got plenty of objective data in here, so I don't mind saying that I came into this review kind of&nbsp;<em>wanting</em> to like the 9070 and 9070 XT. Nvidia's 50-series cards have mostly upheld the status quo, and for the last couple of years, the status quo has been sustained high prices and very modest generational upgrades. And who doesn't like an underdog story?</p>
<p>I think our test results mostly justify my priors. The RX 9070 and 9070 XT are very competitive graphics cards, helped along by a particularly mediocre RTX 5070 refresh from Nvidia. In non-ray-traced games, both cards wipe the floor with the 5070 and come close to competing with the $749 RTX 5070 Ti. In games and synthetic benchmarks with ray-tracing effects on, both cards can usually match or slightly beat the similarly priced 5070, partially (if not entirely) addressing AMD's longstanding performance deficit here. Neither card comes close to the 5070 Ti in these games, but they're also not priced like a 5070 Ti.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Just as impressively, the Radeon cards compete with the GeForce cards while consuming similar amounts of power. At stock settings, the RX 9070 uses roughly the same amount of power under load as a 4070 Super but with better performance. The 9070 XT uses about as much power as a 5070 Ti, with similar performance before you turn ray-tracing on. Power efficiency was a small but consistent drawback for the RX 7000 series compared to GeForce cards, and the 9070 cards mostly erase that disadvantage. AMD is also less stingy with the RAM, giving you 16GB for the price Nvidia charges for 12GB.</p>
<p>Some of the old caveats still apply. Radeons take a bigger performance hit, proportionally, than GeForce cards. DLSS already looks pretty good and is widely supported, while FSR 3.1/FSR 4 adoption is still relatively low. Nvidia has a nearly monopolistic grip on the dedicated GPU market, which means many apps, AI workloads, and games support its GPUs best/first/exclusively. AMD is always playing catch-up to Nvidia in some respect, and Nvidia keeps progressing quickly enough that it feels like AMD never quite has the opportunity to close the gap.</p>
<p>AMD also doesn't have an answer for DLSS Multi-Frame Generation. The benefits of that technology are fairly narrow, and you already get <em>most</em> of those benefits with single-frame generation. But it's still a thing that <a href="https://sega.fandom.com/wiki/Sega_does_what_Nintendon%27t">Nvidia does that AMDon't</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, the RX 9070 cards are both awfully tempting competitors to the GeForce RTX 5070—and occasionally even the 5070 Ti. They're great at 1440p and decent at 4K. Sure, I'd like to see them priced another $50 or $100 cheaper to well and truly undercut the 5070 and bring 1440p-to-4K performance t0 a sub-$500 graphics card. It would be nice to see AMD undercut Nvidia's GPUs as ruthlessly as it undercut Intel's CPUs nearly a decade ago. But these RDNA4 GPUs have way fewer downsides than previous-generation cards, and they come at a moment of relative weakness for Nvidia. We'll see if the sales follow.</p>

                <p>You're probably wondering why Focus Mode in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a> is a bit finicky. As you take on numerous gargantuan beasts, this mechanic is one that enables you to track targets and land devastating blows. However, making use of it is a bit cumbersome... at least until you make a small tweak to the controls. Our guide tells you just what you need to do to alleviate combat-induced migraines in your playthrough.</p><h2>How to make combat easier with the Focus Mode toggle in Monster Hunter Wilds </h2><p>Focus Mode is a game mechanic that's supposed to make combat easier. First, it requires you to hold the button prompt--i.e. L2/LT on a gamepad, Left Alt on a keyboard, or the Mouse 4 button on a mouse. This lets you aim and track a target as it moves around the area.</p><p>More importantly, it makes wounds easier to discern. When you repeatedly hit a monster's body parts, these wounds appear as bright red gashes while Focus Mode is active. Then, when you press the button prompt for a Focus Strike, your character will perform a devastating blow.</p><p>Unfortunately, the system itself is quite cumbersome to use. Imagine having to hold down a button most of the time throughout a fight, all while switching between items and dodging blows, and the whole thing turns into quite a hassle. Worse, certain armaments, such as the bow--which we consider one of the <strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-weapons-in-monster-hunter-wilds/2900-6288/" data-ref-id="2900-6288">best weapons</a></strong> in the game--become unwieldy since you have to alternate between two ability sets/firing modes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4454003-monster-hunter-wilds-focus-mode-toggle-easy-combat-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454003" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4454003-monster-hunter-wilds-focus-mode-toggle-easy-combat-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454003"></a><figcaption>Focus Mode needs to be active if you want to spot a creature's wounds.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4454003-monster-hunter-wilds-focus-mode-toggle-easy-combat-1.jpg"></figure><p>Fortunately, there's a quick fix for Monster Hunter Wilds' Focus Mode. All you need to do is open the menu and go to the Options screen. Take a look at the Controls tab and go to page 2. You should see the following:</p><ul><li>Aim/Focus Mode Controls  <ul><li>Melee Weapons</li><li>Ranged Weapons</li></ul></li><li>The default setting is "Activate Mode," but you should change it to "Toggle Mode."</li><li>You can switch to Toggle Mode for either melee or ranged weapons, or both, depending on your control preference.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4454004-monster-hunter-wilds-focus-mode-toggle-easy-combat-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454004" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4454004-monster-hunter-wilds-focus-mode-toggle-easy-combat-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454004"></a><figcaption>Switching Focus Mode to activate when toggled makes controls less cumbersome.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4454004-monster-hunter-wilds-focus-mode-toggle-easy-combat-2.jpg"></figure><p>With this tweak, you simply need to press the Focus Mode button/keybind. As long as your weapon is drawn, Focus Mode will remain active and you won't have to hold the button down anymore. If you want to deactivate it, just press the same button or sheathe your weapon to disengage swiftly.</p><p>That does it for our guide on how to use the toggle for Focus Mode in Monster Hunter Wilds.

And, in a series first, it comes with a mode that removes many choices, instead adhering to one “canonical” narrative path. Now Ubisoft has explained why this option was added and also clarified that you’ll still be free to kiss whoever you want even if you pick the Canon Mode. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,195776,196165" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-always-online-steam-deck-ubi-connect-1851767074&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-always-online-steam-deck-ubi-connect-1851767074"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span>, set in feudal Japan and starring two very different protagonists, launches later this month. When fans boot it up, they’ll have an ironic choice to make: During your playthrough, do you want to make choices or not? You can play <em>Shadows </em>like most RPGs, choosing what to say to certain people to affect the outcome of a questline or story arc. Or you can choose Canon Mode, which removes such choices and tells a set story created by Ubisoft. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-canon-mode-1851719396&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-canon-mode-1851719396">But why is this previously confirmed Canon Mode</a></span> even in the game? Well, Ubisoft says it’s because of fan “disappointment” over the way all the dialogue options in games like<em> Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla </em>prevented the creation of a single “canonical” record of how those stories played out.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-creation-why/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-creation-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a recent interview with <em>Gamerant</em></a></span>, creative director Jonathan Dumont talked about the Canon Mode in <em>Shadows</em>. According to him, while many fans have loved the RPG choices in recent <em>AC </em>games, others missed the fact that there was no longer a single, agreed-upon metanarrative. </p><p>  “When we introduced a choice of characters and dialogue choices in <em>AC Odyssey</em>, many of our fans loved the idea, but some expressed their disappointment in not having a definitive and canon narrative for the game that could be embedded in the <em>AC</em> lore meta story, “ said Dumont. </p><p>“After speaking with our fans during development, we decided to add a mode that takes out all the choices for <em>Shadows </em>and that can serve as a reference story within the franchise. This way players can enjoy the more RPG style of narrative or a more linear one, if they prefer.” </p><p>It’s yet another example of how Ubisoft is extremely focused on ensuring that both old school <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>fans—who prefer linearity and stealth—and newer fans—who prefer RPG-flavored open-world action—are happy when they play <em>Shadows</em>. </p><p>For those who crave a more traditional <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> experience, you can turn on instant assassinations,  play almost entirely as classic assassin Naoe, and  turn off all dialogue choices, too. On the flip side, you can play the game like <em>Valhalla </em>and mostly fight your way through crowds of enemies with big swords while making hard decisions. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-4-hour-preview-hands-on-review-1851745403&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-4-hour-preview-hands-on-review-1851745403">As I experienced in my preview with the game earlier this year</a></span>, <em>Shadows </em>truly feels like an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> designed from the ground up to make all fans happy. </p><p>However, regardless of whether you play in canon mode or not, Ubisoft will let you romance and kiss any romanceable character you desire. This was confirmed by associate narrative director Brooke Davies while speaking to <em>Gamerant</em>. </p><p> “Because Naoe and Yasuke are different people, they each have unique romance possibilities and connections,” said Davies. “None of our love stories is canon, so players can choose for themselves who—or who not—to pursue.” </p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 20. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’ve been waiting to play Cities: Skylines 2 until it finally releases on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5, you may just have to move on to something else. In a  new update posted on Wednesday, it doesn’t appear that Cities: Skylines 2 is anywhere close to releasing on console.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/542225339665875067?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new update</a> ahead of the franchise’s 10th birthday, developer Paradox Interactive said that the team at Colossal Order is making “steady progress” on the console version. They added that a “core focus” has been on performance and stability improvements for the game. That said, there is “more things” that need to be worked on in order to get the game to “the level of quality and the experience we want for you as our players.”</p>



<p>“We know many of you are eagerly awaiting the console release, but to set expectations clearly: we will not have a release before summer,” Paradox said. “We want to avoid any premature estimates and instead commit to providing you with reliable information when we’re closer to a launch-ready state.”</p>



<p>They closed the console-specific update saying that the goal remains the same, and that’s bringing Cities: Skylines 2 to console in the “best possible shape”.</p>



<p>Originally planned for a release in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-release-date-set-for-october-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 2023</a> alongside the PC version, the console edition of the city builder was delayed to 2024 at the last minute. Since then, it has continued to see delays as the developers work around what has been said to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-console-delay-is-due-to-hardware-limitations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware limitations</a>.</p>



<p>When do you think Cities: Skylines 2 will release on console? Let us know in the comments below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>
