            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/aliens-fireteam-elite-2-leak-rumor<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new leak appears to have confirmed the existence of&nbsp;<em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2</em>, a followup to the 2021 squad-based third-person shooter. If the leak is correct, the game is set to launch sometime next year.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AliensFireteamElite/comments/1e2r9kj/aliens_fireteam_elite_2_leaked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">document spotted by Redditor firemonkey11</a> (with additional reporting from <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/aliens-fireteam-elite-2-information-seemingly-appears-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VGC</a>),&nbsp;<em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2</em>, which is currently codenamed&nbsp;<em>Project Macondo</em>, is set to launch in the third quarter of the 2025 financial year, which would likely mean somewhere between September and December next year.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, the game will be a third-person co-op shooter, but it'll make some changes to the first game's formula, including the addition of a class system and the removal of in-game voice chat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aliens-fireteam-elite-2-leaked-first-game-shot.jpg?itok=D--sXgte 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aliens-fireteam-elite-2-leaked-first-game-shot.jpg?itok=sQ4yj8xL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>2021's&nbsp;<em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite&nbsp;</em>is getting a followup next year, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2&nbsp;</em>will feature "evolved enemy intelligence and behaviors", according to the leaked document, and it'll also give you the chance to test your alien-slaying skills in the new Annihilation Mode, a "new spin on Horde Mode".</p>
<p>The sequel will give you a choice between five different character archetypes, including the "silent assassin" Callsign Nix and the "inspiring leader" Callsign Vulcan. This represents a fairly major change over the original's more modular build-crafting system.</p>
<p>According to the document,&nbsp;<em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2&nbsp;</em>won't feature any microtransactions, gacha systems, or in-game advertising, and it also won't support native in-game chat, instead asking players to use the voice chat included with the platform on which they're playing.</p>
<p>Some of these purported changes haven't proven popular with&nbsp;<em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite&nbsp;</em>fans; one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AliensFireteamElite/comments/1e2r9kj/comment/ld335cb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="noopener" target="_blank">simply says</a> that the plan appears to be to "make it worse" in the sequel, while <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AliensFireteamElite/comments/1e2r9kj/comment/ld2zo65/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="noopener" target="_blank">another says</a> the character classes and kits included in the leak "ain't doing it for me".</p>

<p>Disney hasn't issued a comment regarding the hack yet, but it was apparently carried out by accessing the company's internal Slack messaging system, which is also apparently how the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-leaks-include-over-hour-of-footage">infamous 2022&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>leak</a> happened.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's worth taking these reports with a pinch of salt, but if the leak is correct, then you can likely expect an&nbsp;<em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite 2&nbsp;</em>announcement sometime in the near future. Stay tuned for more.</p>

And as before, if the amount is small enough to use a list, we may simply look for the least element through the list linearly. For larger pools, we want a data structure that allows efficient adding objects, removing of the minimum, and efficiently removing specific objects.

Most of the discussion in this post assumes that the objects we want to hash are reference types.

Besides, when passing them between methods, their values are copied, so any gains trying to avoid creation will be thwarted. There may well be occasions where pooling structs may be useful.

            <p>Genshin Impact has once again been accused of cultural appropriation from fans and voice actors in response to the reveal of its new cast of Natlan characters.</p>
<p>Every region in Genshin Impact draws heavy inspiration from real world countries and cultures, basing each region's general design, mythology, and music on these various real-world areas. Inazuma is representative of Japan, Fontaine of France, Mondstadt of Germany and the Netherlands, and so on.</p>
<p>Based on its character and region names, established mythology, and glimpses of what the area looks like in trailers, the upcoming Natlan region looks set to take great inspiration from countries and cultures that make up the Ring of Fire area surrounding the Pacific Ocean, which includes Latin America, Africa, and Aboriginal Australian cultures. But fans say that this isn't reflected in Natlan's character designs, and now the game's voice actors have joined in the criticism via social media.</p>
<p>"I really hope that a video game company listens to its fanbase when valid criticism is made multiple years in a row about the execution of its research and inclusion of elements/aspects of other cultures," said <a href="https://x.com/annejyatco/status/1812215122888437830">Anne Yatco</a>, who voices Raiden Shogun in the game.</p>

<p>Valeria Rodríguez, who voices Sucrose, <a href="https://x.com/ElvisBadger/status/1811938029709496606">shared a similar sentiment</a>: "If you're going to use real-world deities, RESPECT them. If you're basing off of real cultures, RESPECT THAT. I'm fine with things being inspired by various cultures - that's awesome. Representation is dope. But bare minimum do some research and show some cultural appreciation."</p>
<p>Rodríguez also compared Genshin Impact's representation of Ọlọrun, the supreme Yoruba deity, with that seen in popular MOBA Smite, showing the stark contrast of skin colour between the two. "This is unforgivable. Look at what a sick job Smite did with their own interpretation!!! IT'S NOT HARD!!!"</p>
<p>Alejandro Saab, who voices Cyno in Genshin Impact and Jing Yuan in Honkai: Star Rail, retweeted Rodríguez's Smite comparison, adding "You still got time to fix it", presumably addressing Genshin Impact developer HoYoverse.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted HoYoverse for comment.</p> <div>

<p>Genshin Impact's Albedo voice actor, Khoi Dao, also <a href="https://x.com/khoidaooo/status/1812140177126723759">addressed Ọlọrun's representation</a>: "If a game draws so heavily from real-world cultures, and bases a character on the supreme deity of Yoruba religion, and that character ends up looking like pale sasuke Batman, people are absolutely within their rights to demand better representation, ESPECIALLY when said game has a clearly-stated commitment to a *global* audience. I hope y'all keep making your voices heard, and I hope they listen."</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Genshin Impact has been called out by fans for its overwhelmingly light-skinned cast of characters, as the same criticisms have been continually made against Sumeru, a nation with heavy South Asian, Middle Eastern, and North African influences. However, this is the first time so many prominent HoYoverse voice actors have spoken up, which seems to have brought more attention to the issue.</p>

<p>The hashtag 'BoycottHYV' has been steadily gaining momentum on X since the Natlan character reveal, which fans are using to share their frustrations, petitions, and character redesigns. HoYoverse has yet to respond, and has continued to post Natlan character teases on their social media. The company isn't known for addressing controversies, but with Chinese players and its own voice actors criticising Natlan's characters, fans believe the company may be more likely to respond than usual.</p>
<p>Zeno Robinson, who voices Sethos in Genshin Impact, <a href="https://x.com/childishgamzeno/status/1812108021050318922">sums up</a> the worldwide dissatisfaction with Natlan's characters well: "If even your base audience, the Chinese fans, are asking for better representation/or character[s] with different shades of melanin, who are you making these characters for?"</p>

			<p>Sony might not have much this year coming from its own PlayStation Studios, but Astro Bot certainly is the notable exception. <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-revealed-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unveiled</a> during May's State of Play broadcast, Astro Bot <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-is-the-biggest-game-made-by-team-asobi-with-80-levels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> to be the biggest game made to date by Team Asobi with 80 levels.</p>
<p>Speaking to EDGE Magazine (<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Faaa-fallout-crpg-was-larians-alternative-pick-if-they-didnt-get-the-baldurs-gate-license-from-wizards-of-the-coast%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.magazinesdirect.com%2Faz-magazines%2F6936449%2Fedge-magazine-subscription.thtml&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=-120&amp;xuuid=0ad38a56c8611bae7d8f9493083ecd87&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue #400</a>), Team Asobi's Studio Director and Creative Director Nicolas Doucet revealed that the developer considered an open world design but decided against it to provide optimal variety.</p>
<p><em>Actually, we did consider, at first: should this be an open world game? In the end, we went for a level-based approach, because that was the one that gave us the most control over the game’s variety.</em></p>
<p>On that note, Doucet also said Astro Bot will continuously provide players with new mechanics to learn and experiment with to avoid repetition.</p>
<p><em>We don’t really stretch any mechanic too much until it becomes repetitive. We give you just enough to want more, and then move on to something else. We want it to be fresh, to be really surprising the player.</em></p>
<p>Power-ups will be key to the ever-changing mechanics, as Team Asobi only plans to use each two to three times throughout the entire game.</p>
<p><em>Usually, we use them twice. Up to three times maximum. The first time you use the power-up, you get introduced a little bit to what the next use case will be. Like a preview of what’s to come. There will also be free DLC coming that really takes the power-ups to a level of high precision.</em></p>
<p>Astro Bot, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-devs-explain-why-the-game-doesnt-support-ps-vr2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won't support PS VR2</a> despite the franchise's debut on the original PlayStation VR, is slated to launch for PlayStation 5 on September 26. Considering Sony's aggressive multiplatform strategy, we might see the game launching on PC, too, at some point in the next couple of years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/once-human-dev-struggles-to-cope-with-huge-number-of-players-as-steam-hit-exceeds-expectations<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Compensation for server queues coming.</h2></div><section><p>After a weekend of server problems, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/once-human"><u>Once Human</u></a> developer Starry Studio has revealed how it struggled to cope with the unexpected number of players who have descended upon the game.</p><p>Once Human is a free-to-play multiplayer open world survival game from Starry Studio, a developer owned by Chinese games company NetEase. It launched on PC on July 9 and quickly found an audience, with a huge peak concurrent player count of 231,668 on Steam.</p><p>It’s a big success for NetEase, but some players have faced frustration simply playing the game. Specifically, players found they were unable to play with friends because they were already playing on a server that was full due to newly imposed player limits, or had lengthy queue times.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Once Human July 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Now, in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139460/view/6145807877738837219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on Steam</a>, Starry Studio said the increase in the number of players over the weekend “exceeded our previous expectations” and in turn caused big server queues. Because of this, Starry Studio said it had “no other choice” but to limit the number of players on each server.</p><p>“But we'll admit that this has indeed caused inconvenience for some players, so we are working on improving that,” the developer added. “We apologize for the inconvenience.”</p><p>Starry Studio went on to explain exactly why too many players on a single server causes problems for Once Human. It’s a helpful insight into the way the game works and the challenges developers face when it comes to MMO-style games such as these.</p><p>“Once Human is an open-world survival building game where resources on the map are limited in numbers,” Starry Studio said. “If too many players get on the same server, they will have a hard time finding a suitable spot to create their territory. Additionally, some late-game content such as the Stronghold Conquest for PvP servers will be affected. According to our previous test data, we discovered that the current scenarios could offer a better gaming experience if the number of players on each server was limited between 6,000 and 8,000. That's why we've set a limit. Once that limit is exceeded, players will have to wait in queue. This is all for the online players to enjoy a better gaming experience.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>At the time of this article’s publication, nine of Once Human’s servers are completely full. Starry Studio suggested players play on other servers instead in order to get in the game. In the meantime, Starry Studio said it will soon raise the limit for each server, which should mean players can play on the server of their choice, “but this measure is not a long-term solution, so you should still try to avoid servers that seem too crowded.” An August update will add an invitation code feature so you can invite players to join your server even when the server is already full.</p><p>In the shorter term, a patch scheduled for July 18 will make some initial improvements, with plans to offer compensation “for those who spend too long waiting in a queue.”</p><p>“We understand that you eagerly want to have fun with your friends. We assure you that our team is hard at work resolving issues related to server loads, and we are doing all that we can to improve the queuing issue,” Starry Studio said.</p><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-hit-once-human-to-make-all-purchased-cosmetics-accessible-across-multiple-characters-following-backlash">Starry Studio responded to a backlash about how cosmetics work in Once Human, and promised changes</a>. Once Human has a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam, with some players expressing concern about everything from the game’s privacy policy to the use of the NetEase Launcher. In gameplay terms, players have hit out at mandatory seasonal resets and how they can affect your sense of progression and attachment to your character, as well as cosmetics being tied to individual characters.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>In order to bring Japanese games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review-step-inside-the-plumber-rpgs-back/1900-6418230/" data-ref-id="1900-6418230">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/1900-6418063/" data-ref-id="1900-6418063">Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> to America and other countries around the world, Nintendo uses teams of internal and external translators to fully localize each title. But you'd never know that from the games' credits, which exclude the names of the external translators. Now, a small number of external translators are speaking out about not being credited for their contributions to some of Nintendo's biggest titles.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/nintendo-s-systemic-policy-of-miscredting-is-harming-external-translators#close-modal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameDeveloper.com</a>, an anonymous former Nintendo employee--who currently works as a translator for Nintendo through an outside company called Localsoft--has detailed the onerous terms that the external translators have had to deal with. In addition to not getting any credit in the games themselves, the translators have to sign a 10-year NDA that prevents them from telling anyone they worked on the titles or even putting them on their resumes. </p><p>"I felt I would benefit from being able to state I worked on the title when offering my services to new clients. Not to mention that I actually spent a fair amount of time working almost exclusively for them," wrote an anonymous translator. "It is nigh impossible for translators to push back against this structure. Anyone trying will get blacklisted before getting anywhere. This is a field where taking an annual break can shut you out of months of work. No one cares what we think because there's literally nothing we can do about it, and that's even if we were willing to forfeit our livelihood for the greater good." </p><p>Nintendo's exclusion of the external translators from their rightful credit appears to be the company's stance on the issue. As noted above, the vast majority of the translators are unwilling to risk their livelihoods by calling out Nintendo's practices. But the only way this issue can be addressed is if the public pressure is great enough to convince Nintendo to change that policy. Otherwise the status quo will remain.</p>

Nintendo Switch Online members who have the premium expansion pack can now play the Game Boy Advance titles<span> Densetsu no Starfy, Densetsu no Starfy 2, and Densetsu no Starfy 3.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-game-hotel">Death Game Hotel</a> came out last week - a comically gory game in which players play casino-style card games around a table and raise the stakes by betting their own limbs. It's a VR game, which is a break from the norm for White Owls, the studio run by Hidetaka "Swery" Suehiro (then again, what is their "norm"?). It's also got a big multiplayer component, with lots of jovial bubble-popping and chicken-squeezing between the comedy blood spurts. And this taste of multiplayer mischief has Swery's head percolating. This game won't be his last dipped toe in the multiplayer ocean, he told us.</p>
<p>"In the future," said Swery, "I would like to leverage this experience to challenge myself with something new in the online multiplayer realm (something you probably haven't even imagined yet)."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's just a tease. He didn't say much more about future plans in our chat. We do know Swery is already working with Goichi Suda (aka Suda51) on a totally different deadly guesthouse - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2286600/HOTEL_BARCELONA/">Hotel Barcelona</a>. But whatever multiplayer mayhem is marinating in Swery's head, it isn't related to that.</p>

<p>For now, Swery is mostly keen to get players into the lobbies of the studio's VR gambling den, where each player has a goblet full of blood in front of them, into which they must drop their increasingly unhinged bets. He said the idea for a mortal multiplayer table game came during the Covid-19 pandemic, when workers at the studio started hanging out in VR to discuss work.</p>
<p>"During the 'Stay Home' phase, when we couldn't leave our homes or meet friends and colleagues, we at White Owls distributed VR headsets to all employees and held game meetings in VR," he said. "This experience led to the idea of creating a place where people could gather and connect, which heavily inspired this project."</p>
<p>This'll be Swery's 17th published game (at least according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidetaka_Suehiro">his wiki</a>), not surprising for someone who's been making video games since the 1990s, sometimes to a mixed reception. The lead developer of cult favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadly-premonition">Deadly Premonition</a> and cosy village cat-person simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-good-life">The Good Life</a>, communicated that he was satisfied with his studio's previous works. Even if the nature of making art means there's always something left undone. </p>
<p>"As a game creator, I believe all the works I've created are 'eternally unfinished' yet considered 'as complete as they’ll ever be.'"</p>

<p>When I asked if he had any advice to give to younger developers, he dispensed with any flowery talk and put it to me straight: know what you're making.</p>
<p>"Big companies make AAA titles by investing money," he said. "Indies try to compete with big titles by offering something unique that can't be experienced elsewhere. I think it’s important to look deep within and ask yourself what it is you are offering - and how - in order to avoid moving forward without a strategy."</p>
<p>Swery is also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/swery-on-the-cats-and-countryside-of-the-good-life"> a fully certified Buddhist monk who gives excellent appraisal of felines</a>, having previously given me some good advice on my cat's behaviour. When I told the studio head and fellow cat enjoyer I no longer lived with my precious moggy due to a breakup (sniff), he knew which tone to adopt.</p>
<p>"Everyone has different approaches to healing from the loss of a relationship with a beloved cat," he said. "Getting another cat (preferably a newborn kitten), reading cat blogs daily, finding another girlfriend who has a cat, or chatting with an AI pretending to be a cat – all could be some good options. </p>
<p>"As for me, I would calm my mind by believing that we will meet again someday (in another dimension). For now, let's play Death Game Hotel together and cheer up! Hang in there!"</p>
<p>Death Game Hotel is for sale <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/7371422382882960/?utm_medium=yt&amp;utm_source=social&amp;utm_campaign=1-aw-deathgamehotel-20240708&amp;utm_content=3&amp;utm_term=quest">on the Meta store</a> if you're Oculus'd up.  The developer also points out there's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/deathgamehotel">a Discord server</a> where staff at the studio arrange to play games, sometimes involving Swery too. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-kernel-exploit/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-series-x-new-kernel-exploit-collateral-damage-released-online.927330/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-kernel-exploit/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One SystemOS kernel exploit called Collateral Damage was released online today, giving users total control over the SystemOS virtual machine to do things normally not possible in retail mode.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/exploits-forsale/collateral-damage">Collateral Damage exploit</a>, which was developed by Emma Kirkpatrick and Lander Brandt, targets systems running kernel versions 25398.4478, 25398.4908, and 25398.4909 and uses the Game Script UWP application. As explained by one of the exploit's developers on <a href="https://x.com/carrot_c4k3/status/1799981812523172027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1799981812523172027%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X/Twitter</a>, this isn't a jailbreak, as SystemOS is the virtual machine where apps run, which is the same environment users get control over when enabling dev mode. As such, the exploit doesn't allow piracy but essentially gives users full control of SystemOS without dev mode.</p>
<p>Being the first release, the Collateral Damage Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S exploit is not fully reliable, as it relies on a CPU side channel as well as race conditions, which can fail. In case they do fail, the console will simply crash and reboot, so there should not be any danger of bricking a system. Additionally, the exploit is best used offline for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Even without this exploit, which could definitely lead to some interesting developments, the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S were already homebrew-friendly systems thanks to dev mode. Multiple emulators for older gaming systems can already run on the systems, and some recent developments may lead to Microsoft's current-generation systems emulating <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-run-playstation-3-games/">PlayStation 3 games</a> even before the PlayStation 5.</p>

            <p>
The Covid pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine were the biggest setbacks in development of Baldur's Gate 3, said CEO Swen Vincke.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Edge magazine, Vincke discussed how Larian closed a studio in St Petersburg, Russia, and was "fighting with embassies" to relocate staff.
</p>
<p>
"I had already thought about what we were going to do if it actually happened," said Vincke. "So the decision was instant: we can't stay there. We needed to move people away because, as these things go, you can almost predict that eventually there's going to be a mobilisation, and that meant that all my team was going to go to war."

</figure>
<p>

A joint task force of the developer's studio operations, finance and legal teams was then set up to facilitate the move.
</p>
<p>
"They did an incredible job, worked day and night to be able to get every single person a tailored solution to get them out of there," said Vincke. "I'm super-proud of them for doing that."
</p>
<p>
As a result, over 90 percent of staff from the St Petersburg team were relocated to other Larian studios.
</p>
<p>
"That meant that we started fighting with embassies and consulates," said Vincke. "It was really complicated."
</p>
<p>
Though of course worthwhile, this did cause setbacks in development.
</p>
<p>
"In a machine as complicated as an RPG, where everything's connected to everything, if you suddenly start ripping stuff out, the entire thing collapses," said Vincke. "Because things that were supposed to be done are not being done. It's not that they didn't try, but it was really, really hard. You could see the ripple effect of that lasting all through the end of development."
</p>
<p>
On a more positive note, the success of the game began to affect development due to all the award shows staff attended.
</p>
<p>
Baldur's Gate 3 won a huge number of awards, including top honours at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-sweeps-the-game-awards">The Game Awards</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-takes-home-best-game-and-four-more-awards-at-this-years-baftas">BAFTA Game Awards</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developers-use-award-show-win-to-address-state-of-the-industry">the DICE Awards</a>.
</p>
<p>
"I think it's great that you have a moment of celebration, but we still have award shows that we're going to," said Vincke. "Because they're important, and we really appreciate it, but it would be cool if everybody could agree to do it all at the same time."
</p>
<p>
And while Larian is of course grateful, Vincke said attending ongoing award shows "is surprisingly draining on the soul. I certainly didn't expect that. I think we've all been more emotional because we can't get closure. And you want to have closure at the end of a project.
</p>
<p>
"We sent rotating teams," he said. "So different people went to different award shows. It affects development - there's a lot of them." He added, laughing: "This has been a real problem."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-adds-official-modding-toolkit-this-autumn">Larian is adding modding tools to the game in September</a>. At a BAFTA talk last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mod-support-in-baldurs-gate-3-will-be-final-handover-moment-to-players-says-larian-ceo">Vincke stated this would be a final handover moment to players</a>.
</p>
<p>
"One of the big things for us, and the one that we're really working towards now, is the ability for players to mod [Baldur's Gate 3] themselves, because then they will be able to make their own things," said Vincke. "And I think that will be the point where we're going to say 'ok, now it's yours fully'."

			<p>The first official GTA VI trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-trailer-breaks-100-million-youtube-views-is-the-biggest-non-bts-video-ever-for-its-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set</a> new records right away, becoming the most-viewed YouTube video (except for two songs by South Korean boy band BTS) on its launch day. In just 34 hours, the trailer had already amassed 100 million views.</p>
<p>It's been a little over seven months since December 5, and the GTA VI trailer has now reached the impressive milestone of 200 million views. For comparison, the debut GTA V trailer only has around 111 million views despite having been on YouTube for twelve years. The trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto installment also helped its signature song, Tom Petty's Love Is a Long Road, mark a mind-boggling 36,979% increase in Spotify streams.</p>
<p>These figures once again reaffirm the incredible amount of hype for what is now undoubtedly the most anticipated game in the industry, following GTA V's 200 million units sold to date. In fact, according to Circana (formerly NPD), GTA VI is <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time when it launches.</p>
<p>Currently, Take-Two has <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">established</a> a Fall 2025 launch window for Grand Theft Auto VI. However, looking at Rockstar's recent track record, it is hard to imagine there won't be any delays. GTA V was originally slated to launch in Q2 2013 before being moved to September 17, 2013. Red Dead Redemption 2 fared even worse, suffering two major delays: from the second half of 2017 to <a href="http://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-2-delayed-screenshots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spring 2018</a> and later to <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-2-final-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 26, 2018</a>, the final launch date. That's more or less in line with the average of triple-A games, which also tend to see one or two delays.</p>
<p>Of course, it is also possible Rockstar Games has improved its internal development prediction model. GTA fans certainly are eager to play a brand new entry in the franchise, having already waited for nearly eleven years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-online-bottom-dollar-bounties-update-out-now-adding-bounty-hunts-dispatch-work-and-new-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues to update GTA Online</a>, which, as we had all assumed, essentially <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-rockstar-dev-says-kick-ass-gta-v-standalone-trevor-dlc-was-scrapped-to-milk-gta-onlines-cash-cow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannibalized </a>a promising GTA V story DLC with its incredible appeal.</p>

IGN has asked 2K for comment.</p><p>According to the site, the image is taken from a 2021 showreel that depicts an early demo build of the game, so it’s already years out of date and probably doesn’t reflect what fans can expect to play when the next BioShock eventually comes out.</p><p>It includes the expected first-person shooter perspective from the previous BioShock games, as well as a basic user interface and what’s called a ‘Ricochet Shotgun.’ We see what looks like BioShock-style plasmid powers in icon form, triggered by controller bumper button presses. It's hard to tell what these are meant to indicate, but one looks like an electricity bolt, which would be very BioShock. Another looks like a stopwatch, so perhaps there were, and still are, plans to be able to pause time during gameplay.</p><p>The character is facing what looks like a burning orb set atop a pedestal of some kind.

            <p>If there’s one series that can be relied upon to dole out 80-hour helpings of joy straight into my eager face at regularly scheduled intervals, it’s the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> brawler stylings of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/yakuza">Yakuza</a>/<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Like A Dragon</a>. One could, I believe, make a convincing argument for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-0">Yakuza 0</a> being - if not the best videogame ever made - then at least the <em>most</em> videogame. While this coming October’s Amazon series won’t be the <a href="https://youtu.be/6qKAM2UxFVs">first live action adaption</a> of Yakuza, I am hopeful its episodic format will give its characters a bit more room to breathe. Or, according to Kiryu actor Ryoma Takeuchi in an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/interview-ryoma-takeuchi-like-a-dragon-yakuza-kazuma-kiryu">interview with IGN</a>, to find the love they’ve always longed for.</p>

<p>“Rather than me becoming Kiryu, I had to create Kiryu from scratch,” Takeuchi told IGN Japan. This is music to my ears, honestly. It’s always reassuring to hear an actor not treat previous depictions of a character with so much reverence it becomes stifling, even if the interview makes it sound like Takeuchi has clearly spent a lot of time researching the games for his own portrayal. “I have great respect for the feelings of the fans,” Takeuchi says. “But when I play a character, I have to express them in my own way, so I can’t pay attention to the preconceptions of others.</p>

<p>Takeuchi told IGN he sees Kiryu as a man who’s “starved for love," saying ““I think we all unconsciously chase after what is missing in our lives, and we all want to be loved.” With this in mind, Takeuchi continues, “I thought about what Kiryu might be searching for in Kamurocho, as he strives to become the Dragon of Dojima. He wants a family, he wants love, and he doesn’t even realise how much this drives him.” And, yep, that’s Kiryu.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Takeuchi talks about honing Kiryu’s different fighting styles before and after the character’s prison sentence. “When the story starts in 1995, Kiryu’s fighting style is still rough and not very effective, because he has not formally learned martial arts and he is just using his instincts,” he says. “I wanted to portray him growing as a fighter, as he gradually becomes able to beat his opponents. So his fighting style in each of the two eras is very different.”</p>
<p>Takeuchi is obviously a bit more fresh-faced than the Dragon Of Dojima we know. But as long as he can lift a bicycle over his head and belt out Judgement at karaoke, he’s fine by me. I had a chat with the localisers of Yakuza: Like A Dragon a while back about translating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/like-a-dragons-localisation-team-explain-how-they-bring-the-series-singular-storytelling-to-the-west">the jokes and other fun nuances</a> of the series from Japanese to English, in which they detailed the subtleties of Kiryu and Ichiban being great mates who have each other's backs.</p>

			<p>Morthal may not be among the most stunning locations in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, but even a small city like it can look stunning with the help of modern technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lion_towers3d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leo Torres</a>, who has been remaking <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-remade-unreal-engine-5/">towns and cities</a> from the fifth entry in the series by Bethesda using Unreal Engine 5, shared today a new video showcasing recreation of the city with lore-accurate scale made in the 5.4 version of the engine as well as Nanite for all models and foliage and Lumen for global illumination and reflections. Needless to say, the end results look incredible, giving the town the visual identity it kind of lacked in the original game.</p>

<p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was released well over ten years ago, but it continues to receive plenty of attention from modders who have vastly improved the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-ray-tracing/">visuals.</a> Unfortunately, a proper remake of the game is nowhere in sight, and with Bethesda currently working on the sixth entry in the series, we may not see one in a very long time, if ever. The studio, thankfully, hasn't forgotten about its popular game, releasing the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1746860/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Anniversary_Upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anniversary Edition</a> to celebrate the game's 10th anniversary with new content and features. Who knows, maybe the 20th anniversary will be the right occasion to release a remake that would certainly be very well received.</p>

            <p>"Honey, I shrunk the first-person puzzler. Twice." This is how I like to imagine the designer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/supraworld">Supraworld</a> explaining the hijinks that unfold in his life. Supraworld, the sequel to toybox explorer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/supraland">Supraland</a>, is going to hit early access this year, say developers Supra Games in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/813630/view/6338336761809130584?l=english">an update post on Steam</a>. These are happy words for anyone who enjoyed 2019's dander among the sandcastles and erasers. A lot of games offer a "sandbox" but in Supraland, the entire world really did take place in exactly that - a sandbox out in a garden, full of toys. The sequel's launch into early access "might be in october," says the post. "We'll see."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Explaining why the studio has again decided to follow the early access route, Supra Games are straight-talking, calling it "a great advantage for feedback and motivation reasons." </p>
<p>"Seeing people play what you're making, you are being reminded why you're actually doing this and try to give people a better time instead of working on something in isolation forever.</p>
<p>"We also simply need the Early Access income because we're working on the game for 3 years now and production is expensive."</p>
<p>I like it when game devs speak plainly. Production <em>is</em> expensive. The previous game was always marketed with a similarly comical frankness. The Steam blurb, often reserved for high-falutin' game summaries, straight up tells you how much time Supraland can take. "Playtime 12-25h." And the game's trailer ends not with a poetic or catchy tagline beneath the title, but a pie chart showing how much of the game is devoted to "exploration," "puzzles", and "fighting". They may as well ask the prospective buyer: "Do you understand there is limited time on this earth? Are you a parent?" </p>
<p>Well, it pleased one dad, at least. In his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supraland-review">Supraland review</a> John (RPS in peace) called it "an absolute joy of a game. It really does stand comparisons with Portal, Zelda and Metroid, which is no mean feat."</p>
<p>In Supraworld, you'll be continuing the puzzling and nose-poking as an apprentice "solver" (who needs subtext, eh?) "Solvers are the most important people in this world," says the game's description, "because puzzle storms are rising all over the place, making people's lives harder."</p>

            <p>
It appears the credits for Elden Ring, revised after the release of DLC Shadow of the Erdtree, do not properly credit translators from Latin America.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer understands the revised credits now fully credit translators from Europe. Localisation staff have been listed, as well as a Special Thanks including all individual translators, all under Bandai Namco Europe.
</p>
<p>
However, translators from Latin America under Bandai Namco America have not been given the same courtesy. Thai translators have also not been listed individually by Bandai Namco Asia, beyond the name of the agency, unlike those for Chinese and Korean.

<p>

What's more, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lSeisyhrqk">original credits</a> for the game credits Brazilian Portuguese and Latin American Spanish translators individually, but the new credits remove these names and instead includes a generic Special Thanks message. 

</p>
<p>
Now that the revised credits overwrite the original, these translators are no longer individually credited.

The full, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ4uJrWBMak&amp;t=308s">revised credits have been uploaded to YouTube</a>. Further, translator Ramón Méndez has confirmed the European localisation teams are fully accredited.</p> <div>

This miscrediting of translation staff is in violation of the <a href="https://igda.org/sigs/credits/">International Game Developers Association game crediting policy</a>. This states: "Any person, be they contractor, freelancer, external agency employee, vendor, part time employee, or full time employee with billable contributions toward creation or publication of a game in any discipline must be credited."

</p>
<p>
As for external agencies, it states: "Employers must establish a contractual obligation to identify and credit vendors and contractors employed or contracted by an external agency to work on their project."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Bandai Namco for comment.
</p>
<p>
Just last week a report was published by Game Developer concerning external translators <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/external-translators-hired-for-nintendo-projects-bemoan-lack-of-credit-in-almost-every-big-title">not being properly credited in Nintendo games</a>. This followed a high profile case last year of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-translation-company-commits-to-change-after-leaving-staff-out-of-credits">translation staff being left out of the Baldur's Gate 3 credits</a>.

            <p>A screenshot purportedly taken from Cloud Chamber's upcoming BioShock game - codenamed "Parkside" - has popped up online.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/tUs50kO#ti0OL7P">Whilst the image itself</a> isn't particularly exciting - we can see a weapon, called the "ricochet shotgun" and some kind of weird glowing sphere, er, thing - we do get to see how the UI looked at the time the demo was created (thought to be around 2021), and get our first peek at some of the powers available to players.</p>

<p>BioShock fans of old will be familiar with the plasmids and vigors that complement your armoury, enabling you to shock enemies, set things on fire, or chuck them up in the air, and so on.</p>
<p>In this image, we can see three plasmid-like powers in the bottom-left corner. On the bottom-right seems to be an Electro-Shock like power, and next to it, a magnet, intimating magnetic or telekinetic powers.</p>
<p>On the top, however, is the icon of a stopwatch, which may hint that we'll get the opportunity to slow down or even stop time, perhaps?</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-bioshock-4-screenshot-surfaces-giving-us-look-early-look-at-ui-shotgun-and-more">MP1st</a>, which was first to report the screenshot, the image originates from "a 2K visual effects artists but for the sake of privacy, we are refraining from naming or linking their online profile".</p>
<p>More than a decade on from the release of BioShock Infinite, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshock-developer-ramping-up">the team working on a successor is now "ramping up"</a>.</p>
<p>Work to continue the BioShock series has been ongoing - if off and on - over the past 10 years.</p>

			<p>Rising PlayStation 4 PC emulator shadPS4 is now also able to boot last year's Red Dead Redemption Remastered.</p>
<p><span>The team behind the PS4 emulator has been making great progress recently, and as covered earlier this month, the emulator is <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-4-emulator-shadps4-bloodborne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already able to boot fan-favorite Bloodborne on PC</a>. Last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-emulator-improves-bloodborne-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we reported on additional improvements being made</a> when it comes to emulating the game on PC.&nbsp;</span>With a PC port of FromSoftware's PS4 hit title likely not happening, this is welcome development for many fans of the game. As it turns out, the team behind the promising emulator has now also managed to get Red Dead Redemption Remastered to boot on PC. Not only that, but the emulator also allows to access the game's main menu. We've included a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjVbfQQU-zY1N7RWkavDF-A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WIP video</a> of the emulator booting Red Dead Redemption Remastered below. Quite the news for the PS4 emulation scene indeed.</p>

<p>Red Dead Redemption Remastered was released for the PlayStation 4 (and Switch) last year. The game is a remastered version of the 2010 original. We've included some info from the original press release of the remaster below:</p>
<p><em>Relive, or experience for the first time, the story of former outlaw John Marston in the events immediately following the critically acclaimed 2018 blockbuster Red Dead Redemption 2.&nbsp;Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;also includes&nbsp;Undead Nightmare, the hallowed story expansion that reimagines the world of&nbsp;Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;as Marston fights to survive a relentless zombie horde and searches for a cure in a spooky, supernatural twist on the Western genre.</em><br>
<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>These new conversions of the original games were crafted specifically for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, and both are showcased at a framerate of 30 FPS, up to 1080p resolution on the Nintendo Switch and the PlayStation 4, up to 4K on the PlayStation 4 Pro, and in full 4K on the PlayStation 5 (via backwards compatibility).</em></p>

            <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> enjoyer-in-public Paul Tassi of Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/07/07/the-first-descendant-is-using-barely-changed-destiny-2-icons/">wrote an article</a> pointing out the similarities between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-first-descendant">The First Descendant</a>’s in-game icons and those used by Bungie’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> looter shooter. Nexon have since reached out to Tassi, saying they’re taking the concerns seriously, and will be make adjustments so that the imagery "clearly reflects the unique identity" of their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a>-Destiny hybrid GaaS shooter.</p>

<p>“It’s pretty clear that if these weren’t flat-out taken from Destiny they were copied almost exactly with those small additions or subtractions added,” wrote Tassi in the first article, sharing several comparison images like the one below. Tassi also points out comparisons between guns, enemies, some promotional art, and a skull icon.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/destiny-first-descendant-icons.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paul Tassi/Forbes.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Whether you think there’s any veracity to these comparisons or not - although let’s be honest, some of them are incredibly suspect - Nexon themselves decided to reach out to Tassi <a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1811595182577426907/photo/1">with a statement</a>. In short it basically says: uh, sorry about that, we’ll get right on it.</p>
<p>"The First Descendant, as a looter shooter game, was developed with a deep affection and respect for other games in the genre," said Nexon. "Destiny 2, being a globally renowned looter shooter game, is also personally admired and respected by the team, and it has served as an inspiration during the development process. We have taken the concerns raised seriously and decided to make adjustments to ensure that the imagery that may appear similar clearly reflects the unique identity of our game."</p>
<p>I don’t really care much about The First Descendant, although if Nexon go back and draw moustaches and glasses on all the offending icons, I will champion it until the day it dies. Despite my personal lack of enthusiasm for getting involved with another forever-shooter right now, I did chat to Nexon about how they’ve designed their endgame to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-descendants-endgame-wont-be-about-meaningless-dps-or-piling-on-specs">not rely on "meaningless DPS" or "piling on specs"</a>, which is admirable.</p>

            <p>
UK retailer GAME will soon end the in-store sale of POSA (Point of Sale Activated) cards that offer currency or in-game credit, such as funds for the Nintendo eShop, Eurogamer understands.
</p>
<p>
Once again, the move is a casualty of the brand's increasing integration within the Frasers Group, and the adoption of the wider company's more generic till software. </p>
<p>
GAME, which has been owned by Frasers Group since 2019, now operates mostly via concessions housed within other Frasers Group chains, such as Sports Direct and House of Fraser.

<p>
So far this year, GAME has ditched the ability to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">trade-in games and buy pre-owned stock</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-shutting-reward-scheme-next-month-and-you-should-use-any-remaining-credit-while-you-can-still-can">closed its long-running membership scheme</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-dropping-xbox-all-access-offering-later-this-month">ended its support for Xbox All Access</a> and, soon, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-to-end-in-store-pre-orders">place in-store pre-orders for new releases</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The sale of POSA cards will be the next thing to go, and will no longer be offered within a matter of weeks, GAME staff have told Eurogamer - despite the cards' widespread sale in many other high street stores and supermarkets. 
</p>
<p>
An important and slightly technical distinction here is that digitally fulfilled codes (which can include Xbox or PlayStation store credit) generated and printed on a receipt will still be supported. 
</p>
<p>
But those physical cards, often sold with a pre-set value of £15, £25, £50 or more, will no longer be purchasable - at least in stores. 
</p>
<p>
Online, <a href="https://www.game.co.uk/en/gift-cards-and-posa">GAME's website page that sells POSA cards</a> is empty and broken. 
</p>
<p>
GAME did not respond to Eurogamer's request for comment.

            <p>The early access beta for Firewalk's 5v5 sci-fi shooter Concord has been extended.</p>
<p>The beta - which was initially meant to wrap up last night - will now run until this evening, culminating at 8pm UK time on 15th July.</p>
<p>This beta includes four maps to try out: Freewater, Star Chamber, Water Hazard, Shock Risk. It also has three modes: Clash Point, Trophy Hunt and Cargo Run. In addition, all 16 Freegunners (the player characters) are available to put through their paces during the beta.</p>

<p>Last week, developer Firewalk announced that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-early-access-beta-weekend-now-open-to-all-playstation-plus-users">early access beta would be made available for all PS Plus users</a>, in addition to those who had pre-ordered the game. On PC, the beta remained only for those who had already pre-ordered, with a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3011460/charts/">concurrent peak of 1124 players</a> at the time of writing.</p>
<p>These numbers will likely rise later this week, when the Concord team hosts its open beta.</p>
<p>The open beta runs from 18th - 21st July, and will add another new mode known as Area Control, as well as an additional map called Bone Mines. </p>
<p>
Those on PS5 will be able to pre-download for access to the open beta from Wednesday, 17th July at 10am PDT. That's 6pm for those of us in the UK.</p>
<p>"If you plan on joining us for both early access and open beta, your progress will carry over between the weekends," the Concord team said in a blog post last week. "However, please keep in mind that your progress from either beta will not carry over to our official launch on 23rd August."</p>
<p>As for rewards, those who take part in Concord's betas will get a Frog Weapon Charm (Frog, stands for "From Orbit to Ground", and is the name of the Northstar's drop ship, not a literal frog, Firewalk explained), a Star Flare Icon and Business Card.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Heads up: we’re going to be extending the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ConcordBeta?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ConcordBeta</a> availability to Monday, July 15th, 12pm PDT | 9pm CEST | 4am JST—so make sure you get in those extra rounds, earn those levels, and extract all the Blue Buddies that you can! <a href="https://t.co/ZPUx7T8zUA">pic.twitter.com/ZPUx7T8zUA</a></p>— Concord (@PlayConcord) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayConcord/status/1812564007250792524?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>For more on the hero shooter, our Chris went hands on with Concord earlier this year. "Concord can't help but feel like many of the other competent games made by other highly competent former-developers of other big, successful multiplayer games," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-feels-like-a-load-of-brilliant-games-combined-but-is-that-enough">Eurogamer's Concord preview</a>.</p>
<p>"In other words: a game that places individual moments of that high-level competency within its various disciplines - diverse, fleshed-out characters! Satisfying gunfeel! Intelligently-limited verticality! Sensible environment design! No gameplay-affecting microtransactions! - above an overall uniqueness of vision that binds it together."</p>

			<p>The Halo series developer 343 Industries will only supervise the development of future entries in the series, as Microsoft is reportedly not confident in 343 internal developing anymore.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/BathrobeCast/status/1812578845108625769?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1812578845108625769%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bathrobe Spartan</a>, who has proven reliable regarding the popular series in the past, recently revealed some new information on the franchise's future and its developer. According to the report, based on information received from current and former 343 Industries employees, the studio was downsized in 2023 and 2024, going from around 500 employees to less than 280. Internal communications and marketing teams were also cut, with Microsoft now managing them.<br>
As Microsoft is no longer confident in 343 Industries' internal development, future entries in the series will be developed by other studios, with the series developer focusing only on the concept and pre-production phases and supervising development.</p>
<p>Regarding future Halo games, Bathrobe Spartan revealed that two big projects are currently in the pre-production phase. One of them will feature multiplayer with a much higher number. What these projects are is unknown, but it is being speculated they are a Halo CE Remake and the next main entry in the series, the latter probably the project featuring the aforementioned multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>Despite seemingly doing well on the market, Halo Infinite reportedly didn't meet Microsoft's targets. As such, only Forge will continue to be supported after content that is already in development has been released. It is a shame that the game is somewhat considered a failure, at least by Microsoft, as it is a very solid entry in the series, as highlighted by Chris in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/halo-infinite-review/">review.</a></p>
<p>The latest entry in the series, the aforementioned Halo Infinite, is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

But according to an age-rating for the game Link is playable, too.</p><p>The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) published its <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39983/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">listing</a> for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, and it mentions that players can control Link to defeat enemies using his famous sword and arrow attacks. Zelda is also mentioned in the description as using a magic wand to summon creatures for battle, as revealed in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom’s debut trailer, below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here’s the The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom rating summary, still live at the time of this article’s publication, in full:</p><blockquote>This is an adventure game in which players assume the role of Zelda as she attempts to dispel rifts throughout Hyrule and rescue Link. From a ¾-overhead perspective, players explore various environments while fighting stylized enemies (e.g., humans, creatures). As Link, players use a sword and arrows to defeat enemies; Zelda can use a magic wand to summon creatures (e.g., wind-up knights, pig soldiers, slime) for battle. Some enemies can be defeated by being set on fire; other creatures dissolve into mist when defeated. Battle sequences are somewhat frenetic, with several enemies attacking/fighting at once.</blockquote><p>So, how might Link be playable in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom? Fans already have plenty of theories, the most common of which is that the game starts with a prologue in which a fully kitted out Link is playable before he is spirited away and replaced with a playable Zelda for the remainder of the game.</p><p>Indeed, the The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom debut trailer teases such a setup, with an opening fight between Link and franchise villain Ganon that perhaps is actual gameplay rather than a cutscene as most had assumed it to be. The question now is whether Link will also be playable in any other section of the game, or whether it’s Zelda only from then on out.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom – 28 New Screenshots From June 2024's Nintendo Direct</h3></div></output><p>Upon its reveal, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom sparked all sorts of fan theories, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-fans-are-already-theorizing-when-and-where-echoes-of-wisdom-takes-place">including where and when it takes place in the Zelda timeline</a>.

Confirming Concord launches in both physical and digital standard editions for $39.99 / £34.99 / €39.99, Pam Piscitello, director of marketing and operations at developer Firewalk, said in a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/concord-is-now-available-to-pre-order-early-access-and-beta-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation Blog</u></a> that this full experience includes all 16 playable characters, 12 maps set on various worlds, and six team-based modes.

            <p>I'm not sure it's physically or metaphysically possible to overfeed the Maw, but this week we put that desperate daydream to the test. There aren't any mega-sequels in the offing, none of yer Call Of Dutifuls, just an absolute deluge of neat and nifty originals - a deluge of such proportions I have been forced to unsheathe my HTML hammer and smash the customary single paragraph of PC game releases in twain.</p> <!--more-->
<p>On Monday 15th July, we have lunar base-builder <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1465470/The_Crust/">The Crust</a>, handsome 8-bit platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1459010/Fallen_Leaf/">Fallen Leaf</a>, and gelatinous roguelike shmup <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1536620/Galactic_Glitch/">Galactic Glitch</a>. On Tuesday 16th July, there's Strange Scaffold's latest worrying oddity, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3011440/CLICKOLDING/">Clickolding</a>, in which a guy just wants to watch you use a clicker in a motel room, and the bright and breezy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flock">Flock</a>, a fluttering creature-collector from the makers of Wilmot's Warehouse. I was going to call Wednesday 17th July a day of blessed, restorative oblivion, but then I glimpsed cyberpunk noir detective game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1939970/Nobody_Wants_to_Die/">Nobody Wants To Die</a>, and folkloric metroidvania <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1614440/B_Path_of_the_Teal_Lotus/">Bō: Path of the Teal Lotus.</a>
</p><p>You'll need a day off midweek, because on Thursday 18th July, it all gets a bit "autumn 1998". In no particular order, please be upstanding for: the amphibian shadow-hopping of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/schim">Schim</a>, the alpine slaycationing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeons-of-hinterberg">Dungeons Of Hinterberg</a>, the gunpowdery sorcery of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn">Flintlock: Siege Of Dawn</a>, the mucky early access kingdom management of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/norland">Norland</a>, and the immortal headshrinking of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-therapist">Vampire Therapist</a>. And on Friday 19th July, finally, a colourful closing ceremony in the shape of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kanitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess</a>, aka <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-was-the-best-game-i-played-at-summer-game-fest">the best game I played at Summer Game Fest</a>. Oh, and catacomb-pillaging co-opper Dungeonborne. Thanks for ruining my tidy finish, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeonborne">Dungeonborne</a>.</p>
<p>Are there any important PC releases we've missed? I sincerely hope not. It may not be possible to overfeed the Maw, but it's definitely possible to give the Maw the runs, and you don't want to be within a thousand feet of that particular Altered World Event. Have a jolly week of PC gaming all.</p>

			<p>Playground Games' Forza Horizon 5 has reached 40 million players around the globe, it's been revealed.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/SnapBlastPLAY/status/1812623587011940361?t=2TWlpv2ylFRCJAxN_gEiQg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> on X by 'SnapBlastPLAY', and <a href="https://x.com/klobrille/status/1812648759278579885" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picked up</a> by known Xbox insider Klobrille, Playground's most recent entry in the Horizon series was played by 40 million players across both Xbox and PC since the game's launch in 2021. Of course, this doesn't mean active players playing the racing game, but those who at least downloaded the game. More details about this stat are unknown, but it's quite impressive nonetheless. Looking at previous reached player numbers from previous years, it's clear that Horizon 5 reaches quite the amount of players each month. Back in November of 2021, shortly after the game's launch, Xbox's Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-breaks-4-5-million-players-milestone-largest-xbox-game-studios-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the game reached more than 4.5 million players. Here's what we wrote about the racing game in our launch review back then:</p>
<p>"Forza Horizon 5 is yet another step up for the series and arguably the best racing game ever made", we <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. "Offering a host of content across a fantastic representation of Mexico, its varied terrain and scenery, there's so much to explore and race. A massive roster of cars will perform all of these, each feeling different from the others, with a variety of upgrade and tuning options almost matching those of simulation titles. While there are a few minor niggles here and there, they are nearly so small as to be hardly worth mentioning. All in all, it's impossible not to recommend this for anybody, regardless of them being a fan of racing games or not, as this is that good."</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 5 is available now worldwide on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. The game has been available on Game Pass since day-one.</p>

		<div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Once you get over the terrifying idea that your shadow is not only alive, but also capable of wandering around on its own, SCHiM is a delightful and whimsical indie game that gently plays with your preconceptions.</p>
<p><iframe title="SCHiM - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YHSWlEFJYs8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As with the best games, SCHiM’s central mechanic needs very little explanation.&nbsp; Schims are a person’s soul or spirit. They are capable of leaving their owners body – is that creators? Do we ‘create’ our spirits? – taking on the form of adorable inky frog-like creatures. These can hop from shadow to shade, but never out in the open on their own for long, with a tether to their owner ensuring that they snap back to their original location.</p>


<p>The opening of the game takes you through a person’s early life, with you and your Schim – who is fundamentally your shadow – initially riding tricycles, jumping on trampolines and generally having a good time, before steadily growing up, taking in highlights like graduation and meeting a girl, before experiencing some of the less enjoyable aspects of life like break-ups and getting fired from your job.</p>
<p>That’s when you have ‘the incident’. While running for a bus your person falls over, somehow severing the connection between him and his Schim, and on discovering that he’s somehow shadow-less, he panics and runs away. This leaves you to make your shadowy way back to your owner, hopping, bouncing and skulking through the shade.</p>


<p>All of this storytelling is done without a single line of dialogue or text, and it’s done with a clear sense of intent and purpose, as well as a playful eye for how to tell a story without words. The simple but elegant art style helps here, and the world has a solidity and a realness to it that feels utterly grounded, while the shadow creatures have an adorable Ghibli-esque charm to them. You’ll nestle in amongst other shadows as you invade their turf, and little touches such as cars’ larger, sleepier shadows eyeing you with annoyance really brings Schim to life.</p>
<p>Despite playing like a platformer, Schim is as much a puzzle game as anything else. Working out your route towards your objective can be fiendishly difficult, and there were times my sanity started to fray. You can make one expansive leap from a shadow, and if you don’t immediately land on another one you can make a drastically shorter second jump. This is often handy for making a slight correction, but no use whatsoever if you’re stuck with a large area to try and clear.</p>

<p>You can back yourself into a bit of a shadowy hole at times, and while you can restart each level, that can mean losing a bunch of progress. It doesn’t happen too often though, with a solution eventually showing itself. There’s multiple ways for your shadow to interact with the world, from bouncing on power cables to switching traffic lights, and its these that open up the path ahead. Sometimes it’s just a change of perspective you need, swinging the camera around to reveal an unseen shadow lurking behind a bin.</p>
<p>Some of the frustration is melted away by the tuneful electronic soundtrack that gently tootles along in the background. It feels especially Nintendo-like in nature, reminding me of the background noodling in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/01/51-worldwide-games-clubhouse-review/">51 Worldwide Games</a>, with an emphasis on the soothing side of things. SCHiM is a vibe, and I really bought into it.</p>

<p>While they’re utterly different games, SCHiM has the same gentle touch as Untitled Goose Game, and that’s the closest, and greatest comparison I could make. It’s not mechanical, but there’s an atmosphere and a sensation that the two titles share, not least in puzzling out the way forward, and the release of calming endorphins when you work it all out.</p>

			<p>In last month's Nintendo Direct, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced-zelda-starring-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom would finally put the titular character in the spotlight nearly forty years after the franchise's first installment. However, as <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39983/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), Link will be playable, too.</p>
<p><em>This is an adventure game in which players assume the role of Zelda as she attempts to dispel rifts throughout Hyrule and rescue Link. From a ¾-overhead perspective, players explore various environments while fighting stylized enemies (e.g., humans, creatures). As Link, players use a sword and arrows to defeat enemies; Zelda can use a magic wand to summon creatures (e.g., wind-up knights, pig soldiers, slime) for battle. Some enemies can be defeated by being set on fire; other creatures dissolve into mist when defeated. Battle sequences are somewhat frenetic, with several enemies attacking/fighting at once.</em></p>
<p>It is presently unclear whether both characters will be switchable at will or not. New information will likely be shared by Nintendo soon, considering that The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is slated to launch in just over two months, on September 26. Here's an official overview of the upcoming Nintendo Switch exclusive:</p>
<p><em>Across the vast lands of Hyrule, strange rifts have appeared and have taken many people, including Link. Now alone, Zelda meets the fairy Tri,&nbsp;receives a mysterious staff called the Tri Rod, and sets off on a journey across Hyrule to save her kingdom. By waving the Tri Rod at a table she found, Zelda learned how to create an imitation of it called an Echo. Once you learn an Echo of something, you can recreate it whenever you'd like. Even if there's a wall blocking your path you can create Echoes of tables to get a leg up. You can create wooden boxes of old beds and unusual things like water blocks. How you use them separately or together is entirely up to you.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, there's a <a href="https://wccftech.com/live-action-zelda-movie-officially-in-production-nintendo-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live action The Legend of Zelda movie in production</a> at Sony Pictures Entertainment. It will be directed by Wes Ball (known for directing the Maze Runner trilogy and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes), while the screenplay will be handled by Derek Connolly, who worked on the Jurassic World trilogy, Kong: Skull Island, Pokémon: Detective Pikachu, and Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Global Gaming Revenue to Reach $300 Billion in Next Three Years]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/global-gaming-revenue-300-billion/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/global-gaming-revenue-300-billion/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It’s no big secret that the games industry is becoming something of a cash cow. More free-to-play games laden with microtransactions are emerging every day, and over time, the cost of investing in a console and an array of games is rising. That’s inflation for you, but for all their complaining, gamers are keeping up with the flow.</p>



<p>It was recently estimated that, as a result of these trends, the global gaming industry’s revenue will reach epic proportions soon, hitting more than $300 billion by 2027.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-money-money-money">Money, Money, Money</h2>



<p>In a financial forecast <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/business/brandwagon-global-revenues-in-the-video-game-industry-to-exceed-307-billion-by-2027-says-bain-amp-company-3553679/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Bain &amp; Company</a>, it was suggested that the global gaming revenue will secure a CAGR of 9% between now and 2027. This will take the revenue cap from $199 billion in 2022 to a whopping $307 billion by 2027. The report highlighted that young gamers aged 13 – 17, a very impressionable market, now spend 40% more time playing games than engaging with other media, such as television shows.</p>



<p>With landmark investments and acquisitions taking place – such as Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision – more money is floating around than ever before. Every vertical, from esports to mobile gaming, is undergoing growth at the moment. These analysts have also been studying the rise of streamers and ‘gaming influencers’. Over time, they’re becoming multimedia superstars, pulling in millions of viewers and netting insane revenue simply for broadcasting video games online.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of money out there, and the CAGR is nuts. Before long, gaming will be more valuable and powerful than the movie, music, or television industries. As technology is only becoming more advanced, it’s only a matter of time. It helps that there are games on the horizon – like GTA 6 – that will pull in billions of dollars by themselves.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[XDefiant’s Esports Scene Could Be Coming One Step Closer]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-esports-scene-coming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xdefiant%E2%80%99s-esports-scene-could-be-coming-one-step-closer.927186/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-esports-scene-coming/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>XDefiant was built as a competitive shooter that would one day play host to a vibrant esport scene. It’s a free-to-play first-person shooter that boasts all the elements of a competitive ecosystem, including a range of character types and roles, objective-based game modes, and a clear skill gap and meta. However, the groundwork for a competitive landscape is yet to be laid.</p>



<p>That could be set to change. Recently, dataminers uncovered an array of information from XDefiant’s files, including things like a Free-For-All mode and anime-themed weapon skins. They also found something that could suggest an esports scene is coming one step closer.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-laying-the-foundation">Laying the Foundation</h2>



<p>I caught up with Ubisoft’s Neale Maker at the BLAST R6 Manchester Major in May and he explained that XDefiant’s esports scene will likely start to surface in ‘Year Two’ of the game. He was adamant that it <strong>is </strong>in the pipeline, but various elements have to be added to the game to accommodate it.</p>



<p>According to dataminers, one of those core elements is on the way.</p>



<p>It was recently discovered that custom games and spectator modes are in development for XDefiant as we speak. On Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/TxLim_/status/1811417048851104081" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TxLim_ circulated</a> information related to a series of elements found in the game’s code:</p>



<ul>
<li>Countdowns</li>



<li>Kicking/moving players</li>



<li>Custom competitive rulesets</li>



<li>Game mode modifiers</li>
</ul>



<p>With the introduction of custom games and a spectator system, XDefiant comes increasingly closer to being one of the next best esports games. All that’s now needed is a one-life mode like Search and Destroy, and the game is ready to go.</p>
