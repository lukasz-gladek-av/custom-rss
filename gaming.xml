			<p>The Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S may soon receive a price increase, judging from what a big European retailer did just as the new month began.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-series-s-and-x-get-overnight-price-increase-in-french-retailer-micromania.1178412/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, French retailer Micromania has increased the price of both Microsoft's current-generation systems overnight. All the SKUs available from the retailer have seen a €50 price increase, and the timing suggests that this price adjustment could have been made ahead of an official announcement coming in the next few days.</p>
<p>The current economic situation worldwide is making it difficult for console manufacturers to maintain steady prices for their systems, so seeing an official price increase for the Xbox Series X wouldn't be surprising, however unfortunate it is.<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">&nbsp;</a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last month</a>, Sony increased the price of the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand due to the challenging economic environment, high inflation, and fluctuating exchange rates.</span> The system's price has been unchanged in the United States to date.</p>
<p>If the economic situation continues to be as challenging as it is today, gaming will definitely get more and more expensive down the line. While it is not a real price increase like the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 increases, the Nintendo Switch 2's launch price, which may <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-us/">increase in the future</a>, was higher than most analysts predicted, suggesting that next-generation systems from Sony and Microsoft will likely be priced much higher than most expect, though <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/">handheld</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-once-again-teased-by-phil-spencer/">offerings</a> could mitigate this issue.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo's partnership with Lego is continuing this summer with a fresh wave of Super Mario and Animal Crossing sets, including the first appearance of some fan-favourite characters.
</p>
<p>
In Nintendo's general Super Mario range, you'll be able to add Captain Toad via a new playset featuring the intrepid explorer at his campsite. Very cute. 
</p>
<p>
The Mario Kart range, meanwhile, adds an interactive Lego Mario and Standard Kart set, as well as a set containing Wario and King Boo (thanks, <a href="https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/lego-super-mario-summer-2025-sets-include-wario-captain-toad-prince-florian-and-more/">Jay's Brick Blog</a>).
</p>
<p>
Other Mario sets include a Toad House and a Bowser's Castle playset. For those looking to splash a bit more cash, there's a 1251-piece Prince Florian and Castle Bowser set inspired by Super Mario Wonder to tempt you.

<p>
Three more Lego sets also join the Animal Crossing range, bringing a pair of houses with villagers Fuschia, Stitches and Fang, plus a further house with Goldie. 
</p>
<p>
But the star of the show here is clearly Blathers' Museum, a 543-piece set that features the building's facade, as well as a fountain and dinosaur skeleton exhibit. Oh, and Blathers himself of course, hoo.
</p>
<p>
All of the above sets are due to go on sale from 1st August, with pre-orders live shortly via Lego.com. Anything take your fancy?
</p>
<p>Further down the line, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-boy-is-the-next-nintendo-console-officially-getting-the-lego-treatment">Lego has already announced a Game Boy set due later in 2025</a>, and a full <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-announced-coming-2026">Lego Pokémon range that's coming in 2026</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>HLX, the project thought to be Half-Life 3, is being widely playtested ahead of a possible summer reveal and winter release, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during a recent livestream, Tyler McVicker, who proved to be reliable regarding Valve leaks and rumors in the past, commented on the current state of the HLX project which has recently been referenced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-release-optimization/">updates for other games like Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2</a>, saying that it is being playtested so religiously and so widely that multiple people are willing to talk about it openly. As such, details on the game's plot are already circulating.</p>
<p>Commenting on what type of game the Half-Life 3 HLX project will be, Tyler McVicker confirmed it won't be a VR game like Alyx, and its procedural generation features won't have anything to do with terrain generation or other roguelike mechanics. These features will essentially be the next step for a system like the one powering the Left 4 Dead Director, which will influence features like doors, physics, props, enemy types, and NPCs.</p>
<p>While no official announcement has been made, things seem to be looking up for Half-Life 3, according to the leaker. The HLX project has moved along more than other similar projects, and it's currently playable from beginning to end, content or, at the very least, mechanics are probably locked at this point, and the development team is focused on optimization and polishing. As such, the leaker believes the game could finally be revealed this summer for a winter release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ask Me Anything - HLX/HL3 Discussion - Letting off Steam - April 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l_Z9IOIWKHg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Even if the HLX project is not Half-Life 3, another entry in the series would be quite welcome, considering Half-Life Alyx is over 5 years old, and fans of the series had to make do with other series' projects like the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/">Half-Life 2 RTX demo</a>. Thankfully, it may take too long to learn if the beloved series by Valve is indeed making a comeback soon.</p>

            <p>In a year that has so far seen some demanding giants like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, I have found myself routinely playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1190000/Car_Mechanic_Simulator_2021/">Car Mechanic Simulator 2021</a>, a four-year-old sim that has you repeatedly changing the brake pads on busted vehicles and scavenging old engine parts from a nearby junkyard. So I feel a quiet delight to learn of the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/car-dealer-simulator">Car Dealer Simulator</a>, due to release next month, which will let me not only fix up old bangers, but also sell the absolutely banjaxed pieces of trash to unsuspecting bozos. Heh heh heh. Yes. YES.</p>

<p>The sim is due out May 29th. Your job is simple. "Buy low, fix up, and sell high," says the game's Steam blurb. You will be working at a run-down dealership (mis)managed by a country singer lookin' fella named Little Sam. But work hard enough and you'll take over the business. You'll have to diagnose and fix issues with each vehicle, but you'll also turn a blind eye to a few problems too. Put some paint over that badly corroded crossbar. They'll never notice.</p>
<p>"Presenting a car to the customer requires a few tricks," say the developers in the game's description. "Washing, good photos, and an engaging advertisement will be your allies. Highlight the car’s strengths in your listing, but remember—every car has its hidden flaws. Customers buy with their eyes, so use the shine of the paint, a full tank, and quality photos to your advantage."</p>

<p>As someone who recently bought a used car only to find that half the steering apparatus was rotten and two tires were the wrong bloody size, I am excited to relive my experience from the other dastardly perspective. This is how we build understanding. Embrace the jerk. Become the jerk. (A trick I like to do when I'm short of money in Car Mechanic Simulator 2021 is to take on a job and strip the customer's car for parts to sell. It's okay, I always rebuild their vehicle... Eventually.) </p>
<p>Car Dealer Simulator has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3413480/Car_Dealer_Simulator_Demo/">a demo on Steam</a> for anyone looking to give it a go. Developers Garage Monkeys previously made two related sims: Car Washer Simulator and Car Rental Simulator. Both allowing players to run reputable and respected business ventures, I'm sure. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Evil Dead: The Game is being removed from sale on PC, PlayStation and Xbox, publisher Saber Interactive has announced. 
</p>
<p>
The multiplayer horror game's online servers will remain online for the time being for those who have bought and played Evil Dead: The Game already, Saber continued, but no new players will now be able to join.
</p>
<p>
Launched in May 2022, today's announcement comes just ahead of Evil Dead: The Game's third anniversary. But development on new content for the game had already ceased, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/last-years-multiplayer-evil-dead-game-wont-get-new-content-switch-version-canned">planned port for Nintendo Switch was scrapped</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We can confirm we've begun the process of removing the game from digital storefronts," Saber wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1493750/view/501697399294526021">statement on Evil Dead: The Game's Steam page</a>. "Anyone who has purchased the game will still be able to play it as we plan to keep our servers online for everyone.
</p>
<p>
"We want to extend a sincere thank you to our community, to those who have been part of the game from the very beginning, and those who have recently joined us. We appreciate all of your support."
</p>
<p>
Evil Dead: The Game is an asymmetrical multiplayer game featuring characters from the Evil Dead movies, including Bruce Campbell's Ash Williams, facing off against the Deadite hordes. 
</p>
<p>
The project was supported by additional maps, modes, classes and characters, though this soon fizzled out as it became clear the game had not found enough of an audience. 
</p>
<p>
"Evil Dead: The Game works best when it allows you to be the demon, which also means allowing you to be the director," Christian Donlan wrote, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/evil-dead-the-game-understands-evil-dead-the-movies-better-than-i-expected">saying it reflected the franchise's films better than expected</a>. "Gimme some sugar, baby."

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> has been played by over two million people, Ubisoft has announced, while hinting at more from the franchise to come.</p>
<p>The Lost Crown, released in January 2024, was the first new game in the series since 2010's middling The Forgotten Sands, arriving alongside The Rogue Prince of Persia from Evil Empire that remains in early access.</p>
<p>"You've revived the legend," reads a post on social media. "The Prince is back, and believe us - he's just warming up."</p>

<p>The Lost Crown sold 1.3m copies in its first year, with overall players now reaching over two million thanks to its inclusion on Ubisoft's subscription and PS Plus, as well as its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-comes-to-mobile-next-month">recent mobile release</a>.</p>
<p>However, French outlet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HgkIyq0emY">Origami</a> reported last October the team behind the game had been disbanded and it would not receive a sequel, owing to its commercial performance.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-development-team-disbanded">follow-up statement to Eurogamer</a>, the game's senior producer Abdelhak Elguess confirmed "most" of the team had "shifted to other projects that will benefit from their expertise".</p>
<p>He added: "We know players have a love for this brand and Ubisoft is excited to bring more Prince of Persia experiences in the future."</p>

<p>As The Lost Crown has reached the end of its post-launch roadmap, it's unclear precisely how the prince is "just warming up", as per that social media post.</p>
<p>Presumably, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-the-second-act-update-effectively-relaunches-the-game-makes-prince-no-longer-purple">more updates are on the way to The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> ahead of a supposed full release out of early access.</p>
<p>There's also the forthcoming, and much-delayed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-now-targeting-2026-gets-briefest-of-trailers">Sands of Time remake that's now targeting a 2026 release</a>.</p>
<p>But will there be more sidescrolling Metroidvania action from The Lost Crown team?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sweeney told IGN at the time that he considered it a long-term investment in Epic and Fortnite’s future, insisting Epic could afford to keep up the fight for decades to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sweeney’s ongoing battle to get Fortnite back on iPhones and Android phones while avoiding paying store fees is well-documented. The gist is this: Epic doesn’t want to pay the now standard 30% store fees on revenue made on mobile games. Instead, it wants to run the likes of Fortnite through its own mobile store, the Epic Games Store, without Apple and Google getting in the way and gobbling up its profit.

Unlawful here, unlawful there.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apple will now be referred to federal prosecutors for violating the U.S. court order. "Apple’s continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated," U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said. "This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gonzalez Rogers referred Apple and one of its executives, Alex Roman, vice president of finance, to federal prosecutors for a criminal contempt investigation into their conduct in the case.

            <p>
A major European retailer has raised the price of Xbox Series X and both variants of the Xbox Series S overnight, prompting speculation of a wider price hike.
</p>
<p>
Xbox fans spotted the increases at French retail giant Micromania this morning (thanks, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-series-s-and-x-get-overnight-price-increase-in-french-retailer-micromania.1178412/">ResetEra</a>), and noted that each model was now €50 more expensive. 
</p>
<p>
The suggestion here is that Micromania has pushed an imminent price rise live early, before Xbox announces the changes itself. Eurogamer understands that wider price rises are on the table, and has contacted Microsoft for comment.

</figure>
<p>
In Europe, or at least at Micromania, the Xbox Series X has increased in price from €549.99 to €599.99. The original 512GB Xbox Series S has meanwhile increased from €299.99 to €349.99, while the newer 1TB Xbox Series S has gone up from €349.99 to €399.99.
</p>
<p>
Today's development comes just weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">Sony raised the price of PlayStation 5 here in the UK</a>, as well as in mainland Europe, Australia and New Zealand.
</p>
<p>
Sony blamed that change on "the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates". The company last raised the cost of PS5 in Europe back in August 2022.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">struggled with its Switch 2 pricing in the US</a>, and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">raised the cost of the console's accessories</a> ahead of its launch in response to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-already-shipped-over-1m-vietnam-made-consoles-to-us-this-year-as-switch-2-launch-threatened-by-tariffs">ever-changing tariff situation</a>.
</p>
<p>
Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-revenue-continues-to-tumble-but-gaming-revenue-is-up-microsoft-reports">Microsoft reported a further fall in sales of its Xbox hardware</a> as part of its latest quarterly financial results. But overall revenue from Microsoft's gaming division was up, thanks to money made primarily by Call of Duty, Minecraft and Game Pass subscriptions.

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>EA have announced they're "pausing" development of any future rally racers, including the filth-speckled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wrc">WRC</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dirt-5">Dirt</a> series. Many rally games have historically been made by the now EA-owned studio Codemasters, a crowd of long-time motorsports specialists who've been soiling wheel arches as far back as Colin McCrae Rally for the first PlayStation. Well, no more, say the big wigs. The games have "reached the end of the road", they say. Bad news for fans of muck and sand on wheels, but there is a splash of muddy hope just past the next hard right.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"For now, we are pausing development plans on future rally titles. Rest assured, EA SPORTS WRC will continue to be available for existing and new players," said <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-wrc/wrc-24/news/wrc-development-update">a statement</a> from Codemasters. "Our WRC partnership was a culmination of sorts for our Codemasters journey with off-road racing, spanning decades through titles like Colin McRae Rally, and Dirt. We've provided a home for every rally enthusiast, striving tirelessly to push the boundaries and deliver the exhilarating thrill of driving on the ragged edge."</p>
<p>All those games have now tumbled off that ragged edge, just like 10-year-old me playing Colin McCrae Rally on a PS1 demo disc in 1998. Codemasters have been responsible for much of the genre over the past few decades with the Dirt series, as EA mention above. But the parallel WRC series has also flown the flag, going through the hands of many different developers and publishers. French studio Kylotonn made the games for a while, publishing under Bigben Interactive. Codies got the license to make WRC games in 2020, and then everything became one big corporately consolidated parking lot when Codemasters themselves were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/electronic-arts-have-bought-codemasters">snorted up by EA</a> the following year. </p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Codemasters / Electronic Arts</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So, we can add the deletion of blockbuster rally games from the near future to the many negative effects of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-worrying-about-timed-exclusives-and-worry-more-about-games-industry-consolidation">corporations binge eating other smaller businesses</a>. It's not yet clear how this decision has impacted workers at Codemasters, but it is obviously concerning given EA's recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">wave of layoffs</a>. EA has cut between 300 and 400 jobs across their company this week, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game">reports by Bloomberg</a>.

</p><p>There is one faint god ray shining into these roadside puddles. Rally is (and always has been) open to smaller developers. In particular, the low-poly indie racer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/550320/art_of_rally/">Art Of Rally</a> has been favourably received by dirtsters. And <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/parking-garage-rally-circuit">Parking Garage Rally Circuit</a> offers similar Sega Saturnesque drifts around high-rise parking facilities. There's also the lesser-known <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2824660/Old_School_Rally/">Old School Rally</a>, and the illegal rally racing in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a>. Uh, provided you know <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-summer-car-review-a-sordid-sim-of-piss-and-pistons-that-wont-hold-your-disgusting-little-hand">how to build an entire car</a> from scratch. We have a list of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">best racing games</a> too, if you fancy that. </p>
<p>Remember: when big corpos buy out all the bacon, go looking for the tasty lardons. Also, this doesn't necessarily mean the end for WRC games. The FIA (Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, the international vroomsports body that runs the real life World Rally Championship) has teased <a href="https://x.com/OfficialWRC/status/1917610425153097758">on Xitter</a> that the game series will continue in the hands of another developer somewhere, as pointed out by cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/racing/ea-says-codemasters-wont-be-making-any-more-rally-games-weve-reached-the-end-of-the-road-working-on-wrc/">PC Gamer</a>.</p>
<p>"Now our WRC gaming franchise is going in an ambitious new direction," they say, "with more news coming in the near future."</p>

            <p>Nintendo has altered the way it ranks best-selling games in the Switch eShop, which could have big ramifications for both shovelware games and indies alike.</p>
<p>The change comes as part of a major firmware update released yesterday for the older console, in preparation for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s release next month.</p>
<p>Previously, the eShop listed best-selling games by total downloads from the past 14 days. That's now been changed to list games by total revenue from the past three days (spotted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6nDoGNfPc">GVG</a>, via <a href="https://kotaku.com/slop-nintendo-switch-eshop-best-seller-firmware-update-1851778523">Kotaku</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p>On the one hand, this appears to be a good move to help filter out cheap shovelware games. The eShop has been rife with cheap imitation games and "slop" - back in December, copycat games based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-black-myth-wukong-copycat-games-are-popping-up-on-nintendo-eshop">Black Myth: Wukong</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unpacking-developer-calls-out-nintendo-after-reporting-cheap-fakes-on-its-eshop">Unpacking</a> were both called out.</p>
<p>The change in ranking means cheap games looking to make rapid sales will no longer be prioritised at the top of the charts, meaning studios will be disincentivised to game the charts with cheap knock-offs and sale prices aimed at undercutting bigger releases.</p>
<p>The flip side, though, is that legitimate indie games will likely have a more difficult time being discovered on the store. Instead, the chart will likely be dominated by fully priced AAA games - most notably, Nintendo's own, considering they're very rarely discounted.</p>
<p>At the time of the writing, the eShop Charts are dominated by predictable releases: Minecraft is top, followed by Animal Crossing, FC25, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>.</p>
<p>There is at least an option to view download exclusive games in the same format, though it's not shown by default.</p>
<p>It's certainly a welcome change, then, that focuses on legitimate games, but it's not necessarily an ideal solution.</p>
<p>Presumably this change will carry over to Switch 2, when it's released on 5th June. Nintendo previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-was-almost-called-the-super-nintendo-switch">digital store will have improved performance on the new console</a>, but it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-eshop-music-wont-be-returning-for-switch-2">still won't have any music</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-prepares-for-switch-2-with-original-console-update-adding-gameshare-virtual-game-cards-and-more">Switch firmware update arrived yesterday</a>, adding Gameshare, Virtual Game Cards and more.</p>
<p>However, it was soon spotted that sharing Virtual Game Cards means <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-users-say-virtual-game-cards-are-a-downgrade-as-online-game-sharing-changes">games can no longer be played online simultaneously across two consoles</a>, which users have called a "downgrade".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Sometimes a video game is an epic. It’s daunting, and it’s forever, and it’s a slate of marble you slowly chip away at for weeks and months and an entire year. Other times, a video game is lightning and fireworks. It’s an instant flash, and immediate dopamine, and a bag of chips that’s empty before you know it but also maybe empty before you have too much of it. It’s Shotgun Cop Man.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shotgun Cop Man |  Weapons Showcase Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6F6Vk0TcbmM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;puts arcade action and mechanical perfection above all else. As the follow-up to indie sleeper hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/20/my-friend-pedro-review/">My Friend Pedro</a>,&nbsp;it’s stripped down and simplified in a lot of ways to achieve that. There’s a story here in the loosest and most barely defined sense of the word: you are shotgun cop man, and you need to go to hell to arrest Satan. It’s and instant, charmingly stupid setup to get you straight to the business in a way that’s reminiscent of the most experimental Adult Swim cartoons. Don’t worry about why you’re here, just accept that you are here and have fun.</p>


<p>Your journey through Hell takes the form of a sidescrolling twitch-precision platformer, but you don’t have a jump button. Instead you have a pistol in one hand and a shotgun in the other. The kick of the shotgun gives a rocket-jump level of bounce when fired, and the pistol keeps you afloat and just barely manoeuvrable while in mid-air. Both weapons have limited clip sizes, but they reload the instant you touch the ground. Every level has an exit and a slew of demons, traps, and platforms in the way of it, tasking you with learning the ropes of your momentum-based toolkit to safely navigate there.</p>


<p>Shotgun Cop Man does a great job of consistently dishing out new elements through each level and chapter of the campaign to keep the challenge fresh and justify the 100+ levels you’ll be shotgun-hopping through. New weapons give you alternative ways to dispose of enemies and unique momentum-modifiers, while the increasing array of traps and obstacles keep you guessing. I love that the game is incredibly challenging, but also refreshingly forgiving in how it lets you tackle those challenges – upon death, you can instantly load back into a checkpoint in the middle of the level, and the game is incredibly generous with the placement of these checkpoints, often dumping you right back where you died each time.</p>
<p>You can die and hop back in as many times as you need to in order to finish a level, but each level comes with a trio of completion challenges tasking you with defeating every enemy, beating it without dying, and beating it in a certain time limit. You don’t have to complete all of these challenges for each stage, but they offer a nice incentive to slowly wean yourself off the checkpoint system as you become more confident in your shotgun-copping skills.</p>

<p>That variety in level design and mechanics I mentioned earlier, sadly, isn’t reflected nearly as well in the other areas of the game. Every level of Shotgun Cop Man looks practically identical to the last, sporting black level geometry on a gloomy darkened background that means they all blend together. The lack of environmental variety, or even some basic colour palette swaps makes every chapter blend together. Even in the game’s custom campaign editor, which lets you freely draw out and share your own custom levels or chapters online, you have no options for visual customisation or even song selection. I love a game with Workshop mod support and custom content options, but when these options only provide mechanical alterations and no aesthetic or visual ones, I can’t imagine there being much room for creativity in the kind of custom campaigns we’ll see from this game.</p>
<p>It’s still an absolute treat to blast through hundreds of demons in Shotgun Cop Man and master the finicky art of shotgun-jumping, I just wish there was a bit more care put into offering some visual and auditory variety to make each moment of the game stand out a bit more from the last. It’s an impressive and incredibly addictive experience nonetheless, but ends up being a blast of fireworks that’s over just a bit sooner than you were hoping for.</p>

        <p>App Store must now allow alternative payment options.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games is celebrating an enormous US court decision that forces Apple to allow alternative payment options on iPhone.
</p>
<p>
This is the key issue that began the five-year feud between Apple and Epic Games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">when the Fortnite maker deliberately added a cheaper payment option to its battle royale that circumvented Apple's own method</a>, from which it then takes a 30 percent cut.
</p>
<p>
The case has rumbled on since, but has rarely felt quite as dramatic as in the 80-page verdict slapped down on Apple last night by the US District Court of Northern California, which found the iPhone maker "in wilful violation" of the court's previous injuction designed to prohibit the company's "anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive pricing". 
</p>
<p>
That particular injuction saw Apple being told it had to allow purchases for apps from outside websites, to which Apple agreed but then decided to levy a 27 percent fee when doing so - effectively restoring its regular app store cut. 
</p>
<p>
In fiery terms, the US court has now said this move "strains credulity" and branded it an "obvious cover-up" designed to allow Apple to continue with "anticompetitive conduct solely to maintain its revenue stream".
</p>
<p>
The damning verdict echoes many of the arguments previously made by Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney, who has campaigned against Apple's fresh barriers to outside payments.
</p>
<p>
"Apple's response," the court verdict reads, was to "impose new barriers and new requirements to increase friction and increase breakage rates with full page 'scare' screens, static URLs, and generic statements. 
</p>
<p>
"Apple's goal," the verdict continues, "was to dissuade customer usage of alternative purchase opportunities and maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream. In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this Court's Injunction."
</p>
<p>
More dramatic still, the court states that Apple documentation reveals the company "knew what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option", and that "to hide the truth, vice-president of finance Alex Roman outright lied under oath".
</p>
<p>
Sweeney, who previously stated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">Epic Games had lost around $1bn in missed revenue over the run of the case</a>, <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1917716512347152499">took to social media last night to celebrate the decision</a> - and state that Fortnite would return to the US iPhone App Store next week.
</p>
<p>
"NO FEES on web transactions," Sweeney wrote. "Game over for the Apple Tax. Apple's 15-30 percent junk fees are now just as dead here in the United States of America as they are in Europe under the Digital Markets Act. Unlawful here, unlawful there.
</p>
<p>
"We will return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week. 
</p>
<p>
"Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer contacted Apple for comment, and asked whether it will be considering Sweeney's offer.
</p>
<p>"We strongly disagree with the decision," an Apple spokesperson stated in response. "We will comply with the court's order and we will appeal."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Throes of the Watchmaker, the much-anticipated DLC for retro RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a>, will release later this month on 20th May.</p>
<p>The carnival-themed post-game adventure will arrive for free across all platforms: Nintendo Switch, Steam, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One.</p>
<p>The news was shared alongside a fresh trailer, showing off clockwork enemies, a new party member for the turn-based battles, and of course plenty of beautiful pixel art.</p>

<p>Throes of the Watchmaker will take place as a side adventure to the main plot, with Solstice Warriors Valere and Zale exploring the cursed carnival of Horloge to defeat the "mischievous Puppeteer".</p>
<p>The DLC promises over eight hours of gameplay, new playable classes for its pair of protagonists, the aforementioned new party member (called Arty), and three player local co-op.</p>
<p>It's also said to link to the studio's previous game, ninja platformer The Messenger.</p>
<p>Sea of Stars first released back in August 2023 - it's a retro RPG heavily inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> and Super Mario RPG, with its active turn-based combat and chiptune score. I previously spoke with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/composing-nostalgia-how-sea-of-stars-revisits-the-past-through-music">composer Eric W. Brown about working with Chrono Trigger's Yasunori Mitsuda</a>.</p>
<p>Though no longer available on PS Plus, the game is still on Xbox Game Pass if you're looking to catch up.</p>
<p>What's more, if the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">turn-based action of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has caught your attention, Sea of Stars is well worth a look.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following the death of Colin McRae in 2007, the series retired McRae’s name and continued its evolution as Dirt. 2009’s Dirt 2 (known as Colin McRae: Dirt 2 in Europe and other PAL game territories) marked a transitional point for the series, which was reinvented again as a hardcore simulation in 2015’s Dirt Rally. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">2023’s EA Sports WRC was the first Codemasters rally game to hold an official WRC license since 2002’s Colin McRae Rally 3.

        <p>The “Yuki Onna” or snow woman moves quickly and glides with barely a sound. Make sure you listen carefully or she’ll appear when you least expect it! When Yuki Onna finds you, she spits out a blizzard which causes the player to be frozen in ice. Take care to watch the floors too, if they’re frozen by Yuki Onna, you’re likely to slip around and be caught more easily.</p><p><strong>About “The Mine”</strong></p><p>The mine was once a site where silver ore was excavated with vigor. Back in those days, silver was highly valued by those in power and it would take several hours to traverse through all of the tunnels.</p><p>Many workers were employed to dig through this maze of large tunnels. It was also difficult to get to the mines from the nearest village due to its rugged surroundings coupled with heavy snowfall. It was common for workers of the mine to sleep in a bare bones rest area in the tunnels, forced to work everyday without getting enough sleep. As a result, it was common for people to lose their lives due to accidents caused by human error.</p><p>The site grew to be revered as a mine that “once you enter, you never leave.”</p><p><strong>About the Downloadable Content</strong></p><p>Our very first downloadable content includes two additional characters and a soundtrack to the game. The characters come from the recent film <em>Birth of Kitaro: The <a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>ery of GeGeGe</em> and will give players the opportunity to dress up as Kitaro’s Father and Mizuki. These characters also come with additional character-specific perks so be sure to check these out! The price of the character downloadable content will be sold at $3.99 / €3.99 / ¥500.</p><p><strong>Original Game Soundtrack</strong></p><p>This is an original soundtrack that includes the background music played in the game. Get through the coming summer heat with a spine-chilling horror atmosphere! The price is $ 1.99/ €1.99 / ¥250.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
