            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">finally revealed the Switch 2</a> — but it didn’t reveal everything. Even still, the new console looks pretty much like a bigger, more refined Switch. Sure, that’s the straightforward and expected move from Nintendo. But it’s also exactly what I’ve been waiting for.</p><p>The first Switch was a revelation. When it launched, I marveled over being able to play <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> on my TV and then take the console out of the dock and play in handheld mode curled up on the couch. Nintendo absolutely nailed the execution of combining its console and portable expertise into one great device, and ever since, the Switch has been a constant companion at home and while traveling.</p><p>I would have been disappointed if Nintendo messed with what worked for the Switch with the Switch 2. I’m glad it has a bigger screen, one that appears to be even larger than the seven-inch display on the OLED Switch. I’m guessing the taller Joy-Cons will be easier to hold, which could be a massive improvement for my hands, and attaching them from the side looks like it could be easier than sliding them up and down. The second USB-C port on the top will be a <em>very</em> welcome addition for easier charging. And even though I barely used it, the return of the kickstand is great, too — maybe with the Switch 2, I’ll actually bring it to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/25/13403924/nintendo-switch-karen-meme-reveal-video">some rooftop parties</a>.</p><p>I also quite like the new black design with accent colors. Sure, it doesn’t pop quite as much as the red and blue Joy-Cons for the original Switch, but I think this design looks elegant with a splash of Nintendo whimsy — I love how colors peek out in different places around the hardware. And there will almost certainly be more color options at launch; Nintendo initially revealed the Switch <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161020005938/en/Nintendo-Switch-World-Premiere-Demonstrates-New-Entertainment-Experiences-from-a-Home-Gaming-System">in gray</a> and later showed off the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2017/170113.html">now-iconic red and blue</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo made a great call in making physical <em>and</em> digital Switch games backward-compatible with the Switch 2. (Before today, it was a little unclear if that would be the case.) I’ve spent years building up a large digital Switch library that is filled with incredible games, and while Nintendo says that “certain” games won’t be supported on its new console, I imagine that the vast majority of my favorite Switch games will be playable.&nbsp;</p><p>While Nintendo didn’t reveal any technical specs, we can presume it’s going to be more powerful than the original Switch. And hopefully the new console gives a boost to games that sometimes struggled on the original hardware — as much as I love <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, some performance improvements could make it even better. The same goes for other big games like <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> and <em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>. Maybe we’ll finally get a <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> game on the Switch now.</p><p>Yes, there’s a lot we don’t know about the Switch 2. The only official Switch 2 game is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24337198/switch-2-mario-kart-nintendo">a new <em>Mario Kart</em></a>. Nintendo didn’t reveal the console’s UI or say if the console has any improved online features. The video briefly showed a way to use the Joy-Con like a computer mouse, but that could be a barely used gimmick. We don’t know how much it will cost or when in 2025 it will come out.</p><p>That said, because it builds upon the original Switch’s outstanding legacy, it will be a familiar experience. There will be lots of older games to play even if Nintendo doesn’t have many Switch 2 games from the jump. It doesn’t look like Nintendo has switched things up very much — and that’s fine with me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month? </em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>At the end of every month, we have an edition of Remap Recommends focused on video games. But in the middle of the month, we'll have an edition focused on...everything else. It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h2 id="patrick-recommendshere">Patrick Recommends...<em>Here</em></h2><figure><figcaption><span>The de-aging stuff in this movie is so bad, and yet...</span></figcaption></figure><p>My wife is not into sad movies. She'll tolerate them, but her bar is usually "is this going to be up for an Oscar?" Beyond that, I'm on my own to swirl around a glass of bourbon and weep as midnight approaches. But I like good cry; <a href="https://medium.com/@patrick.klepek/everything-is-normal-until-it-isnt-111c6959ae7d?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">as I've argued in the past</a>, it's a reminder of raw emotions that have become distant—tolerable, even—with time. <em>Here</em>, the latest from director Robert Zemeckis, has a lot going against it. Zemeckis is broadly a hack these days, enamored with technology over storytelling. (If you've never seen <em>The Polar Express</em> and its terrifying CGI, bless.) </p><p><em>Here</em>, an adaptation of a graphic novel where the camera sits at a fixed point and has us watching a family (and a place) evolve over time, has all the trappings of modern Zemeckis' worst impulses. For the most part, the movie has us watching Tom Hanks and Robin Wright look slightly off. Just use make up, man, or let me imagine what a 16-year-old Tom Hanks looks like. It's fine. Here, it's grotesque. </p><p>But...<em>Here </em>knocked me off my rocker. I'm turning 40 next month, so I'm in a moment where I'm spending time thinking about what's come before, what's coming next. And icky visuals aside, <em>Here</em> lands enough sappy, sentimental punches about what it means to live a life, what it means to have regrets, what it means to imagine a life difference than the one you've experienced. I watched this while on holiday break, where my kids were around me all the time. It got me bad.</p><p>(The less we talk about the movie trying to comment on what it's like to be Black, however, the better. What the hell, Zemeckis?)</p><p>If you, like me, are a sap and enjoy working through a box of issues, check it out.</p><hr><h2 id="rob-recommends%E2%80%A6-30-for-30-lance">Rob Recommends… <em>30 for 30: Lance</em></h2><figure></figure><p>Slowly but surely competitive cycling is moving up the rankings of my favorite sports. But as much as I watch, I always feel like there are tremendous amounts of context I am missing. I don’t fully understand the sport yet, and I always feel like I have just the smallest sense of its history.</p><p>So I decided to watch the documentary ESPN did on Lance Armstrong, who might be the Antichrist of the Tour de France and maybe all of modern cycling. It’s an utterly riveting film, in part because it turns out to be such a stark portrait of an unrepentantly corrupt and self-centered man. That might be the film’s great weakness as well: it’s so focused on Lance that it somehow fails to do justice to the extent of his cheating or the viciousness with which he defended his undeserved reputation. It becomes a psyschodrama about what was going on in the head of an audacious crime boss, and can’t quite stay on top of all the misdeeds or victims he left along the way.</p><p>On the other hand, Armstrong <em>is </em>an incredible figure. He appears to have stumbled into cycling because it was the one sport at which he truly excelled, and it fed his deep desire to dominate and humiliate people via competition. At no point does Armstrong or anyone else talk about his love for cycling, because it’s not clear he even liked it that much. He was from a young age a damaged and cruel person, he excelled at a sport where corruption and cheating were prerequisites for serious high-level competition, and then he improbably survived a metastatic cancer and this miserable person overnight became the inspiring feel-good sports figure of the decade.</p><p>At the outset we’re warned by a lot of the people interviewed as part of the documentary that Lance is a master manipulator, and they think he’ll turn any “tell-all” documentary about himself into an exercise in image rehabilitation. So take what I’m about to say with a grain of salt but I did come away feeling some sympathy for him in this one particular way: he was a corrupt liar, but he was the hero of a corrupt and mendacious age.</p><p>It seems like nobody who knew cycling was every fooled: everyone knew PEDs were widespread in the sport, and while Armstrong was marketing himself as a clean cyclist in a sport that was cleaning up its act, the riders were <em>improving</em> against the times they’d set in years when people had been caught taking drugs. But it was a good story that made a niche sport more popular, that gave American media a clean-cut underdog hero at a time when the United States was losing a pair of increasingly unpopular imperial wars, and that made a lot of brands and businesses a lot of money. Armstrong is justly reviled as a vicious and vindictive cheater, but the documentary raises questions about how much of the fraud he perpetrated on his own. He had lots of partners who were invested in selling his phony heroism, and when he was finally cornered, a lot of those same interested parties helped turn him into a symbol of everything that was rotten in sports.</p><p>You watch this documentary and you see clips of Matt Lauer talking about Armstrong on Today, or you hear about an FDA bureaucrat deciding to make it a mission to expose what Armstrong was up to, or you hear about how his commercial empire collapsed when Nike finally cut ties with him. In victory and disgrace, Armstrong seems to have been the perfect symbol for the comforting fictions Americans are so often fed. First, that a rich and ruthless competitor can have a clean conscience and a heart of gold, and then that in the end the truth will out and justice will be served.</p><hr><h2 id="cado-recommends-nobody-understands-playing-cards">Cado Recommends... <em>Nobody Understands Playing Cards</em></h2><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kY6DmPs4klU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Nobody understands playing cards — not even the experts"></iframe></figure><p>Yeah yeah, I know, it's funny how predictable this is. Sometimes you have to live your truth though and my truth is that I love card games, so I was delighted when last weekend <em>Polygon</em> published this fun video on some of the things that make cards so compelling. Simone de Rochefort et al have done their research on how 52 pieces of thick paper can have such a lasting impact on culture, and take some time to get into some of the math around the probabilities that make a deck of cards such a great source of delicious randomized tension.</p>

<p>Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially announced</a> the Nintendo Switch 2 console on Thursday with it releasing some time in 2025. The reveal came in the form of a two-minute video that showed the new system from a number of angles. Players got a look at the handheld, the new Joy-Cons, and even the new dock.</p>



<p>While full specs weren’t announced—that’s likely coming during a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Direct event</a> on April 2—Nintendo didn’t really hide any aspect of the exterior of the system. From the kickstand to the dock to the new USB-C port on top, there’s a lot to see. So, let’s check out the first pictures of the new Nintendo Switch (click on an image to enlarge it).</p>

<p>As you can see in the pictures below, a number of rumored features were confirmed. The new Joy-Cons attach to the console via a magnet as opposed to a slide rail while the new dock is more rounded, much like the system itself. Sticking with the Joy-Cons, the base colors now match the system with the red and blue being accents on the connector and under the thumbstick. The new button that has been shown on past mockups is on the right controller, though Nintendo seems to have intentionally left it blank to hide its functionality.</p>



<p>Elsewhere there is the aforementioned second USB-C port on the top of the system. Lastly, the console’s kickstand also received an overhaul as it appears to allow the Switch 2 to lay nearly completely horizontal with support.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/killer-strategy-boardgame-roots-steam-expansion-has-made-me-aware-that-root-exists-as-a-pc-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
I have an on-and-off-again relationship with boardgaming based mostly on the fact that I have nobody to play boardgames with. I used to be part of a boardgaming circle, but then I missed a fateful opening round of Twilight Imperium, and then the pandemic started, and then everybody lost patience with Tabletop Game Simulator. 
</p>
<p>
As such, I've been unwilling to invest in new boardgames, and unable to play one particular awesome-sounding creation, Root, an asymmetrical strategy affair in which different factions of animals vie for control (mostly) of a storybook forest. Good news, me: I've just learned that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/965580/Root/">Dire Wolf adapted it into a PC game a whole four years ago</a>. I know this because somebody's just sent me a mail about a new Marauder expansion on Steam.
</p>
<p>
Root, as I understand it, is excellent because the factions are effectively playing different games side by side. You've got the birds, who used to rule the woods and must keep up a steady momentum of territory capture or else fall into squabbling. You've got the cats, who are currently in charge, have the biggest army, and are trying to chop it all down for profit. You've got a guerrilla alliance of other critters, who don't have a base to begin with and must build sympathy in the shadows. And you've got the Vagabond, a travelling ragamuffin who plays all sides while undertaking a quest for fame and plunder.
</p>
<p>
That's the base offering. The Steam edition has received a bunch of expansions. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/965580/view/536590767160820525?l=english">The latest one</a> introduces two more factions: Lord of the Hundreds, who will "oppress the Woodland and burn it to the ground if need be", and the Keepers in Iron, a group of exiled knights searching for relics.
</p><p>
The digital adaptation's 3D visuals and presentation feel a teeny bit lacklustre next to the woodcut storybook vibes of the original boardgame - this feels like a case of more is less. Still, I am very keen to play. Perhaps it'll fill the hole left in my life by the collapse of my <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/armello">Armello</a> habit. The predictable question I have, as a filthy hermit, is whether the bot AI is any shop. If it's cobblers, I may have no choice but to visit my old boardgaming group, cap in hand, and beg for another chance. I think they're done playing Twilight Imperium now? It's been years, but this is Twilight Imperium.

Now it’s delving into piracy with <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>. I recently got to spend two hours with the game, due out next month, and, I came away expecting Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio to once again nail new ideas while maintaining the series’ old familiar draws.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196578" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="387" data-playlist="196578,194088,195896" data-current="196578"><div><p>Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22135.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Pirate Yakuza </em>puts the focus entirely on fan-favorite comic relief rival Goro Majima for the first time in the series’ 20-year history. Majima has been a supporting character and playable hero a few times over the years, but <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>is the first time he’s been the lone star of the show. He’s a good lead for a game that takes the series in one of its more outlandish directions yet, as he’s often facilitated comic breaks with fervor and gusto. If there’s one character that commits to the bit, it’s him, and that includes becoming a pirate captain in modern-day Hawaii.</p><p><em>Pirate Yakuza</em>’s story takes place six months after the events of <em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em>, and somehow Majima’s lost all memory of his life as a crime boss and club manager. <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>doesn’t use this as a complete break from previous games, as recovering his old memories is a core part of his story, but it does mean that he’s taking on a new crew on the open seas off Hawaii’s shores. Majima is at the center of a conflict between the pirates he works alongside and the yakuza he was once a part of.</p><p>The tension between those two forces means <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>is constantly shifting between traditional <em>Yakuza </em>scraps and silliness and, as the name suggests, pirate ship battles. As far as hand-to-hand combat goes, <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>delivers some of the fastest-paced fighting the series has had, to the point that it feels like it borders on a character action game along the lines of <em>Devil May Cry</em>. <em>Like a Dragon Gaiden</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-gaiden-preview-agent-style-yakuza-rgg-1850759282?rev=1736969234480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-gaiden-preview-agent-style-yakuza-rgg-1850759282?rev=1736969234480">experimented with spy gadgetry</a></span> to give its combat a distinct feel, and <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>is riffing on its own motif by giving Majima a pair of cutlasses. The game feels snappy, stylish, and occasionally pretty tough. Swapping Majima between his harder-hitting pirate persona and the nimble yakuza one can make the difference between getting clobbered and overcoming a gang of criminals. I gravitated toward the knife-wielding yakuza style for one-on-one fights and swapped to the pirate one for wider slashes when taking on big groups. I was surprised by the difficulty of a few fights, such as one against a runaway prisoner I met on the beaches of Hawaii who cold-cocked me as I was still learning all the tricks I had at my disposal. Most of my memories of <em>Yakuza 0</em>’s beat-em-up combat are of it being tedious and repetitive, so coming into <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>and finding something that felt involved and dynamic was a welcome sign.</p><p><em>Pirate Yakuza</em>’s riffs on old <em>Yakuza </em>ideas are where it shines the most. Even though Majima is sailing the seven seas this time, I still found the grounded moments traveling around cities on land to be just as memorable as duking it out on a pirate ship. Between silly mini-games and squaring up against any crook who would approach me, I rode around on a scooter until I stopped at a small cafe where employees were trying to attract customers with a small performance. Even as the series constantly pushes against the boundaries of what people think it is, those small human interactions remain the beating heart of <em>Yakuza</em>.</p><p>The actual pirate ship battles are the part I’m not quite sold on just yet, but I could see them getting more complex beyond the early sections of the game I played. Sailing to different islands on a slow-moving ship with weather hazards felt novel, but I could imagine it getting tedious down the line. Ship battles, meanwhile, feel complex in the menus beforehand, but in practice got rather monotonous as I would position my ship to fire upon incoming vessels, let out some cannonballs, then turn around and do the same thing from the other side. The depth comes from the preparation, which includes assigning crewmates with different specialties to weapon-manning and other tasks to bolster your ship’s effectiveness in battle. Building your ship’s arsenal and managing your crew were the most interesting part of ship battles in my time with the early game, and I’m curious to see just how expansive these options are and if the game can spice these fights up as it goes on.</p><p>Every time I pick up a <em>Yakuza </em>game, I’m always surprised to see just how much RGG can bend what I think these games are without quite breaking them. The series has been characterized as grounded despite constantly escalating to new heights, and what I’ve played of <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>feels like a natural yet goofy extension built off a stable foundation. We’ll see if Majima’s seafaring detour pays off when the game launches on February 21, but even if it doesn’t, I’m more curious than ever about how far RGG is willing to take its heroes as it keeps pushing the boundaries of what it means to be a <em>Yakuza </em>game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo confirmed the existence of the device last year, and it’s been a drip feed of news from leakers ever since.

No title was given, but the brief glimpse we saw of the game in action showed a more cartoonish art style than that of <em>MK8 </em>and teased what seems to be a 24-player mode. Fans seem stoked about it, and hot on the subtly revamped character designs.</p><h2 id="h109711"><a id=""></a><strong>Avoiding the Wii U mistake</strong></h2><p>One thing several people have noted is that Nintendo went out of its way to make it clear that the Nintendo Switch 2 is a new console. The Wii U had plenty of problems, but one of the biggest was the mistaken perception, based on its branding, that it could be a peripheral for the original Wii. Slapping a 2 on the name makes it clear that this is the next iteration of the thing you already love. Say what you want about PlayStation’s naming convention not being that flashy, but you know that a PlayStation 5 is the next major console from Sony. The Switch 2 name is straightforward, and that is the best decision Nintendo could have made in moving to the next system.</p><h2 id="h109712"><a id=""></a><strong>Some healthy skepticism and questions</strong></h2><p>The reveal trailer finally removed any uncertainty about the existence of the Switch 2, but it was light on some larger details. Right now, it seems to be mostly a bigger, beefier Switch with a few extra bells and whistles. That’s pretty uncharacteristic of Nintendo, which has typically introduced some major innovation in every generational leap. So there are a lot of unanswered questions still floating around as we move toward launch. Is the bigger screen and more powerful hardware the main hook? Will Nintendo release more Joy-Cons than the sleek ones it shows in the reveal trailer?

                <p>Nintendo historically holds Nintendo Direct briefings in February, and it seems that tradition will continue this year.

            <p>Hideki Kamiya has called out "shitty leakers" in the wake of Nintendo's Switch 2 reveal, stating they "should be cursed".</p>
<p>Earlier today <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo finally revealed its Switch 2 console</a> after months of leaks and speculation.</p>
<p>Following the reveal, Kamiya (game designer of Okami, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>, Devil May Cry and more) took to social media to express his frustration towards those who leaked Switch 2 information ahead of the official reveal.</p>

<p>"I hope that all of the people who leaked Switch 2 information/those who helped leak it will be cursed for the rest of their lives to always have poop on the soles of their shoes when they get home," he began, jokingly enough (via machine translation).</p><p>Kamiya referred back to the surprise reveal of an Okami sequel in development from last year's The Game Awards. "Now that I've enjoyed the surprise announcement of Okami with all the users, I truly believe that... all those damn leakers should be cursed," he said.</p>

<p>He continued, referring to theoretical leakers as "the worst of scum".</p>
<p>"The shitty leaker only acts for his own pleasure and self-satisfaction, not only is he not contributing to anyone's benefit, he is incurring all sorts of opportunity losses, and has done nothing to be proud of in front of others," he said. "He is the worst of scum, so he should be covered in shit from head to toe and thrown out of the atmosphere... and then stop thinking and wander forever."</p>
<p>He concluded the thread with a further vent of frustration.</p>
<p>"These damn leakers are in a position of responsibility where they have access to information that only a very select few know, yet what they do is nothing more than an expression of a filthy desire for approval that lacks a shred of rationality; they are shameful people, so it is not the manufacturers whose secrets have been exposed who should be blamed, but these damn people, and they need to be crushed as soon as possible," he said.</p>
<p>The outspoken Kamiya is known for his hot takes on social media, yet while his thread is lighthearted to begin with, there appears to be an undercurrent of genuine annoyance.</p>
<p>Indeed, leaks have become an issue across the industry. In recent years, many major releases - from Nintendo and other studios - have been leaked ahead of release. This week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-very-very-upset-by-switch-2-leaks-former-staff-suggest">former Nintendo staff said the company had likely been "very, very, upset" by Switch 2 leaks</a>, due to their "disruptive impact".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">Kamiya's Okami sequel</a>, thankfully, didn't leak before its reveal. It's being developed by his new studio Clovers.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 is still without a firm release date, but was finally announced earlier today along with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">tease of a new Mario Kart game</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The newly revealed Nintendo Switch 2 console could end up becoming one of the most popular gaming systems of all time, as suppliers are reportedly ready to ship a huge amount of units in the first year of availability.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/nintendo-to-unveil-next-generation-switch-2-in-april?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a>, unspecified analysts said that Nintendo suppliers are ready to ship 20 million units in the console's first year of availability, a much bigger number of units compared to the first year of other popular systems like the original Switch, and the PlayStation 5, although production of the current generation system by Sony was impacted for quite some time by shortages and the COVID-19 pandemic. With this many units, at the very least, there shouldn't be too much trouble finding the console in stores, which has apparently been one of<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-enough-units/"> Nintendo's concerns</a> for a long time.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Nintendo Switch 2 has finally officially been revealed today with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-february/">a trailer</a> that focused on the hardware and the differences with the current system. Besides showing off the system, the trailer also provided a quick look at what will likely be the next entry in the Mario Kart series and confirmed that the new system will have full backward compatibility with the current consoles, as it will run both physical and digital Switch games. A better look at the system will come in April with a dedicated Nintendo Direct, while a select few will be able to get some hands-on time with the Nintendo Switch 2 thanks to special experiences that will be held across the world.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch worldwide in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sons-of-forest-update-rafts-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Endnight Games has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest&nbsp;</em>update, and this one comes complete with new buildable structures, support for a major Steam feature, and even a fun new secret to find.</p>

<p>Naturally, this update isn't quite as big as the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sons-of-forest-10-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">huge 1.0 release in February last year</a>, but it does bring three new buildable raft structures, as well as a new mooring post for you to hitch your seafaring vehicles to.</p>

<p>You'll also find new buildable holders for the KnightV and hang glider vehicles, as well as a "procedural defensive wall placement system" to help you draw a more natural formation for your defensive fences.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sons-of-the-forest-update-head.jpg?itok=wQGdiNzv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sons-of-the-forest-update-head.jpg?itok=5OAQfPZ- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you were using&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest</em>'s new procedural defensive wall system, this would never have happened.</figcaption></figure><p>Support for Steam's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-game-recording-beta" rel="nofollow">Game Recording feature</a>, which allows you to record your game footage without ever leaving the comfort of Steam, has also been added, so you can show off your new defensive walls to all your friends.</p>

<p>What's more, there's also a new "secret player findable outfit" that you can discover somewhere in the game world. Endnight is remaining cagey regarding exactly how or where you find this item, so it's up to you to scour&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest</em>'s world to claim it.</p>

<p>Naturally, you can also look forward to tons and tons of new gameplay improvements and bug fixes. Make sure to check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1326470/view/526458302147592280" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full patch notes</a> for this update if you want to see everything that's new.</p>




<p><em>Sons of the Forest&nbsp;</em>is the followup to the supremely spooky survival game&nbsp;<em>The Forest</em>, which was released back in 2018 for PC and PlayStation 4. The sequel is only available for PC, though.</p>

<p>This time, you'll be exploring a mysterious island to try and uncover the fate of a missing CEO, although you'll quickly be drawn into the same type of shenanigans the first game offered. I won't spoil, but this certainly isn't a cozy game, let's put it that way.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Sons of the Forest&nbsp;</em>right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1326470/Sons_Of_The_Forest/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo is reportedly preparing a massive amount of Switch 2 shipments for the console's first year on sale, with the figure apparently dwarfing that of the original Switch.</p>

<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/nintendo-to-unveil-next-generation-switch-2-in-april" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> (which, in turn, cites analyst Robin Zhu of Sanford C. Bernstein), Nintendo's supply chain network for the Switch 2 will allow it to sell "more than 20 million units in its first year".</p>

<p>As Bloomberg points out, that figure would be five million higher than the original Switch, which managed to sell 15 million units during its first year on sale. It's clear that Nintendo is banking on its new console doing well.</p>

It might sound obvious, but Nintendo really doesn't want you not to be able to find this console in stores.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">finally announced</a> the Switch 2 earlier today after months of speculation regarding when the console would finally be revealed.</p>

<p>It's fair to say that the announcement itself was pretty terse; it showed off the console's form factor, as well as what appears to be a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>series, but it didn't give away anything about the machine's specs or launch day lineup.</p>

<p>We do, however, already know that the Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible" rel="nofollow">will be able to play</a> original Switch games, although Nintendo has said that the successor may not support every original Switch game at launch.</p>




<p>Nintendo has promised that it will reveal more about the Switch 2 during a Direct presentation in April. It's likely we'll learn more about the console's hardware specs then, and we'll probably get a release date too. Stay tuned.</p>

It feels unlike most of the company’s past marketing. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,193658,194644" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>First, let’s look at the Switch 2 teaser/trailer thing real quick. I’m assuming you’ve seen it, but if not, well you are in a for a treat! </p><p>Wowza! The Nintendo 2 looks less like a toy or a big chunk of plastic designed to be unbreakable (like a lot of the company’s past consoles), and more like a modern piece of technology. This first teaser really hammers home that Nintendo wants you to salivate over how much bigger, better, and sleeker the Switch 2 is over its predecessor. </p><p>It’s also very unlike Nintendo to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-gallery-differences-comparison-joycon-1851740928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-gallery-differences-comparison-joycon-1851740928">zoom in and reveal each and every port and button on the console</a></span>. Sure, it’s done in a whimsical fashion, with the new console evolving from the old one, but it’s still really cool to see Nintendo  point at tiny details and go, “Oh yeah, sweet, huh?” I also appreciate how each new button and port pops out with a tactile motion and noise. It’s good shit. </p><p>This trailer feels more like something Apple or Sony would do to reveal a new console or device; a white void background and super close shots of intricate technical aspects. But then, the controllers start driving around the shiny room and you remember that this is a device made by Nintendo. </p><p>Compare this trailer to the WiiU reveal at E3. </p><p>Or the original Switch reveal eight years ago. </p><p>Those trailers feature people playing the consoles, lots of game footage, more upbeat music, and both focus more on the experience than on the device. For the original Switch, that approach made sense. Nintendo needed to explain its hybrid device to the world.</p><p>Now, with this new sexy teaser for Switch 2, Nintendo doesn’t need to convince the world that a hybrid console is great. Instead, they can show off and tease you about how much better it is than the last one. And you know what? Works for me. I’ll be buying a Switch 2 later this year. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially announced the Nintendo Switch 2</a> on Thursday with a short video to reveal the system. Within the teaser, the company also showed what appeared to be Mario Kart 9 (name pending) running on the system. While there was nothing to really write home about regarding the look at Mario Kart 9, one shot seems to suggest that 24-player races could be a feature of the next game in the series.</p>



<p>A keen-eyed Twitter user (<a href="https://x.com/The_Rimea/status/1879881772852490287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@The_Rimea</a>) spotted the starting grid for a race in the new game, and with it came what appeared to be 24 spots for racers. </p>



<p>“Judging from the starting line, Mario Kart 9(???) seems to have 24 players per race, which is insane,” the post reads alongside the accompanying image that you can see below. For comparison’s sake, there’s also a couple images of the starting grid from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the original Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Nintendo hasn’t confirmed any details about games coming to the new Nintendo Switch 2 later this year. All that has been confirmed is that both physical and digital original Switch games will be compatible with the new system. In some instances, however, original Switch games “may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2”. </p>



<p>Nintendo is scheduled to hold a Nintendo Direct event fully dedicated to its new console on April 2. It’s expected that the company will announce full specs, a release date, price, and some launch games during the event. Insider Gaming will have full coverage leading up to and during the showcase.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Popular indie FPS <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortunes-run/">Fortune's Run</a> won't be seeing any updates for a while--about three years, to be precise, as that's how long its sole developer, known only as Dizzie, will be spending behind bars.</p><p dir="ltr">"I have some stuff going on I need to make public as it's going to interrupt development," Dizzie <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1692240/announcements/detail/532087801681805319">shared in a post</a> on the game's Steam page. "I've been sentenced to prison for the next three years. It's a long story, but I've lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn't living very well."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WGagabyqUc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7WGagabyqUc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"My case is about five years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I've been working on this," he added. "I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I'm going away next month. It's a shame, but it's the consequences of my actions."</p><p dir="ltr">Described by Dizzie as a "fast-paced melee boom-shoot fighting game platformer action immersive sim role-playing fever dream adventure story," Fortune's Run's only other developer recently left the project. According to Dizzie, his former co-developer left for a number of reasons, one of which was a series of struggles she faced after what the post describes as a "botched surgery."</p><p dir="ltr">"The other developer has left the project," Dizzie wrote. "Once she recovered [from surgery], she decided that she was no longer interested in game development. She was in charge of QA and a few level segments, all of which have been abandoned and I've been forced to get by on my own for the past while. It's been very difficult to do alone, but I actually managed--by basically not sleeping--to complete all of the work in time so that it could be released before I'm sent away."</p><p dir="ltr">"Since we decided to part ways, development will be completely interrupted until I'm released," He continued. "I know many of you will be upset and disappointed but please understand that there's absolutely nothing I can do, these wheels were in motion long before I started making this game and it's just been slowly unraveling in my face the whole time."</p><p dir="ltr">The dev added that he is "no longer in financial dire straits" since Fortune's Run "actually sold OK," and noted that he "should be able to afford rent" once he's released from prison.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's a chance that if you wait a few years, I'll be able to cap off the release," he wrote. "In fact, there's not very much content left to work on, I've been making stubs and prototypes of the missing levels in my spare time."</p><p dir="ltr">Dizzie also noted that "the game isn't <em>totally</em> dead, but unfortunately due to even further bad things happening, it's unclear what will happen [to it]."</p><p dir="ltr">Dizzie's identity--and the crime for which he is being incarcerated--are not known to the public, though he admits in the blog post that his sentence is the result of violence on his part.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was a very violent person [in the past] and I hurt a lot of people in my life," he wrote. "Unfortunately, the sentence isn't going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that."</p><p dir="ltr">Dizzie also noted that another Fortune's Run update is in the works and will be released before he begins serving his sentence.</p><p dir="ltr">"Oh yeah. What about the update, huh? I'm going to put that in the next news post, because it feels weird to uh, put patch notes at the bottom of this blog post."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/five-takeaways-for-game-developers-from-matthew-ball-s-state-of-gaming-data<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Can any one person describe the entire state of the video game marketplace? Entrepreneur, author, and Epyllion CEO Matthew Ball is certainly giving it a shot. The man who wrote "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ballmetaversebook.com/">The Metaverse</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" is out this week with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025">a slide deck</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> full of data and analysis capturing the economic headwinds facing the business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ball's presentation gets to the heart of a very uncomfortable fact: according to analysts, video game spending didn't just fail to grow after the COVID-19 pandemic, it dipped 3.5 percent in 2022 and only climbed back a few percentage points by the end of 2024. Other data points, like a declining amount of playtime in games, are also enough to trigger game developers' anxiety (and mine!).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ball identifies the slowing growth as being a symptom of major interlocking growth drivers of the period between 2011-2021 (when consoles and mobile devices exploded in capabilities and new social networks came online) losing steam. It's not a pretty picture, but this is a business built on solving big problems by staring them right in the face.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His lengthy explanation of the complicated market effects at play might warn investors and executives from investing more in the video game business—but that leaves and opportunity for savvy developers and leaders to slip in and find victories where others retreated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I have no doubt this slide deck is bouncing through the inboxes of various studios right now and sliding across the desks of different C-suite execs. If you want to make the most of Ball's data, you'll need to think about how it applies to your day-to-day life. Here are a few takeaways that might resonate with rank-and-file developers.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Video game budgets have to come down">Video game budgets have to come down</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is probably thuddingly obvious to many of our readers but Ball's data makes a very clear point: video game budgets are too dang high. The amount of money invested in individual games is becoming more difficult to turn a profit on when a fewer percentage of players are picking up new games every year. "Excluding annual releases, but including sequels, only 6.5 percent of gametime in 2023 was for new games," Ball writes. "Always On" games-as-a-service titles released before 2019 earned the most "gametime" in that year. "Tens of billions in development and marketing investment and thousands of games competed for that 6.5 percent of total players hours (and four titles won half of it)."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the unfortunate poster child for Ball's breakdown here, as his breakdown of sales versus budget of the widely beloved sequel relative to its predecessors shows the heart of the problem. The series' production budget shot from just over $100 million to over $300 million across three games (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Miles Morales</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> clocked in at just over $150 million), but lifetime sales of the series haven't increased exponentially.</span></p><p>Image via Matthew Ball.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pair that against the small market share the series is competing for and the economics become </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>rough</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I don't know the fate of the budgets for future Marvel's Spider-Man games, I do know Insomniac is aware players aren't necessarily seeing the payoff of the increased spending, a fact that came out in the frustrating dump of leaked documents obtained by hackers targeting the studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now here's where things get hard: how do you reduce budgets? There are only three major tools: lower salaries, lower development time, or lower headcounts. Each has frustrating tradeoffs that in many cases, punish workers and reward executives who ballooned the budgets in the first place.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Devs need to dance with governments">Devs need to dance with governments</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ball's data points to two obvious ways government regulators could influence the game industry—one explicit, the other implicit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The implicit argument isn't clearly stated, and I wonder if Ball would take issue with my analysis. But reading between the lines, an understated challenge of bigger budgets is this: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>game development is hit brutally hard by the cost of living and inflation</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. As we discussed last year, the same number of developers you stick on a game costs dramatically different depending on the country you're operating in. Developers in higher-cost-of-living regions are being undermined by ones in lower-cost-of-living regions, and developers in the latter territories risk being exploited because they have less agency to leverage better wages.</span></p><p>Image via Matthew Ball.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ball's explicit argument targets the purported monopoly Google and Apple have on their mobile platforms. He says that if the iOS and Android app platforms need to "open up." New stores could, among other things, drive competition that lowers the 30 percent "platform fee" claimed by Google and Apple, drive new discoverability methods that connect players to a wider variety of games, and spark innovation for new genres of games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both topics may require industry leaders to grit their teeth and press local and national governments in support of regulatory action. Industry lobbying groups to date have largely focused on tax breaks and legislation surrounding the import cost of parts and access to internet bandwidth. That's a lot of work invested into legislation that primarily benefits the world's largest publishers and studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Smith_Goes_to_Washington">Mr. Smith</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it's time for video games to go to Washington (or London, Ottowa, etc. etc.).</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Players respond to exciting &quot;new genres&quot;—but where do new genres come from?">Players respond to exciting "new genres"—but where do new genres come from?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking of new game genres, Ball's analysis concludes that the emergence of new game genres could be a shot in the arm for the video game market place. He points to the era of the battle royale genre's as being the kind of event that can drive new growth. The industry, he says, could use a shot of innovation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His suggestions for where new genres might come from are concentrated on possible technological advances in "mass concurrency," "high-bandwidth data streaming," "higher-persistence game worlds," and "cloud native games." His analysis of generative AI also focuses on the technology's potential to introduce new genres, as some developers </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/hidden-door-ceo-ai-controversy-is-about-value-not-tech">like those at Hidden Door</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are experimenting with.</span></p><p>Image via Matthew Ball.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ball's technology-focused thinking isn't out of place, as many previous industry advances came out of graphical and rendering advances. But there might be a missing variable here: unpaid modding.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many breakout new genres of the 2010s began life as mods (born of unpaid labor) for entirely different games. That goes for MOBAs, battle royale games, tactical shooters like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Counter-Strike</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That trend muddies of the waters of where developers can find true innovation that will land with players—and who benefits from it. Valve and Blizzard jumped into action to try and profit off genres built on mods of their games. Meanwhile, Brendan Greene was lucky to find a business partner that could turn his </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>ARMA 3 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">mod into a full game, but Epic Games fast-followed with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> so hard it became the defining version of the genre in the United States.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A bubbling example of this phenomenon right now might be </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto Online</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s roleplaying servers. Their popularity speaks to Ball's analysis that the next generation of video game players prioritizes social play over competition, and right now Rockstar Games is the beneficiary of unpaid time and labor from players setting up their own mini improv theaters. Will Rockstar build on this audience after the release of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto VI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">? Will other developers swoop in to try and eat their lunch?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Video game analysts from the early 2000s have a fair bit of egg on their face as one of the few bright spots for the traditional video game marketplace is consistent growth in the world of PC games. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/study-pc-gaming-hardware-market-down-not-out">Declining sales around 2010</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> led some to think consoles and mobile would inevitably beat out PC games, which were (and sometimes are) difficult and fiddly to get running.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Twenty years ago, PC's share of non-mobile console spending was 29 percent. It's now 53 percent," writes Ball. "And while console [spending] has stagnated since 2021, PC has grown 20 percent."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before you jump out of your desk and greenlight another generation of flight simulators, you should check out </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>why</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> PC spending is growing. "The largest share of Steam users now use Chinese as their default client language (which probably </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>underrepresents</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> China's total share of Steam users)," says Ball.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additional data he shares shows that Chinese client language users are among the group that has grown the most on Steam from December 2021 to September 2024. This group represents what many publishers hope to reach—a "fresh audience" with different tastes and interests than the more calcified existing market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But while Chinese player spending on video games has grown by $39 billion since 2011, only 20 percent of their domestic spending goes to imported titles. Spending on imported titles </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>declined</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> five percent from 2023 through 2024. Ball compares this phenomenon to one also taking place in the film industry: locally-made entertainment is outpacing imported entertainment across the globe in China, Nigeria, and India.</span></p><p>Image via Matthew Ball.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Box office hits like Wandering Earth, A Tribe Called Judah, and RRR are cinematic cousins of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Black Myth: Wukong—</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">entertainment produced by local artists that are wildly popular in their countries of origin and also find audiences abroad.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As foreign markets grow, their domestic production capabilities and supply grow too, and this always results in national preferences then shifting to local product," Ball observes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's opportunity for the game industry to meet this moment. We've seen rustling from South Korea about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/korean-devs-report-a-burst-of-interest-in-single-player-console-and-pc-games">expanded interest in triple-A </a></span><span data-testid="content-text">games alongside the country's longtime passion for free-to-play multiplayer titles, and regions like Brazil and Eastern Europe are following similar trends.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're not in those regions, you might wonder how your neck of the game industry can benefit. For now, the best I can offer is that if overseas audience spend more time on consoles and PCs than mobile devices, developers have an opportunity to catch some of that interest by investing in localization.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Understanding player socialization should be a priority">Understanding player socialization should be a priority</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Woven through Ball's analysis is another long-running trend: how players and why socialize through games is changing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> phenomenon, for instance, isn't just about younger players being drawn to blocky graphics and user-generated content, it's that the platform's flexible tools have become a haven for self-expression and social play. We can again look at the proliferation of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto Online</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> roleplaying servers as another data point in this phenomenon, and outside of games, the increasing growth of chat platform Discord.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One in five Discord users (or 40 million total) use the app to stream gameplay to their friends each month—and just under one in three watches monthly," Ball notes. It's a piece of social glue that accelerates interest in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Smite 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Phasmophobia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lethal Company</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discord's list of users playing Steam Early Access titles as a share of total observed players is largely loaded with co-op multiplayer games, but also features single-player titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fields of Mistria, Hades II, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Ball describes this as "disproportionate" game discovery behavior.</span></p><p>Image via Matthew Ball.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The developers behind these games probably didn't do any weird science studying the habits of Discord users (unless they did, in which case, hey reach out to me I want to know what you learned), but enough of them have succeeded on the platform in a way that suggests studying how players engage with and use Discord might be a vector for developers to grow, explore new genres, and succeed in 2025 and beyond.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(And Discord may not deserve all the credit here—social apps across the globe likely drive similar behavior in different regions).</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How do developers handle an uncertain future?">How do developers handle an uncertain future?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'll be honest here. When I first read Ball's report, I came away with some degree of anxiety. The human brain struggles to wrangle numbers like these, and it's easy to spiral into an unhelpful spree of if-&gt;then statements that make a decline in billions of dollars in spending feel like the end of the world. The problems and solutions are so big and abstract that if you aren't a big-money decision maker—just a humble programmer, artist, designer, or a writer like me—you can feel like you have no agency in a field you deeply love. And even if you have the power to greenlight a game, what if the games Ball is proposing aren't the ones you want to or even can make?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The solution, I think, is to look at Ball's data and analysis as a map. Maps don't serve one purpose—they lay out the territory as best they can so another traveler can navigate it. Plenty will read Ball's map and see "X marks the spot" where others will see "here there be dragons."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You don't have to change or fix the game industry. But to make the game you want to make, having a map handy might keep you from sailing into dangerous waters.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony Pictures has released the first full trailer for its Until Dawn horror film.</p>
<p>Earlier this week a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-movie-teaser-reveals-how-its-replaced-the-games-branching-narrative">teaser was released</a> that hinted towards how the game's branching narrative would be replicated in the film.</p>
<p>Now, in this full trailer, we can see how the plot revolves (literally) around an hourglass with the cast repeatedly waking up after gruesome deaths to try their luck at surviving once again.</p>

<p>Though the plot differs from the original game - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-film-wont-feature-the-same-characters-or-even-the-same-story-as-the-game-its-based-on">features a new cast</a> - there are plenty of horror tropes: from the haunted house setting, masked slayers, and chases thwarted by bear traps, to creepy zombie-like monsters and a particularly nasty looking face infection.</p>
<p>"Every night holds a clue," the trailer reads. "Every death brings you closer to the truth."</p>
<p>Then: "If we want to survive, we have to make it until dawn," says one character nodding. He said the name!</p>
<p>The film is set to release exclusively in cinemas on 25th April.</p>
<p>As for the original game, it received a PS5 and PC remake in October last year and<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-leak-points-to-potential-sequel"> includes a new ending</a> that points towards a possible sequel.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/but-i-like-to-slide-the-joy-con<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This morning, Nintendo<a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-rumors-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> finally</a> announced the Switch 2, or at least showed a console that looks a lot like everyone thought it would and set a Direct with more details for April. The hardware-minded among us are certainly rushing to analyze every frame of the trailer, but I am a simple man with a simple complaint: I still want to slide in the Joy-Con.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 – First-look trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itpcsQQvgAQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In the trailer above, you can see that instead of sliding the Joy-Con into place from the top of the console like the current Switch, they click in from the sides. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-reportedly-revealed-in-alleged-image-leak-and-internet-sleuths-are-trying-to-work-out-what-it-all-means" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a> wrote of an alleged leak of the controllers back in January that “[the] new Joy-Con allegedly ditch the railed lock method used by the current Switch in favor of electromagnetic suction controllers,” though in the trailer there appears to be a connector.</p><p>We’ll know more about how and why this all works in April, but if you’ll allow me to engage in the internet-old tradition of complaining about things I don’t know much about, I don’t like it! I want to slide the Joy-Con. Is it the best connection system in the world? No. Some players have found that the rail <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/rci8im/tips_to_protect_the_console_rails_from_bending/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bends</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/q8zgrt/switch_oled_joycon_wobble/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wiggles</a>, and it’s certainly not a seamless glide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But still, sliding the Joy-Con in feels like the aesthetic heart of my experience of the Switch, a stance that’s backed up by the animation that opens every <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKlRN2YpxRE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch game</a> trailer of a Joy-Con sliding into place vertically. In those trailers, this is accompanied by the sharp “click” that’s triggered a Pavlovian response in me ever since the initial Switch reveal. In today’s trailer, that “click” is replaced by a rounder, somewhat echoey sound. Of course, neither of these are what the actual Joy-Con sound like, and the latter might just be an aesthetic choice for the trailer rather than a new “official” Switch sound.</p><p>This raises some obvious questions: Is Nintendo going to make a new animation? Are we going to get a new Switch sound? I will grudgingly say that change is good because that’s how therapists advise me to think about life, but aren’t we facing enough change these days? I like the little animation. I like the little click. I like to slide my Joy-Con into place like I’m dropping into a world-defining battle in the <em>Power Rangers</em> mech before I spend a whole evening giving people gifts in <em>Stardew Valley</em> when I should be doing something else.</p><p>Fine, fine–change <em>is</em> good, and hopefully the Switch 2 makes many much-needed improvements. While I like to slide the Joy-Con in to connect it, it can be a little annoying to detach; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a> writes that it’s possible the new design will allow a button press to push the Joy-Con away from the console instead of clumsily sliding it back out, which sounds much nicer. There’s no mention in the trailer of fixes for Joy-Con drift, but I suppose I’m willing to sacrifice my beloved slide in exchange for a controller that reliably does what I want it to. There’s speculation that the Joy-Con can be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used like a computer mouse</a>, which is… I don’t know, cool I guess? Time marches forward, and things change, and perhaps a new generation will look at old Switch trailers with their slide animation with the same bafflement of my little nieces and nephews when I make a “hanging up the phone” gesture in front of them.</p><p>RIP, Joy-Con slide. I’ll miss you.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/luke-plunkett-aftermath-game-of-the-year-2024"><h3>Luke’s Favourite Video Games Of 2024</h3></a><p>From archaeologists to Barnsworth, it was a good year</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/diy-speaker-pioneer-dennis-murphy-andrew-jones"><h3>The Affordable Accuracy Monitor Is Everything That DIY Should Be</h3></a><p>Dennis Murphy's mod to the now-discontinued Andrew Jones Pioneer speakers are the perfect combination of price and performance.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exoborne-playtest-will-let-you-try-yet-another-extraction-shooter-next-month.1084188/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/exoborne-playtest-february<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Sharkmob has announced an&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>playtest for February, so if you were looking for yet another extraction shooter to add to your list for some reason, then you're in luck.</p>

<p>The playtest will take place between February 12th and 17th, and unlike the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/second-monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>open beta</a> (and, indeed, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">one prior to that</a>), you'll have to request access in order to be approved for the test.</p>

<p>Sharkmob doesn't specifically say which aspects of the game you'll be granted access to if you manage to get approved for the beta, so it sounds like you'll be able to test a slice of the game, which is exciting if you're an extraction shooter fan, I suppose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/exoborne-playtest-february-storm.jpg?itok=OPeg2gwx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/exoborne-playtest-february-storm.jpg?itok=0wPd3OKI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>playtest is coming in February.</figcaption></figure><p>Playing the&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>playtest for 60 minutes will earn you two extra keys, allowing you to recruit a couple of friends and "complete your squad", as Sharkmob says.</p>

<p>As for what the game actually is, Sharkmob describes&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>as an "open-world tactical extraction shooter set in a world torn apart by extreme forces of nature". An apocalyptic cataclysm (is there any other kind?) has ravaged the world, making resources scarce and hostile humans numerous.</p>

<p>You'll be let loose in the "vast open land" of Colton County, and it'll be up to you to scavenge for loot, deal with warring factions and enemy players, and try to survive when nature's fury comes a-calling once more.</p>

<p>If you want to know what&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>looks like on a moment-to-moment level, you can check out the playtest announcement trailer right here.</p>




<p>Between this, shooters like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-patch-0-16-0-0" rel="nofollow">Escape from Tarkov</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gray-zone-warfare-tarkov-players" rel="nofollow"><em>Gray Zone Warfare</em></a>, and experiments in other genres like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeonborne-playtest-early-access" rel="nofollow">Dungeonborne</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolcen-devs-project-pantheon-live-service" rel="nofollow"><em>Project Pantheon</em></a>, the extraction genre sure is gaining popularity.</p>

<p>Whether&nbsp;<em>Exoborne&nbsp;</em>can stand out in a landscape like that remains to be seen, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2705130/Exoborne/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam</a> if you want to find out. That's also where you can request access to February's playtest.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>will launch on PC and Nintendo Switch on May 30th. There's no word on whether it'll also be released for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">newly-announced Switch 2</a>, but since that console is backwards compatible, I suppose the answer is technically "yes".</p>

<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>will take place in the land of Azuma, which are "a shadow of their prosperous past" following the events of a mysterious calamity known as the Celestial Collapse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date-farming.jpg?itok=BEGzDpb- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date-farming.jpg?itok=bYhHC9rC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>brings more cozy RPG farming goodness in May.</figcaption></figure><p>The gods of nature have abandoned the land, but one hero makes a pact with a dragon in order to use its power to save the world from its encroaching blight. That, in case you hadn't twigged, is you.</p>

<p>You'll be able to choose from one of two protagonists, whose destinies are "closely tied together", according to Marvelous.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>will also offer "reimagined and expanded&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>gameplay", meaning you'll be able not only to farm, but also to fight using new weapons like bows and talismans, as well as befriending local villagers and exploring the land of Azuma to your heart's content.</p>

<p>You can check out the latest trailer for&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, which shows the kind of direction the game is going in, right here.</p>




<p>You won't just be farming in&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, either; you'll be rebuilding entire villages, constructing and placing buildings as you see fit. It's a wonder you can find the time for romance in between being an adventurer and a city planner.</p>

<p><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2864560/Rune_Factory_Guardians_of_Azuma/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and Nintendo Switch on May 30th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

But the movie’s latest trailer makes it pretty clear that this isn’t just going to be a one-to-one translation.</p></div><p>Similar to the game, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/16/world-premiere-of-the-until-dawn-movie-trailer/">director David F. Sandberg’s <em>Until Dawn</em></a><em> </em>revolves around a group of people who find themselves trapped in a time loop that resets as they’re each murdered in a number of different horrific scenarios. When Melanie (Maia Mitchell) goes missing under mysterious circumstances, her younger sister Clover (Ella Rubin) recruits her friends Max (Michael Cimino), Megan (Ji-young Yoo), Nina (Odessa A’zion), and Abel (Belmont Cameli) on a mission to find her. In the trailer, group’s search brings them to what looks to be an inn run by Hill (Peter Stormare), an odd man who warns them that wandering farther up the road will only bring trouble into their lives.</p><p>Though one seems all that bothered by how the weather acts strangely around Hill’s inn, they know something is up when their car vanishes, and they find Melanie’s signature written in a dusty old guest log. Things only get spookier as night falls, and <em>something </em>starts lurking in the darkness around Clover and her friends. But it isn’t until people start dying that they realize they’re somehow being resurrected and challenged to survive until the morning as various ghouls try to kill them in inventive ways. </p><p>The trailer makes it seem like, despite revolving around new characters, it’ll hit many of the classic <em>Until Dawn </em>beats<em>. </em>And when the movie hits theaters on April 25th, it’ll probably keep audiences guessing as to who exactly is going to make it out alive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-patch-0-1-1-notes">Path of Exile 2 Patch 0.1.1 Notes</h2>



<h3>Endgame Changes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added 4 new Tower Map areas: Alpine Ridge, Bluff, Mesa, and Sinking Spire.</li>



<li>The Lost Towers Map area has also been revamped.</li>



<li>To address the problem of only having one attempt at the Arbiter of Ash Boss fight, you will now have up to six respawn attempts at this fight. Respawns can only be triggered by the person who put in the keys, and everyone in your party will be respawned at the same time. Leaving the Map still forfeits your attempt so you’ll still need to fight the boss with the build you walked into the Map with. Higher difficulties of the Boss will lower the number of respawn attempts you receive. We’ll be looking to add respawn attempts to other Pinnacle content over time.</li>



<li>The Arbiter of Ash can no longer be interrupted during his falling flame seed skill. His flaming gale skill can no longer be blocked.</li>



<li>The Arbiter of Ash Boss is now invulnerable for longer during its emergence and now takes significantly reduced damage while emerging.</li>



<li>The Arbiter of Ash is now way less likely to target minions when using his sword, which could prevent some of their skills being used.</li>



<li>Added checkpoints to Map areas.</li>



<li>Map areas now contain a minimum of 3 Rare Monsters.</li>



<li>Citadels can now appear closer to the Ziggurat Refuge.</li>



<li>Improved the visibility of Citadels on the Endgame Map.</li>



<li>Maps now display their Biome when hovered in the Atlas UI.</li>



<li>Added the new Overseer’s Precursor Tablet, a currency item which can be placed in completed Towers to add Map Bosses to valid Maps in radius. These tablets drop from Map Bosses, and can roll exclusive modifiers that affect Map Bosses.</li>



<li>Map areas have been adjusted to have more distinct specialities for the content they contain. For example, one Map area might have more total number of monsters, while another is more likely to contain additional content such as Strongboxes, Essences or Shrines. Generally speaking, the more difficult a Map is to clear, or the smaller it is, the more axes it will specialise in. Here’s an overview of changes we’ve made to give Maps more discernibility:</li>



<li>A number of Maps now spawn up to double the number of Chests, and twice as many minimum Magic or Rare Chests.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now contain up to double the number of Monsters.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now contain 50% more Magic Monsters.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now contain 50% more Rare Monsters.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now have a higher minimum number of Rare Monsters you will encounter.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now have a lower minimum number of Rare Monsters you will encounter.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now have 50% more chance to contain Essences.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now have 50% more chance to contain Strongboxes.</li>



<li>A number of Maps now have 50% more chance to contain Shrines.</li>



<li>Maps that are only exclusively found in Biomes containing Citadels now have 50% more chance to contain Essences, Strongboxes and Shrines.</li>



<li>Unclaimed Hideout Areas now have substantially more Magic Monsters, and fewer Rare Monsters.</li>



<li>Monsters in the Untainted Paradise have been breeding. Untainted Paradise now contains 100% more Monsters, of which spawn 100% more (thus quadruple) Magic and Rare Monsters.</li>



<li>Improved the highlightability/clickability of Shrines.</li>



<li>Reduced the damage scaling of Monsters in Simulacrum encounters with added Difficulty.</li>



<li>Adjusted the chance for Maps to contain Bosses, you should be encountering a Boss roughly every 1 in 4 Maps.</li>



<li>The chance for Map Bosses to drop a Waystone of the current tier or higher has been reduced to account for the increase in total number of Map Bosses.</li>



<li>The Radiant Waystones Atlas Notable Passive now provides +15% chance for Map Bosses to drop a Waystone of the current tier or higher (previously 25%).</li>



<li>The small Map Boss Waystone Chance Passives now provide +6% chance for Map Bosses to drop a Waystone of the current tier or higher (previously 10%).</li>



<li>The “I’m not afraid of you!” Delirium Atlas Passive Skill now grants “Delirium Bosses in your Maps drop 100% increased Simulacrum Splinters” (previously 50%).</li>



<li>Reduced the number of monsters and small chests from Breaches by 15%.</li>



<li>Increased the amount of Simulacrum Splinters found in Maps by 20%.</li>



<li>Added dedicated 2D art for Waystones that are instilled with layers of Delirium.</li>



<li>Crisis Fragments, Breachstones, Simulacrums, and An Audience with the King now have a more appropriate gold value to vendors.</li>



<li>Increased how far you can zoom out on the Endgame Map on keyboard and mouse input, to match the zoom level on controller input.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Skill Changes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Supercharged Slam now has “Each successive aftershock gains +0.5 metres to radius, up to 3 metres (previously uncapped).</li>



<li>Scavenged Plating now grants you stacks for a duration based on the enemy’s rarity. Normal enemies grant 1 stack, Magic enemies grants 2 stacks, Rare enemies grant 5 stacks, and Unique enemies grant 10 stacks.</li>



<li>The Lightning Bolt Skill granted by the Choir of the Storm Unique Amulet has been renamed to Greater Lightning Bolt to differentiate it from the Skill granted by Staves. Triggered Greater Lightning Bolts are now unable to trigger a subsequent Greater Lightning Bolt if the first was a Critical Hit. Greater Lightning Bolt now deals roughly 3.5 times more base Lightning Damage compared to Lightning Bolt.</li>



<li>The Temporalis Unique Body Armour can no longer reduce the cooldown of a Skill to below 100ms.</li>



<li>Skills socketed in a Meta Gem’s sockets can no longer gain energy.</li>



<li>Clarified Vine Arrow’s description to explicitly state that it hits enemies on landing.</li>



<li>Removed the Aura tag from Pain Offering for consistency with other minion skills, as the skill does not directly create an Aura (the Aura is created by the summoned minion).</li>
</ul>



<h3>Monster Changes</h3>

<li>Monsters now have increased Toughness per Essence modifier affecting them.</li>

<li>Adjusted the frequency of some monsters such as Prowling Shades and Gelid Zealots.</li>



<li>Vaal Zealots are now less likely to repeatedly use their Eye of Winter skill.</li>

<li>Slitherspitters no longer deal damage twice with their projectile attack. Their melee attack now deals Physical damage instead of Chaos.</li>

            <p>Nintendo has reportedly set itself up with a supply chain network which will ultimately allow the company to sell in excess of 20m Switch 2 units during the console's first year on the market.</p>
<p>This nugget of information comes from a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/nintendo-to-unveil-next-generation-switch-2-in-april?srnd=undefined">Bloomberg</a> report citing Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Robin Zhu. To put that number into more perspective, Nintendo sold "around 15m" Switch units during its own first four quarters after release, so we are looking at (potentially) a 33 percent increase in sales during those first 12 months.</p>
<p>"Given the hardware segment drove 40 percent of fiscal 2024 top line, a successor to the 2017 Switch could go hand-in-hand with its stronger game pipeline in fiscal 2026, reversing what is expected to be the fourth consecutive year of lackluster sales growth in fiscal 2024," added analyst Nathan Naidu.</p>
