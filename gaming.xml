The logical answer is “I will play <em>Mario Kart World</em>,” and I respect those of you who feel that way. I, too, will be playing some <em>World</em>, in part because it’s one of the few game series that my wife and I enjoy playing together (and I need to justify this purchase somehow). But, it won’t be the first thing I’m doing.</p><p>I won’t be licking any cartridges either — I already know they’re going to taste bad — or huffing Switch 2 exhaust fumes. Actually, I’m sad to say that the very first thing I’ll be doing with my unit is plugging it in to charge and walking away for a while to pick my kid up from gym class. However, when I return I’ll be tearing through the setup screens, and… seeing how <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/9/23592822/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-best-way-classic">Metroid Prime Remastered</a></em> looks.</p><p>Don’t dash my dreams of the Switch 2’s graphics upscaling giving all of my Switch favorites a glow-up. I <em>know </em>that’s probably not how this is going to work, having seen how Sony’s PSSR tech can’t “automagically” make PS4 games run better in a much more powerful console, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">PS5 Pro</a>. Let me live in that fleeting moment before hope inevitably turns to melancholy, after which I’ll wait for Nintendo to (hopefully) trickle out updates on a game-by-game basis.</p><p>Anyway… what will you be doing first with your Switch 2? Let’s hear it. Looking for easter eggs in the box design? Flipping your unit for profit? (Hopefully not!)

            <p>Witcher fans have naturally been busy poring over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-shows-off-a-swanky-ue5-tech-demo-at-state-of-unreal-2025-with-ciri-hunting-monsters-and-visiting-circuses-in-kovir">tech demo</a> in search of interesting details beyond the big obvious teases. One group on Reddit reckon their ears picked up the voice of Witcher 3 actor Richard Hawley.</p>
<p>Hawley voiced a few characters in Gerry from the Riviera’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pc-mods-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">clash with the Wild Hunt</a>, with Caleb Menge, Francis Bedlam, and Redanian schemer Sigismund Dijkstra all boasting his dulcet tones. It’s that last one that’ll likely have lodged the actor’s voice into your brain.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It’s also the name that some Witcher fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/1l2eys9/did_anyone_else_recognise_dijkstras_voice_actor/">Reddit</a> have admitted they shouted at the screen when Ciri chats to a bearded merchant about her current monster contract at around the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nthv4xF_zHU">ten minute mark</a>, after taking a walk through Valdrest. I’ve taken a listen to both the merchant and Dijikstra, and the two do sound a bit alike to me, especially when the merchant says certain phrases. I’ve also reached out to CD Projekt for confirmation.</p>
<p>As some of the fans in the Reddit thread have pointed out, if this is indeed Hawley, he’d be an interestingly fitting inclusion in this particular tech demo. In addition to those characters he voiced in The Witcher 3, Hawley also voiced a number in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings-enhanced-edition">The Witcher 2</a>. One of these is Carduin of Lan Exeter, a Koviri mage Geralt meets during the summit at Loc Muinne.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed from his name, this wizard is from the city that CD Projekt ended TW4’s tech demo by teasing via a shot of Ciri looking out at it nestled in the distance. Spoilers for The Witcher 3 and The Witcher 2 incoming, so skip the next couple of paragraphs if you want to miss them.</p>
<p>Carduin’s exact fate in the series so far is influenced by the choices you made at the conclusion of The Witcher 2, but it is possible to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWttKXXDVPY">run into him</a> in The Witcher 3 depending on what you picked.</p>
<p>If you do, he’ll be in Oxenfurt serving alongside Radovid of Redania, as a result of needing to avoid being burned at the stake, and to my knowledge isn’t confirmed as being killed alongside the ruler if you choose to aid in Radovid’s assassination. So, it seems possible he could show up in The Witcher 4, especially if the game’s story involves matters affecting Koviri politics or involving magic in the region, which seems a good shout if it's more than a brief stop in whatever journey Ciri’s on. I'd certainly be up for it, even if just to potentially see Esterad Thyssen in non-Gwent card form.</p>
<p>As it is, TW3 and TW2 had Hawley voicing multiple characters - ones who were all key figures in Novigrad in the case of the latter. If this tech demo merchant is played by him and ends up being in the final game, I’d wager there’s a good chance it’ll just be one of the times you hear his voice. For now, though, all any of us outside of CD Projekt can do is speculate.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> has surpassed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> on Steam's Top Sellers chart, one day before its early launch for Deluxe and Ultimate Edition owners. Only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter Strike 2</a> seems able to keep the Survival MMO at bay.</p>
<p>The game previously hit a concurrent player peak of 37,889 during a closed weekend beta, initially limited to those invited <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/funcom-has-heard-your-feedback-and-opened-the-dune-awakening-beta-to-all-pre-orderers">but opened up to pre-orderers near the conclusion</a>. These folks were able to play through the same early portion as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-proves-mmos-can-still-be-interesting-and-try-new-things">our lovely Bertie dived into in the Eurogamer preview</a>.</p>
<p>It has managed to slip past Elden Ring Nightreign, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-strong-start-on-steam-reaching-over-300k-concurrent-peak">which had a strong start on Steam</a> before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">recently surpassing the 3.5m sales mark across all platforms</a>. It's worth noting of course that Nightreign came out last Friday, so it was bound to start trickling down the Top Sellers chart sooner or later.</p>

<p>Dune Awakening, the next big release from Funcom, releases for all players on 10th June, but those looking to hop in tomorrow will have to drop at least £58.50 / $69.99 / €69.99  for the Deluxe Edition. Obviously, there's no way to differentiate which version Steam users are buying to cause this surge up the store page, but it's certainly a good indicator for initial interest.</p>
<p>Recently, Funcom peeled back the curtain on the mid - end game experience in Dune Awakening <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMpSKFSWjMM">in a lengthy live stream</a>, providing much-needed information on what those who sink dozens if not hundreds of hours into the game will actually be doing. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.vg247.com/">VG247</a> also <a href="https://www.vg247.com/dune-awakenings-creative-director-speaks-on-the-end-game-and-how-the-landsraad-will-give-key-roles-to-crafter-and-killer-alike">interviewed the creative director on the Landsraad system</a>, a rotating semi-randomised set of server wide tasks the Atreides and Harkonnen will be battling over.</p>
<p>For those unaware the game follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-devs-explain-their-alt-history-approach-to-the-vast-intricate-follow-up-to-conan-exiles">an alternate history of Frank Herbert's sci-fi series of novels</a>, though aesthetically more aligned with the recent films by Denis Villeneuve. Its creators at Funcom were responsible for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-secret-world-preview-2">The Secret World</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/anarchy-online">Anarchy Online.</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>I yearn for the excavation site. This is the result of spending too much time with Dig Dig Dino, the newest release from Playdate’s long awaited Season 2, and a game about digging up dinosaurs and detritus.</p>
<p>It is, as with many of Playdate’s games, presented with an untold amount of charm and carefully cultivated visuals, making the most of the handheld’s crisp monochrome screen, with a tightly crafted gameplay loop that is surprisingly moorish. It’s about digging. And it’s good.</p>
<p>Your archeological team are a series of humanoid animals, led by a canine chap in a jacket – Dig Dig Dino’s Alan Grant – with each of your companions in charge of an important sector for your dig, including the archivist collecting artefacts, a scientist collecting DNA strands – when has that ever worked out? – and a tech guru who provides you with upgrades and enhancements like Q from James Bond, only he’s a pig. No, not a chauvinist pig, an actual one.</p>

<p>The central gameplay loop revolves around digging. You have a set amount of energy, as well as a shovel and a drill, and each time you dig through a particular layer of soil, you use up some energy. Rocks are your main nemesis, and you have to drill these into oblivion to get to the sweet bones beneath, with some taking multiple hits to shatter. When your energy runs out, that’s the end of this run.</p>

<p>You then take the cash you’ve earned from whatever you’ve dug up – whether that’s coins, trash or actual archeological finds – and buy upgrades, improving how much digging your spade does, or gaining new technology like a radar that helps you locate items of interest. Once you’ve spent all your money, you head out to dig up some more things, and start all over again.</p>

<p>The funny thing is, you’ll keep doing it. It probably shouldn’t work, but there’s something hugely appealing and fundamentally satisfying about clearing an area or digging deeper to find the missing DNA strand for a particular dinosaur. There’s also a puzzle element to it, uncovering the tip of a bone or artefact, and then working out the most efficient way to excavate it with the energy you have remaining.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of longevity here, with multiple areas each hiding a series of skeletons, as well as different artefacts and treasures. When many Playdate games have a finite lifespan, or explore a very acute set of mechanics or ideas, Dig Dig Dino has just the right hook to keep you coming back.</p>
<p>Dig Dig Dino is just delightful, and it goes to show just what developers can achieve with the consistently surprising handheld.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-will-not-host-its-annual-ubisoft-forward-event-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft is not hosting its annual Ubisoft Forward event this year, for the first time since Ubisoft began running its '<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forward-july-e3-style-game-reveals/">Ubisoft Forward' showcases in 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Wccftech reached out to Ubisoft to confirm the initial report, but the confirmation first came from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3lqqfmg47ok2z">Game File founder and reporter Stephen Totilo</a>, who was told by a Ubisoft representative that the company is <em>"always eager to connect with our players and showcase our</em> <em>games</em>" and that it is "<em>continuing to explore opportunities to share updates, and we look forward to providing more information at a later date</em>."</p>
<p>Wccftech was also told, as was Totilo, that we'll see Ubisoft participating in other aspects of Summer Game Fest, including the IGN Live event this weekend between June 7 and 8 and the PC Gaming Show on June 8. We'll also see Ubisoft later this summer at Gamescom 2025.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d/app.bsky.feed.post/3lqqfmg47ok2z" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreih6cxjkkvnfc6bjjpdzmcgfmbmrw3uwtreebolpz3jejeluqul4bm">
<p lang="en">Ubisoft Forward, which has been a digital and in-person showcase for the company's games just about every June, isn't happening this year.A company rep tells me Ubisoft will participate in IGN Live (June 7-8) and PC Gaming Show (June 8) and will also be at GamesCom</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d?ref_src=embed">Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d/post/3lqqfmg47ok2z?ref_src=embed">2025-06-03T23:03:50.202Z</a></p></blockquote>


<p>When Wccftech reached out to confirm Totilo's report, we also asked for any further clarification as to why the decision was made to skip 2025, and if the event will return next year. We simply received the same statement that was initially reported, with no further clarification.</p>
<p>Though, as Totilo points out, it's not the biggest surprise that Ubisoft is taking a year off. To say that Ubisoft is going through a big internal shift at the moment would be an understatement, as it is figuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">out a new structure post its deal with Tencent</a>, which could very well lead to <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/">more layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some of the company's biggest series are <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-seemingly-teasing-more-splinter-cell-remake-news-is-coming-soon/">nowhere to be seen</a>, seemingly in a state of<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-2026-no-word-on-splinter-cell-remake/"> development limbo</a>, and that's before getting into other issues the company is currently facing, with former executives from the company <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/02/ubisoft-trial-france-accused-sexual-harassment-video-games-me-too">currently on trial for alleged sexual harassment</a>.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-for-march-2025-while-fortnite-was-the-most-played-game-on-consoles/">has done incredibly well</a>, sure, but it's the lone big win Ubisoft has had to cut its streak of losses from 2024. And just yesterday, the company's failed multiplayer shooter, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-now-taken-offline-forever/">XDefiant, was officially taken offline forever</a>.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what the company has for the events it is confirmed to participate in this weekend, but with everything it has going on, it's almost no wonder why Yves Guillemot didn't want to stand on a stage to celebrate the company's short and long-term future.</p>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>No Man’s Sky</em> is about to take flight on yet another new platform: developer Hello Games announced today that the sci-fi exploration game will be getting a free update that will enhance it for the Nintendo Switch 2, which launches on June 5th.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/23/23179322/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-release-date">The game came to the original Switch in 2022</a>, and Hello Games says getting it crammed onto Nintendo’s previous console was “a bit of a technical miracle,” while calling the Switch 2 version “a huge leap forward.” On the Switch 2, the game will improve both the amount and quality of stuff on screen at any given moment. “We’re rendering significantly more than before, at a higher resolution <em>and </em>improved framerate,“ the developer says.</p><p>It will also feature full multiplayer support, which was missing from the first Switch version of the game. Additionally, the Switch 2 version of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> will include features like touchscreen support, gyro controls, and cross-save.</p><p>The new platform is part of a larger update that spans all versions of the game. Called Beacon, it introduces something of a settlement management element to the game. Here’s how Hello Games explains it:</p><div><blockquote><p>Beacon completely overhauls settlements, bringing towns and their management to No Man’s Sky. There are huge new robotic settlements to discover, with impossibly new sci-fi buildings. Players can become town mayor and take ownership of multiple settlements. You can construct buildings and upgrade each one, with new building types like jukebox bars where you can choose the music, merchants where you can build custom starships or even ponds you can chill and fish at.</p><p>Each inhabitant can be conversed with, with their own abilities and attributes to manage. As town mayor you’ll be enlisted to welcome new settlers, resolve disputes, and make choices to create prosperity. A well managed settlement can make their owners rich in resources, but they need to be protected. Travellers can hire a squadron of wingmen, who will now defend towns when they come under attack from roving pirates.</p></blockquote></div><p>As with all updates for <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, Beacon will be free to download. It launches today.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Switch 2 not only increases that limit to 15,000 for the console itself, it also lets you store another 15,000 screenshots on the auxiliary microSD Express card. It might be enough to document every square inch of Mario Kart World. At the very least, no more sorting through what screenshots to delete in the short term anyway. </p><p><em>We’ll be updating this story throughout the day so check back for more news on what players are finding as Nintendo’s most anticipated console launch ever finally gets underway.</em> </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The update adds a new questline, new recipes, rare fish to collect and display in your C.A.M.P., and of course, a chill new pastime that can be enjoyed anywhere across the map.</p><p>Fishing can be unlocked through the new Casting Off questline, which can be accessed through a new location in the Mire known as Fisherman's Rest. The questline will give players the base-level fishing rod, which can then be upgraded through Tinker's Workbench.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fallout 76 Season 21 Gone Fission Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The fishing rod isn't an item that needs to be manually equipped; instead, just go up to any body of water and select the "Fish" command when it shows up on screen. Fishing isn't contained to just the new area. You can fish anywhere across the map with a handy mantra: If you can swim in it, you can fish in it.</p><p>There are a number of fish to be caught in Fallout 76, from generic fish to regional fish that have differing levels of rarity from common to super rare. The rarest catch is a super-cute axolotl--there are twelve of them to be caught, with one unique axolotl available to be caught every month.</p><p>You'll have to upgrade both your bait and your rod to have a chance at catching rarer fish, and the weather will play a part in what you can catch, too. Fish you catch can be eaten as is, broken down into Fish Bits that can be used in recipes, or saved and displayed in your C.A.M.P. with a new fish-display item.</p><p>The Gone Fission season also adds a heap of new fishing-related items. Check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76s-new-season-has-the-best-name-includes-basket-of-dead-fish/1100-6531784/" data-ref-id="1100-6531784">everything new in seasonal content here</a>.</p><p>While the fishing additions make up the majority of the latest patch, Bethesda is continuing with major combat balance changes first initiated in last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fallout-76-everything-new-in-the-skyline-valley-update/2900-5472/" data-ref-id="2900-5472">Skyline Valley update</a>.

        <p>Is it just me, or is the game's second anniversary event kinda nothing?</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The time has come to celebrate the second anniversary of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>. Yes, the game has been out for two years now, even if it does not feel like it's been that long. And with every anniversary, of course, comes a new event from Blizzard designed to commemorate it.</p>
<p>The second Anniversary Celebration is now live in-game. And, honestly, does not feel like that much of a big deal. At all.</p>
<p>The Diablo 4 Second Anniversary event is available from now until Tuesday, 17th June, giving you about two weeks to take part in the muted festivities. And you'd only really want to do that, of course, if you care about the rewards you could get from grinding through the activities; rewards which this event does actually have, even if they're nothing to really write home about.</p>
<p>Now that Diablo 4 has <a href="https://www.vg247.com/diablo-4-season-8-belials-return-new-battle-pass-reliquary-details">adopted Call of Duty's battle pass system</a>, there's a new Event Reliquary (which is essentially a mini-battle pass) that runs parallel to the Season 8 Reliquary. While the new system <em>does</em> offer more utility, and is practically designed for situations like this, it has not been well received by players <a href="https://www.vg247.com/diablo-4-reliquaries-new-battle-pass-system-season-8-player-reaction">because of how little of the premium currency it offers compared to the old style</a>.</p>
<p>But we're not here to talk about that, we're here to reveal the rewards... all six of them. As part of the event Reliquary, you'll be able to exchange your Gold for these rewards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sunflame Lantern Mount Trophy.</li>
<li>Burning Dawn Banner Mount Trophy.</li>
<li>Sunraiser Sword Cosmetic.</li>
<li>Sunflame Sword Two-Handed Sword Cosmetic.</li>
<li>Burning Barbs Polearm Cosmetic.</li>
<li>Burning Dawn Bow Cosmetic.</li>
</ul>
<figure>

<figcaption>Look at my horse, my horse is amazing. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Blizzard</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once you've collected all six of the skins above, you'll automatically earn The Burning Dawn Mount Armor. Having Gold set as the currency of this particular event is certainly interesting, mainly because it doesn't involve some other paid currency, or any sort of in-game grinding. You will, of course, need to have enough Gold to be able to afford everything, but farming Gold isn't difficult, and gives you the freedom to do whatever you want in the game (rather than force you into certain time-gated events).</p>
<p>The recent <a href="https://www.vg247.com/diablo-4-berserk-cross-over-event-details-skins-gameplay-cosmetics">Berserk collaboration event</a> certainly reminded everyone why limited-time events exist to begin with, with its meagre in-game rewards, and a skin pack that <a href="https://www.vg247.com/diablo-4-berserk-cross-over-event-cosmetics-skins-prices">would've run you £110 if you wanted the actually good cosmetics</a>.</p>
<p>Given that, many players will no doubt be happy to learn that there are zero skins being sold for real money as part of the Anniversary event. As a bonus, a Mother's Blessing event will also be running right alongside the two-year party, giving everyone 35 percent extra XP, and 50 percent extra Gold.</p>
<p>This improved version of Mother's Blessing also means each time you turn in your Grim Favors at the Tree of Whispers, you'll receive an extra cache, which includes items you'd find in a Collection of Chaos cache. If you've been away from the game for a while, or don't know what that means, trust me when I say: it's a pretty good boon to have.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It seems very likely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/mario-kart-world-switch-2-nintendo-kosuke-yabuki-1235350685/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, Mario Kart World producer Kosuke Yabuki acknowledged that 200cc had been a popular addition to the series, but stopped short of confirming anything around its return — for now. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Some players are really happy with the addition of high difficulty modes likes this," Kosuke teased. "However, does that mean we're going to consider adding engine sizes that are larger than 150cc to Mario Kart World? I'm afraid I can't say just yet."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not surprising that Nintendo has not included 200cc within Mario Kart World at launch. The mode's arrival at a later date allows the game's fans to learn courses and get used to playing at the standard 150cc (or lower, if you need) before the tougher challenge of 200cc arrives at a later date. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This will likely only be more of a consideration with Mario Kart World's multiplayer-friendly gameplay, in which groups of players are encouraged to team up and explore together, their GameChat open, and cameras switched on. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Presumably, whenever Mario Kart World's 200cc update does arrive, all players will need to be playing at the same level to explore the game's map together. It's therefore better, once again, to let players get to grips with 150cc first before things step up a gear, or engine size.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World launches this week alongside Nintendo Switch 2, and boasts a seamless map that can be explored at will. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-open-world-isnt-what-you-think-it-is">Just don't go into this offering expecting it to be like Forza Horizon</a>, IGN has said.

Unknown Worlds has dropped a new 10-minute Q&amp;A about all things <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/subnautica-2"><u>Subnautica 2</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbvNYN76ArQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>video interview</u></a> between community manager Donya Abramo and creative producer Scott MacDonald gives us few more details about what's coming up in the action survival game, including confirmation that we're going back to a silent protagonist. There was also an emphasis on assuring fans that rather than being a co-op game that lets you play solo, Unknown Worlds has specifically designed Subnautica 2 to be a single-player adventure with optional co-op (yes, there <em>is</em> a difference!). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for just how big Subnautica 2 will be? "The playable map size will be bigger than what we originally launched in early access on the original Subnautica, and even Below Zero's early access release," said MacDonald. "But just how big and how deep you'll be able to go over the course of early access? We're not exactly sure yet. The entire world is being handcrafted by a talented team of world designers and environment artists, and they're pouring everything into the world right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're aiming for this to be the biggest and most exciting Subnautica game ever once we hit 1.0 in a few years' time."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Not everything is coming back bigger and better, though. Apparently, the Cyclops, Seamoth, and Sea Truck will not return, but new vehicles are being developed that are "designed in the same spirit, just more suited to the brand new environment they need to navigate."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Though a big sub won't be ready for the start of early access, know that the team is hard at work behind the scenes crafting one," added Abramo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we're still no closer to a concrete release date, the team did confirm an early access period will launch later this year, and it's because of that early access period that the release is limited to PC and Xbox — there is no way of releasing an early access product on PlayStation as yet. There is sadly no VR support at this time, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, there are no plans for proximity chat, but the option is "being investigated" by the development team. In the meantime, it's recommended you connect with your pals via Discord. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new installment in the Subnautica series <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-adds-a-new-planet-and-co-op-in-2025"><u>accommodates up to four players</u></a>, taking them to an all-new planet, complete with new environments, flora, and fauna to discover.

                <p>Building a gaming PC is kind of like building a hot rod--sure, the parts that make the car go fast are important, but if you're going to spend all that time on it, shouldn't it look cool, too? As such, PC gamers who build their own systems love to look for the PC case that fits their aesthetic. Computex, the annual computing convention held in Taipei, Taiwan, is where PC case-makers go to show off the chassis they'll be selling throughout the year. Some are purely cosmetic, while others put function over form, but many are fascinating. It's important to note that, due to the international trade situation caused by U.S. tariffs, the availability of some new computing items is in question. That said, here are some of the cases we loved from the show.</p><h3>Hyte X50 Air</h3><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNMBD7S3AGk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jNMBD7S3AGk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Hyte has become a prominent name in PC cases in the last couple of years, and the <a href="https://hyte.com/events/computex?utm_campaign=computex2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X50 Air</a> makes it easy to see why. With its rounded edges and unique color options--lavender, matcha, pink, and red to go with the standard black and white variants--the design language calls to mind the iMacs of yore.</p><p>In the interview with Gamers Nexus in the video above, HYTE Product Director Rob Teller explains just how hard it is to put an airflow-friendly mesh onto a curved surface, as they've done with this case. He shows off a variety of failed test models, including one with metal so soft that it began to rust in a week and another where the edge of the mesh acted more like a "tear here" perforation line. The end product, though, is a truly unique-looking case with gentle curves inside and out.</p><p>This case isn't available quite yet, but HYTE has a bunch of other great cases already on the market, such as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKW889MJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hyte Y70</a>, which offers a number of fun colorways, including the pink one pictured below, but with fewer curves. This one retails for $239.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499266-hyte-x50-blk-1-converted.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499267-hyte-x50-matcha-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499268-hyte-x50-pink-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499269-hyte-x50-red-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499270-hyte-x50-taro-5-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499271-hyte-x50-white-4-converted.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4499266,1300-4499267,1300-4499268,1300-4499269,1300-4499270,1300-4499271" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4499266-hyte-x50-blk-1-converted.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4499267-hyte-x50-matcha-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4499268-hyte-x50-pink-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4499269-hyte-x50-red-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4499270-hyte-x50-taro-5-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4499271-hyte-x50-white-4-converted.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499266-hyte-x50-blk-1-converted.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499267-hyte-x50-matcha-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499268-hyte-x50-pink-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499269-hyte-x50-red-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499270-hyte-x50-taro-5-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499271-hyte-x50-white-4-converted.jpeg"></figure><h3>Silverstone FLP02</h3><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5Kmo8RPrmo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z5Kmo8RPrmo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The case makes for an interesting blend of retro aesthetics with modern adaptations. The inside of the case is spacious enough to fit beefy GPUs and AIO coolers up to 360mm. The front of the case features one USB Type-C, two USB Type-A ports, and a combo audio jack hidden under a magnetic flap, as well.</p><p>But it also makes use of standard features seen on those old PC cases. There's a working lock on the front of the case that locks the power button. The Turbo button, used to overclock old CPUs back in the PC stone age, will now allow you to manually crank up your fan speed. The front of the case also has space for three 5.25-inch drives. The floppy disk-style dummy pieces can be left in place if you're one of the 99% of PC gamers who hasn't used an optical drive in more than a decade (not scientifically verified), but you can indeed slot 5.25-inch optical drives into those spots, if you like.</p><p>The original ultra-retro FLP01 was a very popular case for Silverstone, and the company <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/pc-cases/silverstone-reveals-the-flp02-late-80s-style-tower-pc-case-proudly-beige-but-thoroughly-modern-inside" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told Tom's Hardware</a> that it plans to make a lot of these cases to keep up with demand. The FLP02 will retail later this year for $220 in the U.S. If you're looking for another retro case, there isn't really anything like it on the market except for SilverStone's FLP01, which the company has a hard time keeping in stock. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Technology-All-Metal-Radiator-SST-FA514X-WG/dp/B0D9PQ35CF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SilverStone FARA 514X</a>, priced at $129, is another ATX mid-tower-sized case with plenty of room and a more modern design.</p><h3>Cooler Master MasterFrame 360 Panoramic</h3><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHwd-PQbRjg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="466">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MHwd-PQbRjg?start=466" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>PC builders are no strangers to building aesthetically-appealing PCs, as cases have featured tempered glass panels for decades, but recent innovations have brought us things like fish-tank-style cases and curved glass corners to really show things off. If you're <em>really</em> confident in your building skills, though, you can show off to the world with Cooler Master's MasterFrame 360 Panoramic, which offers a continuous view into your PC case from the front and both sides. You'll have to manage your cables carefully if you want to make the best use of this chassis.</p><p>There's also a variant of the MasterFrame 360 Panoramic, called the AK Mods X Bounce, that puts a stage on the front of the case, backed by an LCD screen. The idea with this variant is to let you put something there--Batman, Sephiroth, Hello Kitty, or whatever your favorite action figure is--and then give it an animated background to stand in front of. We're expecting lots of cool mods to come out of this particular option. Cooler Master has not yet revealed availability or price, however.</p><p>It seems we'll be waiting a bit for the MasterFrame 360 Panoramic, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-MasterFrame-Open-Air-Panoramic/dp/B08T5PRCCN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cooler Master's MasterFrame 700</a> will do an equally good job of putting your PC on display to admire, albeit without the curved glass. We're betting it's less expensive than the 360 Panoramic, too, at $191.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> is boldly going where no nine-year-old exploratory space sim has gone before: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. Developer Hello Games has announced a free launch-day update that'll bring significant upgrades compared to the original Switch release, including enhanced visuals, multiplayer, and more. That's in addition to a major update for all platforms arriving today.
</p>
<p>
Starting with Switch 2, Hello Games says this new version of No Man's Sky is a "huge leap" over the original Switch release, featuring "massively" increased density and detail, plus higher resolutions and improved frame rates (the <a href="https://youtu.be/cgYYQwHuh-Y">studio's announcement video</a> suggests 40fps at 1080p while playing portable, and 30fps at 1440p in docked mode).
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 also gets multiplayer and settlements - two features missing on Switch 1 - as well as cross-save and cross-play, so it's possible to jump seamlessly between devices. No Man's Sky's Switch 2 upgrade is free to existing users and launches alongside the console on 5th June.

<p>
It'll also include <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/beacon-update">No Man's Sky's new Beacon update</a>, which arrives today, 4th June, on all other platforms. This provides a significant overhaul of the space sim's existing settlement system, which essentially enables players to become the mayor of their own Mos Eisleys.
</p>
<p>There are new robotic settlements, for instance, and it's now possible to own multiple settlements instead of just one. There's also suggestion of more granular customisation and management, with talk of new upgradeable buildings types and settlement features, ranging from custom starship merchants to fishing ponds. That's alongside citizens with their own stories and abilities, and the option to enlist wingmen to protect your settlements from pirates. All of which sounds wonderful, but if the update wipes out the sprawling, settlement-adjacent cliffside base I've spent the last two years building, I will 100 percent cry.
</p>
<p>
So to recap, No Man's Sky's Beacon update is out today on PC, PCVR, Steam Deck, PlayStation 4, PS5, PSVR, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch 1, with a Switch 2 update due tomorrow, 5th June. And as Hello Games is fond of teasing, "more will follow". But what of the developer's next game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">planetary sim Light No Fire?</a> It's been a while since we've had an update on that, so fingers crossed for a bit of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Game Fest</a> news.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-launches-massively-improved-switch-2-version-lets-you-be-a-towns-mayor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Over the last year or so, Hello Games has secretly prepared a Nintendo Switch 2 version of No Man's Sky that will be available when <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the console</a> launches tomorrow.</p>
<p>According to the independent British studio, this new version is a massive improvement over the existing Switch version, which, in their own words, pushed that console's hardware to the absolute max of its capabilities. For instance, it was possibly the only game to support AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 on the platform.</p>
<p>Firstly, on the Nintendo Switch 2, No Man's Sky includes its full multiplayer functionality (which the first Switch lacked), including cross-save and cross-play. The density, level of detail, resolution, and frame rate are all significantly higher. Textures are now in higher resolution, and pixel density has been increased in both TV and handheld modes. The UI's resolution has been improved, too, and this version also supports the touchscreen and gyro controls.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Switch 2 Edition Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cgYYQwHuh-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But there's also a new No Man's Sky update out today on all platforms. Titled BEACON, it greatly overhauls settlements and even adds the ability for players to become a town's mayor, taking ownership of multiple settlements. They can construct and upgrade buildings, including new types such as jukebox bars where players can choose the music, merchants where they can build custom starships, and ponds where they can relax and fish.</p>
<p>Each inhabitant can be conversed with. They have their own abilities and attributes, too. As mayor, you will be responsible for welcoming new settlers, resolving disputes and making choices to create prosperity. A well-managed settlement can make its owner rich in resources, but it needs to be protected. Travellers can hire a squadron of wingmen to defend towns when they are attacked by roaming pirates.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Beacon Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRrjItm3j4s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is the 38th named update for No Man's Sky. Following the underwhelming launch in 2016, there's no doubt that Hello Games has more than redeemed itself, as evidenced by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-finally-reaches-very-positive-overall-user-review-rating-on-steam-8-years-after-disastrous-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very positive user reviews.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-mans-sky-beacon-update-released-switch-2-edition-confirmed.1206609/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-beacon-update-switch-2-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello Games has released a brand new update for&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>by the name of Beacon, and what's more, the studio has also announced that the game is getting a Switch 2 Edition upgrade on Nintendo's new console.</p>

<p>Beacon follows on from major&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>updates like March's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-relics-update" rel="nofollow">Relics</a> and January's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-2-update" rel="nofollow">Worlds Part 2</a>, and it's on a pretty similar scale to those updates, adding some pretty major features to the game.</p>

<p>First up, the settlement system has been overhauled; you can now become the overseer of "multiple planetary settlements", according to Hello Games, and the systems for things like base management, upgrades, and decision-making have also been improved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-mans-sky-beacon-update-switch-2-running.jpg?itok=agxaBPVQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-mans-sky-beacon-update-switch-2-running.jpg?itok=zH0jmtKJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>No Man's Sky</em>'s new Beacon update is bringing a major overhaul to settlements.</figcaption></figure><p>You can now also view your settlements' history and achievements thanks to "improved record-keeping", which will also show you the happiness of the citizens who live in your settlements, as well as other stats.</p>

<p>Not only that, but disputes between those citizens have also been overhauled, with more resolutions now available to you when citizens have a disagreement in your settlements. If you want to see why those disagreements got started, you can check the new settler personality info page.</p>

<p>There are tons of other changes to&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>'s settlement system as part of the Beacon update, and plenty of other features have been added as well. Make sure to check out the <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/beacon-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full patch notes via the game's official website</a> for more info.</p>

<p>As well as the Beacon update, Hello Games has also revealed that a Switch 2 Edition upgrade is coming for&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>, and it adds some features that are missing in the original Switch version.</p>




<p>First and foremost, multiplayer will be available in the Switch 2 version, as will settlements. Both features are missing from the Switch version of the game.</p>

<p>Of course, the Switch 2 Edition version of&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>will also boast better visuals and performance, as well as touch controls, gyro aiming, and cross-save support. What's more, the Switch 2 upgrade will be entirely free.</p>

<p><em>No Man's Sky</em>'s Beacon update is available for the game right now. You can check out&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/no-mans-sky/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/no-mans-sky/BQVQTL3PCH05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/no-mans-sky-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, with the Switch 2 version on the way tomorrow.</p>

            <p>If you found the feudal festival of backstabbing that was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> distressingly upbeat and wholesome, perhaps you'll be more impressed by Never's End, a new turn and grid-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny</a>'s former lead sandbox gameplay designer Ryan Jucket with character designs from Final Fantasy artist Masayoshi Nishimura.</p>
<p>It takes place in a world swamped by creeping undead darkness, and casts you as a warrior spirit wrought of deathless silver. Taking charge of the last surviving village, you will possess and burn away the very souls of townsfolk in order to transform them into battlefield units. Careful, though, because the more villagers you catch in your mirrors and reduce to living weapons, the stronger the Never becomes.</p><!--more-->

<p>If that were all there were to Never's End, I might have given it a miss. The other source of intrigue here is that battles put a big emphasis on using spells to modify the terrain and atmospheric conditions. "Temperature, weather, wind, water level, and even the density of the earth beneath your feet can all be manipulated to gain the advantage in combat," observes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1999930/Nevers_End/">the Steam page</a>. "Drain rivers dry or flood the battlefield. Create rain and fog to hamper your enemies, or mighty winds to hurl them over cliffs. Freeze your foes or set them aflame. Reshape earth to gain the high ground, or melt it into deadly lava."</p>
<p>Sounds like a jolly time. The last tactical RPG I played that meddled with the air and soil this extravagantly was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tenderfoot-tactics">Tenderfoot Tactics</a>, and I've been hankering for a similar feat of geomancy. I'm also quite sold on the art style, which suggests a handsome Dreamcast remake of a PS1 game.</p>
<p>Going by the launch description, the campaign will give you the choice of when to mount an assault on the heart of the Never, which pumps out fresh boglins at regular intervals. There's an open-ended overworld full of jungles, deserts and tundra where you'll go on hunting missions and pick through the treasures of a forgotten golden age. Very Destiny-ish, indeed.</p>
<p>"Cleanse corrupted settlements, awaken long-dormant temples, unearth lost technology, and then reap the rewards as civilization rebuilds in your wake," comments the Steam page. The rebuilding theme extends to the founding of new towns, each a source of (willing?) husks for your zombo war effort.</p>
<p>Are you the real villain here? Well, put it this way: when you're felled in combat, you're reborn at HQ as a rapidly congealing pool of liquid silver. The last time I saw somebody do that it was the T-1000 from Terminator 2, and he did not strike me as promising village management material. If you enjoy the foulness of all this but can't abide grid-based battlers, maybe check out <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/against-the-storm">Against The Storm</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
