            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345484/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-january-launch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s coming a little later than we initially thought, but The Pokémon Company (TCPi) has finally announced when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248306/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hands-on"><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em></a>’s long-awaited <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296690/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trade-cards">trading functionality</a> is rolling out.</p><p>Today, TCPi revealed that, along with <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s next set of cards, the game’s trading feature is set to launch later this month. TCPi didn’t specify an exact date in its statement about the update, but it did explain that trading will involve some restrictions and costs. In order to swap cards, people will first have to be friends with one another in the game. </p><p>In order to swap cards, people will first have to be friends with one another in the game. Trades can only occur if players are offering up cards with the same rarity, meaning that you won’t be able to trade powerful EX cards for more common ones that are easier to pull. Additionally, TCPi trading is limited to cards that have rarities of 1-4 diamonds or a single star full-art cards, and TCPi noted that “items must be consumed in order to trade.”</p><p>It’s not clear which particular items players will need for trades, but it feels likely that the process will involve spending Poké gold, one of <em>Pocket</em>’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684">multiple in-game currencies</a> that can be purchased in exchange for real money. The item requirement sounds like logical (but not exactly welcome) way for <em>Pocket</em> to generate even more revenue given how easy it is to accumulate certain duplicates from every set. </p><p>In a follow-up <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880027099836411924">post to X</a>, <em>Pocket</em>’s official account stated that it was hearing people’s immediate concerns about how this is all going to work in practice, and encouraged everyone to provide more feedback once the feature is out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Like many JRPG series, it feels as if the Tales Of series has made strides in popularity in recent years. Both 2016's Tales Of Berseria and 2021's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tales-of-arise">Tales Of Arise</a> had charming worlds and flashy combat, and the latter has found a home on our picks for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-best-jrpgs-on-pc-in-2024">the best of the genre</a>.
</p>
<p>Now the series is adopting the other dominant JRPG trend of late: remakes and remasters. Tales Of Graces f Remastered, a revision of the 2009 entry in the series, is out now.

<p>Much like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-game">Final Fantasy</a>, entries in the Tales Of series tend to standalone, linked by style and high fantasy settings. You don't need to have played any other game in the series to hop into Tales Of Graces, then, which is set in the new world of Ephinea and stars new characters, including protagonist Asbel Lhant.
</p>
<p>Originally released for Wii in 2009, it got a light remaster with some quality-of-life features in a PlayStation 3 port called Tales Of Graces f in 2010. An English release then arrived two years later. 
</p>
<p>This Remastered version adds further quality-of-life enhancements, like destination markers and the ability to turn off enemy encounters when travelling the overworld. It also includes the post-script DLC originally added for the PS3 release.
</p>
<p>Should you play this rather than similar recent remakes and remasters like Star Ocean The Second Story R, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> III HD-2D, Romancing SaGa 2 or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>? Should you save your appetite for next week's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, or March's Suikoden I&amp;II HD Remaster? I'm honestly asking. Someone good at the economy help me, all of these games are a million hours long and my family is dying. I never even got round to trying the last Tales Of game, despite genre expert Nadia Oxford making it sound exciting in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-arise-review">Tales Of Arise review</a>.
</p>
<p>You'll find Tales Of Graces f Remastered over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2530980/Tales_of_Graces_f_Remastered/">on Steam</a> for £35/€40/$40.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Best CS2 Launch Options]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-launch-options/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The best Counter-Strike 2 launch options can set you up for a fun, rewarding gameplay session before you even join a server. There a number of launch options that CS2 players can utilize to improve performance, and they’re relatively easy to implement. These will instantly apply settings that will boost your game.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-apply-launch-options-to-cs2">How to Apply Launch Options to CS2</h2>



<p>Launch options can be applied to CS2 through Steam. To access launch options, right-click Counter-Strike 2 and select Properties. Under the main General tab, there will be a section called “Launch Options” with a single text box.</p>



<p>This box is where you will enter your launch options. Each option is a string of text consisting of letters, numbers, and various symbols. Each individual option consists of zero spaces, so you will use spaces between each launch option. Do not include any quotations marks when applying launch options.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-launch-options">Best CS2 Launch Options</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Here are the best Launch Options for maximizing performance and FPS in CS2. If you’re copying and pasting these directly into your settings, make sure you are only copying and pasting the bolded section, including the plus or minus sign at the start.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>+fps_max 0 </strong>– This is an essential launch option for players using high-end PCs, as it removes your maximum frames per second. For PCs that aren’t high-end, set the 0 value to 200.</li>



<li><strong>-high </strong>– This option denotes CS2 as a high priority process for your computer. This is a useful option for lower-end systems, but for all systems it will take divert processes away from other programs you have open. It can also occasionally lead to more frequent crashing.</li>



<li><strong>-softparticlesdefaultoff</strong> – This option disables the blending of particle effects with the background, reducing system stress and improving CS2 performance.</li>



<li><strong>-nojoy </strong>– This options disable joystick support, which will free up a small amount of RAM.</li>



<li><strong>+mat_disable_fancy_blending 1</strong> – This option disables “fancy blending,” making textures look less detailed but more smooth, improving performance.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you want to apply all of these launch options at once, enter this into your Launch Options menu in Properties:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>+fps_max 0 -high -softparticlesdefaultoff</strong> <strong>-nojoy</strong> <strong>+mat_disable_fancy_blending 1</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Truth be told, if you have a high-end PC, then most of these options other than removing the max FPS will only be minor improvements. They won’t be substantial enough to explain why you’ve gone negative in your last few Premier matches.</p>



<p>Are there better launch options you use when playing CS2? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hyper-light-breaker-review-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">So far this roguelike feels hyper light on content and the wrong kind of broken.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Normally, when a sequel is announced that’s a wild departure from the original, I welcome it with open arms – look no further than my inexplicable but everlasting love of Banjo-Kazooie Nuts N Bolts as evidence. But after just a day with Hyper Light Breaker – a follow-up (though not a proper sequel) to one of my all-time favorite indie games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/14/hyper-light-drifter-review"><u>Hyper Light Drifter</u></a> – I feel like Vito Corleone telling y’all to look at how they massacred my boy. I’ve only sunk six hours into this incredibly challenging co-op roguelike so far, and although there’s clearly the skeleton of a good action-RPG in here somewhere, it’s currently buried deeper than the sun can see under sloppy combat mechanics, shallow and frustrating exploration, and scant content that began to feel repetitive only two hours in. Of course, this is its early access launch, so there’s always hope an initially rough package will transform into something much better with enough time – but in terms of what’s here right now, my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The goal of a run is to hunt around a randomized map for better gear and key items before taking on three highly deadly and supremely irritating bosses hiding out on each map, then extract yourself back to base to regroup, buy some upgrades, and do it again. I’ve already bested a couple bosses, which summon minions endlessly and flop around erratically to do massive damage, but have yet to complete a map in its entirety, which I’m assuming won’t happen until I near the end of what’s currently available in early access. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat makes an absolutely terrible first impresion.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe the combat will grow on me once I get deeper in, but it makes an absolutely terrible first impression. There isn’t anything interesting about the melee hack-and-slash attacks you are given, the alternative third-person shooting option has very limited ammo, moving and dodging feel unresponsive and inconsistent, and the lock-on system constantly toggles itself off unexpectedly and gets me killed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these things are especially frustrating when Hyper Light Breaker is immediately difficult – and I mean <em>extremely </em>difficult, and that’s coming from someone with all the achievements in Sekiro – but doesn’t bother to explain its rules and often punishes you with an onslaught of enemy attacks that feel cheap. It’s also extremely funny that you start with no healing items (and are only given them at great expense and extremely sparingly) when you’d think you would need them most at the beginning when you’re learning. Instead, you basically have to throw yourself at impossible odds until you can unlock the bare minimum you need to survive.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So I’ve spent most of my time running around procedurally generated worlds that at least look quite pretty, using a unique art style that channels Hyper Light Drifter in 3D quite well. But these repetitive areas are extremely irritating to navigate, filled with awkward cliffs and crooked landscapes that feel like I’m not actually supposed to be climbing them but offer me no other choice. On the bright side, they at least give you a neat hoverboard to ride around on and do tricks, and although the controls are as sloppy as everything else, hoverboards are indeed still dope as hell and there are definitely some good times to be had there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve got a whole lot left to do and see before I’m ready to finalize my review sometime next week, and it's a little encouraging that combat is becoming a bit more bearable as I start to understand its unpolished ways and gain more than zero healing items. But so far I’m not having a good time, and that’s not what I was expecting from this long-awaited follow-up, even taking into account this is its early access launch.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-the-monster-hunter-wilds-team-select-their-beastly-lineup-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you ask people who the main characters are in Monster Hunter, they might say “the hunters” – but others will tell you: “It’s all about the monsters.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So many striking creatures have appeared over the course of Monster Hunter’s 20-plus-year history. With each new hunter and each new hunt, we form new memories around these monsters. That's why players have pored over information about the new monsters appearing in the latest title, Monster Hunter Wilds, and why they let out shouts of joy when they heard that certain monsters would be making a long-awaited return.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">IGN First Monster Hunter Wilds Oilwell Basin Artwork</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In this interview with Kaname Fujioka, who was the director of the first Monster Hunter and now Executive Director and Art Director for Wilds, and Yuya Tokuda, director of both Monster Hunter: World and Wilds, we get to hear in detail about the process that new and returning monsters went through before appearing in Wilds, with a special focus on the processes of creation and selection. Throughout the interview, I felt the deep love that these developers have for their monsters, as well as the ceaseless work they've put into giving those monsters the greatest stage possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokuda first explains the process that goes into the creation of a Monster Hunter monster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We first consider what we want players to experience when facing major monsters like Arkveld, as well as the setting, ecosystem and so on of the world, unique to each title,” he tells IGN. “We then think about the kind of monsters needed to do that. In a way, we start by putting puzzle pieces together, like, ‘If this monster exists in this place, how does the ecological pyramid work here?’”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easy to simply think that players will be happy so long as popular monsters make a reappearance, but the development team actually focuses most on the player's experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We don't focus too much on the proportion or number of new versus old monsters,” continues Tokuda. “What's important at the end of the day is the overall level design and order of monsters across the entire game, as well as the balance of ecological pyramids in each area. We take this multifaceted approach to decide which monsters to include." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">How will players play the game, and when will they encounter each monster? What will we see monsters doing in this latest title enabled by new technology? Fujioka says that this approach is extremely important, even when choosing to have older monsters make a reappearance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"So even when we're selecting old monsters to put in the game, part of that involves making sure to stay true to that monster's concept while thinking about how much room each monster has to grow when they're reborn using current-day technology and game design," he says.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Setting the stage</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the monsters that live in the Forbidden Lands (or as the developers call it, "The East") like Doshaguma, which embodies the game's herd system, there are some monsters that quickly present new ways of hunting spread across the world of Wilds. During the open beta test in November, many players encountered Chatacabra, or Rey Dau, the apex monster of the Windward Plains. As the game's entryway into its world, the Windward Plains contains monsters whose designs were carefully made to match the overall game experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Herds are one of the major concepts in Wilds, and so we created Doshaguma as a monster that lets players experience this element of the game,” says Tokuda. “We were designing Doshaguma from a pretty early stage, in part to help verify the way that packs move."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, Fujioka says, the design of Rey Dau, the boss of the Windward Plains, was finished before that of Arkveld, the marquee monster in Wilds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think part of a monster's character can be an appearance that simply makes you think that it looks cool, even among all the other unique monsters,” he says. “We call these our ‘handsome monsters’. We believe that if we're able to have one of these cool monsters appear at just the right time, they'll stand out that much more as a unique character. We thought that Rey Dau was in a good position for that even during the design stage, and so we wanted it to be a cool monster. As Rey Dau's design was finalized before Arkveld's, even some of our own staff thought that it was the game's main monster until partway through development. That's just how handsome it is." However, once Arkveld’s design was finalized the whole team was satisfied they had found their flagship monster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rey Dau is a monster that uses lightning, and it reigns over the Windward Plains as its apex monster. Tokuda explains that this background was used as a base for its attack patterns and movements.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Rey Dau's biggest attack is one where it stores lightning in its body and slides its face along the ground to unleash all of it at once,” he says. “As it grinds its wings into the sand, the lightning combines with it to create Fulgurite Ore. The amount of electricity it stores rises higher and higher when it wears these crystals, and it can store electricity faster as well. Thinking about this process is what caused it to become a monster notable for its wing-based physical attacks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka says that monster attacks are even a part of the game's stage design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we were designing this stage, we talked about incorporating the process of lightning generating Fulgurite Ore,” he says. “The terrain is formed by Fulgurite Ore created when lightning strikes the ground, and villagers use the ore to ward off monsters. We hope that players pay attention to how monster biology and attack methods are connected to how the game's humans live."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While it may sound simple for ore to be generated when lightning shot from a monster hits the sand, a number of technical hurdles awaited the team before they could make this a reality. Conditions like the timing of the lightning hitting the sand or the desert and its sloping hills had to be calculated in real-time to generate this ore, and creating that system was no simple task.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, Monster Hunter is a real-time, synchronous multiplayer game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The feeling of playing together and being able to communicate on the same wavelength with shared information is extremely important to us. Our top priority during development is how we express the experience of people playing in the same space," says Fujioka. I'm overwhelmed for a moment when I hear this. Yes, this may of course be what multiplayer game development theory states, but the hurdles presented to this team by what they're attempting to depict are far greater than players imagine.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, compromise was not an option when it came to depicting Rey Dau's actions when considering the earlier discussion about a world where monster ecology is directly tied to the lives of human characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Monster Hunter does depict a fantasy world, but we want players to feel a kind of reality from each individual thing they see in-game,” says Tokuda. “Graphics become higher-definition as hardware advances, and so we want the world's setting to be as authentic as possible, because this kind of reality is connected to the game's immersion." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These words make me feel how important the detailed creation of monsters is to Mr. Tokuda. The games depict their world through their monsters, and depict their monsters through their world. As this reciprocal relationship digs deeper and takes form, it completes the Monster Hunter experience.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Returning monsters</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Forbidden Lands act as this game's stage, so as a place unknown to hunters, the developers say that they included a higher proportion of new monsters at the start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among all of its monsters, the first familiar one that hunters encounter in the Forbidden Lands is Congalala. Its reappearance was a moment that shocked and delighted players. I had a chance to play the Scarlet Forest where it appears, and along with the story that involves the adorable Wudwuds who live in the Forest, it all made for a humorous sequence. Though a hunt is understood to be a serious task for players who've faced the harsh environments of the Forbidden Lands in the Windward Plains, this is still a moment on the lighthearted side.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Congalala was selected after an overall evaluation of the Scarlet Forest's ecosystem, comical twists and more. Still, Tokuda says that the dev team found ways in which it's a surprisingly good match even after their decision.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Congalala is a monster with straightforward action compared to the unique monsters of the Scarlet Forest that hunters will have faced so far, like Lala Barina,” he says. “It's easy to hit, and I think it ended up being perfectly placed for players to enjoy hunting as they make full use of what they've learned and the weapons they've created so far."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we have monsters appear, we're always conscious of not just trying to make them easy to understand for players new to Monster Hunter, but to also shock and delight fans of the series," Fujioka says, recalling the reaction fans had when they announced Congalala's return. "I think tossing Congalala out right there was just right for it. We announced it at Tokyo Game Show because we thought fans who know about Congalala would enjoy that. Once we did, the reaction ended up being even bigger than we imagined. We talked later about how that must have been the greatest moment of Congalala's life."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seeing these two as they say this makes me think that in a way, the Monster Hunter development team is also like a talent agency trying to sell its stars. Monster Hunter's monsters must feel as attractive and real as they do because of these creators who care about their monsters more than anything, searching for the place where they'll shine the brightest.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The sensei returns</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For longtime fans, the reappearance of Yian Kut-Ku was likely even more of a shock than Congalala's. As a sort of rite of passage that teaches players the movements and methods they need while being a bit strict at times and kind at others, Yian Kut-Ku is known to series fans as Sensei, or “teacher.” Despite being a beloved monster, though, it didn't reappear in the series for the longest time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yian Kut-Ku is a monster that many Monster Hunter lovers know, and we're aware that they call it Sensei, says Fujioka, clarifying the monster's positioning. “We designed it as a monster that teaches you the basics when facing large monsters."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's difficult to have Yian Kut-Ku act as a teacher, as that role is played in each game by different monsters that are suited for the environment of its new stages. The way that the fans love Yian Kut-Ku is important to these developers as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Yian Kut-Ku's name would always come up whenever discussing which monsters would appear in each game, it was difficult for it to make an appearance without something new that still felt right for it. Tokuda says that the herds in Wilds are part of what helped to support Sensei's reappearance. That's because Yian Kut-Ku was always related to packs of monsters, even if they couldn't be depicted in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yian Kut-Ku herds did exist in the game's setting, but we never had a chance to make that a part of the actual gameplay until now,” he says. “It seemed like a good fit for the systems of Wilds that let us include packs of monsters, and we were able to find a moment for it to appear in the perfect way during the game's progression."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What could he mean by "a perfect way"? I try asking more about Yian Kut-Ku's position in Wilds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"While Yian Kut-Ku is loved by many players right now, I think it was incredibly strong when it first appeared,” Tokuda elaborates. “It's placed at the moment in the game where the difficulty curve suddenly spikes upward, and we weren't sure that it'd be right to have it appear like that again to play the role of a teacher. That's why we thought we needed to do a deeper analysis of its strengths and what makes it feel strong. We looked at recent player trends and thought about the position they'd want Yian Kut-Ku to occupy instead of simply being a teacher, which is why we've prepared a different kind of position for it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a bit of a behind-the-scenes story about Yian Kut-Ku. Tokuda is a lover of large reptiles, and his pet lizard that's over a meter long has a major relationship to Yian Kut-Ku's design this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I made a garden that's like a miniature Ancient Forest for my lizards and even breed them there,” he says. “It's like there's vegetation inside of my home. I've made an ecosystem there, complete with water, light and wind. An artist who knew that I raise lizards told me to bring my largest lizard's shed skin, which we then scanned and processed in order to make it a part of Yian Kut-Ku's scales in the game."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monsters growing alongside fans</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yian Kut-Ku was able to make a comeback thanks to the passion players had for their Sensei and the herds system implemented in Wilds. So then, which monster's comeback is most awaited out of those that haven't made an appearance (yet) in Wilds?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That would have to be Lagiacrus," Tokuda instantly responds. "Ever since World, people ask us to bring Lagiacrus back no matter where in the world we go. It feels like we've been constantly asked since then."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka nods vigorously as he sits beside Tokuda. "There really are a lot of fans both inside and outside of Japan who love Monster Hunter Tri,” he says. “It's a very memorable title for me as well. Listening to the fans, I get the sense that monsters like Lagiacrus and Brachydios enjoy a particularly deep-rooted popularity. Gore Magala as well, as it seems like many people have a lasting love of monsters that are featured on the cover art of a title."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Tokuda says, Lagiacrus is a very memorable monster for both developers. The two were involved in its creation, with Fujioka as director during the development of Monster Hunter Tri and Tokuda as its lead planner of the monsters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm one of the creators of Lagiacrus myself, so I naturally have a deep attachment to it,” says Tokuda. “I might even say that I want to put it in the game more than anyone. There are a lot of difficulties, such as the fact that we haven't had aquatic battles or action ever since Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, of course… But we've heard everyone's voices loud and clear, and I want fans to know that I want it to make an appearance just as much as anyone."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hearing Tokuda talk, I get a sense of the deep affection and attachment to specific monsters that goes beyond the categories of developer or player, held instead by people who love Monster Hunter. The monsters lovingly created by the developers are loved by players, with those feelings then reaching the developers. Perhaps this is how monsters in Monster Hunter change and grow.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"When looking at Monster Hunter as a series, I've always felt a kind of strong passion that's created through communication,” says Fujioka. “The biggest characters that appear in Monster Hunter are its monsters, at the end of the day. It's about how fans see those monsters, and that understanding is what creates the next step for Monster Hunter. That's why I think that carefully fostering the feeling of monsters as characters is key to Monster Hunter." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I ask about one more thing that's been on my mind: Rathalos, a monster that could be called a series mainstay. Rathalos' appearance in Wilds has already been revealed in a trailer, but how will it appear to us this time around? I ask, but Fujioka steadfastly keeps everything from the way it makes an appearance to its environment a secret. But what he does give me is a small glimpse at his feelings towards it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Rath is the poster monster for the series, so we're still keeping that a secret for now,” he says. “I feel like Rath is the kind of monster that makes both the creators and the players think, 'Yep, this is Monster Hunter' when it appears. That's why we always give a lot of thought about how it'll show up impactfully whenever we develop a new title.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"During World, there were a lot of people around the globe who still didn't know about Monster Hunter, and so we depicted Rath as the apex monster of the Ancient Forest's ecosphere, the game's first stage. But now that there are so many people who know about it through World, we've thought about how to place it in a position that they'd find interesting." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Depicting monsters means depicting the world of Monster Hunter. Contemplating the role of a monster means creating the experience hunters will have. Monsters are present at every point of the gameplay loop, and their creators truly care about them. It won't be long until we get to meet new ones and be reunited with old favorites in Wilds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of old favorites, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-the-monster-hunter-wilds-team-select-their-beastly-lineup-ign-first">Gravios has been revealed as a returning monster in Monster Hunter Wilds.</a> Check out our exclusive Gravios reveal, which includes details straight from the devs and brand-new gameplay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds comes to PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on February 28.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-shortage-brings-supply-worries<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pokemon fans will have trouble getting the latest <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pokemon TCG</a> set. Local game stores have reported unusually high demand, leading to a shortage of <em>Pokemon TCG Prismatic Evolutions</em> by distributors. It has gotten so dire that The Pokemon Company has directly addressed the shortage.</p>



<p>Pokebeach <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow">first reported</a> on the <em>Pokemon TCG Prismatic Evolutions</em> shortage. On January 4th, local stores were forced to limit or even cancel customer preorders of the upcoming set. According to a poll, each US store received on average 10-15% less of what they requested to buy from distributors.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-binder-collection-screenshot.jpg?itok=ny6dKo06 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-binder-collection-screenshot.jpg?itok=0XN307q1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Providing context to these findings was a quote from Ben DeGuire, owner of Player 1 Services, one of the largest Pokemon stores in the US. He stated the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I think a large part of the issue is that stores who do not normally order Pokemon are requesting to buy this set from distributors. Think small book stores, tabletop game stores, and other TCG-adjacent stores.” DeGuire frequently speaks to Pokemon’s distributors.</p>

<p>“This means there is nowhere near enough product to go around. Distributors are still giving loyal Pokemon stores a higher percentage of the supply, such as my store. But the actual amount of product a store receives is diluted because so many other stores want the product. Strategically, distributors want to give the product to as many stores as possible to retain as many accounts as possible.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, because of so many stores placing orders, The Pokemon Company didn't have enough supply to go around, leading to fewer boxes across the board.</p>

<p>This is curious since the <em>Pokemon TCG Prismatic Evolutions</em> shortage is an anomaly. Usually, The Pokemon Company provides plenty of supply to retailers, especially during the holidays. So what exactly is making this set so in demand?</p>

It is beloved, consistently within the top 10 lists of most popular Pokemon, thanks to its varied evolved forms and adorable design. The Pokemon Company itself even dubbed 2025 <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/2025-is-the-year-of-eevee-at-the-pokemon-center" rel="nofollow">The Year of Eevee</a>.</p>

<p>The Pokemon Company released an official statement addressing the <em>Pokemon TCG Prismatic Evolutions</em> shortage. In a <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCG/status/1879574273544622582" rel="nofollow">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter), the company stated that they are actively printing more products for the impacted stores across the US. They also confirmed that they will be printing more future Prismatic Evolutions product in the coming months.</p>

If they were shooting a scene at the home of Mark’s sister and her husband for the first episode, they would also shoot Mark’s cliffhanger moment when he yells “She’s alive!” around the same time. That piecemeal style of filming wasn’t the only quirky directing choice made by Stiller, who reveals on the podcast that he originally was going to shoot the entire finale from the Innies’ perspective on the outside.</p><p>“I always imagined it was going to be totally different, visually, than the rest of the show because everything is very set and ordered; not a lot of handheld [cameras], if any. But, for episode nine, we were like, ‘We’re going to use Steadicam the whole time, and it’s going to be flowing because we want to be in the point of view of these characters.”</p><p>That would mean instead of watching Innie Mark (Adam Scott) try to visibly squirm his way out of talking with a Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette) who’s suspicious of whether she’s actually talking to Outie Mark, we would have been staring directly into Arquette’s judgemental eyes as Mark stammered along. As enjoyably immersive as that would’ve been, it would’ve taken away from scenes like Mark’s punctuating ”She’s alive!” moment, which carries an extra emotional weight thanks to Mark’s shocked look. This is a fact Stiller thankfully realized. </p><p>“It can’t be in their point of view the whole time because then we’ll never see them.”</p><p>The second season of <em>The Severance Podcast with Ben Stiller and Adam Scott </em>debuts tomorrow, right after the Season 2 premiere is released. They’ll be breaking down all the nuances of the second season so we can better make sense of the mindfuck we’ll be embarking on for the next 10 weeks.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a> Past Is Prologue event, which precedes the arrival of Episode: Heresy, kicks off next week. The event, announced in today's <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-01-16-25" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Week in Destiny</a>, will be centered around Eris and the Drifter. Developer Bungie says that those who played Riven's Wishes last year will find a familiar flow once more, starting on January 21.</p><p>Starting at the Tuesday reset, you can visit the Drifter to grab quests that will reward you with the Bento Tokens currency. You can then exchange them for rewards over at Eris. You'll be able to earn a total of eight Bento Tokens throughout the event.</p><p>The event offers a promising incentive via its rewards, providing alternative means of getting a number of gear and currency items normally locked to certain activities. You can get your hands on Spoils of Conquest, which are only obtained when completing raid encounters, Adept weapons outside of high difficult nightfalls and raids, and Artifice armor without the need to tackle Master dungeons. In addition, the Chatterwhite shader is returning for Past Is Prologue. Once you've gotten five Bento Tokens, you'll unlock the shader for your collection.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4429047-destiny2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4429047" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4429047-destiny2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4429047"></a><figcaption>Destiny 2's Past Is Prologue rewards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4429047-destiny2.jpg"></figure><p>The Past Is Prologue event will be available for two weeks, from January 21 to February 4, so plan accordingly.

		<p>Having lived through endless years of terrible movie versions of video games it is rather nice to sit here and write nice things about such a thing, and that thing today is the movie version of Sony’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/until-dawn/">Until Dawn</a> game.</p>
<p>The trailer confirms what we learned from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/14/the-until-dawn-movie-teaser-explains-how-the-branching-narrative-will-be-used/">teaser,</a> in that the group of teens are trapped in a house with time resetting after they are killed, a novel way of allowing the film to explore the branching narrative found in the game. From then on we get hints of some of the grisly deaths that will occur, many of which seem to be taken from the game. We also get to see the Wendigo and Clown killer, also from the game, along with some new evil creatures including a witch and giant.</p>
<p><iframe title="Until Dawn Movie - Full Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vQ5iD8ZVWOQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That looks like the perfect Friday night popcorn movie</p>
<p>Peter Stromare who is playing a character called ‘Hill’ in the game, but here he seems to be working at a gas station rather than playing he role of Dr. Alan J. Hill, “The Analyst”, the psychiatrist who popped up between chapters of the game to give you tests and offer advice. The film will also star Michael Cimino, Ella Rubin, Ji-young Yoo, Belmont Cameli, Odessa A’zion, and Maia Mitchell.</p>

<p>This year will also see the release of the odd looking Minecraft movie in April, a sequel to 2021’s Mortal Kombat film in October, and another sequel, Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 in December.</p>
<p>Return to Silent Hill finished shooting in February 2024 but does not have a release date yet,&nbsp; that really should show up this year unless the studio are messing about with it. The Watch Dogs movie also finished filming in the middle of last year so that may show up as well, it currently has no release date.</p>

If you see any website, social media account, or app claiming you can pre-order the Switch 2, it’s a scam, and I’d stay far away from any of those links. Now, for some good news: We probably know when Switch 2 pre-orders will go live. </p><h2 id="h185966"><a id=""></a>When Switch 2 pre-orders will (likely) go live</h2><p>At the end of the new Switch 2 trailer, the company confirmed it would have a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-gallery-differences-comparison-joycon-1851740928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-gallery-differences-comparison-joycon-1851740928">Nintendo Switch 2</a></span>-focused Direct later this year. Specifically, the Nintendo Direct will arrive on April 2. And this is likely the date when pre-orders will go live in most territories. </p><p>It makes sense that Nintendo would wait to start taking pre-orders until it has shown more games and revealed more info on the upcoming console’s price and launch date. So I’d expect the Direct in April to end with an “And pre-orders go live later today!” announcement, or at the very least a confirmation of when to expect them to go live. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Wario64/status/1879890176786239826&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1879890176786239826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">At the moment, as spotted by Wario64</a></span>, Best Buy is letting people sign up to be notified when pre-orders are live on the retailer’s site. I’m not sure you need to do that. Every website and social media account dedicated to games will post about Switch 2 pre-orders the moment they are available. But if you want to be super-duper sure you have a chance to pre-order Nintendo’s next home console, signing up for a Best Buy email notification won’t hurt.</p><h2 id="h185967"><a id=""></a>When will the Switch 2 launch? </h2><p>Officially, the only thing Nintendo has confirmed about the Switch 2 launch is that it will be in 2025. However, the company also announced at the end of the Switch 2 trailer that it will be holding <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-experience-early-play-la-nyc-dallas-1851740842&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-experience-early-play-la-nyc-dallas-1851740842">hands-on experiences</a></span> around the globe ahead of the console’s launch. And we can look at those dates to help us pinpoint a possible timeframe for launch. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-switch-2-experience/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-switch-2-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Nintendo’s website</a></span>, New York City will be the first place in the world where you’ll be able to go hands-on with a Switch 2. That starts in April. Then there are a bunch of other cities around the world that will also get a chance to check out the device.</p><p> Currently, Nintendo has a demo event in Seoul, South Korea planned for May 31-June 1. That’s the farthest-out date confirmed. One would assume that Nintendo isn’t going to be doing hands-on demo events after the console’s release, so we can probably assume the earliest possible launch month for the Switch 2 is June. My bet is for July or even August. That gives Nintendo time to squeeze in a few more events if it wants, and gives the company enough time to market the hell out of the Switch 2 between now and then. </p><p>We’ll update this post as we learn more about the price, release date, and pre-order times for Switch 2. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-activision-deny-report-regarding-financial-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On Wednesday, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-purchase-hasnt-helped-xbox-game-pass-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report from The Information</a> claimed that Microsoft’s purchase of Activision Blizzard hasn’t resulted in the growth that the company expected with its Xbox business at this point. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-gaming-business-falls-short-despite-activision" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report quotes (paywalled)</a> one analyst—portfolio manager Danny Fish—as saying “Activision has been disappointing” for the company’s overall revenue. After reaching out to Activision and Microsoft for comment, representatives from both companies not only said The Information’s report wasn’t accurate and “through omission is misrepresenting the business”, but provided context to show how the company has performed since the purchase along with the state of Microsoft gaming.</p>



<p>In its last four earnings reports, Microsoft has reported revenue increases regularly for Xbox content and services. Going back to Q2 FY2024, Xbox content and services revenue increased by 61% “driven by 55 points of the net impact from the Activision acquisition.” For the next quarter, revenue was reported to have increased by 62% with 61 points attributed to Activision. For Q4 2024, it was up another 61% with 58 points of net impact from the purchase. Lastly, Q1 of FY2025 saw the revenue increase by 61% with 53 points coming from Activision. </p>



<p>Breaking the numbers down, Activision has accounted for over 85% of each quarter’s revenue increase. It also shows, over the last three quarters, a slight steady growth outside of Activision’s impact from a low of one point to eight points as of Q1 FY2025.</p>



<p>What’s more, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella alluded to the purchase’s benefit during the company’s Q1 FY2025 earnings call last October about the acquisition and gaming’s growth.</p>



<p>“We set new records for monthly active users in the quarter, as more players than ever play our games across devices and on the Xbox platform,” he said while saying that the business is “positioned for long-term growth”. </p>



<p>Regarding Xbox Game Pass, Nadella said that the service set a record for the number of new Game Pass subscriptions on Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s launch day. He added that the service “set a new Q1 record for total revenue and average revenue per subscriber.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moving on to the suggestion from the report that, in 2021, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the company could “wind down its games business entirely”, the company flat out denies that. They point to comments made around that time with Nadella expressing that Microsoft is “all in on gaming”. </p>



<p>They closed by saying that engagement on Xbox platforms is “at an all-time high”. Microsoft says that they “are well over&nbsp;500 million monthly players&nbsp;and over the last year, we’ve seen consistent growth in monthly users on cloud”.</p>



<p>Regarding the report’s claims on Azure servers and the Activision deal not being a catalyst to get other studios to release their games on Game Pass, Insider Gaming was told that The Information’s report “conflates an opinion that developers are scared of profit loss with the fact that the business is already set up to pay developers up front if that’s their choice for how they want to structure deal”. </p>



<p>Microsoft is scheduled to announce its Q2 earnings for FY2025 on January 29.</p>

            <p>
With this year's Awesome Games Done Quick (and its impressive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-years-agdq-included-someone-speedrunning-elden-ring-bosses-with-a-saxophone">Elden Ring sax attacks</a>) officially over, preparations are well underway for Games Done Quick's Frost Fatales charity speedrunning event - and organisers have now revealed its full schedule in the run up to March.
</p>
<p>
Frost Fatales, if you're unfamiliar, is the annual winter version of Games Done Quick's all-women and femmes charity speedrunning event (Flame Fatales is its toastier summer equivalent), and this year's week-long show runs from 9th-16th March.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, things kick off at 5pm BST on Sunday 9th March with a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cuphead">Cuphead</a> Any% No Major Glitches speedrun by Vicky_spleen. Seven days and more than 60 speedruns later, things wrap up with a one-handed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/celeste">Celeste</a> Any% speedrun by SawaYoshi - at 3.23am on 16th March. And between all that, there's a tantalisingly varied selection of other games to look forward to, ranging from big ol' blockbusters and retro classics to indie favourites and leftfield oddities.
</p>
<p>
A quick scan of the <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/55">newly released schedule</a> reveals, for instance, the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cult-of-the-lamb">Cult of the Lamb</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ducktales-remastered">DuckTales: Remastered</a>, RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, Clock Tower 3, Super Mario Maker for Nintendo 3DS, Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team, Hylics, and more - as well as a three-way "girl squad" Final Fantasy X-2 race using all female characters.
</p><p>
Frost Fatales 2025 is once raising money for the National Women's Law Center, a US non-profit that fights for women's and LGBTQ rights through initiatives that change laws, policy, and culture. And if all that's left you suitably intrigued, you can <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick">watch the event live on Twitch</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[What Games Journalism Can Do Now]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-trump</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-games-journalism-can-do-now.1084578/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-trump<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This feels like the last week when folks in the US can say “things aren’t looking good” before Monday’s inauguration happens and we start to see how grim things are actually going to be. I’m sure I’m not alone in wondering how to meet the moment, which is a polite way of wondering what the hell I’m going to do not just personally and politically, but professionally.</p><p>Journalism broadly has already begun to <a href="https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/its-not-looking-great" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crumble</a> under the onslaught: load-bearing outlets like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/business/media/the-washington-post-new-mission.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> and the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/24/g-s1-29665/la-times-editor-resigns-presidential-endorsement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a> <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/11/the-washington-post-isnt-alone-roughly-3-4-of-major-american-newspapers-arent-endorsing-anyone-for-president-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bending the knee</a> in advance, the potential chilling effects of <a href="https://defector.com/abcs-trump-settlement-is-a-bad-omen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC’s settlement</a>, Trump and his ilk’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/media/trump-threatens-retribution-against-press/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threats against the press</a>. As tech billionaires–people who exercise some sway over how the journalism we’ll still be able to do gets out into the world–line up to <a href="https://aftermath.site/zuckerberg-meta-policy-changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kiss the ring</a> or declare themselves “<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1879426713035436199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the media</a>,” we can assume it’s just going to get harder for journalism to survive and for journalists to publish the truth.</p><p>I’ve been thinking a lot about what it’s going to mean to be a games journalist after Monday. Journalists can be a bit self-important, not entirely undeservedly, and while I’m proud to tell people what I do for work, when they ask for details, I’ll often say I cover tech. This is true, but it’s also a way to avoid trying to explain what games journalism is or of having to defend why it matters. The beat can often feel frivolous or unnecessary; I think we’ve all had days when the work we do feels out of step with the world around us. If the years of <a href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-gamesindustrybiz-humble-buyouts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">job cuts</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-closed-layoffs-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closures</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outsourcing</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memory-holing</a>, and <a href="https://aftermath.site/vice-waypoint-site-news-reopen-open" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">degrading reinventions</a> are any indication, the people who fund games journalism or own games outlets generally feel the same way. <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-gamurs-group-games-journalism-escapist-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Media</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">owners</a> are happy to grind games journalism up for parts and clicks, and there’s a vocal portion of our audience, fed on a diet of <a href="https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conspiracy theories</a> and insecurity, who’ll cheer them on.&nbsp;</p><p>But if you’re working in this field, or reading this website, you know games journalism is worth more than that. A games journalist’s greatest strength–the one I’ve highlighted desperately to every higher-up who’s come to slash my site’s budget or cut my people’s jobs–is how versatile we are, how much “writing about video games” is actually writing about everything else. A games journalist is an art critic, a business and labor reporter, a service writer, a tech expert, a culture analyst. We regularly have to work outside our niches or comfort zones, pushed to where different topics overlap and making sense of that messy space. As the people coming to power try to tell a falsely simplistic story about the world, games journalists know how to paint the full picture for readers, to show them where topics and issues intersect and explain why those intersections matter.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of the reason we know how to do that is because we’ve been here before. Games most commonly get dragged into politics as a scapegoat whenever <a href="https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">violence</a> occurs, but we know that the soon-to-be ruling party took its <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/1/20/20808875/gamergate-lessons-cultural-impact-changes-harassment-laws" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playbook</a> from our beat. We’re intimately familiar with its tactics and how they’re deployed to <a href="https://deadspin.com/the-future-of-the-culture-wars-is-here-and-its-gamerga-1646145844/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">silence journalists</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-adin-ross-donald-trump-kick-stream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">woo</a> the young and disaffected<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/12/nx-s1-5181804/young-men-helped-trump-retake-the-white-house-a-trend-years-in-the-making" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> some claim swung the last election</a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/sweet-baby-inc-consulting-games-alan-wake-2-dei-1851312428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spread misinformation</a> that primes people for more. We’ve learned–and are still learning–how to stand up to those tactics, and our audiences know how to see through them too. We have skills to share with other journalists, and we have examples to point to of how the communities we cover foster <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dominictarason.com/post/3lfivnbpddr2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">positive environments</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/geeks-and-nerds-for-harris" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use their passions</a> for good in the face of opposition. And apart from us, people in gaming and online cultures have made their own <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-youtube-tiktok-politics-election-hasan-piker-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">information ecosystems</a> to educate and <a href="https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-caroline-kwan-california-firefighters-twitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">empower</a> each other, to identify and counter the hatred and lies that are only going to get louder.</p><p>That was all part of the first Trump administration too, but as <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/elon-musk-jeff-bezos-mark-zuckerberg-attend-trump-inauguration-rcna187642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tech moguls take their seats</a> alongside Trump this time around, games journalists and our audiences are uniquely situated to point out how technology and money collide to shape culture. <a href="https://aftermath.site/as-video-game-industry-goes-all-in-on-ai-workers-race-to-secure-their-rights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI</a>, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22959860/metaverse-explained-video-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">metaverse</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23521430/nft-video-games-crypto-failed-decentraland-axie-infinity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NFTs</a> have and are playing out in real time on our beat. Games journalists are–or should be–particularly good at seeing through the latest bullshit, at resisting the hype and buzzwords we’re all being bludgeoned with. We know how people are <a href="https://aftermath.site/category/hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">really using technology</a>, and we know what happens when <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-shutdown-offline-refund-ps5-pc-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">money motivates art</a> and the effect it has on both audiences and <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workers</a>. The best games and tech journalism focuses on the real human experiences at the heart of technology and art, all the stuff <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-california-conde-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI grifters</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/kaos-cancelled-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">media</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/coyote-vs-acme-fuck-david-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">execs</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/facebook-instagram-meta-changes-dei-fact-checkers-dana-white-rcna187370" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platform owners</a> want to bury under their own self-serving visions. However infinitely more embarrassing and harmful these people are going to get once they have even more power, we and our audiences are prepared for them.&nbsp;</p><p>In our own careers, we’ve been at the forefront of the degradation of the internet and of journalism widely. Games sites and verticals have been early to the chopping block in the face of <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-gamer-network-eurogamer-gamesindustrybiz-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consolidation</a> and economic changes. We know how tweaks to search and social media algorithms can affect the work our <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-stupid-do-they-think-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">owners</a> ask us to do, lessons more and more outlets are starting to learn. We’ve lived through–and continue to live through–the conflicts that can exist between traditional journalists and the “<a href="https://aftermath.site/star-reporter-talent-pr-washington-post" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personalities</a>” or influencers more and more people turn to for information. And while none of that’s been pretty, and none of us are out of the woods, it’s also taught us how to do good work regardless of circumstances, whether that’s at established outlets or outside of them. We’ve had a scene of <a href="https://www.critical-distance.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">independent outlets</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PeopleMakeGames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">non-traditional formats</a> long before the wave of worker-owned sites that spawned Aftermath and our peers. Our audiences know how to find us, and they’re willing to support us.&nbsp;</p><p>And if this is all starting to sound overly serious, even if you look at games journalism as little more than covering what basically amounts to expensive toys, that’s a beat full of writers telling stories about all the different ways that people find joy, and an audience full of readers who want to hear about it. We’re going to need those experiences in our lives in the years ahead, and we’re going to need those stories and examples.</p><p>I’ve been wrangling with how grandiose this all reads, and I won’t lie that I wrote it at least in part to have something to pep up a future version of me who’s pinned to his couch in despair. But maybe it can help you too: Journalists outside of games are going to need the skills we’ve honed in the coming environment. Our readers are going to need all the skills they have to navigate an even louder, more confusing world of misinformation, one with higher stakes than just whether or not you should buy a video game. On so many days, games journalism can feel over, but next week, I think we’re going to need it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/but-i-like-to-slide-the-joy-con"><h3>But I Like To Slide The Joy-Con</h3></a><p>The most fun part of the Switch</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/luke-plunkett-aftermath-game-of-the-year-2024"><h3>Luke’s Favourite Video Games Of 2024</h3></a><p>From archaeologists to Barnsworth, it was a good year</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-rumors-reveal"><h3>You Can’t Rush Christmas</h3></a><p>A thing is announced when it's announced</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo didn’t reveal a title, but fans are already calling the kart racer <em>Mario Kart 9</em> and scanning every frame of footage we got from the announcement trailer. We’ve gathered a few of those observations fans have made about elements that stick out in the brief glimpse we’ve gotten of the new game. Here are some of the details you might’ve missed in the new <em>Mario Kart </em>trailer.</p></div></div><div><p>We didn’t get a great look at all the characters, as much of the trailer focuses on the fireball-slinging plumber himself, but what we can see makes it look like some of Mario’s friends have gotten a makeover. Donkey Kong is the most immediate example, as he now looks closer to his <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie </em>incarnation than to his <em>Mario Kart 8 </em>model. Meanwhile, everyone seems a little bit more squished, like they appear in <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>.</p></div><div><p>There’s a shot in the trailer of what looks like 24 total starting points on a race track. This implies the next <em>Mario Kart </em>may include races of up to 24 players at a time. This is double the 12-player races of <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, and probably accounts for some of the larger tracks players have noticed. However, some also speculate the game might have some kind of open-world exploration element similar to games like <em>Crash Team Racing</em>.</p></div><div><p>Rosalina is returning as a playable character this time around, and her kart looks a little bit different than everyone else’s. Fans pointed out her ride looks like a snowmobile rather than the wheel-sporting vehicles of most other characters. This isn’t a first for the series, but many fans probably haven’t played the mobile game <em>Mario Kart Tour</em> where they were introduced.</p></div><div><p>At one point in the trailer you can see a burger stand that is seemingly run by Yoshi? Or is Yoshi the meat? I’m suddenly left with more questions than answers about this establishment. But fans realized the burger joint is actually shaped like Yoshi. Its windows are his eyes and the top bun covering the entrance is his snout. It’s cute!</p></div><div><p>Yoshi has a burger stand of some kind, but in keeping with a long series tradition, there’s also branding seen in the trailer that references other characters and entities. There’s a brief shot where you can see the logo for Morton’s Construction, a reference to one of the Koopalings, and you can see logos for sponsors on the tracks like Luigi Tires, Mario Motors, Mario Kart TV, and 1-Up Fuel. </p><hr><p>Those are just a few of the details folks are pointing out, and there will no doubt be more discoveries as <em>Mario </em>sickos comb through the trailer. Beyond that, we’ll more than likely hear more about the next <em>Mario Kart </em>in April when Nintendo holds its Switch 2 Direct <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848">on April 2</a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-9-burning-questions-about-the-new-console.1084554/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-burning-questions-price-release-size-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After months of being easily the worst-kept secret in the gaming industry, the Nintendo Switch 2 has finally been revealed. We’ve now gotten <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name">our first official look at the new console</a> via a trailer from Nintendo, one that confirms many of the leaks that had surfaced about the successor to the original Nintendo Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this new footage proved to be tantalizingly brief, and there’s a lot we still don’t know about the Nintendo Switch 2. When is the exact release date? How much will it cost? Why isn’t it backwards-compatible with every original Switch game? Let’s break down the biggest questions surrounding the new console as we wait for the next Nintendo Direct in April 2025. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 - First Look</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">What's the Nintendo Switch 2 Release Date?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s been plenty of speculation about when in 2025 Nintendo plans on releasing the Switch 2. The trailer gives us no new insight on that subject, only confirming what we already knew - the system will hit stores at some point this year. So when in 2025 is the Switch 2 actually dropping?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Switch launched on March 3, 2017, after first being revealed in October 2016. Will Nintendo follow a similar timetable this time around? If so, that would <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-likely-not-before-june"><u>put the release of the Switch 2 around May or June 2025</u></a>, which is in line with recent rumors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At this point, all we know for sure is that the system won’t release before April 2025. Nintendo has scheduled a new Direct livestream on April 2, where we’ll get more details about the console and see footage of the Switch 2’s launch games. We also know that Nintendo will be running a series of hands-on fan preview events from April until early June. It would make sense to release the console once those events have concluded. But again, we probably won’t get a firm release date until the Direct in April.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is the Price of the Switch 2?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The price tag might be the biggest mystery surrounding the Nintendo Switch 2 at the moment. How much will the new console cost? Will it be in line with the original Switch, or should gamers brace themselves for a price hike?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Switch launched in 2017 at $300. Currently, the Switch OLED is priced at $350. With the Switch 2 being, by all appearances, an upgraded version of the Switch with superior hardware, it stands to reason that Nintendo will increase the price by $50 or $100. Indeed current rumors suggest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-predicted-to-arrive-in-2024-at-less-than-400"><u>the Switch 2 will launch at $400</u></a>, putting it in line with the baseline OLED Steam Deck. IGN spoke with a number of industry analysts who largely agree that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-cost-analysts-weigh-in"><u>$400 is the sweet spot for the new console</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It may ultimately depend on how advanced the hardware is in the new console. Rumors suggest the Switch 2 is roughly on par with the Xbox One X. In other words, a major upgrade over its predecessor, but not necessarily on the cutting edge of portable tech. The horsepower of the Switch 2 and questions like whether the system still uses an OLED screen (more on that later), will determine just how much more expensive the Switch 2 is compared to the original.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What New Games Will the Switch 2 Launch With?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A new console is only as good as its library of launch games. Part of the reason the original Switch was such a hit out of the gate is that it launched with a pretty killer lineup. It’s not often that a new Nintendo console launches with a brand-new, open-world Legend of Zelda game. Couple that with the hugely popular Mario Kart 8 and the release of Super Mario Odyssey later that same year, and it’s clear the Switch came out with guns blazing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will the Switch 2 have a similarly impressive arsenal? At this point, we can only really speculate. The trailer only teases one new game for the Switch 2, offering <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-new-mario-kart-game-is-seemingly-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2"><u>footage of what we assume is Mario Kart 9</u></a>. If Nintendo has a new Zelda or Mario game planned for launch, they’re keeping that under wraps until April.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We do have a fairly comprehensive list of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/predicting-the-switch-2-launch-games"><u>all the games rumored to launch with the Nintendo Switch 2</u></a>. We’re expecting an upswell of third party support this time around, now that there won’t be such a wide gulf in technical power between Nintendo’s console and the Playstation 5 and Xbox.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is the Switch 2’s Exact Size?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest takeaways from the Switch 2 trailer is that the new console isn’t just more powerful than its predecessor, but bigger, too. Both the console itself and the Joy-Cons are physically taller (though their width appears unchanged) and the screen is larger and takes up more of the front of the unit. All signs point to this being a more substantial piece of hardware than the original Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But just how big is the Switch 2? Based on the trailer, we’d estimate the Switch 2 is around 15% larger than the original. Is that accurate? How much of a difference does that make to the overall experience? Will the new Switch be as comfortable to hold and manipulate? Again, we’ll have to wait until April for more concrete details.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Type of Screen Does It Have?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Switch only went through one major hardware refresh during its long life cycle, but it was a big upgrade. The Switch OLED is a clear improvement over the original model. The OLED screen is brighter and more vibrant, and the OLED tech also allows for improved battery life (a big win on a portable system like this). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, Nintendo fans have been wondering whether the Switch 2 will follow that example and once again make use of an OLED display. We’d certainly like to see an OLED panel again, but it’s very possible Nintendo will downgrade to an LED or even LCD panel in order to keep costs down. The trailer gives us no indication of what tech the Switch 2 is using, so this is another area where we’ll have to wait until the next Nintendo Direct to find out more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Which Games Aren’t Backwards Compatible?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo eased fears by confirming that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-officially-almost-fully-backward-compatible"><u>the Switch 2 will be backwards-compatible with most original Switch games</u></a>. These OG Switch games, whether physical cartridges or digital downloads, will work on the new system. That makes it that much easier to commit to the new console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, the trailer does include a disclaimer that not all Switch games will be compatible with the new console. Which games won’t work on the new system? Are we talking about Switch games that require the original Joy-Con controller, like Ring Fit Adventure or Nintendo LABO? Or are there other hardware limitations we don’t know about that will prevent certain games from coming forward to the new system?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Will Original Switch Games Be Enhanced?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s good to know that most original Switch games will work on the new console. Still, that leaves the question of how exactly Switch games will perform on the Switch 2. Will the experience be identical, or will Nintendo make use of the upgraded hardware to boost framerates and otherwise improve the graphics?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given how much graphically intensive games like Tears of the Kingdom are crying out for more horsepower, we have to assume Nintendo has some sort of plan for offering improved versions of original Switch games. But will it be as simple as loading up an old Switch cart on the Switch 2, or will gamers have to pay for an upgraded, remastered version? And if it’s the latter, will that take the form of a paid download, or will they have to buy a completely new version of the game? Basically, what investment are we looking at if we want to play a Tears of the Kingdom remaster? </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What New Functions Does the Joy-Con Have?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Rumors suggested the new Joy-Con controllers would be getting a few upgrades on the Switch 2. Those rumors were borne out by the trailer, which confirms that the new Joy-Con has an extra button and will attach to the console magnetically rather than via rails. The trailer even seems to confirm the rumor that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-mouse-theory-is-looking-pretty-good-right-about-now"><u>the Joy-Con can be manipulated like a computer mouse</u></a>, opening up new gameplay opportunities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How exactly will the Switch 2 take advantage of these new features? Will the mouse-style functionality open up new doors for first-person shooters or strategy games on the Switch 2? And what exactly does the new button do?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, we expect the new Joy-Con will be a major focus at the Direct event in April, where we’ll see new games that show off the opportunities provided by these added features.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Kart 9 - First Look</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Will Joy-Con Drift Be Fixed?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gaming on the original Switch wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows. Many owners faced the dreaded problem of Joy-Con drift, where joysticks would begin to register movement on their own. While to their credit, Nintendo was aggressive about offering repair and replacement solutions, it was still a frustrating problem that persisted throughout the Switch life cycle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We can only hope drift is an issue Nintendo has solved this time around. Are the new Joy-Cons drift-proof? Will the combination of new joystick sensors and the magnetic attachments ensure that this problem is a thing of the past? We hope so, but we’ll see whether Nintendo addresses the subject at the Direct event in April. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on the Nintendo Switch 2, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/30-details-from-the-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-trailer">30 details we found in the reveal trailer</a>, and see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-nintendo-in-2025">what to expect from Nintendo in 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

Movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-9-every-character-track-and-vehicle-confirmed-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-game">The trailer revealed more than a dozen characters</a> and, while most looked exactly as fans would expect, Donkey Kong stood out as appearing quite different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The character has had the same design for years now, even decades, and has appeared as such in the likes of Mario Kart 8, Mario Tennis, Donkey Kong Country Returns, and more. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-super-mario-bros-movie-had-the-biggest-global-opening-weekend-ever-for-an-animated-film">The incredibly successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a> shook up his design, however, and Nintendo now appears to be incorporating this into its games.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/16/dk-1737051656618.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Donkey Kong in Mario Kart 8, the animated film, and Mario Kart 9 (Image Credit: Nintendo)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Only a very brief look at Mario Kart 9 was shared, and Donkey Kong only appeared in a few scenes himself, and not particularly clearly, so it will be a while before the designs can be compared side by side, but it is already notably different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-announced-for-april">This extra look will likely come in April during the Nintendo Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</a>. In anticipation of this event, the console reveal trailer included just a few hints of the Nintendo Switch 2, focusing mostly on how it looks. It did confirm <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-officially-almost-fully-backward-compatible">the hardware is mostly backwards compatible</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-still-dont-know-what-the-nintendo-switch-2s-mysterious-new-joy-con-button-does">Joy-Cons feature a mysterious new button</a>, and that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-mouse-theory-is-looking-pretty-good-right-about-now">a theory about using the controller as a mouse</a> appears spot on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it was only revealed with a 2025 window, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-likely-not-before-june">the Nintendo Switch 2 probably won't arrive until June at the earliest</a>. That's because myriad hands on events are taking place worldwide, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-event-registration-begins-very-soon">registration for them opening very soon</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
