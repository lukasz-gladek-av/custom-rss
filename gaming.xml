			<p>Japanese developer<strong> Game Freak</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-this-nier-beast-of-reincarnation-gameplay-and-soundtrack-immediately-bring-yoko-taros-series-to-mind/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared the first proper look at their new franchise</a>, <strong>Beast of Reincarnation</strong>, during the recent <strong>Xbox Developer Direct Show 2026</strong>. Following that appearance, several gamers noted the <strong>apparent similarities with the Soulslike genre</strong>. However, <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202601/63919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Famitsu</a>, Game Director <strong>Kota Furushima</strong> revealed <strong>several key differences</strong>, such as the design goal of making the game completable even for those who are not action game experts, and the ability for players to lower the difficulty. This is <strong>famously absent in most Soulslike games</strong>.</p>



<p><em>We're trying to make it so that even people who aren't good at action games can enjoy it. You can also choose the difficulty level, so if you're unsure, I think it's best to lower the difficulty level. Personally, I'd be happy if people could enjoy the game by taking an approach that actually lowers the difficulty level, by devising the skill tree system and Koo's support.</em></p>



<p>That's not to say there won't be times when you will be challenged in Beast of Reincarnation. Again, though, Furushima stressed that <strong>they're not trying to make a game where you're forced to fight a boss hundreds of times</strong>, which is practically a key component of a Soulslike game.</p>



<p><em>I think there will be times when you get defeated, and I want players to enjoy trial and error, trying different fighting styles next time, or changing Kuu's skills. However, I don't intend for players to never be able to clear the game on their first try, or to have to retry dozens or hundreds of times, so I hope that players will pick it up without being too scared.</em></p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Game Director confirmed that the protagonists, <strong>Emma the Sealer and Koo, each have three skill trees</strong>, enabling a variety of playstyles. For example, as well as close-range combat, you can attack with long-range weapons and perform stealth actions. There are also other ways to change your fighting style; while you can learn action-oriented skills, you can also acquire passive skills that simply boost Emma and Koo's stats or recovery rate.</p>



<p>Beast of Reincarnation is currently slated for a <strong>Summer 2026</strong> launch window on <strong>PC</strong>, <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, and <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> and <strong>X</strong>. Stay tuned for more details as the release date approaches.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-winterspell-expansion-first-hands-on-with-darkwing-duck-pocohontas-and-more</link>
            <guid>1422469</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney Lorcana kicks off the new year with its upcoming release of Winterspell, the latest expansion set for the popular card game. The eleventh set will have an early release on February 13 at your local game stores, followed by the wide release on February 20. The exciting bit for every card game and their new sets or expansions is the change in gameplay and what that means for the meta. There’s also, of course, the beautiful new cards for those collectors out there. In Winterspell, the game finally brings in characters like Pocahontas, Tod from The Fox and the Hound, and even Darkwing Duck. In addition, different versions of characters already here make an appearance, like Lilo and Stitch, alongside new friends who are prominently featured in this new set. With all these new cards and the expected power creep, players will have a good excuse to tweak some competitive decks or make new ones entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of the newly introduced characters to Lorcana, Pocahontas and friends have a slew of cards to play around with. Namely, the legendary Pocahontas Peacekeeper card, which has a fun shift-related ability. When you play her onto the field using shift (which is upgrading an already played version of Pocahontas in play), you can freeze out your opponent’s characters from challenging until the start of your next turn as long as none of your characters challenged the turn it’s played. This means your characters can quest freely without having to worry about your opponent defeating them through challenges or battles on their turn. It’s quite a strong ability that also lines up with Pocahontas’ character in avoiding battles and creating peace. Some of the other cards from Pocahontas also focus on questing versus challenging, like Wisdom of the Willow or Mother’s Necklace. In a game where questing for lore ultimately wins you the match, I can see Pocahontas decks potentially lore rushing, since there are so many positives to questing with these cards than trying to control your opponent’s characters individually.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/darkwing-1769738267759.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Another legendary card showcasing a new character to Lorcana is Darkwing Duck Cool Under Pressure. This character also has the ability to shift, but his power comes from his passive synergy with item cards. During the player’s turn, they may pay 1 ink or mana to deal 2 damage to a chosen character whenever an item is banished or discarded. Being the Batman-like character that he is, this is a pretty cool way to emphasize Darkwing Duck’s use of gadgets. He also has a secondary ability that allows him to challenge or battle ready characters if they have the classification of Villain on their card. Normally, you can only challenge rested or tapped characters, so unlike Pocahontas, Darkwing Dark is all about fighting. Other Darkwing Duck-related cards fall into the Steel and Sapphire type categories, which lines up with that color combo’s style of play. Between the toughness of Steel cards, and the numerous items and control cards in Sapphire, this legendary Darkwing Duck can wreak havoc with the right build. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to these strong character cards, there are some location-based ones that could make games a bit more interesting. For example, the Game Preserve Protected Land location can gain Evasive itself if there’s a character with Evasive on that location. The Tod Playful Kit card, for example, has the ability to give a character evasive each time he quests, so the Game Preserve location will ideally have evasive every turn as long as Tod is on it, giving himself evasive. Another The Fox and the Hound card, Education or Elimination, is a song card with a similar ability of giving evasive. There are other location-based characters, like the new legendary Elsa Ice Artisan, which allows the owner to exert or rest a character with 3 or less strength when that Elsa or a location is played. While she’s at a location, she also gains an additional 3 lore when questing, so you want her on locations at all times. These are just some examples of the fun stuff you can do with various aspects of the gameplay getting further support. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/moanaruby-1769749875085.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that rotating sets have affected Disney Lorcana as well, that leaves players with a smaller pool of cards to optimize their decks. With that said, some older cards do get reprints, but it’s all for the sake of balancing the game. In a recent big competitive event, the top cut saw a lot of control decks with 5 of the top 8 running Sapphire. Amethyst was also popular with 5 of the top 8 players representing the color as well. Ultimately, a Sapphire/Emerald deck took the top spot in a mirror match that focused on filtering the deck with card draw alongside some removal and hand manipulation. Unfortunately, some of the new rare Sapphire and Emerald Winterspell cards don’t really work on this champion deck like Darkwing Duck, since there are no items in that deck. Still, cards like the new Moana Curious Explorer could be a worthy addition to keep your hand size while building up ink or mana through a different source like the discard pile. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another deck in the top cut is an Amethyst/Steel deck that revolves around playing many characters, and being able to draw more because of low hand sizes and a legendary Dumbo. A new Winterspell card that could fit very well in this competitive deck is Angel Experiment 624, who can gain resist +2 if the player has no cards in hand. A fairly easy feat for a deck that likes to have fewer than 3 cards in hand. Angel also has another ability to discard a card to deal 2 damage to a chosen character. Yet another option to keep that hand size low. The deck is already proven, and this Angel card just optimizes it a bit more.</p><p>The Darkwing Duck cards make him the hero he was made to be.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">One color lacking in the competitive scene lately is Ruby, with no representation in the top 32 of that recent major event from late last year. It seems to be due to the card set rotations banning certain staple cards in the currently constructed meta, so hopefully the new Ruby cards can give the color a fighting chance. For instance, this new legendary Wreck-It Ralph Raging Wrecker card is a triple threat with his ability to get stronger, quest for 3 lore, and a potential board clear if given the support. It’s a bit expensive, but it’s nothing Sapphire can’t achieve with its ramping capabilities. With this and the location support Elsa Ice Artisan, there could be some meaningful Ruby decks in this upcoming meta. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this is all speculation, but that’s the fun part about getting into new cards and brewing new decks. Do you follow the meta and tweak decks to their optimized state, or do you build a spicy meta breaker to keep your friends and opponents on their toes? The Pocahontas cards seem to favor questing and the protection of that strategy. The Darkwing Duck cards make him the hero he was made to be while making opposing characters villains with negative effects. Plus, familiar characters like Moana get a new spin for an everchanging competitive scene. Players will have a fun go with these new Winterspell cards, and it’ll be interesting to see what people gravitate towards as the season progresses.

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#967)—Clues and Answers for Monday, February 2]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-february-2-967/</link>
            <guid>1422430</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Monday, and while it’s time for a new week in your world, it’s also time for a new NYT Connections puzzle. I know you love them! But I also know you sometimes want to get the best NYT Connections hints squared away as soon as possible to start your day. That’s why I’ve outlined the answers and solutions below, just for you!</p>



<p>Read on to quickly resolve today’s NYT Connections puzzle.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-2">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 2)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #967:</p>



<ul>
<li>POPULAR</li>



<li>PERIOD</li>



<li>CROSS</li>



<li>STAMP</li>



<li>SPAN</li>



<li>PSALM</li>



<li>PASS</li>



<li>RYAN</li>



<li>LANYARD</li>



<li>STRETCH</li>



<li>REACHER</li>



<li>MARPLE</li>



<li>FAIR</li>



<li>INTERVAL</li>



<li>WRISTBAND</li>



<li>BOSCH</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Words you’d use to describe how long something lasts.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Items that let you <em>prove you belong</em> somewhere — concerts, events, secure areas.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> Last names of lead characters from popular thriller/crime novels and TV adaptations.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word becomes a type of tree when you add or remove a single letter.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 2:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-february-2-967">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, February 2 (#967)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– INTERVAL, PERIOD, SPAN, STRETCH</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – LANYARD, PASS, STAMP, WRISTBAND</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BOSCH, CROSS, REACHER, RYAN</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – FAIR, MARPLE, POPULAR, PSALM</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov Anti-Cheat Plea Gaining Community Traction]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-anti-cheat-community-playsafe-id/</link>
            <guid>1422418</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov has long had an issue with cheaters, and the developer in Battlestate Games has always professed how much of a full-time job it is to constantly combat them. For every head you eviscerate, two more pop up – it’s that adage linked to the concept of the hydra, but in this case, the mythical monster is very real, and it concerns <strong>malicious gamers</strong>.</p>



<p>Recently, a new community-backed initiative (or plea) has started gaining traction within the Escape from Tarkov space. Long-term fans of the hardcore extraction title are requesting that Battlestate Games implement <strong>PlaySafe ID</strong> verification, echoing a successful move made recently by SCUM’s developer.</p>







<h2 id="h-could-playsafe-id-change-the-game-in-escape-from-tarkov">Could PlaySafe ID Change the Game in Escape from Tarkov?</h2>



<p><a href="https://playsafeid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlaySafe ID</a> is all about anti-cheat mechanics and player protection, encouraging the facilitation of verified matchmaking features that link <strong>legitimate players </strong>with <strong>other </strong>legitimate players. The technical infrastructure behind it is much more complex than that, but the long and short of it is that it <strong>works </strong>as an anti-cheat solution and is <strong>not </strong>disruptive.</p>



<p>In a trending suggestion on the Tarkov Community site, which regularly hosts player-backed initiatives ranked by user votes, it has been requested that Battlestate Games ‘finally beat cheaters with PlaySafe ID’.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://tarkov.community/posts/10017/finally-beat-cheaters-with-playsafeid-just-like-scum-did" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the suggestion had pulled in</a> 153 total votes, of which 93% are in favor of the recommendation. In the comments, users spoke positively of PlaySafe ID and the potential protection gains the company could provide if it were to join forces with Battlestate Games.</p>



<p>The suggestion reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This isn’t about punishing legit players — it’s about finally protecting them. At this point, a system like PlaySafe ID feels like the only solution that can actually work long-term.</p>



<p>So, after the successful rollout of PlaySafeID in SCUM, it’s time to seriously talk about bringing it to Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Let’s finally get rid of cheaters, that have plagued us since the alpha of this game</p>
</blockquote>



<p>PlaySafe ID started probing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/anti-cheat-firm-plans-rid-tarkov-hackers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Escape from Tarkov space</a> back in June 2025, revealing an interest in working with the developers to improve the state of play in the world’s biggest extraction shooter title.</p>



<p>In August 2025, the company backed an investigative report and survey that revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/report-gamers-encounter-cheaters-online-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more than 80% of gamers</a> had encountered cheating in an online game. It’s no big secret that Escape from Tarkov is one of the most troubled games in that respect.</p>







<p>Do you think you’d participate in what PlaySafe ID could offer in Escape from Tarkov? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

      <p>The Pokémon Company has had to issue a formal apology after advertising an event on its official website that was scheduled to be held at the Yasukuni Shrine, a deeply controversial place that has been the epicentre of decades of social and political turmoil in Japan and around the world.</p><p>The event wasn't an official one--<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjn0nmnjmwo?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the BBC reports</u></a> it was being staged by a third party--but The Pokémon Company had it listed on their website regardless, which (after being discovered) prompted Chinese state media to write in the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, as quoted by the BBC:</p><blockquote>Brands that disregard history and hurt the feelings of the Chinese people will ultimately be abandoned...The relevant enterprises must accordingly take social responsibility and not make light of the heavy weight of history in the name of entertainment.</blockquote><p>This has not come at the most opportune time! China and Japan are in the middle of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025%E2%80%932026_China%E2%80%93Japan_diplomatic_crisis?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>a full-blown diplomatic crisis</u></a>, and the last thing anyone needed was news that a Pokémon event was being held at a shrine that, while dedicated to the memories of <em>all </em>Japanese soldiers killed in war since 1868, also contains the names of 1,066 convicted war criminals--all of whom served in China and the Pacific in the Second World War–<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversies_surrounding_Yasukuni_Shrine?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>which has made it a diplomatic flashpoint</u></a>.</p><p>A <a href="https://apnews.com/article/japan-china-yasumuni-pokemon-b826a5a8ecee7888e1a80322544e6b18?ref=aftermath.site"><u>statement </u></a>from The Pokémon Company says that not only are they apologising for advertising the event, but that it had been cancelled as well:</p><blockquote>After the incident was discovered, the event was promptly cancelled. We sincerely apologise for the various reactions and opinions that have been generated as a result of this publication.</blockquote><p>The company also says it will now "thoroughly review and strengthen" its processes, which shouldn't be too hard; adding a "don't promote events taking place at notorious war shrines in the middle of a diplomatic crisis" bullet point to the company handbook should do it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>During the Call of Duty League Major I finals in Dallas, Treyarch took to the stage to present the future of Ranked Play in Black Ops 7. Next week, the more competitive ecosystem will be introduced to Black Ops 7, allowing players to flex their skills, unlock exclusive rewards, and climb the ranks.</p>



<p>However, in a brief interview, Treyarch explained that changes coming to Black Ops 7’s Ranked Play platform mean that the higher the rank you are, the <strong>harder time you will have</strong>, for multiple reasons.</p>







<h2 id="h-ranked-play-restrictions-on-higher-levels">Ranked Play Restrictions on Higher Levels</h2>



<p>Treyarch appeared in Dallas, Texas, during the CDL Major I grand final to dish the dirt on Black Ops 7’s season two update, scheduled to drop next week. The conversation turned to the imminent arrival of Ranked Play and the <strong>changes </strong>that have been made to the competitive ecosystem.</p>



<p>First, it was confirmed that placement matches are being overhauled. The system will start calculating your opening rank from your first placement match, and after you’ve won <strong>three matches</strong>, you’ll be assigned an amount of SR and a starting rank that <strong>doesn’t </strong>put you at the lowest level out of the gate.</p>



<p>It was then explained that, as you climb the ranks, things get harder. If you make it into the top 250, the most prestigious annals of the Ranked Play platform, you’ll face immense losses when you fail to win your matches. You’ll drop harsher in terms of SR than you would at lower levels, keeping things much more competitive.</p>



<p>Also, you <strong>will not </strong>be able to queue with more than <strong>two </strong>Crimson-or-above-ranked players in one party. This is another limitation imposed to keep things more balanced.</p>



<p>Treyarch also confirmed that new ‘Ranked Play Series’ circuits will start up as season two unfolds. This fresh system will stand at the <strong>end </strong>of the season, allowing users to directly compete against those who finished ‘close to them’ in the Ranked Play space for more rewards and ‘the ultimate bragging rights.’</p>







<p>Do you think these changes are good, or are they putting you off playing Ranked? Let us know your <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[AdHoc Working With Nintendo After Dispatch Censorship Controversy]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/adhoc-working-with-nintendo-after-dispatch-censorship-controversy/</link>
            <guid>1422310</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/adhoc-studio/" id="2968">AdHoc </a>says they’re working closely with Nintendo to find a pathway forward after a censored version of Dispatch was released on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Dispatch is a superhero interactive fiction video game in which your choices determine how the story unfolds. The game was released in the latter half of 2025 on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. The game was instantly met with critical acclaim and fanfare.</p>



<p>Dispatch eventually made its way to Nintendo Switch 2, but instead of allowing some adult language and content to be censored, the decision was made for you, and the game is permanently censored on the Nintendo Switch.</p>







<h2 id="h-nintendo-s-response-and-adhoc-s-current-stance">Nintendo’s Response and AdHoc’s Current Stance</h2>



<p>AdHoc initially responded to the backlash by explaining that different platforms have different submission criteria. They also stated that they worked with Nintendo to ensure the content met release criteria and assured players that the core narrative of the gameplay experience remained unchanged.</p>



<p>Nintendo then released a statement confirming that while they inform Partners when a submitted game does not meet their platform’s guidelines, they do not make changes to partners’ content.</p>







<p>AdHoc most recently stated in a <a href="https://discord.com/invite/adhocstudio">Discord </a>message that, like most players, they assumed they could access uncensored mature content on Nintendo Switch because games like The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 are also available on the platform. </p>



<p>However, they’re continuing to work with Nintendo on a path forward. Still, they advise players to expect and update their addresses; at least some of the censored content will take weeks due to development time and the console submission process.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“People have a right to be pissed. Lots of lessons learned here. Thanks for sticking with us. More soon.”</p>
</blockquote>

            <p>The director and creator of Ashes of Creation, the MMORPG brought to life via the $3.2 million donated by almost 20,000 backers in 2017, has quit "in protest" against decisions his board was making that he could "not ethically agree with or carry out".</p>
<p>Following a slew of unhappy messages from numerous people posted online across Discord and LinkedIn (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ashes-of-creation/layoffs-director-resigns">PCGN</a>), it appears that director Steven Sharif's resignation triggered further resignations across "much of the senior leadership team" of Intrepid Studios, after which the Board "proceed[ed] with a mass layoff".</p>

<p>Things seemed to be coming to a head towards the end of January, when, on the 27th, a notice was posted on the official <a href="https://ashesofcreation.com/news/a-director-s-letter-to-the-citizens-of-verra-336">website</a> promising to address several issues and informing players that the studio was moving its Development Update to 13th February. It was signed by "The Ashes of Creation team", and did not address the game's future.</p><p>"I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation," Sharif wrote on Discord a couple of days later. "Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out. As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support. Following my resignation, much of the senior leadership resigned. Following those departures, the Board made the decision to issue WARN Act notices and proceed with a mass layoff.</p>
<p>"I cannot responsibly speak to further details at this time due to ongoing legal and governance matters. What I can say is that the developers and staff acted in good faith and deserved better than the uncertainty that they are now facing. I am incredibly dismayed at the situation."</p>
<p>Then, overnight (31st January), director of communications Margaret Krohn confirmed on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/margaretkrohn_well-this-chapter-has-come-to-a-close-activity-7423531204198436864-XsUB/">LinkedIn</a> that their time at Intrepid Studios "has come to a close", writing: "As for how this all ended… I don't really have the words. It wasn't what I expected. But I'm holding onto the good because there was so much of it".</p>
<p>Players are now understandably concerned that the game they only purchased a couple of weeks ago - it released into early access on 11th December - could be in jeopardy, and the Steam page, and its subsequent reviews, is now filling up with concerns and complaints from players trying to get an answer on the game's fate. We've reached out to Intrepid Studios and will update should we get a response.</p><p>Asked by someone on LinkedIn if Ashes of Creation had indeed been cancelled, Krohn replied: "I don't work there anymore, so I can't answer that for you. Personally, I don't know how they would make it when the heart and soul of the product, the amazing dev team, was all laid off."</p>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>Without anything else to go on it's hard to be definitive about what to expect, but given Duckov's collab kicks off in February, it's plausible that Tarkov's event will, too. We'll keep you posted.</p>
<p>You'll remember that Escape from Duckov - which debuted on Steam shortly before Tarkov's long-anticipated Steam release late last year - took us by storm as well as surprise, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/escape-from-duckov-waddles-into-the-extraction-shooter-space-with-over-200000-concurrent-players">clocking up a staggering 301,322 concurrent players at release</a>, making it one of the biggest games on Steam ever. Since then, numbers have tapered off somewhat, but it apparently still very much made an impression on Battlestate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/escape-from-tarkov-players-slam-steam-launch-it-is-not-a-game-it-is-a-cosmic-punishment">Escape from Tarkov is still sitting on a Mixed rating after November's eagerly-awaited Steam debut</a> resulted in stability and performance issues that prevented players from even logging in, let alone play.</p>

            <p>Gaming companies saw share prices plummet this week after Google rolled out Project Genie 3, an AI tool that lets users generate virtual worlds in 60-second bursts from text prompts.</p>
<p>Companies like Take-Two, CD Projekt, Unity, and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> saw between 8-20 percent wiped off the value of their companies as spooked investors seemingly went into the weekend thinking tech like this could replace the game development process. Which it can't, of course (not yet, anyway).</p>

<p>As Bloomberg's Jason Schreier wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mdnsxghxkk2t">BlueSky</a>, "Gaming stocks are dropping today after Google's rollout of Project Genie, an AI tool that lets users create and explore virtual worlds for 60 seconds. This is the result of a market that does not understand how video games are made.</p><p>"To be clear, this is not a referendum on the quality of AI content," he added. "Markets are spooked because they believe tools like Project Genie will allow anyone to generate a video game. This is not actually possible." He then suggested traders take a look at his latest book, Blood, Sweat, and Pixels.</p>

</span></p><p>Shinobi602 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shinobi602.bsky.social/post/3mdnsxei4lk2w">added</a> a similar sentiment: "Video game stocks are suddenly crashing today with the launch of Google's Project Genie as investors think games will start magically getting made with AI."</p>
<p><a href="https://deepmind.google/models/genie/">Genie 3</a> is described as a general-purpose world model that can take text descriptions and generate "photorealistic environments that can be explored in real-time". The environments are interactive and controllable, and offer "world consistency and stability". This includes both real-life and fantastical scenarios rendered in realistic 3D or animated styles.</p>
<p>And it does look incredible. The examples given - which include the prompts used to generate them - are undoubtedly impressive, most of which respond to external third-party controls or inputs.</p>
<p>But the tech comes with several limitations, not least that its interactive elements are significantly restricted, and creations are only a minute long. It would be extraordinarily unwise to suggest that Genie <em>couldn't</em> challenge game engines like Unity and Unreal one day, but given the incredibly limited examples provided, it's unlikely to do so anytime soon.</p><p>AI, of course, continues to generate heated debate across the industry. In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">a report by Unity claimed 62 percent of studios using its tools used AI</a> at some point during game development, most notably in animation. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-third-of-developers-impacted-by-layoffs-in-last-12-months-according-to-gdc-survey">GDC survey from that same year</a>, meanwhile, said that around a third of industry workers reported using AI tools already. That number is now likely to be higher, and a more recent Tokyo Games Show survey reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI</a> in development.</p>

            <guid>1422199</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="58446a9d9d94d"><a title="Super Nintendo - Keza MacDonald" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/58446a9d9d94d/super-nintendo-keza-macdonald.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>In the introduction to <strong>Super Nintendo: How One Japanese Company Helped the World Have Fun</strong>, Keza MacDonald makes a simple promise: over the course of the next 12 chapters, you'll read something you didn't already know.</p>
<p>It's the kind of gauntlet-laying that would have any self-respecting Nintendo fan click their knuckles and close their <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page">Bulbapedia</a> tab in a 'challenge accepted' kind of way. And yet, 250 pages later, I can honestly say that it rang true.</p>
<p>'Super Nintendo', to bring it down from its proper title, is the story of the company that we all know and love; it's also the story of us, humans, and how we play. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/keza-macdonald">The Guardian</a>'s Video Games Editor and former Editor-in-Chief at <a href="https://kotaku.com/">Kotaku UK</a> compiles interviews with just about every Nintendo creative you can think of (and the ones you can't) to explain how some of the industry's most iconic series came to be, while also reflecting on why these series are important in wider culture.</p>
<p>It's comprehensive but never too dense, informative but approachable, and packed with an unwavering passion for Nintendo that I'd wager even the company's biggest detractors would find infectious. In short, if you want to learn about Nintendo, this is the book to do it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="0cb0be378867c"><a title="Super Nintendo - Keza MacDonald" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0cb0be378867c/super-nintendo-keza-macdonald.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Strictly speaking, this isn't a chronological walkthrough from A to B. It starts with the toy manufacturing of the 1960s and '70s and ends with the development of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/splatoon">Splatoon</a>, but each game-focused chapter in between serves as a jumping-off point to explain something larger about the company as a whole.</p>
<p>A chapter on <strong>Donkey Kong</strong> delves into the early design processes of a little-known artist called Shigeru Miyamoto. A <strong>Metroid</strong> section also serves to dissect gender representation in both Nintendo games and the wider industry. <strong>Animal Crossing</strong> acts as a prime case study demonstrating Nintendo's habit of sticking with an idea until its audience finds it.</p>
<p>Be it the story of smash-hit successes like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/wii_sports">Wii Sports</a>, or the company's more off-the-wall moments like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_labo_toy-con_01_variety_kit">LABO</a> (no, LABO wasn't just a fever dream), the book presents the House of Mario not as a company that's out of touch with competitors, but one that's always looking to what's next — even if 'next' is a cardboard piano.</p>
<p>The Nintendo fanboy in me always likes viewing the company in relation to the larger industry, and MacDonald does a nice job of balancing the micro details of game development with the bigger picture. There are plenty of places that you can look for deep dives into specific titles and their development, but Super Nintendo really shines in showcasing the personal touches.</p>
<figure data-uuid="801977e687d0a"><a title="Super Nintendo - Keza MacDonald" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/801977e687d0a/super-nintendo-keza-macdonald.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Take the chapter on <strong>Kirby</strong>, which is used as a way into discussing the much-missed Satoru Iwata. It's a poignant and heartfelt tribute shining the light as much on Iwata the man as Iwata the designer — the corporate president, computer programmer, <em>and</em> gamer, to paraphrase his iconic introductory quote. By compiling words from Miyamoto, Itoi and others close to him (mainly from Hobonichi's wonderful book, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/07/book_review_ask_iwata_words_of_wisdom_from_satoru_iwata_nintendos_legendary_ceo">Ask Iwata</a>), MacDonald balances Iwata's commercial and personal impacts. It's fitting that the chapter ends on Miyamoto's memories of their late-night meals and shared sweets rather than impressive sales figures for Wii and DS.</p>
<p>The book is built on one of the most comprehensive collections of interviews that I've seen in a long time, many from MacDonald herself. The veteran journalist throws out tidbits from her chats with Miyamoto, Aonuma, Tezuka, and others, pulling from other works when she didn't have a chance to sit down with the creative in question. Super Nintendo threads each perspective together into a cohesive whole, and it feels like you're getting a peek behind the wizard's curtain, catching a glimpse of all the old developers turning wheels and flipping switches while the end result looks like magic from the outside.</p>
<p>There are lots of little inner-working nuggets peppered throughout the book, and I don't want to spoil them here, but it's exciting to hear some of the company's longest-serving designers talk anecdotally about their perceptions of select products long before they launched. Shinya Takahashi has a list of production credits as long as your arm, so reading about his pre-launch worries about the Switch, about how he wasn't fully on board with the appeal of the design until the first time he moved a prototype from docked to handheld, is fascinating.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e274940fbeaf4"><a title="Super Nintendo - Keza MacDonald" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e274940fbeaf4/super-nintendo-keza-macdonald.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Well-worn tales of Miyamoto's Zelda inspiration stemming from his time exploring forests as a child are mixed with lesser-known details, like Koizumi confessing he designed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a>'s splashy focus on the back of his memories of summer holidays spent by the water. You'll find a lot of these anecdotes elsewhere, but I highly doubt that you've read them all.</p>
<p>By threading them into the story of the company, Super Nintendo proves to be a very satisfying summary of a company that is ever-changing and ever-growing. If this book puts one thing above all others across, it's that Nintendo's sense of fun, and our sense of play, will forever be its most appealing feature.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Hello everyone. We have a different kind of post for you today from our usual coverage of the gaming industry. You may or may not know that TheSixthAxis has been around for 18 years now, with too many people to name who have contributed to our continued existence. Though we do have a special thanks and mention to TheSixthAxis’ co-founders Alex and Michael, and long-time editor Peter, who defined our site back in the PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii era.</p>
<p>Throughout our 18 years, TheSixthAxis has maintained its independence, allowing us to cover the games and news we want, the way we want. We have full editorial control and our team of great writers, past and present, have always been allowed to write the articles they want to, with a little guidance here and there. TheSixthAxis has also been about community. While our forums no longer exist as more than a time capsule, they were a hub for people from all over the world to get to know each other and build friendships that grew. We continue to try and foster a community through our social media channels, and we are always interested in hearing from our readers.</p>
<p>With all of that in mind, and with the current landscape of the games media, we are now exploring how to become a partly reader-funded outlet so we can continue to invest in the site, and support our writers, allowing them to continue to pen the news, features, and reviews that you visit us for. To that end, we have launched a new page on Ko-fi where you can tip us.</p>




<p>It is completely up to you how much you want to tip us, whether you want to tip on a monthly basis, or if you want to tip us at all. There is no obligation or requirement. As much as we would love to be fully reader funded, we expect advertising to remain a necessary source of income, though we will always try to remain respectful with their implementation.</p>

<p>Traditional gaming websites like ours are fewer in number which means fewer opportunities for new writers to break into the industry, less coverage of smaller games as sites fight for views, and less content for you to enjoy overall. Your support will mean we can invest in our current writers, and new writers who want to get into games journalism. As much as we’d love to, none of us will be around to write for TheSixthAxis forever, so we want to be able to hand over the site to the next generation of writers when that time comes far in the future. We can invest in improving our website so your experience is smoother. It also means we can allocate resources to cover more games, from AAA to solo developers who right now may be making the next big thing, but too few of us know about it. There is a lot we want to do as a team, and we want to remain independent and to keep the lights on while pursuing balanced and thoughtful coverage of the games industry.</p>

Ah yes, another dose of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a>!</p>
<p>The Switch 2 has kicked off the year in relatively calm fashion, but before the mad Spring rush hits us, let's look at some eShop gems that are worth checking out. Yes, there are games other than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizon</a> out there, we promise.</p>
<p>Here's how this works: same as ever, our writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from January 2026 from titles we've reviewed, and the three games with the highest scores will make the podium.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kqhylu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>It's been a surprisingly busy January in terms of news and releases — Animal Crossing, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII</a>, two whole Directs on the <strong>Super</strong> <strong>Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> — but the eShop exclusives have been a little on the quieter side on the review front.</p>
<p>We do have a review-in-progress for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_hate_this_place">I Hate This Place</a>, but there have been plenty of other games we just haven't managed to get around to: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/they-are-billions">They are Billions</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/suika-game-planet">Suika Game Planet</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/citadelum">Citadelum</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/escape_from_ever_after">Escape from Ever After</a>... these are just a few, too!</p>
<p>Still, we have four games that made the cut this time around, all scoring 7/10 and above. That leaves one honourable mention, and then the top three:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cassette_boy">Cassette Boy</a> (NS1) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/cassette-boy">7/10</a></li>
</ul>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">3rd Place - GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>The Switch 2's more-powerful hardware has really opened the door for all types of sports and racing games to make the jump onto Nintendo's console, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition</a> has pulled up at the starting line to help get the driving going.</p>
<p>January has been a pretty impressive month for technical ports, and GRID Legends is among the very best. 60fps is the way to go here, but there are multiple different graphics settings you can play around with in both handheld and docked. That's still a rarity on Switch 2 right now, and we hope GRID sets the standard for other developers.</p>
<p>Put all of that together, along with top-notch racing mechanics, and you've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">an excellent 8/10 racer</a> on your hands. Just maybe pull out the GameCube controller for this one.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">2nd Place - MIO: Memories in Orbit (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Speaking of great-looking games on Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">MIO: Memories in Orbit</a> is already one of the most-stunning on the console, with a beautiful spaceship-like vessel adorned in pastels and scribbles and an eerie, ethereal atmosphere that helps carry you along the adventure.</p>
<p>The platforming in this Metroidvania can be tough-as-nails, but when you master the movement in this game, it's sublime. The combat doesn't always work for us, but everything else elevates MIO from being 'just another action platformer' into a beautiful one that will stick with us.</p>
<p>MIO is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">our second 8/10</a> in this top three, <em>just</em> beating out GRID in the votes game by one. Turns out a robot in space is faster than a car.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">1st Place - Dispatch (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>If you've been paying attention to gaming news and releases, then you probably saw this one coming — AdHoc's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Dispatch</a> was the runaway winner this month, and with good reason: it's fantastic, and a true return-to-form for the Telltale-style of gameplay.</p>
<p>Which makes sense, as former Telltale devs worked on this superhero comedy caper, that goes everywhere from rude jokes to explicit moments, but even has plenty of touching scenes and a little bit of romance. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-responds-to-dispatch-switch-censorship-with-official-statement">censorship drama</a> might be sucking the air out of things at the moment, but take it from us — regardless of where you play Dispatch, you'll have a great time.</p>
<p>As both the victor and the highest-scoring game of the bunch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">with a 9/10</a>, Dispatch takes the top spot on the podium. Congrats, Robert Robertson and everyone at the Superhero Dispatch Network!</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-january-2026]]></content:encoded>
