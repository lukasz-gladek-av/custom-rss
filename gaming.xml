<p>The first few months of 2025 were full of graphics card reviews where we generally came away impressed with performance and completely at a loss on availability and pricing. The testing in these reviews is useful regardless, but when it came to extra buying advice, the best we could do was to compare Nvidia’s imaginary pricing to AMD’s imaginary pricing and wait for availability to improve.</p>
<p>Now, as the year winds down, we’re facing price spikes for memory and storage that are unlike anything I’ve seen in two decades of pricing out PC parts. Pricing for most RAM kits has increased dramatically since this summer, driven by overwhelming demand for these parts in AI data centers. Depending on what you’re building, it’s now <em>very</em> possible that the memory could be the single most expensive component you buy; things are even worse now than they were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/spiking-memory-prices-mean-that-it-is-once-again-a-horrible-time-to-build-a-pc/">the last time we compared prices a few weeks ago</a>.</p>

<p>Some SSDs are getting to the point where they’re twice as expensive as they were this summer (for this comparison, I’ve swapped the newer WD Blue SN5100 pricing in for the SN5000, since the drive is both newer and slightly cheaper as of this writing). Some RAM kits, meanwhile, are around <em>four</em> times as expensive as they were in August. Yeesh.</p>
<p>And as bad as things are, the outlook for the immediate future isn’t great. Memory manufacturer Micron—which is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/after-nearly-30-years-crucial-will-stop-selling-ram-to-consumers/">pulling its Crucial-branded RAM and storage products</a> from the market entirely in part because of these shortages—<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/micron-outlines-grim-outlook-for-dram-supply-in-first-earnings-call-since-killing-crucial-memory-and-ssd-brand-ceo-says-it-can-only-meet-half-to-two-thirds-of-demand">predicted</a> in a recent earnings call that supply constraints would “persist beyond calendar 2026.” Kingston executives <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ram/dont-wait-if-youre-planning-to-upgrade-your-ram-or-ssd-kingston-rep-warns-says-prices-will-continue-to-go-up-nand-costs-up-246-percent">believe</a> prices will continue to rise through next year. PR representatives at GPU manufacturer Sapphire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV847y2Q96c">believe</a> prices will “stabilize,” albeit at a higher level than people might like.</p>

<p>I didn’t know it when I was writing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/ars-technica-system-guide-back-to-pc-building-for-back-to-school/">the last update to our system guide</a> in mid-August, but it turns out that I was writing it during 2025’s PC Building Equinox, the all-too-narrow stretch of time where 1080p and 1440p GPUs had fallen to more-or-less MSRP but RAM and storage prices hadn’t yet spiked.</p>
<p>All in all, it has been yet another annus horribilis for gaming-PC builders, and at this point it seems like the 2020s will just end up being a bad <em>decade</em> for PC building. Not only have we had to deal with everything from pandemic-fueled shortages to tariffs to the current AI-related crunch, but we’ve also been given <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-and-5060-review-putting-the-mid-in-mid-range/">pretty underwhelming upgrades</a> for both GPUs and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/amd-ryzen-9000-review-impressive-efficiency-with-bugs-and-so-so-speed-boosts/">CPUs</a>.</p>
<h2>It should be a golden age for the gaming PC</h2>
<p>It’s really too bad that building or buying a gaming PC is such an annoying and expensive proposition, because in a lot of ways there has never been a better time to be a PC gamer.</p>
<p>It used to be that PC ports of popular console games would come years later or never at all, but these days PC players get games at around the same time as console players, too. Sony, of all companies, has become much better about releasing its games to PC players. And Microsoft seems to be signaling more and more convergence between the Xbox and the PC, to the extent that it is communicating any kind of coherent Xbox strategy at all. The console wars are cooling down, and the PC has been one of the main beneficiaries.</p>
<p>That wider game availability is also coming at a time when PC software is getting more flexible and interesting. Traditional Windows-based gaming builds still dominate, of course, and Windows remains the path of least resistance for PC buyers and builders. But Valve’s work on SteamOS and the Proton compatibility software has brought a wide swath of PC games to Linux, and SteamOS itself is enabling a simpler and more console-like PC gaming experience for handheld PCs as well as TV-connected desktop computers. And that work is now boomeranging back around to Windows, which is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/rog-xbox-ally-x-the-ars-technica-review/">gradually rolling out</a> its own pared-down gamepad-centric frontend.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>If you’ve already got a decent gaming PC, you’re feeling pretty good about all of this—as long as the games you want to play don’t have Mario or Pikachu in them, your PC is all you really need. It’s also not a completely awful time to be upgrading a build you already have, as long as you already have at least 16GB of RAM—if you’re thinking about a GPU upgrade, doing it now before the RAM price spikes can start impacting graphics card pricing is probably a smart move.</p>
<p>If you <em>don’t</em> already have a decent gaming PC and you can buy a whole PlayStation 5 for the cost of some 32GB DDR5 RAM kits, well, it’s hard to look past the downsides no matter how good the upsides are. But it doesn’t mean we can’t try.</p>

<h2>What if you want to buy something anyway?</h2>

      As (relatively) old as they are, midrange Core i5 chips from Intel’s 12th-, 13th-, and 14th-generation Core CPU lineups are still solid choices for budget-to-midrange PC builds. And they work with DDR4, which isn’t <em>quite</em> as pricey as DDR5 right now.

<p>Say those upsides&nbsp;<em>are</em> still appealing to you, and you want to build something today. How should you approach this terrible, volatile RAM market?</p>
<p>I won’t do a full update to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/ars-technica-system-guide-back-to-pc-building-for-back-to-school/">August’s system guide</a> right now, both because it feels futile to try and recommend individual RAM kits or SSD with prices and stock levels being as volatile as they are, and because aside from RAM and storage I actually wouldn’t change any of these recommendations all that much (with the caveat that Intel’s Core i5-13400F seems to be getting harder to find; consider an i5-12400F or i5-12600KF instead). So, starting from those builds, here’s the advice I would try to give to PC-curious friends:</p>
<p><strong>DDR4 is faring better than DDR5</strong>. Prices for all kinds of RAM have gone up recently, but DDR4 pricing hasn’t gotten&nbsp;<em>quite</em> as bad as DDR5 pricing. That’s of no help to you if you’re trying to build something around a newer Ryzen chip and a socket AM5 motherboard, since those parts require DDR5. But if you’re trying to build a more budget-focused system around one of Intel’s 12th-, 13th-, or 14th-generation CPUs, <a href="https://www.newegg.com/corsair-vengeance-lpx-32gb-ddr4-3200-cas-latency-cl16-desktop-memory-black/p/N82E16820236541?Item=N82E16820236541">a decent name brand 32GB DDR4-3200 kit</a> comes in around half the price of <a href="https://www.newegg.com/patriot-memory-viper-elite-5-32gb-2-x-16gb-ddr5-6000-pc5-48000-cas-latency-cl30-desktop-memory-white/p/N82E16820225386?Item=N82E16820225386">a similar 32GB DDR5-6000 kit</a>. Pricing isn’t&nbsp;<em>great</em>, but it’s still possible to build something respectable for under $1,000.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p><strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=ram+bundles">Newegg bundles</a> might help</strong>. I’m normally not wild about these kinds of component bundles; even if they&nbsp;<em>appear</em> to be a good deal, they’re often a way for Newegg or other retailers to get rid of things they don’t want by pairing them with things people <em>do</em> want. You also have to deal with less flexibility—you can’t always pick exactly the parts you’d want under ideal circumstances. But if you’re already buying a CPU and a motherboard, it might be worth digging through the available deals just to see if you can get a good price on something workable.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t overbuy (or consider under-buying)</strong>. Under normal circumstances, anyone advising you on a PC build should be recommending matched pairs of RAM sticks with reasonable speeds and ample capacities (DDR4-3200 remains a good sweet spot, as does DDR5-6000 or DDR5-6400). Matched sticks are capable of dual-channel operation, boosting memory bandwidth and squeezing a bit more performance out of your system. And getting 32GB of RAM means comfortably running any game currently in existence, with a good amount of room to grow.</p>
<p>But desperate times call for desperate measures. Slower DDR5 speeds like DDR5-5200 can come in a fair bit cheaper than DDR5-6000 or DDR5-6400, in exchange for a tiny speed hit that’s going to be hard to notice outside of benchmarks. You might even consider buying a&nbsp;<em>single</em> 16GB stick of DDR5, and buying it a partner at some point later when prices have calmed down a bit. You’ll leave a tiny bit of performance on the table, and a small handful of games want more than 16GB of system RAM. But you’ll have something that <em>boots</em>, and the GPU is still going to determine how well most games run.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p><strong>Don’t forget that non-binary DDR5 exists</strong>. DDR5 sticks come in some in-betweener capacities that weren’t possible with DDR4, which means that companies sell it in 24GB and 48GB sticks, not just 16/32/64. And these kits can be a&nbsp;<em>very slightly</em> better deal than the binary memory kits right now; this <a href="https://www.newegg.com/crucial-pro-48gb-ddr5-6000-cas-latency-cl48-desktop-memory-black/p/N82E16820156383?Item=N82E16820156383">48GB Crucial DDR5-6000 kit</a> is going for $470 right now, or $9.79 per gigabyte, compared to about $340 for a similar 32GB kit ($10.63 per GB) or $640 for a 64GB kit ($10 per GB). It’s not much, but if you truly do need a lot of RAM, it’s worth looking into.</p>
<p><strong>Consider pre-built systems</strong>. A quick glance at Dell’s Alienware lineup and Lenovo’s Legion lineup makes it clear that these towers still aren’t particularly price-competitive with similarly specced self-built PCs. This was true before there was a RAM shortage, and it’s true now. But for certain kinds of PCs, particularly budget PCs, it can still make more sense to buy than to build.</p>
<p>For example, when I wrote about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/11/ive-already-been-using-a-steam-machine-for-months-and-i-think-its-great/">the self-built “Steam Machine” I’ve been using</a> for a few months now, I mentioned some Ryzen-based mini desktops on Amazon. I later tested <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FSKYK2MQ">this one from Aoostar</a>&nbsp;as part of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/steamos-vs-windows-on-dedicated-gpus-its-complicated-but-windows-has-an-edge/">a wider-ranging SteamOS-vs-Windows performance comparison</a>. Whether you’re comfortable with these no-name mini PCs is something you’ll have to decide for yourself, but that’s a fully functional PC with 32GB of DDR5, a 1TB SSD, a workable integrated GPU, and a Windows license for $500. You’d spend nearly $500 <em>just</em> to buy the RAM kit and the SSD with today’s component prices; for basic 1080p gaming you could do a lot worse.</p>

              <p>Want a better cordless vacuum? There are tons on the market out there, with options that fit every budget. But one in particular caught our eye thanks to its significant discount and its performance alike: the Dyson V11 Origin Cordless Vacuum. Designed for anyone who wants strong cleaning power without dragging a heavy vacuum from room to room, it’s a lightweight powerhouse you might actually like using, believe it or not.</p>
<p>If that sounds like a holiday miracle, you know we’ve got you covered. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">You’ll need to shop Amazon to get the Dyson V11 Origin Cordless Vacuum, where it’s on sale for just $350, down from its usual price of $630</a>. That’s $280 off and a savings of 44% off. Not bad for a smaller, lightweight vacuum. And of course it’s a Dyson, so you can expect extra features and better craftsmanship along with the price tag.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful cordless vacuum built for all your everyday messes</h2>
<p>This model is more than just your average push-and-go vacuum, with features like intelligent suction and a LCD screen on the frame itself to give you real-time info while you clean. That includes giving you a heads up on its battery life down to the second, so you know exactly how much time you have left to clean. It also lets you know about any potential maintenance needs, which helps keep the vacuum performing at its best. This small detail makes a big difference, especially if you like knowing what’s going on with your appliances.</p>
<p>But really, all that to say its major feature is the fact that it’s cordless. Sure, there are tons of cordless vacuums out there. It’s just that this one has better maneuverability that going corless facilitates, so it’s easier to clean stairs, corners, and tight spaces. You can quickly grab it for a spill or mess without needing to plan around outlets. The vacuum converts into a handheld unit, making it simple to clean furniture, car interiors, shelves, and baseboards.</p>



<p>The filtration system can capture even the smallest of particles and dust, as well as germs. Thats super helpful for homes with pets or allergies. It traps debris inside the bin rather than releasing it back into the air, helping your home feel cleaner after you’re done vacuuming.</p>
<p>Battery life is solid for most households. You can clean several rooms on a single charge, and the vacuum is efficient enough to handle routine cleaning without constant recharging. The included wall mounted dock keeps it charged and ready, while also giving you a neat place to store attachments.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">There’s a lot to love about this vacuum, but in all honestly, we’re mostly attracted to the discount right now.</a> Whether you have a large house or a small apartment, this is an appliance you’ll want to use regularly, and it’ll make the money back for you in terms of time. Plus, you won’t have to keep buying new vacuums. Buy this one once, and you should be as good as done.</p>

            <guid>1387738</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NjA4NTY0MSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NjkwNDQxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0hDRFNLR0lGUEUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.jGluGdyZVa1EEBKJKLlY2aRo0tCwewmOk2TBd_9y2Iw">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> points to Naughty Dog already enforcing mandatory overtime to finish a demo for <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet,</a> its upcoming project and the first new franchise from the studio in over a decade. The game won't be out for a while - <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/">it likely won't be out next year</a> - but the crunching has already started.</p>



<p>Firstly, don't get excited about the demo. It's not for players, or at least that's not what the report claims it is for. According to the employees Schreier spoke to, who remained anonymous as they were not permitted to speak publicly about this, the demo was for a milestone check-in with Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p>



<p>The mandatory overtime reportedly started in late October and has been going on since, working an extra eight hours a week, though they were asked not to work more than 60 hours per week. On top of having to put more time in, employees were also reportedly called back into the office for this period for a full five days a week instead of three.</p>



<p>As Schreier previously reported, the game is still set to arrive sometime mid-2027, but if the studio is already crunching on milestones like this, employees are concerned about what that says for the rest of the game's development as they inch closer to the launch of Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/former-naughty-dog-devs-crunch/">We know that crunch culture has been an issue</a> for Naughty Dog in the past, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/striking-distance-callisto-protocol-crunch/">that crunch culture has been a problem</a> across triple-A development for several studios. But, as Schreier points out, the backlash from players towards studios and their leadership that makes these decisions (which, for Naughty Dog, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/neil-druckmann-hbo-the-last-of-us-naughty-dog/">Neil Druckmann</a>) has led to studios changing. Or, at least it led to them saying they would change.</p>



<p>As for how the studio will move forward right now, the report adds that the overtime mandate ended for the majority of the studio this week, with its previous schedule returning for January. A new schedule for what comes after January 2026 will be released when the studio returns from its holiday break.</p>



<p>There's <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-is-at-the-stage-of-polishing-devs-confirm-2-endings-and-stable-performance-on-ps4/">always a polishing stage</a> towards the end of a game's development. That's normal, and it's possible to go through that polishing stage without overworking the team. For Naughty Dog to reportedly already start putting its developers through periods of mandated overtime this far out from release does not inspire confidence that Druckmann and the studio's leadership will refrain from doing so again, and perhaps for a longer period of time.</p>

              <p><em>Marathon</em> might be the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-shooter-best-vibrant-colorful-bungie-trailer-1850481359">most visually striking game Bungie’s ever made</a>, and the art director overseeing it won’t be there when the game ships. <em>Kotaku</em> has learned that veteran artist Joseph Cross recently decided to depart the studio. The move comes just months ahead of the extraction shooter’s new March 2026 release date.</p> <p>Evidence of Cross’ departure was first spotted earlier today <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-joseph-cross-stepped-down-marathon-franchise-art-director/">by <em>The Game Post</em></a>. His LinkedIn profile was recently updated to give his senior art director position at Bungie an end date of 2025, and his account on X no longer references the studio at all. He was a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/10263/7_Breaking-In---Joe-Cross">lead concept artist at Bungie</a> throughout the <em>Destiny</em> years and returned to the studio around 2020 to help shape the aesthetic for <em>Marathon</em>, the company’s newest multiplayer shooter.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marathon Art Style (a short thread). First of all thanks to everyone for all the kind words and enthusiasm for the art style/direction in our announce trailer, it's been amazing to see. This was the result of many talented artists working together, with the support of an amazing <a href="https://t.co/ePPi41KA6c">pic.twitter.com/ePPi41KA6c</a></p> <p>— Joseph Cross (@josephacross) <a href="https://twitter.com/josephacross/status/1663415929043296257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2023</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Cross told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> that it was his decision to leave. “I’m super proud of the project and what the team accomplished over the last six years,” he said. He also recently shared a clip on X from <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-price-battle-pass-proximity-chat-2000653472">Bungie’s latest ViDoc showing how <em>Marathon </em>has evolved</a> following its delay after negative fan feedback from an alpha test earlier in the year.</p>

 <p>A number of tweaks were made to the extraction shooter, including adding proximity chat, a feature that’s become a cornerstone of breakout hit <em>Arc Raiders</em>. Originally set to launch back in September, <em>Marathon</em> is now coming early next year.</p> <p>The delay also followed fallout <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-alpha-gameplay-posters-antireal-1851780911">around allegations</a> that some visual decals in the game had been lifted from someone outside the studio. “[The] <i>Marathon</i> art issue has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction,” <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-antireal-art-plagiarism-extraction-2000649685">the artist announced</a> earlier this month.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is the MMO Genre Dead for Western AAA Developers? We Asked Three Industry Veterans]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/is-the-mmo-genre-dead-for-western-aaa-developers-we-asked-three-industry-veterans/</link>
            <guid>1387720</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Once upon a time, there was the <strong>MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) Golden Age</strong>. During those years, some of the largest and most renowned gaming studios were willing to make massive investment bets in the development of new MMO games, easily justifying them with the genre's burgeoning popularity.</p>



<p>After the pioneering times of classics like Ultima Online, EverQuest, and Dark Age of Camelot, it was the arrival of Blizzard's <strong>World of Warcraft</strong> that truly turned the interest of many millions of players toward the genre. Until its launch, the most popular games had peaked at between 250,000 and 500,000 subscribers; World of Warcraft immediately attracted millions of fans, eventually reaching its peak of <strong>over 12 million subscribers</strong> in 2010, toward the end of the Wrath of the Lich King expansion.</p>



<p>Between 2005 and 2014, the release schedule saw the debut of many big-budget MMO games made by Western developers: The Matrix Online, The Lord of the Rings Online, Vanguard: Saga of Heroes, Age of Conan, Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning, Champions Online, Star Trek Online, DC Universe Online, RIFT, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Guild Wars 2, The Secret World, Defiance, Neverwinter, Wildstar, and The Elder Scrolls Online.</p>



<p>These projects often leveraged massive entertainment franchises and large budgets to try to carve out a sizable slice of World of Warcraft's dominant market share. RIFT, one of two games on this list that publicly reported having a peak subscriber base of over one million players at some point, reportedly cost $50 million to develop. The other game is Star Wars: The Old Republic, on which Electronic Arts is believed to have invested a budget of around $200 million between the license, highly expensive fully voiced questlines for each character class, and other expenses.</p>



<p>None of these games could quite replicate the level of success seen with World of Warcraft, though. While Guild Wars 2, The Elder Scrolls Online, and (to a lesser extent) Star Wars: The Old Republic and The Lord of the Rings Online are still going strong, Blizzard's game remains the most popular Western MMO even twenty-one years after its release.</p>



<p>More to the point of this article, following that decade of unbridled investment, Western developers have started looking elsewhere to other genres. <strong>After The Elder Scrolls Online, it took seven years before another Western-made MMO launched into the market</strong>. I'm talking about New World, of course. It was the tip of the spear of Amazon's investment into gaming; powered by a massive budget, the game's mere existence drew the eyes of countless long-suffering fans of the genre who had been yearning to play a new triple-A MMO game for a very long time.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/New-World-Key-Art-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>When it launched in late 2021, New World was the first triple-A MMO game made by a Western studio to release in seven years.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>That led to an early success. The game neared a peak of one million concurrent players on Steam, causing long server queues and prompting even Amazon owner Jeff Bezos to <a href="https://wccftech.com/jeff-bezos-praises-amazon-games-for-its-first-success-with-new-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">congratulate the team</a>. New World suffered from a severe lack of content, though, which soon meant players had little to do and stopped logging in.</p>



<p>However, even before the launch of New World, Amazon already had another major project underway: a new MMO based on J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. This game, first <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-working-f2p-lord-of-the-rings-mmorpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in July 2019, was part of Amazon's larger strategy on the IP: Bezos himself, a known fan of LOTR, had previously given Amazon Studios the mandate to acquire the television rights from the Tolkien Estate, which they successfully obtained in November 2017 (to eventually produce Rings of Power). Between the game and the Prime Video show, Amazon hoped to rival and potentially even exceed the Game of Thrones phenomenon.</p>



<p>From the point of view of MMO fans, a new LOTR game by Amazon seemed like the perfect combination to reignite interest in the genre. What better universe than the setting that defined Western fantasy, and what better developer than one with such wealthy coffers? While the 2007 game originally crafted by Turbine has a niche charm that still keeps it alive to this day thanks to its loyal fans, this new project's potential was far grander, even if only to leave behind the dated tech that LOTRO is built upon.</p>



<p>Contractual disputes between Amazon and Tencent <a href="https://wccftech.com/lord-of-the-rings-mmo-canceled-due-to-contractual-dispute-between-tencent-and-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led to the cancellation of the project in April 2021</a>, but that was not the end of the story. Two years later, Amazon <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-once-again-in-production-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was able to reach another agreement with the Embracer Group</a>, restarting development on The Lord of the Rings MMO. At the time, Amazon Games VP Christoph Hartmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-will-be-very-different-from-new-world-will-use-a-next-gen-version-of-its-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a>: </p>



<p><em>We're determined to build the best possible The Lord of the Rings MMO and something that the franchise's millions of fans all over the world will truly love.</em></p>



<p>The goal, they said, was to apply the lessons learned from New World to the new game. But a few weeks ago, Amazon closed down its internal studios, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sunsetting New World</a> (just when it was improving) and effectively <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelling LOTR, too</a>. Just like that, once again, there is no publicly known triple-A Western MMO in development (with the exception of Riot's project, which may or may not ever release, according to the developers themselves).</p>



<p>Die-hard aficionados of massively multiplayer online games took the news hard, and heated discussions surrounding the genre's long-debated final demise, at least as far as Western developers are concerned, filled Reddit, social media, forums, and the like.</p>



<p>Shortly after the news, I started reaching out to several industry veterans to get their perspective on the real state of affairs. In this unique interview, you'll read how each of them responds to the same questions, providing different viewpoints on the issues with their insights.</p>



<p>The first one is <strong>Greg Street</strong>. Street's career in the gaming industry spans nearly thirty years; he has worked on several Age of Empires games, then moved to Blizzard, where he contributed to World of Warcraft at its peak, followed by work on League of Legends and a brief stint on the League of Legends MMO. More recently, he founded Fantastic Pixel Castle to make a new MMO codenamed Ghost, which I <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-mmorpg-qa-ex-wow-designer-opens-up-on-every-aspect-of-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed with him exactly two years ago</a>. However, after getting the initial funding from NetEase, the studio was recently shut down.</p>



<p>The second is <strong>Rich Vogel</strong>. A genre pioneer with his work on the very first 3D graphical MMORPG, Meridian 59, he later worked on Ultima Online, Star Wars Galaxies, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and, for a while, on the MMO-adjacent Fallout 76. Like Street, he founded a new studio, T-Minus Zero Entertainment, with the help of NetEase in 2023, when I <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-qa-neteases-latest-aaa-team-plans-ambitious-things-never-before-seen-in-online-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed him</a>. Like Fantastic Pixel Castle, T-Minus Zero also got its funding cut, although a group of developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-returns-dead-fantastic-pixel-castle-announces-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resurrected it</a>.</p>



<p>The third one is <strong>Scott Hartsman</strong>, who worked as Technical Director on EverQuest I and II and later as Executive Producer on EverQuest II, although most people will know him as the General Manager and CEO of Trion Worlds, the company behind RIFT, Defiance, and other games. More recently, he has served as an advisor to multiple companies, including NCSOFT West. I'd like to thank them all for their willingness to chime in with their thoughts and analysis.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Greg-Street-Ghostcrawler-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Greg Street: 'It's just a really challenging genre to fund, especially in this market where hardly any deals are getting made. Publishers love the thought of a steady income stream for a decade, but they get nervous about the cost to commit to a content-based live service game vs., say, a PvP game. (The PvP games flop all the time as well, but at least the live service commitment is lower.)<br></em><br><em>So, then you play this game of: if you don't innovate enough, you won't attract players who already have an MMO like WoW, Guild Wars, or Final Fantasy, let alone newer players who have rejected the genre as old and stuffy. But if you innovate too much, you may not appeal to the core MMO gamer, and there is no guarantee you will appeal to the newer gamer either.'</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The news that Amazon has cut its entire MMO division, sunsetting New World and cancelling its upcoming project based on The Lord of the Rings, has been taken particularly badly by genre fans, who had hoped that the combination of a big-budget game and a beloved IP might spark a renaissance of sorts. Do you agree that it's a bad omen, even for other industry players who might have been looking into making an MMORPG in the coming years? Are MMORPGs really dead in the Western world? If so, why, and what would it take to revive them?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Greg Street:</strong> I don't think MMOs are dead in the West. It's just a really challenging genre to fund, especially in this market where hardly any deals are getting made. Publishers love the thought of a steady income stream for a decade, but they get nervous about the cost to commit to a content-based live service game vs., say, a PvP game. (The PvP games flop all the time as well, but at least the live service commitment is lower.)</p>



<p>So, then you play this game of: if you don't innovate enough, you won't attract players who already have an MMO like WoW, Guild Wars, or Final Fantasy, let alone newer players who have rejected the genre as old and stuffy. But if you innovate too much, you may not appeal to the core MMO gamer, and there is no guarantee you will appeal to the newer gamer either. The basic problem is that it's hard to start small with an MMO. You have to commit to a lot of systems and content to make it work. There are some notable exceptions, like Warframe, which started small and grew into an MMO.</p>



<p><strong>Rich Vogel:</strong> Over the past few years (<em>ed: following the overstaffing that occurred during the pandemic</em>), the gaming industry has undergone a significant market correction, characterized by large layoffs and project cancellations. Amazon, like other game publishers, needs to evaluate its portfolio and manage its risks. MMORPGs are costly to develop, launch, and support. Their core development team is based in California, which is known as one of the most expensive places in the world for game development. Therefore, given current market conditions, I don't see the cancellation of those MMORPGs as a bad sign. I see it as a strategic business decision to focus on other, less expensive projects with a lower ROI (return on investment) risk.</p>



<p>I don't believe MMORPGs are dead. Several MMORPGs that were developed over 10 years ago still have large communities and maintain a solid, sustainable business model. Good examples include Destiny, Guild Wars, ESO, and Fallout 76. Classics like WOW and SWTOR still have active communities as well. A key reason for their ongoing success is that they have evolved. Destiny, for instance, introduced Strikes, which allow players to complete 20-minute missions and enjoy gaming with friends for short periods, rather than the major time sinks required to keep up with others. Fallout 76 is another great example; it has become much easier to play and progress with friends. The team transformed the game from its original version, which felt like an abandoned world (no NPCs), to what players expected a Fallout game to be (filled with NPCs with quirky dialogue). The TV series also significantly boosted the player base. Now, Fallout 76 <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-update-now-live-adding-the-ghoul-from-the-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is embracing the series and adding similar content to the game</a>. I believe that players will come if an MMORPG is easy to get into, designed as a mid-core game, and offers fun gameplay that does not require a huge time investment.</p>



<p>Look at the recent launch of Dune: Awakening. It attracted many players to try it, but it <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-announces-layoffs-despite-dune-awakening-being-biggest-release-in-32-year-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could not maintain its original player numbers</a> because it was hardcore in terms of PVP and required a significant time investment. In my opinion, it is a hardcore game that heavily draws on the legacy of Anarchy Online, which caused substantial churn in the first six months after launch. But even that game has a solid core base to sustain itself. Many players who previously played RUST are still playing the game.</p>



<p><strong>Scott Hartsman:</strong> Withdrawals and shutdowns like that are certainly not a sign of anything good, and I do know a number of very solid folks over there whose game I would have loved to have seen come out. That said, I wouldn't read too much into it industry-wide. It's really hard to make an MMO or live games focused business scale to the level that it would have had to be in order to be considered a big hit at Amazon Scale. I think you'd most likely have to hit a WoW or LoL level of success to hit that bar. As an industry, if you include all live games, we make about one generational success every 18 months. When their initial games didn't hit that bar, and they didn't see a clear path to that world, we get what just happened. I don't think we should take it as an indicator of anything bad for the kinds of companies that have realistic expectations of what success means in our corner of games.</p>



<p>What we're seeing is more of what you'd call a reversion to the mean, in an environment where the most popular massive and live games being played average 10-13 years old. There's already a ton to play, in a world where these games just don't ever end, and people are still loving games that have existed for a long time. Smaller teams (independent and mid-size) getting entertaining and novel games, being able to take risks -- That's the kind of thing that's going to continue to thrive. It's not that the genre is dead or failing; it's that what success looks like has changed over the years. And the ones pursuing the old definition (massive money in, massive money required out) are going to keep getting bitten.</p>



<p><strong>Asian developers, who continue to invest in the genre, often launch their MMOs on mobile platforms as well. Considering that the mobile segment is the only one showing actual growth in the industry, is that a necessary compromise for big studios to make if they want to invest in a triple-A experience?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Greg Street:</strong> I am more familiar with the market in China than elsewhere in Asia, but they are also worried about player fatigue on MMOs. They still launch more of them than publishers in the West do, but they have been declining (even if gaming as a whole is growing), and there have also been some spectacular failures. Korean publishers still seem to be interested in MMOs, though they are tightening their belts like everyone.</p>



<p><strong>Rich Vogel:</strong> Mobile games in Asia have surpassed PC games in popularity. Most of these titles attract a mid-core audience. I believe that with the latest phones and the shift of console manufacturers toward creating mobile gaming systems, we will see an increase in mobile gaming. This presents a great opportunity for developers to focus on creating multiplayer games for mobile. While Asia has a head start in developing mid-core mobile games, I believe the West will catch up before the end of this decade. I see developers creating AA and AAA mid-core games for all platforms, enabling cross-platform play. I don't see developers focusing solely on PC and console games in the future. Therefore, I can easily imagine developers making MMORPG-lite games for all platforms that appeal to mid-core players.</p>



<p><strong>Scott Hartsman:</strong> I do agree that having some extra advantage is a strategy that'd be wise if someone's going in big like the old ways. Whether that's mobile, simultaneous global on all possible platforms, or some other big lever -- Having something that potentially impactful would certainly be important.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/rich-vogel-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Rich Vogel: 'I believe that games with open-world PVE sandboxes that are heavily system-based and provide more emergent player-driven content are more engaging. I envision a bright future for developers creating a lightweight MMORPG targeting a mid-core audience, featuring an open-world and system-driven design that spans all platforms. I believe a well-made fantasy MMORPG that isn't too hardcore and targets a midcore player base could catch up if it can scale in players and content.'</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Outside of MMORPGs, gamers have been getting more accustomed lately to harsh experiences where you die a lot (Soulslike games) and even possibly lose your hard-earned loot (extraction games). Could that pave the way for more sandbox MMO-like experiences, loosely inspired by Ultima Online and its ilk, which would place less focus on expensive cinematics and storylines and more on emergent, player-driven content? There is one game that has had some success in this niche, albeit on a small scale: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/761890/Albion_Online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Albion Online</a>. Do you think it could be replicated on a larger scale?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Greg Street:</strong> I agree that if MMOs aren't challenging enough, there is less satisfaction in playing and certainly less need to cooperate with other players. I don't personally think pure sandbox is the answer, or you would see the modern attempts be super successful. Too often, the sandbox experience is conflated with either PvP or "go find your own fun." I think the way forward is a hybrid, where you still give players direction and a story, but it requires more strategy on the part of the player than just grinding instances that they have all memorized or doing the same daily quests over and over.</p>



<p><strong>Rich Vogel:</strong> Those games-as-a-service games, like Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders, are PvP games. They hit a different target audience than MMORPGs. PVP players are tolerant of hardcore mechanics. I believe that games with open-world PVE sandboxes that are heavily system-based and provide more emergent player-driven content are more engaging. I envision a bright future for developers creating a lightweight MMORPG targeting a mid-core audience, featuring an open-world and system-driven design that spans all platforms. I believe a well-made fantasy MMORPG that isn't too hardcore and targets a midcore player base could catch up if it can scale in players and content. </p>



<p><strong>Scott Hartsman:</strong> Absolutely. The original sandboxes were well ahead of their time in a lot of ways. Not entirely unlike the way D&amp;D and Magic: TG started out as these niche, nerdy hobbies. Over time, more people get on board with those kinds of experiences. Sandboxes are an entirely different kind of experience, but I'd say they're on a similar track. Theme parks introduced a massive number of people to MMOs and live games in general. Globally playing with friends and making new ones across the world used to be this freakish thing only for the hardest of the hardcore. Now it's just called "games." The step that comes after that is more freedom, more variety. Sandboxes and survival are a huge fit there. More people are absolutely getting more interested in that, as we've seen over the past half-decade or so, both as players and developers, especially across the indie and AA scene.</p>



<p>I'm not an Albion Online expert, but they're clearly succeeding in a niche, and that's fantastic. To me, that's an exciting part of how MMOs have evolved: if you can find a niche and serve it well, you can have a healthy business that runs potentially forever, which is great for both players and developers.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Scott-Hartsman-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Scott Hartsman: 'It's on us to figure out how to deliver the kind of entertainment that an audience large enough to sustain us is looking to play. In some cases, that may mean finding a way to succeed with a smaller audience (i.e. Niche Worlds Cult's Monsters &amp; Memories). In other cases, it may mean adapting the definition of what an MMO is and how we choose to express our worlds and systems. I don't think that's bad for MMOs at all. It's all about finding our players and serving them. After all, they're the ones we're doing this all for.'</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Do you believe there are still enough players potentially interested in an MMORPG, or is that just a pipe dream, given that the older generation has way less time and the new generation is taken in by other genres?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Greg Street:</strong> Our data suggests that Western players are very interested in trying new MMOs, and if you look at some of the launches in the past 5 years, they do try them out. They just don't stick with them long if there isn't enough content, especially at the endgame.</p>



<p><strong>Rich Vogel:</strong> Yes, I believe a large audience is waiting for the right MMORPG to emerge. Consider the millions of players who have played and continue to play WOW, SWTOR, ESO, UO, EverQuest, Fallout 76, and others. The problem is that no publisher is willing to invest the money and take the risk at this time. My instinct tells me that the next major MMORPG will likely come from Asia and/or Europe. If what I have been hearing about GTA 6's features and gameplay is true, it could evolve into an MMORPG, as many of its planned features are typically found in MMORPGs.</p>



<p><strong>Scott Hartsman:</strong> I think it's not as much about having less time, it's more about giving people more control over their time. It's a similar dynamic to what you see with streaming: watch an 8-hour movie? Are you crazy? Watch 16 half-hour episodes in a row? Absolutely! We need to adapt to what people want to engage with.</p>



<p>Contrast that with the original MMOs: a 4-8 hour dungeon crawl, sitting in one place, waiting 15-20 minutes at a time for respawns? Sure, some people might still enjoy that. But that number only goes down over time. Not the number who are interested in being entertained. It's one of the reasons that you see Path of Exile continuing to grow and hit new records a decade after launch, while more classic MMOs stagnated. It did that even with a relatively harsh loss penalty (especially if you're casual). People are okay with challenge, they're even okay with loss, and it turns out they're also phenomenally okay with grinding and random chances on loot. Some of them are even okay with permadeath. A lot of those elements overlap with the harshest of MMOs. People just want the package those elements are wrapped up into to be more aligned with how they're looking to experience them.</p>



<p>It's on us to figure out how to deliver the kind of entertainment that an audience large enough to sustain us is looking to play. In some cases, that may mean finding a way to succeed with a smaller audience (i.e. Niche Worlds Cult's <a href="https://monstersandmemories.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monsters &amp; Memories</a>). In other cases, it may mean adapting the definition of what an MMO is and how we choose to express our worlds and systems. I don't think that's bad for MMOs at all. It's all about finding our players and serving them. After all, they're the ones we're doing this all for.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/esports-gamer-reportedly-leaves-hotel-room-a-horrible-mess-after-two-year-stay-2000654662</link>
            <guid>1387714</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>At a hotel in China that reportedly specializes in catering to gamers and esports competitors, staff claim to have found a disgusting mess left behind by a man who stayed there for two years.</p> <p><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/15653824/grim-video-hotel-guest-leaves-room-stomach-churning-mess/">As first reported by <em>The Sun</em></a> and then spotted by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/guest-from-hell-leaves-hotel-room-a-disgusting-mess-after-two-year-gaming-marathon-3296126/"><em>Dexerto</em></a>, a man believed to be an avid gamer checked out of his hotel room after two years. And during that time, it seems no cleaning staff had ever been allowed in because when employees entered the room, they discovered mountains of trash and a disgusting toilet surrounded by used toilet paper. <em>The Sun</em> reports that staff called the man a “guest from Hell.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Grim vid shows hotel guest from hell leave room in stomach-churning state <a href="https://t.co/GwT0sWJo2d">pic.twitter.com/GwT0sWJo2d</a></p> <p>— The Sun (@TheSun) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSun/status/2001548703564226963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Staff say a thick layer of brown grime had built up on the floor in the hotel room, and the gamer’s sparse furniture was buried in trash that, in some areas, was nearly three feet deep. During his two-year stint in the hotel, employees claim he rarely left the room, with staff telling the outlet that many didn’t know what he looked like because he spent so much time in his disgusting little gamer hole.</p>

 <p><em>The Sun’s</em> report sharing the details and photos of the hard-to-look-at hotel room mess doesn’t provide too many specific details about the location, the guest, or precisely when this happened. But I’ll never forget where I was when I first laid eyes on that toilet.</p> <p>It reportedly took three days to clean out the hotel room after the man left, and it will take more renovations and repairs to make the place rentable once more. The guest apparently still owes 10 days’ worth of fees, amounting to around $400. So the next time you look at your gamer room and feel gross about an empty can or a leftover wrapper, you can at least remind yourself that you aren’t as bad as the person behind this awful gamer-related hotel disaster. But still, pick that crap up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-killed-concord-again-after-fans-tried-to-bring-it-back-to-life/">Before Concord</a>, there was <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-redfall-refunds/">Redfall</a>. Two games that you could argue were similarly fated from the beginning, though at least in the case of Redfall, it got to stick around <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/">for longer than two weeks</a>. Both were major flops for their respective first-party publishers, both games got their respective studios shut down, and both games walked the same line of 'fine and forgettable.'</p>



<p>That's not to say the loss of Arkane Austin and Firewalk Studios is on equal footing. It was far more devastating to see Arkane Austin go, as that was another case of a studio with a talented team that was good at making single-player games <a href="https://wccftech.com/redfall-development-was-reportedly-plagued-by-understaffing-and-confusing-direction/">being forced to change the makeup of their team and try something entirely new</a>. All while still trying to make it an 'Arkane Austin' game, whatever that was supposed to mean in the form of a kind of game Arkane Austin had never made before.</p>



<p>If Arkane Austin had stuck around, the video game industry would be a better place, and for that to have happened, Redfall needed to survive, and potentially, even thrive. According to the game's director, Harvey Smith, there might've been a path to that.</p>



<p>While speaking on the <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console/episodes/harvey-smith-game-director-deus-ex-dishonored-redfall">My Perfect Console podcast</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deus-ex-designer-former-arkane-studio-director-reflects-on-closure-redfall-disastrous-launch">Eurogamer</a>), Smith claimed that if Redfall's final update, <a href="https://wccftech.com/redfall-offline-mode-coming-one-final-update/">which was update 1.4</a>, was the version that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/redfall-dishonored-meets-far-cry/">the studio actually launched with in 2023</a>, then Arkane Austion's fate might've "<em>been a different story</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>It was a shock</em>," Smith began on the decision to close the studio. "<em>It was not a decision I agreed with. I did believe very much in the future of the studio, we were working on something super cool.</em>" Smith goes on to describe the 1.4 update as a "<em>huge upgrade to the game</em>," and said, "<em>If we had launched with that and then built from there it might have been a different story</em>." According to Smith, the 1.4 update was as close as the studio was able to get to their full vision for the game.</p>



<p>Beyond saving Redfall, if Arkane Austin had gotten the chance to stick around, we might've even gotten a Blade Runner game from them, according to Smith. "<em>We were working for a while on a Blade Runner game, which was super exciting to me. What we could have done with Blade Runner...</em>"</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Leaker Wanted To ‘Ruin’ Harry Potter Surprise Because J.K. Rowling’s A Transphobe]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/fortnite-harry-potter-skins-leak-jk-rowling-transphobia-2000654659</link>
            <guid>1387681</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s crossover slop has now spread to engulf the Wizarding World as Epic’s inescapable battle royale is gearing up to add cosmetics based on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-review-harry-potter-rowling-transphobia-1850127849"><i><span>Harry Potter</span></i></a><span>. The game has become such a worldwide phenomenon that there are plenty of leak accounts on social media routinely posting about upcoming collaborations, but the account that leaked the </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>skins had a different motive than simply informing people, as they have stated they “spoiled” the surprise in protest of it inclusion because of </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>author J.K. Rowling’s transphobic rhetoric.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Rowling has been a vocal figurehead in the fight against trans rights </span><a href="https://theweek.com/feature/1020838/jk-rowlings-transphobia-controversy-a-complete-timeline"><span>over the past few years</span></a><span>, and it’s made buying and supporting </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>and its various movies, video games, and spin-offs harder for fans and trans supporters, though it hasn’t stopped </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-harry-potter-slytherin-house-jk-rowling-1850305177"><i><span>Hogwarts Legacy</span></i></a> <span>from racking up over </span><a href="https://x.com/HogwartsLegacy/status/2001336625847243153"><span>40 million sales</span></a><span> since its launch in 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>So when it was confirmed that </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>content was coming to </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>, some fans of both </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> had to wrestle with whether or not they want to support the crossover, or the game more broadly. Fortnite Underground, a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>leaker who </span><a href="https://x.com/FNBRunderground/status/2000583138209100108?s=20"><span>leaked the </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>collaboration</span></a><span>, has posted a lengthy explanation on X about why they chose to post about it ahead of its official announcement, saying they wanted to “ruin” the surprise in an act of protest and that </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>once “stood for what was right.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Most people won’t care,” they wrote. “These Outfits will probably sell pretty well, most people will be happy to see one of their favorite childhood franchises come to the game, and Epic Games and J.K. Rowling will make plenty of money.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But I’m not okay with that, and I hope you’re not okay with it either.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Opinion – I was the leaker who spoiled Harry Potter coming to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fortnite?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Fortnite</a>. Here's why ⬇️ </p> <p>Last year, Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling claimed that Imane Khelif, a female boxer, was actually born as a man. There's just one issue: they weren't. There's been a sentiment around this… <a href="https://t.co/tzKv18jYeK">pic.twitter.com/tzKv18jYeK</a></p> <p>— Fortnite Underground (@FNBRunderground) <a href="https://twitter.com/FNBRunderground/status/2001447614466691338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Fortnite Underground signs off saying they wanted to spoil the collaboration in hopes that “less people would buy it,” but many of the responses argue that any kind of discussion promotes it in some way. Maybe their bringing attention to Rowling’s views could start some much-needed conversations in the </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> community, though you also have a bunch of transphobic nonsense in the replies, with people claiming they’ll buy the </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>cosmetics as a counter protest. Do yourself a favor and avoid the responses to their post.</span></p>

<p>However, she said she was and remains concerned that Tomb Raider could fall apart, given that Perfect Dark was canceled. "I just felt so relieved that I still had Lara, but I also felt really frightened about losing Lara. I'm still frightened of losing Lara," she said.</p><p>Wilton-Regan also shared new insight into what happened with Perfect Dark and how she felt about the game's shuttering and the closure of developer The Initiative.</p><p>"I was as shocked, surprised, and devastated as everyone else was when the funding was pulled, and the studio was closed," Wilton-Regan said. "I did not see it coming. I was absolutely blindsided when the project was defunded."</p><p>She said she was shooting scenes for Perfect Dark in 2023, 2024, and even in 2025 prior to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">Microsoft's announcement in July 2025</a> that the project would not go forward.</p><p>"To my knowledge, we were pretty far along. I'd done entire chapters of this universe." She went on to say that it was her understanding that Microsoft was "really happy" with what the team at The Initiative had turned in up to that point.</p><p>GTA parent company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-almost-got-a-second-chance-at-take-two-report/1100-6534419/" data-ref-id="1100-6534419">Take-Two was said to have been involved in a potential purchase of Perfect Dark</a> to keep the project alive, but a deal did not materialize.</p><p>"That was the day I was really sad because that was the day I lost hope," Wilton-Regan said.</p><p>As for the new Tomb Raider games, a remake of the first game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-remake-will-be-easier-to-cater-for-modern-player-tastes/1100-6537071/" data-ref-id="1100-6537071">Legacy of Atlantis</a> is coming in 2026, with a brand-new game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-actor-shares-her-heartfelt-farewell-to-lara-croft/1100-6536958/" data-ref-id="1100-6536958">Catalyst</a>, set to release in 2027.</p>

Now, as 2025 comes to a close, the studio is reflecting on the momentous launch, which was recently capped off by the title's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">win for Best Multiplayer Game at the 2025 Game Awards</a>, and what's to come in 2026.

Internally, we were having a blast playing it before release, and your reaction to the tech test in April gave us an inkling of what was to come. What we didn't count on was the sheer scale of love and passion you guys were going to show this game."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ARC Raiders - Flickering Flames Winter Event Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Arc Raiders, which was released in late October, became a smash hit right out of the gate, selling millions of copies within days and solidifying itself as one of the most-beloved multiplayer games of the year. Though many multiplayer games enjoy a surge of popularity that eventually relents, Arc Raiders has held on impressively long. As of this writing, its <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam numbers alone</a> are still in the six-digit realm.</p><p>Embark Studios seems intent to keep the ball rolling too. Arc Raiders has received consistent updates, addressing quality-of-life issues while simultaneously rolling out new features and even maps. The latest major update to the game, called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-the-arc-raiders-cold-snap-update/2900-7344/" data-ref-id="2900-7344">Cold Snap</a>, adds a new frosty map condition, in-game event, and more. It's just the first of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-reveals-new-map-in-november-quests-and-more-in-the-months-ahead/1100-6535859/" data-ref-id="1100-6535859">many significant updates</a> which the team has already outlined.</p><p>"We're here for the long term, to build a game that continues to excite and surprise - we hope you stick around for the journey," reads the blog post. In addition, Embark is doling out a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-has-free-raider-tokens-for-you-right-now/1100-6537077/" data-ref-id="1100-6537077">free 1,000 Raider tokens</a>, an in-game currency, to anyone who plays the Winter event before it ends on January 13th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Snow is falling, the chimney fire is blazing, and hot cocoa is brewing. Maybe that's happening for real in your life, or maybe you live in Florida like me and have to imagine these nice Winter scenarios because they don't exist here. Nonetheless, it's Winter here in the U.S., and that means it's time for the 2025 Steam Winter Sale, which went live today and lasts through January 5.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the sale just began, we're already seeing some deep discounts on some of 2025's biggest and best games. While you're free to peruse the sale yourself, your wallet might be afraid. It's dangerous to go alone, though, so pull up the Steam storefront with this handy dandy round-up while you shop.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/flotsam-impressions-review-city-builder/</link>
            <guid>1387657</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>A survival city-builder in broadly the same vein as stuff like <em>Frostpunk </em>and <em>Ixion</em>, <em>Flotsam</em> is a game set at the end of the world that, thanks to its vibrant art style and optimistic outlooks, actually feels more like the start of the world instead.</p><p>You play as a tug boat that poots around a flooded world, ala <em>Waterworld</em>, and as you go--on a kind of strategic overworld map--you need to scrounge for resources and pick up survivors. Zoom in, though, and the game becomes a city-builder, where you can attach buildings to your boat and use those resources to craft stuff, build <em>more </em>buildings and keep everyone happy by giving them nicer houses and places to hang out.</p><p>The cheery, hand-crafted visuals are a joy to be around. For an apocalyptic game, <em>Flotsam</em>'s glass is very much half-full, its flooded wastes featuring crystal-blue oceans, storybook islands and fantastic character art, while the survivor's chatter is mostly interested in everyone working together to build something new and communal from the wreckage. To give you an idea of just how cheery things are, here's the game's website:</p><blockquote>The world of Flotsam is a colorful and cheerful place. It’s about going on adventures, seeing the world and cleaning it up as you go. The sun is shining, the sky is clear and the ocean is calm… mostly at least.</blockquote><p>Does this change the way the game plays? Not really. Does it dictate the way I feel while playing it? Absolutely. As I've explained<a href="https://aftermath.site/town-to-city-pc-builder-cozy-impressions-review/"> <u>in my impressions of <em>Town To City</em></u></a>, I like these games because they let me build stuff, and I hate the stresses so many of them bring along for the ride. <em>Flotsam</em> has those stresses--you need to keep everyone fed and supplied with fresh water--but meeting those needs is so straightforward, and everyone looks and works so happily while they're in danger, that it never feels like a <em>crisis</em>.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/owkx83gyETY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Flotsam - Official Version 1.0 Launch Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>I should note that this isn't really a city-builder in the traditional sense. While you are definitely building a settlement around your boat, and it needs walkways and power and all that stuff, the overworld navigation is a place you spend a <em>lot </em>of time exploring, finding resources and picking up survivors. What's cool is that the two are linked; you cruise around a map screen where everything is abstract, but when you find something to explore, the view zooms into the boat-scaled view, and the objects that appeared as points on the map are now islands represented off the stern of your town, on which you can see your survivors clambering over and harvesting supplies.</p><p><em>Flotsam </em>has a more involved supply chain and production management slant than many of its peers, which I really enjoyed; the loop of harvesting raw resources from the overworld, then using your city to refine them and turn them first into processed resources, then <em>things</em>, is always satisfying. There are a ton of different materials and items, some you can only get by scrounging, others that can be grown and others that you have to craft, and it's an interesting challenge having to prioritise your survivors and various buildings to churn out exactly the things you need at any given time.</p><p>I said earlier in the year<a href="https://aftermath.site/4x-game-climate-capitalism-civilization-future/"> <u>that I'm tired of apocalyptic futures where humanity is resigned to living off scraps</u></a>, where the overriding themes are those of defeat and despair. <em>Flotsam's</em> optimism and resolve to build something <em>new</em> from the ashes are exactly what I was talking about; the fact it's a game where you're directly responsible for the building only makes it better.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/4x-game-climate-capitalism-civilization-future/"><div><p>Give Me A Future Worth Fighting For - Aftermath</p><p>I want to build a better world, not live in the ruins</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The developer behind the slot machine-based indie game <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> has asked fans not to buy it on Xbox, and instead told <em>Kotaku</em> he wants people to<a href="https://kotaku.com/no-games-for-genocide-xbox-microsoft-boycott-palestine-2000650175"> boycott Microsoft due to the company continuing to support Israel</a> in its violent attacks against Palestine and its people.</p> <p>On December 18, <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> creator Dan DiIorio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:n52jsewxgg2zp65ggprctppx/post/3mabikxrjz22q?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fkotaku.com%252Fwp%252Fwp-admin%252Fpost.php">reshared a post</a> about investigative games reporting outlet <em>People Make Games</em> boycotting Xbox due to its involvement in the Israel-Palestine conflict. The dev further added that he didn’t want people to buy the slot machine game on Xbox.</p>

 <p>“Please do not purchase<em> Luck Be a Landlord</em> on Xbox,” posted DiIorio. “I will be making a $10,000 donation to The Palestine Children’s Relief Fund to (hopefully) help offset the revenue the game has generated for Microsoft.”</p>   <p>Originally released in 2023, <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> is a roguelike slot machine game that helped inspire the creation of <em>Balatro</em>. In the game, players try to pay their rent using a slot machine that can be upgraded and tweaked. <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> first launched in 2023 on PC but was ported to consoles earlier this year.</p> <div id=":5b"> <p>“I would love for everyone to give what they can to <a href="https://nogamesforgenocide.com/">The Palestine Children’s Relief Fund</a>, whether they purchased the game on Xbox or not,” DiIorio told <em>Kotaku</em> via email.&nbsp; “I also encourage those with Game Pass subscriptions to cancel them.”</p> <p>DiIorio isn’t the first indie developer to publicly distance themselves from Xbox and vocally support the ongoing and growing boycott against the company. In April, the developers behind <em>Tenderfoot Tactics&nbsp;</em>pulled the game from the Xbox store in solidarity with the BDS campaign against Israel.</p> <p>“We hope that Microsoft will listen to the voices of their workers and customers and stop all business with the criminal Israeli military, which we have watched conduct an open genocide in Gaza over the last 18 months,” said one developer at the time on social media <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indie-developer-removes-their-game-from-xbox-stores-in-solidarity-with-pro-palestine-boycott">as reported by <em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun.</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>The boycott against Israel has continued to cause problems for Xbox and will likely do so moving forward into 2026.</p> </div>

              <p><span>Last year, </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>developer Naughty Dog released a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-grounded-making-of-documentary-1851196816"><span>documentary on the making of the game’s 2020 sequel</span></a><span> that attempted to discuss the studio’s reported problems with overwork and crunch. The video ended on a note indicating that things had improved, but it sounds like the team is facing a similar struggle with its upcoming PS5 game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-last-of-us-naughty-dog-1851721022"><i><span>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</span></i></a><span>.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic"><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i></a><span> reports that Naughty Dog has had developers working mandatory overtime as it races to complete a demo of the sci-fi action game for Sony to review, despite a planned release date that’s still years away.</span></p> <p><span>The mandatory overtime reportedly began in October, with staff being asked to work a minimum of eight extra hours a week and logging them on an internal spreadsheet. This was in an effort to get the game’s production back on track after several missed deadlines, though developers were also told not to work more than 60 hours a week.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>During this period, a new mandatory return-to-office order was also pushed through, requiring everyone to be onsite at the Santa Monica studio five days a week, rather than the typical three. According to </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span>’s sources, employees had to find “alternative care arrangements” for children and pets.</span></p>

 <p><span>This follows older reports that Naughty Dog had hired a new team of producers specifically meant to help alleviate the team’s crunch problems. But according to </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span>, several of them have already left the company. While select members of the team reportedly worked overtime to finish </span><i><span>Intergalactic</span></i><span>’s debut trailer back in 2024, this new overtime requirement has applied to “most” of the staff.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Management reportedly told workers the company will return to its usual three-day in-office requirement in January, with a more detailed breakdown coming after the team returns from holiday break. The </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span> story signs off with an ironic anecdote, saying the team was given metal coins to commemorate the game’s ongoing development, which included text of a quote from the game, “The suffering of generations must be endured to achieve our divine end.”</span></p> <p><span>Reports of Naughty Dog crunching date back years, with </span><i><span>The Last of Us Part II</span></i><span>’s development being </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/as-naughty-dog-crunches-on-the-last-of-us-ii-developer-1842289962"><span>one of the most notorious</span></a><span>. Back in 2023, Naughty Dog </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/naughty-dog-ps5-playstation-sony-last-us-part-3-layoffs-1850893794"><span>cut dozens of contractors</span></a><span> roughly a year before </span><i><span>Intergalactic </span></i><span>was announced at the 2024 Game Awards.</span></p>

<p>Naughty Dog is forcing the developers working on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet to work overtime. This, according to a new report from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier.</p>



<p>In a story published on Thursday afternoon, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NjA4NTY0MSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NjkwNDQxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0hDRFNLR0lGUEUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.jGluGdyZVa1EEBKJKLlY2aRo0tCwewmOk2TBd_9y2Iw&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Schreier states</a> that the studio behind games like The Last of Us and Uncharted has <strong>“been pushing its staff to work long hours to get ready for an upcoming review of the demo by its parent company.”</strong></p>







<p>It’s said that requests began in October for staff to work at least eight extra hours per week with it being logged via spreadsheet. This was done to make up for time lost due to missed deadlines.</p>



<p><strong>“The employees were instructed not to work more than 60 hours a week,” </strong>Schreier writes. <strong>“Staff were also told to return to the office five days a week for this period, up from three previously, sending some employees scrambling to find alternative care arrangements for children and pets.”</strong></p>



<p>Those who spoke to Schreier under the condition of anonymity are worried that, if there’s already mandatory overtime over 18 months away from release, it might get worse in the coming months. As of writing, Intergalactic is scheduled to release in mid-2027. </p>



<p>Sony and Naughty Dog also declined to comment on the claims.</p>

                <p>A new report claims that Naughty Dog recently mandated that workers return to the office five days per week--up from three--and had been pushing staff to work "long hours" to get a demo of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> ready to show off to Sony higher-ups.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NjA4NTY0MSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NjkwNDQxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0hDRFNLR0lGUEUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.jGluGdyZVa1EEBKJKLlY2aRo0tCwewmOk2TBd_9y2Iw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg report</a> said that beginning in late October, Naughty Dog asked staff to work "a minimum of eight extra hours a week" and document their overtime in a spreadsheet. "This overtime period was an attempt to get the production back on track after several missed deadlines," the report said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItkWqN3nMHE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ItkWqN3nMHE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Workers were told to not work more than 60 hours per week, the report said. The return-to-office mandate was disruptive to some workers who reportedly had to find cover for childcare and their pets. The report added that the "mandated overtime" period wrapped up this week with the completion of the demo.</p><p>Sony and Naughty Dog declined to comment when approached by Bloomberg.</p><p>The report added that Naughty Dog established a new team of producers in 2021 with the directive of helping cut back on instances of extended overtime, or crunch. "Many" of these people have since left the company, the report said.</p><p>Finally, the report said Naughty Dog is aiming to release Intergalactic in mid-2027, and that workers are fearful that "overtime requirements will get worse" as the game's release draws closer.</p><p>On the topic of developers at Naughty Dog crunching, studio head Neil Druckmann said in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-2-director-on-crunch-theyre-gonna-w/1100-6478208/" data-ref-id="1100-6478208">June 2020 interview</a> with GQ, "They're gonna work very hard. We need to put some guardrails [in] so they don't injure themselves, but I don't think we could prevent them from working hard and still make the kind of games we make."</p><p>Naughty Dog co-president Evan Wells said in 2021 that its workers want to work more than 40 hours per week. Keeping people in the office only 40 hours a week "would frustrate people to no end," he said, adding that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-execs-push-back-against-unions-say-they-may-not-solve-crunch/1100-6495708/" data-ref-id="1100-6495708">unionization won't help.</a></p><p>Intergalactic is a new IP from Naughty Dog, which is notable given the company has mostly worked on sequels to its Uncharted and The Last of Us series for the past two decades. The sci-fi game aims to be Naughty Dog's "wildest, most creative story yet," and focuses on the character Jordan A. Mun, a bounty hunter who becomes stranded on a planet called Sempiria.</p><p>Naughty Dog has multiple internal development teams, and a second team could be working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">The Last of Us: Part III. </a></p>

But that's not all there is to care about in Fortnite's latest update--we've also got a pair of new sets of quests that reward XP, and an additional free cosmetic that must be earned by completing a specific one of those new quests. Let's take a look at what we've got here.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Winterfest_2025_quests">Winterfest 2025 quests</a><ul><li><a href="#Drop_1">Drop 1</a><ul><li><a href="#Collect_a_Perfect_Gift_from_a_chest">Collect a Perfect Gift from a chest</a></li><li><a href="#Bring_a_Perfect_Gift_to_any_character">Bring a Perfect Gift to any character</a></li><li><a href="#Damage_Yule_Trooper_or_any_other_boss__500_points_">Damage Yule Trooper or any other boss (500 points)</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Squad_Up__quests">Squad Up! quests</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Winterfest_2025_quests">Winterfest 2025 quests</h2><p>The first of these new quests sets, listed under Winterfest in your quest log, are for Battle Royale. There are four time-gated groups of this set of quests--the first group is available now, and the rest will be added every two days until they're all there. Completing a quest awards 12K XP each, and there may be a reward at the end of the questline--but we don't know for sure yet. These quests expire when Winterfest ends on January 5.</p><h3 id="Drop_1">Drop 1</h3><h4 id="Collect_a_Perfect_Gift_from_a_chest">Collect a Perfect Gift from a chest</h4><p>Every chest you open during Winterfest has a change to drop an item called Perfect Gift, which triggers a quest to deliver it to any non-hostile NPC on the map within five minutes. But for this quest, you just have to collect the item. Fortunately, the Perfect Gift does not require one of your inventory slots.</p><h4 id="Bring_a_Perfect_Gift_to_any_character">Bring a Perfect Gift to any character</h4><p>This quest requires you deliver one of these Perfect Gifts to an NPC. They all work, so pick whichever is most convenient.</p><h4 id="Damage_Yule_Trooper_or_any_other_boss__500_points_">Damage Yule Trooper or any other boss (500 points)</h4><p>You will need to cause 500 points of damage to any boss NPC for this one--and we mean the NPCs specifically. Players who have used a boss token to disguise themselves as bosses don't count for this.</p><h2 id="Squad_Up__quests">Squad Up! quests</h2><p>In addition to the main Winterfest quests, there's an additional set of very simple quests that simply require you to find Shiny Llamas in the Squads version of Battle Royale, Reload, OG, or Blitz. These Shiny Llamas have a random chance to drop any time you open a rare chest or supply drop, or when you defeat an enemy player or NPC. You'll receive 12K XP for every 100 of them that you collect, until you've collected 1,000 of them. You won't have to compete with your teammates for them, though, because any Shiny Llamas collected by any squad member counts for all four of you.</p><p>Which is good, because there's also a cosmetic reward for these quests. Collecting 400 of these Shiny Llamas will earn you the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=11838" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Starbrite Slasher pickaxe</a>, which has been sitting in the Fortnite game files collecting dust for nearly two years. You'll want to pay particular attention to this quest if you purchased the Lego starter pack that includes the Brite Agent skin, since this is the first time it's been possible to get the pickaxe that belongs to her set.</p>

I've heard developers who aren't AI enthusiasts express frustration over the backlash. They argue his comments about how generative AI can be used seem reasonable.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I see their point. But watching the reaction from developers I see something more powerful: a backlash not only over the multi-faceted issues with generative AI, but to how leaders like Vincke are instituting the tech.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/how-poor-leadership-slows-down-game-development" target="_self" data-discover="true">How poor leadership slows down game development</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Developers are tired of being told they need to use generative AI">Developers are tired of being told they need to use generative AI</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Across several interviews, Vincke has presented some interesting use-cases for generative AI, positioning some of its implementation as a new tech tool and not a time-saver.

Vincke said workers at the studio are "more or less OK" with the way it's being used—but Bloomberg reports that there are developers inside Larian who've pushed back against the use of generative AI. Former employees have </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/GangstHannah/status/2000958281917866440?s=20">validated</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> this account in posts on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g">Bluesky</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This disconnect is what's driving anger among professionals.

Resisting these mandates for ethical or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/devs-are-more-worried-than-ever-that-generative-ai-will-lower-the-quality-of-games">quality&nbsp;</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">concerns is sometimes ill-received by management.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Workers are then placed between a rock and a hard place. They could quit, but then they'd be looking for work in a terrible hiring environment, competing with their peers for a scant number of positions, many at companies also pushing for the use of generative AI. So they bite their tongue, grind their teeth, and muddle through, trying to make the most of a frustrating position.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many developers are put in this position by leaders who either haven't worked on a game for years or who come from strictly from an executive background. They are forced to watch as people who don't have to use these tools for complex tasks decide their fate. Vincke is the rare CEO who directs his company's games, but even with that perspective, his position as CEO fundamentally means he faces different day-to-day complexities than his employees.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And with the power to hire—and fire—workers, saying "no" to his demands is rather difficult. That became more clear as the game writing community finally spoke out about Larian's hiring practices.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Larian's hiring practices put pressure on some new hires">Larian's hiring practices put pressure on some new hires</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Larian, to its credit, is an international company that considers employees from all over the world, but many of its job descriptions requiring workers be on-site.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On social media, developers raised the idea that if you land a job with Larian—a celebrated studio behind one of the game industry's most beloved single-player titles—you may be putting a lot on the line to land your dream job. If it doesn't work out, you're not just out looking for a new gig, you can be miles away from home, in a foreign country, staring down the barrel of a relocation process that could cost thousands of dollars.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Its influence was made clear to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/unburntwitch.com/post/3ma4p47aqts22">a number</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/damonreece.com/post/3ma4pnjx2mc22">game writers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/acampwriting.com/post/3ma4vrws5a22a">narrative designers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> who came forward on social media about their alleged experience interviewing with the company. They described a 6-month long hiring process requiring 12 interviews and an unpaid writing test where they needed to not just prove their writing skills but also show they could implement an in-game quest (some writers I've spoken with at game industry events have said discontent over these tests has spread privately for months).</span></p><p>Image via Larian Studios</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Imagine being a writer who jumps through all those hoops, only to arrive at the company and see that leadership wants you to use generative AI to create placeholder text, something usually marked by phrases like "TKTK,""[INSERTPLACEHOLDERHERE]," or "FFFFFFFFFF" to ensure it's fixed before the game ships. How comfortable would you be pushing back against that?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even if you aren't an international hire, Larian's ability to implement such a strenuous test shows the strength it can exert over workers. And even if the game industry hadn't spent 3 years laying off thousands of developers, its reputation would make it a highly desirable place to work.

              <p>Developer Mark Ffrench has carved out something of a unique niche on Steam, regularly releasing fill-a-pix logic puzzle games of enormous scale and surprising depth. Among others in 2024 there was <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2024/11/proverbs/"><em>Proverbs</em></a>, a wall-sized puzzle based on Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s painting Netherlandish Proverbs, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3380760/2024_Mosaic_Retrospective/"><em>2024: Mosaic Retrospective</em></a>, which contained dozens of interlocking images recalling major events from the whole year. Following&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3444650/Mosaic_of_the_Strange/"><em>Mosaic of the Pharaohs</em></a> earlier this year, we now have the most elaborate entry yet:&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3444650/Mosaic_of_the_Strange/"><em>Mosaic of the Strange</em></a>—a game that combines the same logic puzzle conceit with a pixelated point-n-click adventure.</p> <p>Right, describing a logic puzzle is always the most stultifying and joy-destroying process, so please bear with me for a moment before we get back to the fun stuff:</p> <p>To get everyone on the same page, fill-a-pix is one of the many logic puzzle types to come from puzzle maestros <a href="https://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx">Conceptis</a>, where you fill in a grid based on&nbsp;<em>Minesweeper</em> rules. Each number in the grid indicates the number of cells that should be shaded in the three-by-three grid of which it sits in the center. So, a “6” on the side of a puzzle means all six cells are shaded, while a “0” in the middle means you can eliminate its nine cells from any overlapping clues. The more you play, the more familiar you become with certain patterns, such as the consequences of having a “6” and a “3” in two adjacent cells (you have to shade the three cells to the left of the 6, and eliminate the three to the right of the 3), and so many more besides. RIGHT, OK, WE’RE DONE.</p>

  <p>The way Ffrench implements this is by creating enormous mosaics that are segmented into individual puzzles, and rewarding completion of most with little pop-up information. In&nbsp;<em>Proverbs</em> it was details on each of the proverbs depicted in the vast painting. In&nbsp;<em>2024</em> it was details of the events of that year. But in&nbsp;<em>Mosaic of the Strange</em>, it’s all rather different. The details that pop up are documents, mostly about conspiratorial mysteries, because in this game you’re playing as FBI agents investigating a murder.</p>

 <p>Agents Cullen and Brady are called in after a body is found in gruesome condition, with the circumstances of the man’s death a crazed muddle of mysteries. And rather than solving multiple puzzles on a single wall, here the process of completing the grids is how you’re exploring the items in the rooms. OK, yes, it’s spurious. You’re not actually playing a point-n-click in the sense that you’re actually deducing anything, but with each item solved you gain a document pertaining to a peculiar subject, perhaps cryptids or UFOs or mysterious disappearances from lonely lighthouses, which all add up to evidence to stick up on the pinboard in your office. You also visit the coroner, the murder victim’s apartment, and elsewhere, with a total of 144 puzzles and documents to find.</p>

 <p>Various items prompt conversations between the characters, which makes what would otherwise be a more sterile puzzle game feel much more alive and in-depth, and the result is something absorbing both in narrative and in puzzling. Ffrench has nailed the way in which he delivers the challenges, with smart, context-sensitive hints if you want them, and a prompt that will pop up if you’ve gone too horribly wrong without noticing. Also, in this game, you can hugely change the difficulty of the puzzles in a way that I adore.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654620" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654620"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654620">© Mark Ffrench / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You can make things so simple that you’re basically painting by numbers, or in increments make it so challenging that every puzzle is a head-scratching ordeal on the scale of <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2020/02/tametsi/"><em>Tametsi</em></a>. I’ve mostly settled on one notch down from the latter, but it’s fun to scale it up to the hardest point and really have to scour for every super-complex pattern of numbers. Even better, you can change that difficulty at any point, midway through solving any grid.</p> <p>OK, I completely nerded out there, but trust me, you’ve never played anything like&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3444650/Mosaic_of_the_Strange/"><em>Mosaic of the Strange</em></a>, and you’ll get&nbsp;<em>hours</em> of entertainment for your $12. I can’t wait to see what Ffrench does next, especially if these games continue to evolve in their current direction.</p>
