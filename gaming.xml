            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/26/new-fortnite-x-the-walking-dead-collab-lets-you-create-your-own-zombie-filled-islands/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Walking Dead is coming back to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> in a new and creative way, with a bunch of assets and content from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-walking-dead">The Walking Dead Universe</a> added to Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) and Fortnite Creative. This means you’ll be able to drop into the editing tools and quickly cook up a Zombie-filled TWD-themed island of your own.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Walking Dead Universe Lurches into UEFN and Fortnite Creative" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_sB3hyiahKE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s a bunch of different elements that you’ll be able to draw upon for your creations. It starts with the Walker NPC template for UEFN, a slow and shambling enemy that just wants to chomp on people, giving damage-over-time and eventual death. They can be grouped into hordes and can also smash through breakable environmental props.</p>
<p>This collaboration will also add Negan to Fortnite, both as a playable character for purchase from 4th April, and as an NPC with an update on 8th April. The Shiva Shotgun and Negan’s iconic spiked bat, Lucille, are also available.</p>
<p>JAHBSKD</p>

<p>But you don’t want to just drop these into basic Fortnite levels. The Prison Starter Island Template gives a basic prison layout to then populate and customise, and there’s also eight prison-themed Prefabs that can be placed in worlds. It can all be made to look extra TWD-like with a Heavy Linework shader to get that graphic novel feel.</p>
<p>Alongside all the other tools available in UEFN, you can create whatever kind of experience you want with this. Epic suggest survival RPGs, prison escapes and FFA shoot ’em ups, but I reckon a zombie baseball game would be a good shout.</p>
<p>Any creations can be published from 16th May via the Creator Portal, and can then potentially be found in the TWDU section of Discover, which will be present for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/the-walking-dead-universe-lurches-into-uefn-and-fortnite-creative?team=personal">Head to the announcement blog post</a> for more details.</p>
<p>In other Fortnite-ly news, people that want to relive the early days of Fortnite BR can continue to do so with Fortnite OG, which has now moved on to <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-og-makes-a-lucky-landing-into-season-3">Chapter 1 Season 3</a>. This brings back Lucky Landing and features a meteor on a collision course with the original island.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Event That Started It All - Fortnite OG Season 3 Launches March 25" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cvuJtEhV4Nc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A bit like rewatching a favourite TV show, we all know what happens next, but it’s nice to revisit, isn’t it? The huge Team Deathmath mode OG 50v50 is also coming back for a limited time, so get into that while you can.</p>

			<p>It looks like Microsoft's big decision to switch to a multiplatform policy could start paying dividends soon if the PlayStation Store pre-order charts are to be believed. As <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-is-topping-the-pre-order-charts-on-the-playstation-store-with-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-and-forza-horizon-5.1144932/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by ResetEra user Red Kong XIX, two games that are due to launch in April, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Forza Horizon 5, are taking the top spots across various countries with their various editions.</p>
<p><em><strong>United States</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #2</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #3, #4, #14</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Canada</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #2</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #3, #4, #12</em></p>
<p><em><strong>United Kingdom</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #2</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #3, #5, #12</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Germany</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #2</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #3, #4, #17</em></p>
<p><em><strong>France</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #3, #4</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #1, #2, #11</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Italy</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #3</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #2, #5, #22</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Spain</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #2, #4</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #1, #3, #13</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Portugal</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #4</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #2, #3, #11</em></p>
<p>It seems like PlayStation users are eager to get their hands on two of the best Microsoft games released in the past few years. Forza Horizon 5 might be the most surprising since it's now nearly four years old. Still, it's arguably the finest open world racing game ever made, having won several Game of the Year awards in 2021. Here on Wccftech, the game earned a 9.5/10 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Wray's review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Let's keep it simple. Forza Horizon 5 is a fantastic game. It's outstanding, and I can unashamedly say that if it's not my favorite, it's in my top five games of the year. I recommend it for anybody and everybody.</em></p>
<p>When the game launches on PS5 on April 29, all users in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-40-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40-million-strong community</a> will be able to access the new Horizon Realms update that allows drivers to relive the post-launch Evolving World updates at their leisure.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will debut twelve days earlier despite being much more recent. Still, it's just every bit as great as Forza Horizon 5 in its own genre, as I outlined in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my 9/10 review of the PC version</a>:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>It is perhaps a bit ironic that both games will be played best on consoles on Sony's PlayStation 5 Pro, but that's entirely on Microsoft for choosing not to make another mid-generation console refresh like they did with the Xbox One X.</p>
<p>Anyway, as The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-playstation-5-more-xbox-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a>, this is just the beginning for PlayStation and Nintendo Switch users. Microsoft-owned studios are expected to release many more titles on 'rival' consoles throughout the year, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibly Bethesda's Starfield</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Obsidian's Avowed</a>, and more.</p>

<p>Minecraft’s ‘A Minecraft Movie’ live event has arrived, and players can hang out with cast members like Steve, Garrett, Henry, Natalie and Dawn in the game today.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-a-minecraft-movie-live-event-start-and-end">When Does A Minecraft Movie Live Event Start and End?</h2>



<p>A Minecraft Movie live event was released on March 25 at 2:30 PM PT and will last until April 7 at 2 PM PT. Players can find the live event through the main menu of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. If it is not visible, you need to update to the latest version of the game. When you load up the limited-time event, will Steve be waiting to take you on your new adventure?&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-live-event-mini-games">A Minecraft Movie Live Event Mini-Games</h2>



<p>A Minecraft Movie live event features three mini-games where players interact with a different cast member for each new activity. Like the movie, players will fight against the Piglins and defend the Midport Village.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-mining-with-henry">Mining With Henry</h3>



<p>Henry will require the players’ help with some good old mining for resources to build defences and weapons. Players will meet Henry at the Mineshaft and must dig for resources while defending themselves from the pesky Pilgins.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-protecting-the-payloads-with-natalie-and-dawn">Protecting the Payloads with Natalie and Dawn</h3>



<p>In this Minecraft Movie live event, mini-game players will help Natalie and Dawn protect their resources from waves of Pilgins while escorting transport carriages.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-defending-the-walls-with-garrett-nbsp">Defending the Walls with Garrett&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Three huge Nether portals have opened at the outskirts of the village, and hordes of Pilgins are rushing in to wreak destruction. Garrett and the players must take these Pilgins head-on while showcasing their archery skills. However, you are not the only one shooting projectiles.&nbsp;</p>

<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>
</figure>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-s-midport-village">A Minecraft Movie’s Midport Village</h2>



<p>The event also includes a new settlement, the Midport Village, which features shops, unique structures, adorable mobs, and hidden items. Thus, players have much more to do than fight in this Minecraft movie live event.&nbsp;Some of these items will be helpful when faced against the Pilgins. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-minecraft-yearn-cape">Minecraft Yearn Cape</h3>



<p>During the battle for Midport Village, players will receive six challenges, and after completing them, they will be rewarded with the Yearn cape. The Yearn cape features the “stunning art of a mineshaft inspired by Steve’s longing for the mines.”&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-minecraft-home-and-menace-capes">Minecraft Home and Menace Capes</h3>



<p>On the other hand, the Home and Menace Capes can be claimed by “watching a Minecraft creator for at least 3 minutes on Twitch and TikTok, respectively.” Players will receive a 5×5 redemption code for two capes, one inspired by Steve’s love for the mines and the other by Nether portal’s aura of danger.</p>



<p>All three capes will also be available in Bedrock and Java Edition, provided players use the same account on both editions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The First Berserker Khazan is a Soulslike, which means it’s difficult. Powerful mobs, even more deadly bosses, respawning enemies, and limited health. The genre isn’t for everyone, and despite the incredible aesthetic of Khazan, people want to know how difficult Neople’s Souslike is.</p>



<p>It took a long time for the Souls genre to win me over. I owned Demon’s Souls on day one, and hated it—now I love it. The unrelenting difficulty and intensity of boss fights aren’t for everyone. But darn it if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> isn’t worth it for its aesthetic alone!</p>



<p>If you need comfort more than classy visuals, here’s everything you need to know about The First Berserker Khazan’s difficulty.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-difficulty-settings-in-the-first-berserker-khazan">Are There Difficulty Settings in The First Berserker Khazan?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A welcome inclusion. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, The First Berserker Khazan has difficulty settings, allowing players to choose between Easy mode and Normal.</strong></p>



<p>After my first death to <a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Khazan</a>‘s first major boss fight, I was presented with the screenshot above (I’m not sure if it’s the same for everyone). You can see two different settings laid out with easy-to-read descriptions, which you can check out here:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Easy: </strong>“This difficulty is intended for players who are unfamiliar with action games.”</li>



<li><strong>Normal:</strong> “This difficulty is intended for players who are familiar with action games and enjoy the challenge and sense of achievement that the genre is known for.”</li>
</ul>



<p>For the longest time, Soulslikes have avoided optional difficulty settings like the plague. I don’t know if it’s a pride thing or if it’s the notion of toughness that comes with the territory of playing a Souls title. But companies are starting to ease up on the “it’s this or nothing” approach.</p>



<p>2024’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-shift-up-record-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade</a> is a recent example of a Soulslike having distinct difficulty settings. Thankfully, The First Berserker Khazan has followed suit with its <strong>Easy </strong>and <strong>Normal </strong>options.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-difficulty-should-you-play-on-in-the-first-beserker-khazan">Which Difficulty Should You Play on in The First Beserker Khazan?</h2>



<p><strong>Your The First Berserker Khazan difficulty decision rests on whether you want to enjoy the story or relish the challenge of combat.</strong></p>



<p>The First Berserker’s premise is fascinating, so it makes sense if you’re in it for Khazan’s journey. If constantly dying frustrates you and you want to progress the narrative, <strong>I recommend picking Easy</strong>.</p>



<p>However, if you enjoy combat, are happy to keep dying to bosses and learn their movesets in the hope of overcoming the imperious foe, <strong>stick with Normal</strong>. I play on Normal, I enjoy seeing the game over screen constantly, but I also live for the feeling of satisfaction when I finally beat a boss on my 153rd attempt.</p>

It could easily go down as the best Souslike of the year, but what do you think? Are better titles set to arrive in 2025? Let us know.</p>

If you've been collecting for a while, it might not surprise you that it's been a fairly chaotic launch window though, with scalpers and store issues already reportedly plaguing the new set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fully unveiled on March 24, Scarlet &amp; Violet - Destined Rivals is set to launch starting on May 30, 2025. A few factors make this a particularly sought-after set. First, it marks the return of Trainer's Pokémon cards. Those old enough to remember <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/1jjbcba/mom_says_we_have_destined_rivals_at_home/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vintage Trainer's Pokémon cards</a>, like Brock's Sandslash or Rocket's Mewtwo, should take a moment to stretch their back and adjust their posture before expressing excitement for this returning archetype.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They're popular ways of tying beloved Trainers into the actual Pokémon cards in cool ways. Additionally, Destined Rivals is also centered around Team Rocket, the bad-team faction of Pokémon's first generation. Suffice to say, much like Prismatic Evolutions and its Eevee-lutions earlier this year, Destined Rivals has the makings of a very popular set.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Destined Rivals Pokémon Center Elite Trainer Box Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, when the pre-orders went live, it should be little surprise that frustration quickly ensued. People trying to get into the Pokémon Center website to buy an Elite Trainer Box, a themed box of packs and other niceties that's a common pick-up for people looking to crack into a set, were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/1jiwtc5/mood/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">left staring in from the outside</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, still unsurprisingly, scalpers immediately hit online auctions like eBay with their ETB pre-orders.

            <p>RPG maker Atlus has become celebrated for the unique UI designs in its games, from the Persona series to the more recent fantasy epic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>.</p>
<p>I spoke with Metaphor's UI designer Koji Ise at this year's Game Developers Conference (GDC) to discuss the creation of the game's UI and how it conveys a sense of "cool".</p>
<p>"There are various ways of interpreting cool," said Ise. "But if we're simply looking at the aesthetics, it should be pretty simple and easy for designers to create that. The important part is to tie [the UI] in with the tone of the game and weave that into the game narrative. Being able to tie all that together with the game itself is what I consider to be something that's cool.</p>
<p>"I think a game that achieves that is a game that has designs that are just unique to that title alone, something that other titles cannot achieve," he added. "I think that sort of design is what I would consider to be cool."</p>

<p>UI is hugely important in setting the tone of a game as it appears across a game during gameplay, in menus, and more. "I think it is a powerful tool to control the overall kind of impression that the game gives off," said Ise.</p>
<p>He continued: "UI has the power to become the face of a game as well as move the player's emotions. That's why we as a team put in so much cost, resources and passion to create all these fleshed out UIs."</p>
<p>A big challenge with Metaphor in particular, though, was standing out from the shadow of the Persona games, which very much established the stylish UI designs of Atlus's games.</p>
<p>"I first started out by really trying to identify what Metaphor as a game was trying to convey and what specific unique traits the game had," said Ise. "And by really honing into those elements and being creative in how to express that through the UI, I believe we were able to pull the appeal of Metaphor to the forefront…[and] create something that was uniquely Metaphor."</p>
<p>Ise added the team was "very conscious of Persona" during development. "It was an established and big presence for us and it felt like we were in its shadows. But the director at one point pulled me aside and told me 'hey, don't focus on that too much, focus on what you want to do on this title alone'. And that really gave me [a chance to] step back and look at Metaphor as it is and focus on what expressions we want to make for this game specifically."</p>
<p>One of those elements was the use of Da Vinci's classic Vitruvian Man for the menu of the game's class system, known as Archetypes.</p>
<p>"That's actually a representation of a formula for the ideal king," said Ise, referencing the game's core plot. "Because the game adopts medieval painting styles, we were looking at various artwork from that era, which is when we found the Vitruvian Man, which we thought fit that theme because it has the ideal proportions of a human being."</p>

</figure>
<p>At Atlus, UI is a core part of the development process from the very beginning and this allowed the design to morph and evolve from the early conceptualisation stage to its final form along with the game as a whole.</p>
<p>As such, Ise showed me some early UI designs to represent the winding road of its development.</p>
<p>The earliest design focused on the game's fantasy setting, using parchment paper and other elements to represent the travel motif. "This was a design that was created when the theme of the journey itself with your companions was at the forefront, so that's why that's clearly expressed in this design," said Ise.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/GDC_Metaphor_Parchment-Concept.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>The travel motif is reflected in the fantasy items | <span>Image credit: <cite>Atlus</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The next design was more retro, with minimalist white borders around menu elements but rearranged in a modern style. This was to tie back to the roots of RPGs for a classic feel.</p>
<figure>

 </a>
<figcaption>The white boxes here reflect classic RPGs | <span>Image credit: <cite>Atlus</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The third design was focused on the theme of anxiety and depicted the face of the protagonist falling downwards into his emotions. "This was created when one of the ideas of anxiety came into the picture," said Ise. "This is an emotion that people in the fantasy world and also in the real world share, it's mutual between those two worlds."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/GDC_Metaphor_Anxiety-Concept.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>The falling character in this design represents anxiety | <span>Image credit: <cite>Atlus</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To me, the blend of medieval fantasy and modern style lends the UI a timeless feel. "Yes that was very intentional and was something we were aiming for because the game is in a fantasy setting and we were referencing a lot of medieval designs," said Ise, though he felt this alone was too old fashioned and "wouldn't be catchy for the modern player".</p>
<p>He was then inspired by a poster in an art museum promoting medieval artwork but with pop art fonts and designs. "It felt like they were talking directly to us as modern people," he said, ultimately influencing that blend of a painterly style enveloped in modern animation and typography.</p>

 </a>
</figure>
<figcaption>Two further concepts for the UI design | <span>Image credit: <cite>Atlus</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A key element of any UI, though, is balancing style with usability and clarity. "Striking that balance was, to be honest, the most difficult part of creating the UI for this game," Ise admitted.</p>
<p>"If we lean too much into the visuals, then it's difficult to use. But if we lean too much into the functional or usability side, then we start to lose the Atlus touch. So we put in a lot of effort and thought to make sure that we were taking both and making sure that it is a great balance to meet the needs of both."</p>
<p>"Persona veteran Atlus flexes its expertise with a fresh take on high fantasy," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">Metaphor: ReFantazio review</a>. "What it lacks in subtlety, it makes up for in grandeur and heart."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/26/ai-limit-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>AI Limit is, strangely enough, a game that’s all about mud. Your player character, Arrisa, is formed from mud. When you die – which you will a lot – Arrisa is respawned from mud. Most foes you encounter are made from mud, heck, you can even eat mud balls to regain health. Also, when you meander down the umpteenth dingey dull brown subterranean tunnel as you make your way through a level, you’ll be thinking the environment looks darn muddy too. AI Limit’s predilection with the goopy brown stuff is a little bit odd…</p>
<p><iframe title="AI Limit - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I9AckdXyWGs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s not the only odd thing about AI Limit, as the story is, quite frankly, bonkers. An assembly of random proper nouns haphazardly glued together – probably with mud – proceedings are overly complicated, make little sense, and are likely best ignored. Suffice to say, Arrisa is an immortal Blader, tasked with traversing a post-apocalyptic landscape to protect the last city of Havenswell. She’ll do this by slaying numerous beasties in a third person action adventure Soulslike.</p>
<p>Unlike a Souls game however, the levels here are almost completely linear. There are some shortcuts to be found, but you’ll generally be traipsing through the exact same level, along the exact same route, again and again. What is initially fun soon becomes a chore, as the identical hidden cultist ambushes you as they always tediously too, like some confused inhabitant of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. Finally, you’ll open a shortcut and get to avoid the hidden cultist, but AI Limit will push your patience in the wait to do so.</p>


<p>Combat is decent if unremarkable, a selection of light and chargeable hard attacks are available, though light attacks are much more effective, so you’re unlikely to do much charging. Rapid and capable of staggering most foes, light attacks prove so potent that hammering their button proves a more winning strategy than all the dodging, parrying, and special abilities combined. Particularly when the controls are a little bit off, as they are here. Inputs are regularly laggy and the targeting fussy, often leading to death as Arrisa insists on not looking at the demon about to kill her.</p>
<p>The Sync Rate mechanic is a neat addition, though. The more you hit opponents the more powerful your attacks become, but being hit or using abilities lowers your Sync Rate and thus your attack power. The risk and reward balance is intriguing but poorly implemented and under-explored; when light attacks are by far your best option and can quickly boost your Sync Rate, why bother troubling yourself doing anything else? As a result, combat is perfunctory and soon becomes rather dull, a significant issue when hitting stuff forms the majority of the game.</p>

<p>Boss encounters are fine, with some memorable behemoths to take down, but they are resolutely cheap in their tactics. Relying on insta-kill attacks to make the game difficult, rather than increasingly dangerous and varied attack patterns to fend off before finding your opening to strike back. Again, decide to stick with it, hammer light attack and force Arrisa to look in the right direction, and you’ll eventually defeat the boss, I’m just not sure how much fun you’ll be having in the process.</p>
<p>Visually, despite the dull as dish-water environments, the characters and enemies are well-designed and fluidly animated, with a lovely anime aesthetic that serves to make the game look more interesting. But don’t be fooled; this is a paint-by-numbers Soulslike offering little of note to differentiate it from the multitude of other games in the genre.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-change-seasons/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows enhances the open-world formula seen in previous entries in the series by introducing some dynamic elements that make the world feel more alive than ever. Some of these elements also have a considerable impact on the gameplay, such as Seasons. Depending on the current one, Naoe and Yasuke will have to deal with different weather and environmental conditions that can make certain quests easier or harder to complete. Other mechanics, such as the<a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-refill-scouts/"> Scouts mechanics</a>, are also tied to the cycle of Seasons, so knowing how they change is extremely important to take full advantage of all the mechanics tied to them.</p>
<p>The changing of Seasons in Assassin's Creed Shadows depends on the<strong> actual passage of time</strong>. <strong>Spring, Summer and Autumn last 140 minutes</strong>, while <strong>Winter 180 minutes</strong>. No matter which activity you complete in the game, <strong>there's no way to speed up the changing of Seasons</strong>, altough there are ways to prevent a Season from changing automatically, or initiate a change manually when the time is up.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250326114317_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>To learn when a Season will end, all you need to do is open the main menu and access the World tab. In the upper right corner of the map, you will find<strong> a compass</strong> with a circulation progression bar. Once it is filled with the passage of time, <strong>the Season will change if you either fast travel, complete a mission or hold the right directional button while in the World menu</strong>. The same will happen if you do any of the things above when the progression bar is halfway full. In this case, you will trigger a mid-season refresh that won't change the Season, but will refresh locations, local factions and alerts.</p>
<p>Even if the Season has ended, if you do not fast travel, complete a mission or trigger the change manually via the main menu, <strong>it will not change</strong>, so you can use this to your advantage. During Spring, for example, you will find additional vegetation all over the world, which you can use to better conceal yourself if needed. During Fall, to make another example, weather will change more often, and you can use a heavy downpour at night to have an easier time sneaking inside enemy strongholds or camps. Being able to change the Season at wish might have been better for some, but this new Assassin's Creed Shadows system, if used correctly, can still be a strong tool to help Naoe and Yasuke in their quest.</p>

Soberly breaking down the plot, mechanics and presentation of InCARceration would be like trying to cook a meal, win a spelling bee or perform a sneak-attack after being welded inside a car.

It was created for this February's automobile-fixated TFR Gamejam, which harbours a few other roadsters of note - the comparatively sheeny <a href="https://mabalobo.itch.io/redshift">RedShift</a>, in which your debt increases when you crash, and the gloomy pizza delivery sim <a href="https://eirye.itch.io/high-road">High Road</a>, of which we may jovially and unforgiveably say "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paratopic">Paratopic</a>-esque, is it? Paratoppings, more like!" You can find the jam on <a href="https://itch.io/jam/tfrjam-001/rate/3262838">Itch.io</a>.

Question for the thread: what makes a minigame collection more than a minigame collection? Decent variety between minigames?  Not actually being called a "minigame collection"? An overarching theme to stop it feeling like you're pointlessly fishing different shapes and colours of marshmallow from a bowl of Lucky Charms? Some actual craft, so that the component games are more like exquisite snowflakes than soggy cereal pieces endorsed by racist leprechaun imagery? Or alternatively, a full embrace of the disposability of minigames? Let the players have their fill of politically incorrect breakfast comestibles. They deserve nothing better.</p>
<p>It turns out RPS has some Background Reading to share. Here's Brendy on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-7-most-needless-minigames">the seven most needless minigames</a>, and here's Alec Meer (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/worst-hacking-minigames-ever">sticking it to rancid hacking games</a> in particular.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-witcher-iv-won%E2%80%99t-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red.1144998/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stunning reveal trailer</a> for The Witcher IV at The Game Awards 2024, fans might have hoped to see the game in the not-too-distant future. However, CD Projekt RED has now confirmed that there's still a long wait ahead.</p>
<p>During yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DY-Q-Wd3Hz4?t=1175s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fiscal year 2024 earnings conference</a>, they announced that the game won't be launched until at least 2027. Here's the full quote:</p>
<p><em>Regarding the expected release date for The Witcher IV, we are not going to announce the precise launch date for the game yet. All we could share for now to give more visibility to investors is that the game will not be launched within the timeframe of the first target for the incentive program, which ends on 31 December 2026.</em></p>
<p>It isn't inconceivable, then, that the two most anticipated fantasy open world roleplaying games, The Elder Scrolls VI and The Witcher IV, might be launched in the same year or at least in relative proximity. Bethesda's game might also debut in late 2027, given that Starfield <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched in September 2023</a>, and there is usually a four-year timeframe between their titles.</p>
<p>Following the aforementioned reveal of The Witcher IV, the Polish studio provided some info on the first installment in the new saga:</p>
<ul>
<li>As most fans had surmised following the end of the previous chapter, Cirilla Fiona Riannon will be the protagonist. The previous actress (Jo Wyatt) has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-ivs-ciri-has-a-new-voice-actress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> by Ciara Berkeley. Having Ciri leading the game also allows the development team to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-devs-comment-on-ciri-as-the-new-protagonist-explain-that-player-agency-will-be-at-the-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increase player agency</a> since she's just starting her journey as a Witcher, as opposed to Geralt, who had a lot of experience on the job.</li>
<li>There will be 'super compelling, very meaningful' <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-has-super-compelling-very-meaningful-romances-in-store-for-ciri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">romances</a> in store for her throughout the game.</li>
<li>Gwent <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-dev-confirms-gwent-talks-about-ciris-new-powers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is in the game</a>.</li>
<li>The Witcher IV will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-will-be-around-the-same-size-of-wild-hunt-devs-aim-for-quality-over-quantity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">around the same size as The Witcher III: Wild Hunt</a>, although the team aims for quality rather than quantity.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the financial report, CD Projekt RED revealed that 2024 was a solid year despite the lack of new releases. The studio almost reached $260 million in revenue, and the net profit line was the third-best in the group's history. CD Projekt RED also announced that it will soon become the owner of 100% of shares of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-acquires-drake-hollow-developer-the-molasses-flood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Molasses Flood</a>, the Boston-based developer that's working on The Witcher spin-off called Project Sirius. As you might remember, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-project-sirius-molasses-flood-rebooted-new-framework-cd-project-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebooted</a> a couple of years ago. Following the total control of the shares, The Molasses Flood will be fully merged into CD Projekt RED.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4-will-not-release-earlier-than-2027/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>CD Projekt Red’s recent statements indicate that The Witcher 4 could target next-gen PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as its release window has been pushed past 2026.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-sometime-in-2027-at-the-soonest-cd-projekt-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a>, CD Projekt Red discussed The Witcher 4’s release window during their latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DY-Q-Wd3Hz4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a>. During their presentation, the developers explicitly stated that the game would not arrive in 2026 twice, leading players to believe that the developers are targeting a 2027 release window and possibly next-gen consoles, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the segment about CD Projekt Group’s incentive program B, it was stated, “Even though we do not plan to release The Witcher 4 by the end of 2026, we are still driven by this financial goal.” Then, during the Q&amp;A section, CD Projekt Red’s chief financial officer, Piotr Nielubowicz, stated, “We are not going to announce the precise launch date for the game yet.”</p>



<p>Nielubowicz added that right now, all they can share for “more visibility to investors” is that The Witcher 4 will not be released “within the time frame of the first target for the incentive program, which ends December 31, 2026.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, CD Projekt Red has four different The Witcher projects in the works. The Witcher 4 is in the production stage, Project Sirius is in pre-production, and The Witcher Remake is in the concept phase. Cyberpunk’s Project Orion is also in the concept phase, and their new IP, Project Hadar, is in the IP concept phase.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>While big blockbuster games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> and Call of Duty pull in huge audience numbers, there are games that quietly ramp up the player numbers without entering the global consciousness. That’s definitely the case for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046300/Pirates_Outlaws/">Pirates Outlaws</a>, a game which racked up an astounding 3 million downloads, while accruing over 30,000 positive reviews on Android. Fans will be happy to find that not only will the sequel, Pirate Outlaws 2: Heritage, be sailing to iOS, Android and PC later in 2025, but they can already test out its roguelike deckbuilding charms via the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025160/Pirates_Outlaws_2_Heritage/">brand new demo that’s just dropped on Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>You may still be thinking about the recent trailer for Snail Games' Ark: Aquatica expansion, but not because it was so impressive it left a long lasting impression of wonder and awe. Rather, you probably still think about it because it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-dlc-trailer-slammed-for-its-blatant-use-of-ai-slop">was so <em>unimpressive</em> with its heavy handed use of AI slop</a>.</p>
<p>"This is disgusting and you should be ashamed of yourselves," reads one comment on the trailer's YouTube page.
</p>
<p>But, who was to blame for the trailer, which at the time of writing has amassed over 480k views, but only 1.7k upvotes on YouTube?</p>

<p>"That [trailer] was done by our marketing department," lead game designer Matt Kohl told <a href="https://aftermath.site/ark-aquatica-ai-trailer-snail-games-studio-wildcard-youtube">Aftermath</a>. "They took our assets and then ran them through an AI to animate them. That was marketing."</p>
<p>Kohl reiterated that the development team "did not do that" adding "there has been no AI use in development of Aquatica". The designer said he didn't "have any knowledge" as to why the marketing team decided to use AI for Ark: Aquatica's trailer, which was revealed at GDC.</p>
<p>Kohl said we would all hear more closer to launch, but did highlight a brief gameplay trailer for Aquatica released by the developer, which you can see below. At the time of writing, Snail's marketing team is yet to comment on last week's trailer.</p>

            <p>
LiDAR or "light detection and ranging" is a way of working out and picturing the distance to an object by shooting laser beams at it, and timing how long it takes the laser to bounce back to the scanner. It's been used for a bunch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar">Hard Science-y purposes</a>, from mapping cave systems to measuring changes in the Amazon forest canopy. It's also become popular among artists, who use it to create high-fidelity yet abstractly coloured and ethereal visualisations of, for example, <a href="https://mymodernmet.com/daniel-coe-lidar-data-river-art/">rivers</a>. Now here's LiDAR Exploration Program, a "relaxing atmospheric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>" game from KenForest, in which you roam maps with a handheld LiDAR gun scanning the geography into being.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I've just been playing the Itch demo, and it's sort of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> but for ghosts. I'm assuming the game doesn't physically calculate the passage of individual laser beams for the simple reason that my work laptop can run it without shuddering to pieces. Each level gives you a list of individual objects to scan. It certainly works as a chillout play: the landscapes appear to be wholly static, and you can take your time going over every surface, using the mouse wheel to expand or tighten the cone of lasers emitted by your gun. There's an alt-fire on right-click which scans the whole screen from top to bottom. All very methodical and restful. But also unnerving. 
</p>
<p>
LiDAR can't reveal the interior of an opaque object, or anything behind the surface you're scanning. As such, using it to explore a 3D environment involves the repeated discovery that any objects you've painted into existence are hollow when viewed from other angles. In encouraging you to hold yourself and the perspective motionless, the right-click full screen scan also subtly has you thinking that you're printing out a 2D photograph, but then you move, and the flat illustration twitches into three dimensions.

I like the unassuming delicacy of these chills, the way they emerge 'organically' from the central conceit. There are more outright horror touches, mind you: the scanner is the only way to see, and sometimes, it reveals things you'd rather have left in the dark. There's a top-down rotatable level map view on tab which somehow doesn't quite ruin the mood. Studying my luminous forays from on high, I was reminded of Arnie following the Predator's green blood through the jungle.
</p>
<p>
Still, I enjoy the demo more as an artistic tool than a horror game. I like narrowing the beams and drilling a density of detail through trees, then circling around to analyse the quiet violence of my vision as it spills out from more intensely illuminated surfaces, closer at hand, to stray puffs of photons in the depths of the forest. I wish more games drew this much attention to the properties of light.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ai-limit-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Like any soulslike fan, I’m quite accustomed to the process of dying over and over again until I’ve mastered a tough section, but playing through AI Limit was the first time I felt that sense of learned repetition before I’d even died at all. That’s because, aside from its anime-inspired art style and a few minor abilities you unlock throughout the story, this by-the-numbers adventure is without question the most milquetoast and unimaginative game I’ve played in the genre. It pit me against boring and meager enemies, laughably wimpy bosses I was largely able to stomp dead without issue, and a story with almost as little to say as its dull protagonist. In fairness, there’s not much especially awful about what AI Limit is doing (apart from its regular crashes and bugs that send you falling through the floor mid boss fight), but there’s almost nothing worthy of praise across this forgettable journey, either.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">AI Limit Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">AI Limit is set in a vague sci-fi universe where society has collapsed due to <em>mysterious circumstances </em>and is now overrun with a bizarre black mud that is both toxic to all life and a delicious meal you eat to regain your health. As an android called a Blader, you were created for the sole purpose of restoring the world back to balance, which you do by killing almost everything you see. You’ll unquestioningly run around the ruins of a civilization that apparently used a book of genre tropes as a blueprint, complete with a sewer that serves as the tutorial and a poison swamp level that’s mandatorily included per the Miyazaki Accords of 2011 – an actual, legally binding statute that’s so evidently real you don’t even need to bother Googling it. The robotic nature of your Blader also provides a convenient excuse for them to never exhibit even mild character traits as they speak in a monotone voice throughout the 30-hour adventure. Having a hazy setting and a forgettable protagonist isn’t exactly unique to this type of game, but if the non-fantasy setting had you hoping this might be one of the ways in which AI Limit breaks that mold: Nah.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The action is largely an impression of better soulslikes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual action is largely an impression of better soulslikes. You’ll split your time between exploring dark and dangerous places, fending off smaller enemies as you work your way to the next bonfire-like checkpoint (in this case, branches sprouting out of the ground), and confronting big, menacing bosses with long health bars and deadly attacks. But that familiar structure underwhelms almost immediately here thanks to a lack of enemy variety, samey and empty levels, and combat that’s overly simplistic and unchallenging. You’ll swing melee weapons several times larger than your body, loose spells that shoot fire, lightning, and more at your opponents, and, of course, dodge roll and parry to keep yourself alive. But while there’s not much unique to be found in AI Limit’s combat, the few new things it tries are mostly good ideas that make me wish it took more risks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest of these mechanics is the Sync Rate bar, which fills up as you do damage and is drained when you use spells or get hurt. The higher your Sync Rate, the more damage you’ll do – but if you take too many hits or use too many spells, you’ll find yourself in a weakened state, unable to use many of your abilities until you land some blows. That rewards cautious play and allows you to cut through boss fights more quickly if you manage to avoid damage while you press the attack. It’s also nice to determine how often you can use your spells by how well you play instead of being limited by a mana meter or something like that. AI Limit even ditches the stamina bar entirely (a genre staple I largely find annoying), letting you attack without fear of running out of steam so long as you are paying attention to your Sync Rate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a pretty neat system where you unlock four special powers that you can freely swap between in the middle of combat, like turning one of your arms into a shield or switching on an ability that lets you make short, quick dashes from place to place. Unfortunately, the first of these abilities that you get allows you to parry enemy attacks, and there’s almost no reason to switch to any of the other powers once you have it since almost everything can be pretty reliably parried, utterly devastating the enemy. So while toggling between these to do some interesting stuff in the middle of combat is a great concept, fights rarely play out that way. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Bosses only very rarely have interesting designs.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll mostly encounter the same handful of aliens that look like leftover costumes from the monsters in Stranger Things and generic robots with identical attack patterns, all of which are easily avoided or parried with little trouble; plus they almost always come at you one at a time. Boss fights are largely straightforward, too, with extremely telegraphed moves that can (once again) be easily parried, stopping those big bads in their tracks as they forget what they were doing for several seconds while you slash away half their health. Bosses also only very rarely have interesting designs, like one that’s just a flying version of the same Stranger Things monsters you’ve already been fighting, and then many are disappointingly recycled, either by almost immediately being reintroduced as common foot soldiers or when they are just straight up reused in another boss fight later on.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Soulslikes Ranked by Difficulty</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unfortunate, because there are times where AI Limit clearly shows promise, like later in the story when the generic, slow-moving bosses very occasionally make way for engaging battles against fellow Bladers. Their movesets are more interesting and challenging, and they have their own Sync Rate bars that must be depleted through attacks and parries in order to reduce the amount of damage they do and open them up to devastating finishing moves. There’s also one or two encounters where AI Limit tries new stuff, like a fight against a giant robot that sits at the end of the room trying to blast you with deadly lasers, and the only way to defeat it is by destroying the electrical equipment powering it as you cut through its minions. But these fights are few and far between, leaving you to slap around the much less interesting, big, ugly, slow moving enemies that make up the bulk of the boss fights most of the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another thing that holds AI Limit back pretty significantly is how buggy it is. I had at least a dozen crashes, got stuck in the environment in ways that caused me to twitch bizarrely, fell right through the floor during boss fights, and once even continuously respawned over and over again at a save point that threw me through the map until I went to the PlayStation dashboard and closed the app. Some of these crashes happened when I was quite deep into exploring an area and far away from a checkpoint, forcing me to start over again through no fault of my own and lose materials in the process. In fact, nearly all of my most frustrating deaths came from straight up glitches, rather than fighting bad guys. That’s not exactly the kind of difficulty I was hoping for.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">AI Limit is a soulslike without any soul, providing 30 mediocre hours of dodge rolling and sword swinging that’s good for little more than filling time. I sliced my way through repetitive goons in unremarkable locations, killed some pushover bosses who were dead before I thought to learn their names, and spent more time recovering from game crashes than learning anything noteworthy about the bland sci-fi setting or the characters within it. The stylish art style, smart Sync Rate system, and swappable abilities are interesting tweaks to the blueprint, but are ultimately too minor to leave much of an impression. If you’re really hurting for more opportunities to scratch that soulslike itch, you could probably do worse than AI Limit, but you could also easily do a whole lot better.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
