<p>The 'Dig to the Beat' event gets underway on <strong>16th December</strong>, and will be sticking around until <strong>23rd December</strong>, so you have plenty of time to rack up an Emerald Rush high score and pick up the reward statues.</p>
<p>And what rewards they are! Hot off the back of Lanky and Chunky Kong's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/donkey-kong-bananzas-next-dlc-in-game-event-swings-into-action-next-week">statue appearances last month</a>, the upcoming event features Jungle Beat's Ghastly and Ninja Kong, immortalised as unlockable island accessories.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytfMx2XNyAq4E" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4ogstuh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>For reference, here is the exact time that the 'Dig to the Beat' event will kick off in your region:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 12am PST / 1am MST / 2am CST / 3am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 8am GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 9am CET / 10am EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 5pm JST / 4pm AWST / 7pm AEDT</li></ul>

<p>As was the case with the two debut events, this one will challenge you to complete Emerald Rush runs with a limited, pre-determined set of perks available, so prepare to switch up your gem-collecting tactics on the fly.</p>
<p>This will likely be the final in-game event of the year, but we expect to see more swing over to the DLC package in 2026.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/against-xbox-sony-practically-gives-away-playstation-dualsense-controller-at-all-time-low-2000651202</link>

              <p>Looking to game better this holiday season? The right controller can make playtime a lot more fun. If your current controller no longer feels comfortable to hold, and you’re dealing with stick drift or weak triggers, it’s time for an upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6257/">We just spotted the PlayStation DualSense wireless controller in Chroma Teal going for just $60 at Amazon</a>. That’s after the retailer slashed 25% off its $80 price tag. Is Green not your vibe? There are several other color options going for less, too. The stunning black version, for instance, is sitting at $54 after a 28% drop, while the bold Volcanic Red color can be yours for $59, at a sweet 26% discount. There’s quite a lot to choose from, but there’s a catch. These deals are selling out fast, and the stock is likely to run out soon. If you’ve been looking to enjoy your favorite titles to the fullest during the holidays, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6257/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Gaming Experience</h2>
<p>It’s made to feel comfortable in the hands with an evolved design, featuring responsive sticks and a familiar layout. The integrated touch pad, accelerometer, and gyroscope come together to provide motion controls for tracking movement and rotation. In-game actions will be felt physically with dual actuators, and in select titles, these vibrations can simulate even the feeling of the digital environment for a more immersive experience.</p>
<p>There’s a built-in microphone to chat with friends during the games, record your own voice to save your reaction, plus use voice search for apps or the console’s menu. The 3.5mm jack lets you connect a headset to the console for a private listening experience, meaning you won’t have to rely on your TV speakers or face audio delays. The dedicated mute button makes it easy to switch voice capture on or off with a single push without having to go through a complicated settings menu.</p>



<p>Compatibility-wise, it works primarily with the PS5, but you can also connect it via Bluetooth or USB to other devices like Windows, PCs, Macs, iOS, Android, select tablets, and Apple TV. That means you don’t limit yourself to a single device. Maybe use it with the console during a solo session, and switch to a bigger screen when playing with friends!</p>
<p>All things considered, if you have been looking to play your favorite titles in a more immersive way and need a new controller without stretching your budget, now is the time to act. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6257/">This deal takes 25% off this responsive controller that typically goes for $80.</a> There are multiple colors available, so there are quite a lot of options to pick from. This also makes it a good time to pick a couple of options, if you’re also looking to gift one to a loved one, or just want to have a spare one lying around for when friends come over. That said, there are plenty of other tech gadgets going for less, too, so now is a great time to stock up on other essentials like laptops, chargers, and consoles if you missed grabbing something during Black Friday.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PlayStation has revealed an odd but intriguing crossover for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, as the popular flight-sim game is bringing Netflix’s Stranger Things to the game, and in this day and age, stranger things have happened.</p>



<p>Stranger Things Season 5 is all the rage right now. Netflix’s hit show is into its fifth and final season, bringing down the curtain on one of the most-watched TV shows ever. In the gaming world, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-release-date-early-access-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> has launched on PlayStation 5, marking the first appearance for the franchise on a Sony console.</p>



<p>Someone behind the scenes was clearly interested to see what would happen if you joined these opposing forces together, and now there’s an answer.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-visit-iconic-stranger-things-location-in-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">You Can Visit Iconic Stranger Things Location In Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stranger crossovers have happened. Credit to Xbox Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’ll be able to explore Hawkins like never before. See and visit real locations from the show in the new Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024: Stranger Things expansion, available December 9.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/09/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-introduces-netflixs-stranger-things-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation</a> Blog said: “You will be able to explore a highly detailed map and recreation of the town with more than 40 iconic locations made famous by the show.”</p>



<p>Some of the locations include Starcourt Mall, Hawkins Middle School, and Hawkins Junkyard.</p>



<p>The expansion includes five new missions taking you around the town in a Bell UH-1H Huey helicopter, and you need to rescue residents in danger. It makes sense for any game right now to cash in on the Stranger Things final season hype, but a Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 wouldn’t have been near the top of your lists!</p>

You don't have to worry about dragons, wizards, or orcs killing you in this game, but you still have to survive in some harsh conditions. Now, a free update for Medieval Dynasty is adding some new touches for the game that go beyond mere survival.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzajklWJTDI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dzajklWJTDI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There were pregnancies and children in this game prior to the Labor of Love update, but there are now more realistic depictions of it including visibly pregnant women, new animations and conversations, as well as a productivity boost for the player during the pregnancy and while the mother takes care of the child. In this game, players go on to play as their children after the death of their characters. Additionally, pregnant women will stop working during their second term.</p><p>This free update is also accompanied by a paid DLC called The Exquisite Pack. The cosmetic options include two new outfits: a dress and jewelry for a female character and something resembling formal wear for the men. The DLC also gives players an exquisite sword, new hairstyles and mustache designs, as well 13 emblem patterns for players' settlements.</p><p>From now through December 18 at 7:00 AM PST, Medieval Dynasty and The Exquisite Pack are on sale on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4159030/Medieval_Dynasty__Exquisite_Pack/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. The core game is available for half of its regular price, which comes out to $17.50, while the DLC is only slightly discounted to $3.99. The previous Medieval Dynasty expansion, Echoes of Nature, is also for sale at the $3.99 price.</p>

			<p>Following <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">its release earlier this year</a></strong>, the Nintendo Switch 2 has received multiple system updates that introduced new features to the system, improved backward compatibility with select original Switch titles, enhanced the system's stability for a better user experience and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-1-fixes-frustrating-bluetooth-issue-and-more/"><strong>fixed some critical issues</strong></a>. Today, the Japanese company started the December system update cycle with a new update that also launched for the original Switch.</p>



<p>The 21.1.0 system update for both systems is a minor system update that introduces <em>"<strong><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68473#current" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">general system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience,"</a></strong> </em>so all those expecting a major new feature, such as Home Menu themes, will be disappointed. The new update will be automatically downloaded and installed by both systems when connected online.</p>



<p>While the new Nintendo Switch 2 system update is still being examined by datamining experts such as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://x.com/OatmealDome"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">OatmealDome</strong></a> to reveal all undocumented changes, Nintendo itself has confirmed that the new update fixes an issue that caused video playback in Super Smash Bros.

            <p>Break out your finest middle-parted hairdo, as Leon Kennedy's in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-2-remake">Resi 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resi 4</a> protagonist's presence has been leaked by the evil resident that is cover art being pushed out too early on the PlayStation Store, which is like Steam, but a bit more blue.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The art, which shows big Leon's bonce looming behind Requiem lead and FBI agent Grace Ashcroft, has been served to players who've pre-ordered the game's standard edition for their console boxes and subsequently tried to set it away pre-loading.</p>
<p>Up to this point, Capcom hadn't confirmed whether the man with the jacket would be in Requiem. This art popping up days before The Geoff Awards, which Resi Requiem's already been confirmed to be popping up at, seems to point to that appearance probably being when Capcom had planned to go 'oh look, it's jacket man'. Now, if that's the case and there's no other big news, you can maybe use the time for a well-earned mid-advert swarm breather.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Playstation for real this time accidentally just leaked Leon in Resident Evil Requiem. Checked with some people to absolutely confirm this was real first, and it is. If you have the standard non-Deluxe Edition of RE9 on PS5, you can see this cover if try to schedule pre-loading. <a href="https://t.co/yZv69ecd2u">pic.twitter.com/yZv69ecd2u</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1998347199311167788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>While this Leon leakage has just occurred  today, the last few days have also seen another bit of potential Requiem leakage squirm out of containment. Game retailers Gamestop briefly left some details which could hint at another character in their listing for the PC deluxe edition. As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1997535711323656529">Dusk Golem</a>, the listing mentioned "three exclusive outfits for Rosemary Winters" and "a unique cosmetic look for Rose’s visor" in some blurb about DLC packs.</p><p>Rosemary Winters, of course, is the daughter of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> protagonist Ethan Winters. Assuming she does turn out to be in the game, that leak doesn't make it clear if she'll just be popping in for a chat or getting the full playable character treatment. Whatever's the case, it would appear Capcom have her wardrobe sorted.</p>
<p>Moving away from who'll be in it, Capcom have said Resi Requiem <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-requiem-wont-repeat-monster-hunter-wilds-technical-blunders-capcom-say">will dodge the technical gremlins</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has suffered since it emerged into the plains and began lobbing stuff at angry creatures.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-soundlink-max-speaker-restock-drops-cheaper-than-black-friday-in-a-december-clearance-move-2000651067</link>
            <guid>1376986</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re already a week into December. The clock is ticking to secure your holiday gifts for all your friends, family, and loved ones. Luckily, even though both Black Friday and Cyber Monday have come to pass, you can still find some sweet deals still lingering. Take this Bluetooth Bose speaker for instance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6301/">The Bose SoundLink Max is normally priced at $399, but has come down to just $279 for a limited time. The 30% discount ends up saving you a whole $120.</a> This Bose speaker can deliver rich audio performance, rugged portability, and all-day battery life. Anyone can appreciate a good portable speaker, so if you’re out of ideas for what to get someone, this might just be your answer.</p>
<p>This Bose SoundLink Max Bluetooth party speaker is capable of producing big stereo sound with a deep bass that can carry your next party. You can perfectly dial in the sound exactly how you want it when using the Bose app. Control EQ settings like bass, mid-range, and treble for the best sound wherever you take the party to.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6301/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Pairing is east. Just press and hold the Bluetooth buttons until the light blinks blue, then choose the Bose SoundLink Max in your device’s Bluetooth settings and voila! The speaker can even be connected to up to two deices at once. You’ll only be able to play audio from one at a time, but two people can have their phones connected to be able to queue up music. In addition to Bluetooth, the speaker includes a built-in 3.5mm AUX input, making it easy to connect turntables, CD players, MP3 players, or any device you prefer to run wired.</p>
<p>Nothing kills the mood like a dying battery. With up to 20 hours of battery life, the SoundLink Max ensures your music lasts from sunrise gatherings to late-night sessions. And thanks to its USB-C charging port, you can even power your phone or other devices directly from the speaker. A Bluetooth speaker doesn’t do you any good if you don’t have a working source to play the tunes from. If the SoundLink Max has juice, your phone does too.</p>



<h2>Rugged Portability</h2>
<p data-start="1614" data-end="2003">Accidents happen. Drinks spill, rain comes out of nowhere, stuff gets dropped. That’s why the SoundLink Max is built with an IP67 rating, meaning it’s waterproof and dustproof. It’s also resistant to shocks and rust. You can toss it in the sand, use it poolside, or let it ride shotgun on a rugged camping trip without worrying about damage. This is a speaker designed to thrive where others fail.</p>
<p data-start="1614" data-end="2003">Portability meets style with the speaker’s soft, removable climbing-rope handle. Grab it and go to the beach, a backyard hangout, a rooftop gathering, or your favorite hiking spot. You can upgrade to custom colored handles that are fun and eye-catching or a carrying strap your can throw over your shoulder.</p>
<p data-start="1614" data-end="2003">The Bose SoundLink Max Bluetooth speaker comes in three awesome color options. Choose between blue dusk, citrus yellow, or the classic black. All three choices are currently discounted, but the steepest price change is on the blue dusk and citrus yellow versions.</p>

<p>The camo grind is a popular pastime for Call of Duty players, and there’s more than ever to secure with exclusive camos available in Warzone, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-zombie-camo-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-multiplayer-camo-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multiplayer</a>, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-camo-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Co-op Campaign</a>.</p>

    <p><span>A message from director Shoon T.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > C#4R4CT3R [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/c4r4ct3r">C#4R4CT3R</a> has delayed “lo-fi psycho-thriller <a title="Genres > Romance Visual Novel [92 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/visual-novel/romance-visual-novel">romance adventure</a>” from its <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/lo-fi-psycho-thriller-romance-adventure-game-rain98-announced-for-consoles-pc">previously planned</a> 2025 release window to 2026. It will be available for unspecified consoles and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,000 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3498720/Rain98/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>. <span id="more-1012672"></span></p><p>In a message director Shoon T shared further insight behind the delay, the vision for the game going forward, and the path toward completing development.</p><p>Here is the message in full:</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ Director’s Message</strong></p><p>Hello, everyone. This is Shoon T, director of <em><a title="Games > Rain98 [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/rain98">Rain98</a></em>.</p><p>We have decided to shift our release target for <em>Rain98</em> to 2026 to deliver the game at the level of quality we believe it deserves. I sincerely apologize to all the players who have been looking forward to it, and I would like to explain how we arrived at this decision.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Why We Need More Time</strong></p><p>After starting development at full scale in April 2025, we have showcased <em>Rain98</em> to hundreds of players at events around the world, including BitSummit, PAX East, and Tokyo Game Show.</p><p>The amount of insightful player feedback we received from these events has helped sharpen and define the image of the game in our minds, which is much more than we had first anticipated.</p><p>With every event, we became more and more convinced that we could go deeper with this game.</p><p><em>Rain98</em> is not meant to be a game that ends the second you see the end credits. We want the experience of playing it to linger with you for a long time, and to be as impactful as the iconic scenes from anime and movies that reside in the popular imagination for generations. We realized that in order to achieve that, we would need to pour even more effort into it. We would need to put every last bit of our soul into this game.</p><p>Apart from the “part-time job” minigame already showcased in the demo version in events, the full release will include a wider array of experiences to evoke daily life in Tokyo in the late ’90s.</p><p>These interactive elements are designed to be more than simple gimmicks. They connect naturally to character psychology, the game’s narrative tone, and the thick, dark, rainy atmosphere of the story.</p><p>Preparing all of this with the care it takes requires additional development time.</p><p><strong>Future Updates</strong></p><p><em>Rain98</em> has now surpassed 45,000 wishlists on Steam, and we’ve received messages of support and excitement from all over the world. The fact that so many people are supporting us despite the very limited amount of information we’ve released is more than we could ever ask for, and this really helps us stay motivated every single day.</p><p>Let me take this opportunity to thank all of you.</p><p>Although <em>Rain98</em> has been postponed, we will be more open with our communication and will regularly share updates on development progress, plans for events, new demo versions, and more on our Steam Community and Discord.</p><p><strong>■ In Closing</strong></p><p><em>Rain98</em> will be worth the wait.</p><p>We still have much to learn when it comes to development, so we ask that you be patient and keep encouraging us through this journey. Our whole team is working tirelessly to share <em>Rain98</em>‘s story with you as soon as possible.</p><p>—Shoon T, Director</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/rain98-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>

                <p>As The Game Awards draws closer, everyone's attention right now is on a mysterious demonic monolith that is teasing <em>something</em>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-scary-the-game-awards-teaser-could-be-for-the-next-diablo-4-expansion/1100-6536594/">First seen in the Mojave Desert</a>--and described by TGA host Geoff Keighley as being pure "regal.inspiring.thickness" as it stood there--the monolith has now been spotted in Los Angeles. It's not clear if this is the same monolith as the one in the desert or a new one, and there's still no clue what this piece of aura-farming architecture is teasing yet.</p><p>One franchise that it's probably not linked to? Battlefield, as Battlefield Studios senior director of integrated communications Andy McNamara snapped a photo of the monolith and <a href="https://x.com/TheRealAndyMc/status/1998267455622586639" rel="nofollow ">mentioned that it wasn't linked to EA's FPS franchise</a>.</p><p>Beyond that, there have been plenty more guesses as to what the demonic monolith will reveal. Some people have speculated that it could be teasing the next Diablo 4 expansion or The Elder Scrolls 6--industry reporter Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/geoff-keighley-posts-cryptic-image-with-the-caption-regal-inspiring-thickness-up-not-diablo-up2-new-message-from-tga-account.1368046/page-17#post-148370662" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">claims it's not related</a> to either IP--and CI Games CEO Marek Tyminski has confirmed that it's not Lords of the Fallen 2 being hinted at. God of War dev Cory Barlog has also downplayed rumors that the next God of War game is what the monolith is alluding to, and the only surefire way to find out what's behind the magic door will be to tune into The Game Awards this week on December 11 at 4:30 PM PT / 7:30 PM ET.</p><p>We've predicted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/tga-2025-predictions-whats-going-to-happen-at-the-game-awards/2900-7307/">what we might see at The Game Awards this week</a>, and several studios have confirmed that new trailers for Exodus, Invincible VS, Resident Evil Requiem, and Phantom Blade Zero will be shown.</p>

<p>The legend returns</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="2c836875913a2"><a title="Leon Kennedy - RE6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2c836875913a2/leon-kennedy-re6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: IGN</em></figcaption></figure><p>Leon Kennedy has finally been confirmed to appear in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>; though perhaps not in the way that Capcom had hoped.</p>
<p>Yes, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/confirmed-leon-s-kennedy-is-in-resident-evil-requiem-playstation-store-leak-reveals">IGN</a>, the veteran character now shows up via the PSN store when users go to the pre-download page. The updated key art shows Leon in the background behind the game's other key protagonist, Grace Ashcroft.</p>
<p>As for Leon himself, he is sporting a similar jacket to his appearance in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>, while his signature hairdo is well and truly present. He certainly comes across more grizzled than previous appearances; almost like a cross between Resident Evil 4 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2FTBspZymlg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0tkqysn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>It's likely that Leon's official reveal was scheduled for the game's upcoming new trailer during The Game Awards, but the cat is out of the bag.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the image in full:</p>
<figure data-uuid="1e3350d9795bc"><a title="Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1e3350d9795bc/requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: IGN</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Capcom has remained tightlipped on Leon's appearance in Requiem, though the company has consistently described the game as a mix between more classic survival horror gameplay and action-oriented scenes.</p>
<p>It's likely, then, that Grace Ashcroft will feature in the slower, more horror-focused sections, while Leon – being the hardened agent that he is – will take on the more action-heavy set pieces.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-clears-out-playstation-vr2-at-its-lowest-price-as-holiday-stock-dump-begins-while-meta-quest-stays-full-price-2000651622</link>
            <guid>1376956</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re looking for a more immersive way to play your favorite titles, where the digital world becomes your reality in every sense, you need a VR set in your setup. These not only offer better visuals, but also unique sensations based on whatever’s happening in the game, pulling you into action.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6302/">PlayStation owners should consider grabbing the PSVR2, especially now that it’s going at a 25% discount at Amazon.</a> This brings its usual $400 price down to $299, which, while not the lowest price ever, is still not bad considering all the features the bundle comes packed with. It’s open to all shoppers, and you don’t have to worry about any delivery charges either. Just be sure to grab it quick. Amazon hasn’t specified an end date for this one, but we’re not expecting it to stick around for more than a couple of days.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6302/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Visuals and Sound</h2>
<p>The bundle includes the PlayStation VR2 headset and a pair of Sense controllers. The headset is comfortable to wear, featuring a rear band that sits a bit low on the back of your head for stability. Once on, the two 2000 x 2040 OLED displays push incredibly sharp and vibrant 4K HDR visuals, which are four times better than the original PSVR. There’s support for eye tracking that simulates emotional responses from the version of you in the game for a better sense of realism, especially when playing with friends. The headset is also designed to be responsive with vibrations, meaning in-game sensations can be felt like they’re happening right in your living room.</p>
<p>For instance, when cars race past, you’ll feel a burst of movement around through the headset. But of course, visuals alone can’t offer a truly immersive experience, and for that, there’s 3D audio that surrounds you and adapts to your position with head movements. Everything from whispers to footsteps, gunfire, and screams will be heard as if you’re right in the middle of the battlefield. Best of all, you can still keep an eye on what’s happening in the real world with the See-through View function.</p>



<p>As for the controllers – these offer haptic feedback for you to physically feel your in-game responses in the form of vibrations, intense pulses, and more. Finger touch detection lets you feel elements of the virtual world even when you’re not pressing any buttons, while adaptive triggers make it easy to sense the digital tension and resistance. The latter is great for feeling that bowstring pull when you’re just about to hit a bad guy, or sensing objects crumple as you crush them in your hand just before delivering an Oscar-worthy line.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to play your favorite titles in a way that makes you feel like you’re a part of the action, a VR bundle can deliver exactly that and more. This one, in particular, offers immersive, 4K visuals that show every in-game detail in a lifelike manner, plus let you feel all that’s happening in the digital world with unique sensations through the controllers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6302/">The bundle typically retails for $400, but you can now snap it up for $299 after a sweet 25% discount.</a> Amazon won’t be this generous for long, and considering how there are no major sales lined up, it’s best to get your orders in as soon as you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6302/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

During that time, the thieves crowbarred open the outlet's door and made multiple trips to a waiting vehicle, all while carrying armfuls of Pokémon merchandise.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>NEW: Burglars ransack card shop and steal $100,000 worth of rare Pokémon and sports cards</p><p>The owner believes the thieves knew exactly where the merchandise was and planned the job ahead of time</p><p>They got away with about $100,000 in merchandise</p><p>Police believe the same crew may… <a href="https://t.co/zMIurJ86U9" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zMIurJ86U9</a></p></div>— Unlimited L's (@unlimited_ls) <a href="https://twitter.com/unlimited_ls/status/1997451668946895184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"[For the] vast majority, they were targeting Pokémon cards," store owner Kiet Nguyen said. "They did take some locked boxes from the back that had sports cards... They were targeting liquid assets, Pokémon is so easy to sell these days that sealed product, everyone has it. So it wouldn't raise any suspicion if someone was to sell it, it's available everywhere."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside new Pokémon decks and collectible sets, the thieves also got away with a handful of rare sports items including a signed Ronaldo card. But it's clear that Pokémon cards were the key draw — with suggestion that this gang has struck several times before.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"It seemed like they had it down pat," Nguyen continued. "They knew what they were doing... We thought this was a very safe, secure, very busy street.

Hamaguchi said, according to a translation by a Final Fantasy fan account on <a href="https://x.com/ShinraArch/status/1997787393253118017/photo/1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>X/Twitter</u></a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/square-enix-director-naoki-hamaguchi-considered-giving-cloud-strife-a-more-realistic-sword-for-final-fantasy-7-remake-but-decided-jrpg-fans-wouldnt-accept-it-we-stayed-faithful-to-the-og/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GR+</u></a>).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"So at the time, when we were making Remake, there was some discussion about whether we should give Cloud a more realistic version of the Buster Sword," Hamaguchi added. "But it was just too iconic, and if we'd made it just a regular old sword, players wouldn't accept it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He closed, stressing: "In the end we stayed faithful to the OG.

Well, in the same interview, Hamaguchi teased that the "core game experience is almost complete," and while he "really want[s] everyone to play it as soon as possible," the team has now moved on to "refining and polishing."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Weirdest Things That Happened in the Original Final Fantasy 7</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiously, he also warned the team "never intended to make all three parts feel like the same game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As the director, I feel a very strong sense of the game’s final form," the director said. "Honestly, I really want everyone to play it as soon as possible, but of course, since it’s a game, it needs to be carefully crafted before it can be delivered to players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Once we go through this phase properly, we’ll be able to present it in a form we’re satisfied with. So I ask everyone to wait just a little longer, and we’ll be able to share more information soon."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, he also teased that "Highwind" will be an important keyword for the third instalment. "As for the third part, introducing new gameplay experiences and a new scale is key to successfully delivering the project to players. 'Highwind' is certainly an important keyword here, there's no doubt about that," he teased. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Briana White, the actress who portrays Aerith in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake"><u>Final Fantasy 7</u></a>, has called on fans to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7s-aerith-has-had-enough-of-creeps-tagging-voice-actors-with-smut-featuring-their-characters"><u>stop tagging voice artists in spicy material featuring their characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <guid>1376941</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> now finally lets players trade creatures from afar — a feature that fans have wanted for almost a decade. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Pokémon Go launched in 2016, the game has been hesitant to allow gameplay that does not encourage players to meet up in person. Remote raiding was only added to the game during the era of Covid lockdowns, and trading has remained locked within a small location radius — until now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remote trading will still require some work to unlock, with the feature available when in-game friends hit a fresh, fifth interaction tier — Forever Friends — that will require a couple of months more levelling beyond Best Friends (though this can be heavily reduced by completing Weekly Challenges).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once Forever Friends, you'll get to make a Remote Trade — and there's a clever system for selecting three creatures you'd be happy to swap, while picking one from your friends' selection. Only when both parties are happy with the matchup will the trade take place. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Subsequent Remote Trades will then require a similar wait to unlock again, but this length of time is not terrible — it will give more of a chance to roll the Lucky Friends status, and for many, Remote Trading will be most useful for existing Lucky Friends in other countries who have been sat with that status in place for years. Another positive change includes a major increase in friend list size, from 450 to 650. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Hot damn!" wrote Plus-Pomegranate8045 on Pokémon Go reddit TheSilphRoad. "Huge shout out to whoever it was at Niantic/Scopely that got this pushed through." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Finally, I can trade with the guy ive been lucky friends with for 4 years," added another fan, Abject-Sector-2167. "He lives on the other side of the globe."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, not everyone is happy. "Welp, that's just ruined the point of regionals," wrote HappyTimeHollis. "This sucks."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokemon Go Safari Zone in Yokosuka, Japan</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Months of datamines have suggested that Remote Trading has been in the works for some time, and initially fans had expected more of a system that required payment via in-game currency to use the feature. Its arrival now, as simply another part of free gameplay, has been greeted warmly. Though, of course, there remains the possibility that some new mechanic might be introduced in future to speed the process up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, though, the announcement of Remote Trading is being received positively. Levelling up to Forever Friends is now live for the game's loyal audience in New Zealand, where new features are regularly tested first, before it is rolled out more widely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>This month's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civ 7</a> update, 1.3.1, will rock up today, December 9th. Following on from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7s-nautically-themed-130-update-arrives-today-delivers-significant-buffs-to-popular-civs">beefy 1.3.0 update</a>, which added in a bunch of new navally-themed bits and revamped battling at sea, this update's comparatively compact, but still packs a new map type and some civ balancing tweaks which are well worth being aware of if you're gonna be Civving over the holidays.</p>

<p>As outlined by Firaxis QA lead Shaun Wilson in the developer update video above, the update introduces the Shattered Seas map, a setup aimed at ensuring you run into plenty of naval action. Basically, it takes a typical Pangea map and splits the central landmass up into a bunch of sizable islands separated by narrow watery dividers. </p>
<p>"Every player gets their own distinct defensible land mass, but all land masses are connected primarily by extensive stretches of shallow coastal waters," Wilson explained. "Distant lands islands will still spawn separated by deep oceans, just like a typical Pangea map." It looks like a good fit for folks keen to do some island-hopping or aim to set up a port fortress to defend, but I imagine it'll have to prove it's different enough to the base game's archipelago maps to become the go-to for watery warfare. Alongside deploying the new map, Firaxis have updated all mini-maps to highlight coastal tiles.</p><p>World generation's also undergone some tweakage. "We've increased the size variance of biomes and the reliance on rainfall," Wilson said. "Rivers and rain shadows near mountains now have a much stronger influence on the surrounding terrain. This means biomes will be less striped along lines of latitude. Instead, you'll experience patchier, more realistic, and ultimately more interesting global patterns for you to navigate and explore."</p>
<p>Finally, the civ balancing tweaks this time around are led by a nerf of Egypt, with the likes of yields from minor rivers being pegged back. Rome, meanwhile, has had its Auxilia and Cursus Honorum tradition revamped so there's an incentive to keep them active outside of periods when you're training up lots of troops. Russia's serfdom civic has also been tweaked, now helping increase wonder building speed by 10%.</p>
<p>This update also brings with it the second part of the Tides of Power DLC, which includes 16th century Moroccan privateer Sayyida al Hurra as a leader, plus Ottoman and Icelandic civs. The full DLC, including the bit with Blackbeard that arrived with last month's update, is currently claimable for free until January 5th. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-will-bring-back-the-ability-to-play-as-one-civ-for-the-whole-game-bypassing-the-divisive-age-system">bigger changes</a> like the ability to play as one civ for the whole game are still in the works.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Resident Evil Requiem PSN Listing Reveals Leon Kennedy Key Art]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-psn-listing-reveals-leon-kennedy-key-art/</link>
            <guid>1376926</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There have been back-and-forth rumors for weeks about Leon Kennedy appearing in Resident Evil Requiem, either as a playable character or as a part of the main story. The PlayStation Store seems to have finally given us an official Leon Kennedy answer for Requiem.</p>



<p>Leon Kennedy is one of the pillars of the Resident Evil franchise. He’s been a playable main character across multiple Resi titles—such as Resident Evil 2 and 4—and with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-new-look-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> taking us back to Raccoon City, the question has been asked since day one—is Leon Kennedy ready for one last zombie rodeo?</p>







<h2 id="h-leon-kennedy-will-be-in-resident-evil-requiem">Leon Kennedy Will Be In Resident Evil Requiem</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Good news for fans, bad news for zombies. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you buy Resident Evil Requiem through the PlayStation Store, you’ll be able to check your purchase and see how long it is until the game goes live.</p>







<p>However, if you look closely at the Requiem game art image, while you can clearly see Grace Ashcroft, there’s a huge Leon Kennedy avatar in the background.</p>



<p>If he weren’t in the game, he wouldn’t be in this image. It’s that simple, folks. This also confirms what Dusk Golem has been saying for months. You can see the evidence below, and it’s reportedly been confirmed by multiple people who’ve pre-purchased Resident Evil Requiem’s Standard Edition.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Playstation for real this time accidentally just leaked Leon in Resident Evil Requiem. Checked with some people to absolutely confirm this was real first, and it is. If you have the standard non-Deluxe Edition of RE9 on PS5, you can see this cover if try to schedule pre-loading. <a href="https://t.co/yZv69ecd2u">pic.twitter.com/yZv69ecd2u</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1998347199311167788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>This all but confirms the return of the legendary character. It doesn’t necessarily mean Leon will be playable in Requiem, though, so rein in those expectations for now. It would be wise to assume Leon is playable in Requiem, and if so, it’ll be interesting to see how Capcom switches back and forth between Grace and Leon, or if you have the option to play the entire game as either protagonist.</p>



<p>What do you think of this reveal? Was Leon always going to be in the game? Let us know what you think of this tidbit, what it means for Resident Evil Requiem, and if you’re excited for the game.

            <p>Leaked Resident Evil Requiem cover art confirms what we suspected all along - Leon Kennedy is indeed going to be a part of the game.</p>
<p>The artwork went live on the PlayStation Store, as confirmed by Eurogamer. It showed the previously announced lead Grace Ashcroft (daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft, who features in spin-off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-outbreak">Resident Evil Outbreak</a>) with a large image of Leon set behind her.</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem has been confirmed to be showing at The Game Awards later this week, and this is presumably when Capcom intended to announce Leon's inclusion in the game. However, PlayStation has unintentionally jumped the gun.</p>
<p>Back in June of this year, game director Koshi Nakanishi claimed Leon simply wasn't the kind of person who would "jump at something like a bucket falling", and therefore making a "horror game based around him" would be tricky.</p>
<p>"No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leon-kennedy-actually-quite-a-bad-match-for-horror-says-resident-evil-9s-director">Nakanishi said</a>. "He's actually quite a bad match for horror."</p>
<p>Clearly, the director was just trying to pull the wool over our eyes.</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem is set to launch on 27th February, 2026, across <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-re-engine-resi-switch-2">PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S</a>. Earlier this year, Capcom assured its Resi fans the team is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-resident-evil-requiem-wont-have-pc-woes-like-monster-hunter-wilds-says-capcom">working to ensure Resident Evil Requiem will perform well on PC</a>, after a multitude of technical issues this year with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>

            <p>
Xbox is officially 25 years old next year and Microsoft has teased a "major" 2026 as it prepares to celebrate the OG console's anniversary in a big way. And those plans might just include more classic Xbox titles heading to Game Pass, depending how you choose to interpret the words of Xbox's vice president of next-gen gaming devices and ecosystem, Jason Ronald.
</p>
<p>
During an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Wl8G4k6FoQ">interview with the BBC</a> about Xbox's recent ASUS handheld collaboration, the ROG Xbox Ally X, Ronald was asked about the possibility of more games from the original Xbox making their way to Game Pass. In classic senior executive fashion, his response danced around the question in wildly non-committal ways, but a charitable reading of his carefully selected words might bring hope to old-school fans.
</p>
<p>
"I can't announce anything today," he replied, "but 2026 is the 25th anniversary of Xbox. And we want to celebrate the great legacy and the history that we have with Xbox, as well as defining the future for where the Xbox ecosystem is going. So, I can't confirm or deny what you are asking, but stay tuned - we have a lot of exciting things to share next year."
</p>
<p>
"Great games are timeless and I think we not only feel a need but also a responsibility to preserve the games from the past," Ronald added elsewhere in the interview, "and enable them to be played in entirely new ways."
</p><p>
Microsoft, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/last-nights-xbox-back-compat-update-really-was-the-last-microsoft-insists">brought its backward-compatibility update efforts to an end</a> in 2021, leaving a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-backwards-compatibility-list-xbox-360-games-series-x-6400">catalogue</a> of around 630 Xbox 360 games and approximately 60 original Xbox games officially playable on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, with a variety of enhancements and improvements. However, last year brought word the company had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-sets-up-a-game-preservation-team-and-wants-the-biggest-technical-leap-ever-for-its-next-gen-system">established a new team to focus on video game preservation and forward compatibility</a>, suggesting it might be looking to future-proof even more of its library.
</p>
<p>
Whatever Microsoft's backward-compatibility plans might hold, Ronald's references to playing old games in "entirely new ways" also brings to mind its remake efforts. Next year sees the launch of Halo: Campaign Evolved, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-its-original-devs-post-conflicting-takes-on-the-controversial-remake-i-have-to-ask-who-is-halo-campaign-evolved-for">already controversial</a> remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-combat-evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>'s single-player campaign, which will mark the legendary Xbox series' PlayStation debut.

<p>Now, Red Art Games has announced that a further enhancement of the game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/romancing_saga_-minstrel_song-_remastered_international">Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- Remastered International</a> (looking forward to the International Universal edition in 2028, then) is now available on Switch consoles in both digital and physical form.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pujovq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>This latest release for the cult classic RPG is, in fact, the 2022 remaster with new localisations, so all the tweaks that version brought along are here, but there have been further fixes mixed in. Here's the full list of updates from the press release, with <strong>the new ones highlighted in bold</strong> for you:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Key Features include:</p><p>

<strong>- New French, German, Italian and Spanish localisations (International edition exclusive)</strong><br>
- Full HD graphical upgrade<br>
- New recruitable characters: Schiele, Marina, Monica and Flammar<br>
- Enhanced and more challenging bosses<br>
- High-speed mode<br>
- Mini-maps<br>
- New Game+<br>
- Japanese or English voice options via in-game menu (International edition exclusive)</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>As pointed out by Red Art, who is publishing this "in association with Square Enix", and it's important to make this doubly clear: "The key differences in <em>Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- Remastered International</em> compared to the 2022 digital release are the addition of French, German, Italian and Spanish text localisations and a number of minor bug fixes. All other game content remains identical."</p>
<p>The announcement also reiterates that "as this International edition is sold separately, players who wish to access the new European language options will need to purchase this new version physically or digitally." Which seems a bit silly, but there you have it.</p>
<p>Of course, more excitingly, we've also got some physical editions available <a href="https://www.redartgames.com/">via Red Art Games</a> (or <a href="https://videogamesplus.ca/search?type=article%2Cpage%2Cproduct&amp;q=romancing*+saga*+minstrel*+song*&amp;bg_ref=0VD60ZTsIP" rel="sponsored noopener">VGP for North America</a>) which collectors should be very interested in. The physical edition here comes in four versions: your regular old standard, a special edition which throws in a PVC keychain and reversible cover, a deluxe edition, which also throws in an exclusive sleeve with alternate cover art and a game manual.</p>

<p>There's also this snazzy collector's edition to round out the goodies, which gives you everything in the other versions plus a box with retro-inspired cover art, a steelcase, art book and three postcards. All special, deluxe and collector's copies are limited to just 500 copies per console platform, too, so don't delay if you're interested.</p>
<p>In terms of pricing, the standard edition of the game comes in at £29.95/$29.99, whilst that fancy collector's edition works the price up to £69.99 (or whatever that amounts to where you are). The digital, meanwhile, is £26.99/$29.99 on the old eShop.</p>

			<p>Even before <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/"><strong>Resident Evil Requiem was formally announced earlier this year</strong></a>, it was widely rumored that Leon Kennedy, the protagonist of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 4, would have been one of the protagonists of the ninth entry in the series. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-leon-playable-demo/">With the development team never confirming whether the character was in or not</a></strong> following the game's official announcement, however, it seemed like the rumors were wrong, but today it has been finally confirmed that the character will indeed be in the game in some capacity.</p>



<p>Leon in Resident Evil Requiem has been confirmed today via a PlayStation Store leak, which shows a new cover art for the game featuring both Grace and the beloved classic series character. The new cover art has been confirmed to be on the PlayStation Store by multiple users, so it's most likely real.</p>

<p>As the PlayStation Store has a nasty habit at leaking information about games a few days before the official announcements, there's little doubt at this point that the first footage of Leon in Resident Evil Requiem will be shown during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/"><strong>The Game Awards</strong></a>, which will take place on December 11.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-will-combat-work-in-resident-evil-requiem">How will Combat Work in Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-finally-gets-first-combat-footage-but-leon-is-nowhere-to-be-seen/"><strong>first Resident Evil Requiem combat footage</strong></a> surfaced online, showing Grace fighting enemies with a battle system that is reminiscent of that of the fourth entry in the series. As the character is likely not going to be a combat expert like a battle-hardened veteran like Leon, there's a very good chance the two characters will have access to different combat skills that should make the experience deeper, more engaging, and, most of all, more varied.</p>



<p>Although the confirmation that Leon Kennedy will be in Resident Evil Requiem is very welcome news for fans of the series (and one that will make them look even closer at the reveal trailer, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-first-trailer-hides-leon-campaign-clues-insider-claims/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">said to have the first hints of the character being in the game</strong></a>), I expected the new entry in the series to be an excellent survival horror game, nonetheless. I had the chance to try it out earlier this year during Gamescom ahead of its launch on February 27, 2026, on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch 2, and<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> I was thoroughly impressed by its great atmosphere and the ability to switch between first and third-person camera</strong>.</a></p>

IDC <a href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS53965725">is already predicting</a> fewer smartphone sales in 2026 due to the RAM shortage, and a $9 increase in average phone prices. Some brands, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/xiaomi-reports-22-jump-q3-revenue-2025-11-18/">like China’s Xiaomi</a>, are already warning customers of future price hikes. Laptop manufacturers may cut corners, and price increases might be coming to gaming consoles.</p><div><p>“If you are not a server customer, you will be considered a second priority.”</p></div><p>Today, just three companies — Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron — control 93 percent of the entire global DRAM market. Specifically, <a href="http://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/global-dram-and-hbm-market-share">data from Counterpoint Research shows SK Hynix</a> holding a 38 percent market share in the second quarter of 2025, followed by Samsung at 32 percent and Micron at 23 percent. No other company has more than a 5 percent share.</p><p>And the three big RAM companies seem to be in no great hurry to reverse sky-high prices; all three boasted about record revenue in their most recent earnings reports, while their net profits exploded. They don’t seem troubled that data centers are eating up RAM that’d normally appear in consumer products, either.</p><p>For Samsung, memory is bigger than most consumer products anyhow. Samsung’s memory business <a href="https://images.samsung.com/is/content/samsung/assets/global/ir/docs/2025_con_quarter03_all.pdf">raked in a record 26.7 trillion Korean won</a> (~$18.12 billion) in its most recent earnings report, making up more than a quarter of its total revenue. That’s nearly double what its entire appliance and TV business made during that time.</p><p>So far, Micron, which raked <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-technology-inc-reports-results-fourth-quarter-and-full-8">in a record-breaking $11.32 billion</a> in the fourth quarter of 2025, made the most dramatic change in response to DRAM demand. It announced that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837594/crucial-ram-ssd-micron-ai">winding down its longstanding consumer-facing brand, </a>Crucial, so it can focus on supplying AI companies with the memory they need to power their servers. “If you are not a server customer, you will be considered a second priority for memory vendors,” Gartner analyst Shrish Pant tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung and SK Hynix, the other two big DRAM companies, may have already committed 40 percent of the world’s entire memory output to a single AI project, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/openais-stargate-project-to-consume-up-to-40-percent-of-global-dram-output-inks-deal-with-samsung-and-sk-hynix-to-the-tune-of-up-to-900-000-wafers-per-month">according to <em>Tom’s Hardware</em></a>, when it <a href="https://openai.com/index/samsung-and-sk-join-stargate/">struck a deal</a> with OpenAI to supply up to 900,000 DRAM wafers per month as part of the AI giant’s Stargate infrastructure initiative.</p><p>With the AI memory boom in full swing, the big DRAM makers seem to be riding the wave to profit, too. SK Hynix’s net profits more than doubled from 5.75 trillion Korean won ($3.92 billion) <a href="https://news.skhynix.com/sk-hynix-announces-3q24-financial-results/">in Q3 2024</a> to 12.6 trillion Korean won (~$8.6 billion) <a href="https://news.skhynix.com/sk-hynix-announces-3q25-financial-results/">in Q3 2025</a>. Micron saw <em>a 10x increase</em> in its annual net income, going from $778 million in fiscal 2024 to $8.6 billion for fiscal year 2025.</p><p>To make DRAM — whether for AI companies or for consumer products — memory suppliers need silicon wafers: thin, disc-shaped materials used as the base of semiconductors, including memory chips. Part of today’s problem is that AI data centers require far more of these wafers than consumer products. Data centers gobble up DRAM to power the servers behind the world’s most advanced AI models, and they also use another kind called high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which comes packaged with high-end GPUs like Nvidia’s Blackwell Ultra chip.</p><p>Demand for these HBM-equipped AI chips isn’t slowing down. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/824111/nvidia-q3-2026-earnings-data-center-revenue">Nvidia reported selling more AI chips</a> than ever during its most recent earnings report, with some even selling out completely.</p><p>With memory suppliers earmarking production lines and silicon wafers for HBM and AI, it’s leaving “less wafer output for standard PC and consumer DRAM,” according to David Naranjo, the associate director at Counterpoint. HBM also uses up far more resources, as a report from <a href="https://nand-research.com/analyst-note-semiconductor-memory-market-supply-constraints-and-rising-prices/">NAND Research</a> states that “wafer capacity consumed by HBM exceeds that of standard DRAM by a factor of three.”</p><p>Though PC builders may be the first to experience these price hikes as the memory stick values skyrocket, the increase “could affect a broad range of industries,” Naranjo says. Lenovo is stockpiling memory as part of an attempt to “strike a balance between price and availability” for customers next year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-24/lenovo-stockpiling-pc-memory-due-to-unprecedented-ai-squeeze">according to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, and Dell and HP are planning to make adjustments, too. During an earnings call last month, <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/data-center/2025/dell-technologies-coo-jeff-clarke-says-price-increases-coming-as-unprecedented-memory-shortage-takes-hold">Dell CEO Jeff Clarke said</a> the company is “going to do everything we can to minimize the impact, but the fact is, the cost basis is going up across all products.” Meanwhile, HP’s Enrique Lores <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/hp-to-raise-prices-lower-configurations-due-to-soaring-memory-costs">said it will try to mitigate the shortage</a> by raising prices or cutting the amount of memory it puts inside its devices.</p><p>Companies may cut other corners, too. “You may use a cheaper battery, maybe a smaller capacity battery,” Janukowicz suggests. “Display might be another area where you might look to do some cost reductions.”</p><p>Even with those potential solutions, companies might “pass along some of those price increases to consumers” anyway, says Janukowicz. That’s especially true for more affordable devices like Chromebooks and the Google Pixel 9A, since there’s less room to swap out parts that have already been cost-optimized — and that could make it harder to find budget-friendly options, period.</p><div><p>For some companies, price increases are already becoming a reality. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/831032/cyberpowerpc-maingear-ram-price-increases-pc-gaming">Custom PC builders CyberPowerPC </a>and Maingear have said they will have to raise prices due to the surging cost of RAM, and <a href="https://x.com/FrameworkPuter/status/1993202082795733134?s=20">so will modular laptop company Framework</a>. Even Raspberry Pi, which makes single-board computers, has been forced to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/836221/raspberry-pi-price-increases-ram-costs">increase the price of its newer devices</a>, while gaming handheld maker OneXPlayer <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/onexplayer-apex-amd-strix-halo-handhelds-gets-200-price-hike-before-launch-due-to-rising-memory-costs">announced plans</a> to raise the price of its latest device <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/onexplayer-pauses-strix-halo-apex-handheld-sales-as-memory-and-ssd-costs-climb">before halting sales completely</a>.</p></div><p>Concerns are growing around the price of the highly anticipated Steam Machine, too, as Valve’s Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/valve-says-that-the-steam-machines-price-will-be-more-in-line-with-current-pc-market-182213173.html">has said</a> it will be “in line with the current PC market.” Leaker Moore’s Law is Dead suggests Microsoft will price hike <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">the Xbox Series X yet again</a> due to the shortage; it already costs $150 more than it did at launch five years ago.</p><p>PC builders looking to upgrade are seeing memory prices double, triple, even quadruple. For example, G. Skill’s Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5-6000 RAM (2x16GB) went from $124.99 in September to $389.99, according to <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/product/CXKKHx/gskill-trident-z5-neo-rgb-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr5-6000-cl30-memory-f5-6000j3038f16gx2-tz5nr">data from PCPartPicker</a>. The similarly specced Corsair Vengeance DDR5 RAM (2x16GB) cost $134.99 in September before <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/product/JkfxFT/corsair-vengeance-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr5-6000-cl30-memory-cmk32gx5m2b6000c30">spiking to $427.99 in December</a>.</p><p>SSDs, which primarily use NAND flash memory rather than DRAM, are facing similar challenges as AI companies buy up storage for their data centers as well. SK Hynix, Samsung, and Micron also make these devices, and just like with DRAM, they’re shifting focus to AI customers. “It’s really a combined problem,” says Janukowicz.</p><p>Even with rising demand for DRAM, the big three are hesitant to ramp up production. They may be taking a more careful stance after oversupply <a href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/global-semiconductor-revenues-decline-8-8-in-2023-ai-promises-gains-in-2024">took a chunk out of their revenue in 2023</a> — but they’re also holding back because it’s profitable.</p><p>A Samsung representative told investors that the company plans to “pursue a strategy of maintaining long-term profitability” instead of addressing the shortage by “rapidly expanding facilities,” <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/memory/memory-crisis-and-sky-high-dram-prices-could-run-past-2028-as-samsung-and-sk-hynix-opt-to-minimize-the-risk-of-oversupply/">as reported by <em>PCGamer</em></a>. SK Hynix <a href="https://news.skhynix.com/sk-hynix-announces-3q25-financial-results/">just celebrated</a> “its highest-ever quarterly performance, driven by the full-scale rise in prices of DRAM and NAND,” and pointed out that operating profit in particular “exceeded 10 trillion won for the first time in the company’s history.”</p><p><a href="https://www.sedaily.com/NewsView/2H1LMSTFMO">Korean outlet <em>Seoul Economic Daily</em></a> says SK Hynix does <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/memory/hot-on-the-heels-of-micron-bailing-out-of-the-consumer-ram-market-sk-hynix-is-apparently-committing-over-usd500-billion-to-build-four-new-memory-fabs-with-the-first-to-be-finished-by-2027/">plan to spend $500 billion</a> to build new production plants, with its first expected in 2027. <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/micron/2025/11/micron-chip-factories-in-upstate-ny-delayed-by-two-to-three-years-company-says.html">Micron is also planning</a> to build a plant in New York, though we now know that it won’t focus on making consumer-focused products. When asked whether SK Hynix plans to discontinue the production of consumer products, spokesperson Paul Jang tells <em>The Verge</em> that the company “is not considering to discontinue the related business.” Samsung didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p><p>With memory makers holding off on greater expansion, Janukowicz says prices could stay the same or continue to increase throughout 2026, while <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/ai-frenzy-is-driving-new-global-supply-chain-crisis-2025-12-03/">SK Hynix told investors</a> last week that it expects the shortage to continue through late 2027.</p><p>Either way, it’s bad timing for PC gaming enthusiasts, who just got over the hump of GPU price hikes — and it’s bad news for everyone else, too, as RAM becomes yet another reason for companies to raise prices.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/839506/ram-shortage-price-increases-pc-gaming-smartphones]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fans-think-ron-perlman-in-fallout-season-2/</link>
            <guid>1376902</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For the uninitiated, Ron Perlman has a lengthy history with the Fallout franchise. The instantly recognisable actor has contributed his gravelly vocal talents to the franchise since the first game debuted in 1997, providing the voiceover for every game’s intro sequence. The only game he never appeared in was 2004’s Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel.</p>



<p>Recently, Perlman appeared in a cast lineup at the Los Angeles premiere of Fallout’s second season, set to debut next week. This has prompted fans to assume he’s set to appear in the show in one way or another.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-ron-perlman-in-the-fallout-tv-show">Is Ron Perlman in the Fallout TV Show?</h2>



<p>Ron Perlman has voiced the introduction of almost every Fallout game. The only exception is an obscure PS2 release and 2015’s Fallout 4, in which he played the newscaster in the game’s opening chapter.</p>



<p>Last night, Perlman, who many will recognize from roles such as Hellboy and Clay Morrow from Sons of Anarchy, appeared in a star-studded image on the red carpet at the LA premiere of Fallout’s second season.</p>



<p>The show is set to land next week and will release on a once-weekly schedule, running until February 4, 2026. It’s the long-awaited second coming of the award-winning show that debuted in April 2024. I recently attended <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-revealed-what-makes-fallout-special/">a London screening</a>, and the first two episodes that I was lucky enough to see surpassed my expectations.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>As you can see in the images shared above, Perlman was almost <strong>hidden </strong>in the picture, which might suggest he nipped in at the last second.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely out of the question for Perlman to at least secure a <strong>cameo </strong>in Fallout. He has contributed to the games for almost three decades, and he’s one of the best actors in the image. Early theories suggest the actor, who was once known for his dominating frame, could be playing a Super Mutant character.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress that not everyone who attends these screenings and premieres of Fallout’s second season is in the show. At the London screening, Aaron Paul was in the audience, and that’s just because he’s a fan.</p>

                <p>The Analogue 3D is earning high praise as one of the best 4K N64 emulators ever made, and it'll soon be available in a wide range of "funtastic" colors. As part of a highly limited-edition release, Analogue will offer its console with transparent shells designed to emulate the look of classic N64 consoles from the 2000s. Priced at $300 each, these will launch alongside matching 8BitDo controllers on December 10 at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET and will be delivered before Christmas.</p><p>Analogue says it spent over a year getting the colors just right for this release, and it collaborated with 8BitDo to replicate the look of the Funtastic originals. There'll be eight colorways to choose from: Jungle, Ice, Watermelon, Fire, Grape, Clea, Smoke, and a Gold model inspired by the legendary Toys R Us N4 console that collectors highly covet. The 8BitDo controllers will also be released in the same color set.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619646-le_funtastic_img04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4619646" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619646-le_funtastic_img04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4619646"></a><figcaption>Analogue 3D console</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619646-le_funtastic_img04.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619656-le_funtastic_img05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619654-le_funtastic_img03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619653-le_funtastic_img02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619652-le_funtastic_img01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619651-le_8bitdo_img3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619650-le_8bitdo_img2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619649-le_8bitdo_img1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4619656,1300-4619654,1300-4619653,1300-4619652,1300-4619651,1300-4619650,1300-4619649" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4619656-le_funtastic_img05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4619654-le_funtastic_img03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4619653-le_funtastic_img02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4619652-le_funtastic_img01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4619651-le_8bitdo_img3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4619650-le_8bitdo_img2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4619649-le_8bitdo_img1.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619656-le_funtastic_img05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619654-le_funtastic_img03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619653-le_funtastic_img02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619652-le_funtastic_img01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619651-le_8bitdo_img3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619650-le_8bitdo_img2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4619649-le_8bitdo_img1.jpg"></figure><p>If you'd prefer a regular version of the Analogue 3D in black or white, it is being restocked on December 10 as well.

            <p>Cloud's Buster Sword is one of the most iconic features in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>. Even those who don't know the series that well will surely recognise the whopping great blade the blond-haired hero has strapped to his back, ready to deploy when the time calls for it.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that the Final Fantasy 7 Remake developers actually once considered giving Cloud a more realisticly-proportioned sword. Thankfully for us all, though, the team decided against it.</p>

<p>In a conversation with French gaming personality Julien Chièze, Final Fantasy 7 Remake director Naoki Hamaguchi said the team considered "the aspect of the weight" that would come with lugging the Buster Sword around (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/square-enix-director-naoki-hamaguchi-considered-giving-cloud-strife-a-more-realistic-sword-for-final-fantasy-7-remake-but-decided-jrpg-fans-wouldnt-accept-it-we-stayed-faithful-to-the-og/">GamesRadar</a>).</p>
<p>"How Cloud swings it around with one hand that sort of felt like it would weaken the sense of realism, you know," the developer explained. "So at the time, when we were making Remake, there was some discussion about whether we should give Cloud a more realistic version of the Buster Sword."</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, the team realised that the Buster Sword is "just too iconic", and if Remake released and the developer had decided to give Cloud a more ordinary and realistically sized sword, "players wouldn't accept it".</p>
<p>"In the end we stayed faithful to the OG," Hamaguchi said, before adding: "A whole new generation of people fell in love with it, so I think it was the right call."</p>

<p>And, right call it was. Final Fantasy 7 Remake, which launched on 10th April 2020 as a PlayStation exclusive, reached the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-hits-5m-sold">five million sales mark after four months</a>. It went on to be released across additional platforms, of course boosting sales further. The game is due to be released on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, though the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-on-switch-2-is-a-game-key-card-thatll-fill-a-third-of-your-consoles-storage-space">physical release of Final Fantasy 7 Remake will be on a game key card and take up around a third of the console's storage capacity</a>.</p>
<p>"An expansive remake that treads carefully upon this most cherished of games, though some blunders will linger long in the memory," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Aoife Wilson wrote in Eurogamer's original Final Fantasy 7 Remake review</a>.</p>

<p>Holidays are coming</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>You know the festive season is well and truly here when No Gravity Games announces its annual 'Switchmas Giveaway', where the studio dishes out a selection of its back catalogue <em>for free</em>.</p>
<p>Well, the time is almost upon us once more, as No Gravity Games has announced that this year's giveaway will kick off on <strong>12th December</strong>, with one free game available each and every day until 18th December, before the event wraps up with a whopping <em>three freebies</em> on 19th.</p>
<p>As ever, there are a few hoops you'll need to jump through if you want to add every game in the giveaway to your library. Firstly, the giveaway is only for those with a <strong>North American eShop account</strong>. Secondly, you need to own <em>any game</em> from the No Gravity Games portfolio to get the offer up and running — and that includes the one you can get for free by signing up to the company's newsletter.</p>
<p>We'll be updating this post with the full list of this year's free games, though you can check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/12/no-gravity-games-wraps-up-winter-giveaway-with-final-two-free-switch-games-north-america">last year's line-up</a> to get an idea of what's in store.</p>
<p>The giveaway works on a chain basis, where you have to redeem each day's freebie if you want to be entitled to the next drop. No Gravity Games will list the free game of the day on the eShop with a '100% off' discount for 24 hours, and will keep it "heavily discounted" the next day, so you have a chance to buy back into the chain if you forget to download one day.</p>
<p>To be clear, these giveaways are rarely packed with blockbuster hits, but if you're keen to beef up your Switch library and don't want to spend a penny while doing it, you might want to follow along.</p>
<p><em>Will you be taking part in this year's No Gravity Games giveaway? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section>
