<p>One of the worst-kept secrets is out in the open—Forza Horizon 5 is coming to the PS5. We know its release period, and the developer has already discussed the game’s release time details and brand-new content on the way.</p>



<p>The Xbox and PlayStation partnership continues to blow minds in 2025. The two companies have waged war for two decades across numerous generations of Xbox and PlayStation consoles. But the tides have turned in the last few years. We’re seeing more Xbox exclusives and Microsoft-owned titles come to the PS5.</p>



<p>Halo is rumored to be coming to PlayStation, as are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War and Hellblade</a>. One title we can tick off though is Forza Horizon 5. The Horizon series (and Forza Motorsport) have battled against PlayStation’s Gran Turismo for years, but now the racer has turned a corner.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-forza-horizon-5-coming-to-ps5">Is Forza Horizon 5 Coming to PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Beauties. Credit to Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Forza Horizon 5 is coming to PlayStation 5 and it marks the first time a Forza title has ever been released on a PlayStation console.</strong></p>



<p>We thought the official announcement was coming in 2024, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-was-ready-but-delayed-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5 PS5 Release was apparently delayed</a>. The news finally arrived on January 30 to say <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5 is on its way to PS5</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-5-release-period">Forza Horizon 5 Release Period</h2>



<p><strong>Spring 2025 is the release period for Forza Horizon on PS5.</strong></p>



<p>The season of Spring is considered <strong>March, April, and May</strong>, meaning Forza Horizon 5 isn’t far away. I can hear the tires screeching in the distance it’s that close. As the weeks fly by faster than a Lamborghini, we’re sure to get a more accurate release date for you to write down in your diary.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as we learn the latest on Forza Horizon 5’s release date. </p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-forza-horizon-5-s-release-times">Do we Know Forza Horizon 5’s Release Times?</h2>



<p>Official release times haven’t been released yet, but developer Playground Games has said to “<strong>Wishlist Forza Horizon 5 on the PlayStation Store&nbsp;today to stay informed about updates and release times.</strong>“</p>



<p>This is significant because it makes me believe we may be getting different release times everywhere. Again, stay tuned for updates on Forza Horizon 5’s release time for PS5.</p>



<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-5-horizon-realms-content">Forza Horizon 5 Horizon Realms Content</h2>



<p><strong>Horizon Realms is a completely new piece of content for Forza Horizon 5, and it’s “a curated collection of some of the community’s favorite previously released Evolving Worlds.”</strong></p>



<p>That’s not all though as the <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">developer is also promising</a> “<strong>other surprises</strong>” too. The content is releasing alongside all “the same content as the Xbox and PC releases of the game.” PlayStation 5 players have a lot of gameplay to look forward to and a lot of rubber to burn!</p>



<hr>



<p>I’ve primarily been a PlayStation and occasional Nintendo fan in my life, making Forza Horizon 5 my first foray into Forza. How about you? Is this going to be a debut drive? Or have you already racked up a ton of mileage?</p>



<p>We have even more rumors of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-playstation-exclusives-are-coming-to-xbox-next-year-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox games coming to PlayStation</a>, and we already know other Xbox and Bethesda games are PS5-bound: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-be-on-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-free-dlss-frame-generation-mod/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skyrim-gets-free-dlss-frame-generation-mod.1096788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-free-dlss-frame-generation-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly two years since PureDark started <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-mod-for-tes-v-skyrim-is-out-now-alpha-build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releasing</a> his DLSS Frame Generation mods with The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. While the regular DLSS mod is available for free, the Frame Generation one was locked to his Patreon subscribers.</p>
<p>At last, the Community Shaders team has <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/140199" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a free version of DLSS FG for Skyrim. This is based on the NVIDIA Streamline plugin; however, due to a long-standing DX11 bug that exists for DLSS FG and Reflex, NVIDIA's technology isn't actually lowering the latency. According to the CS team, this isn't a big issue if your frame rate is already running over 60 frames per second, though, of course, they still hope NVIDIA will eventually fix that bug.</p>
<p>There are a few more caveats. The mod does not support Skyrim VR (you've got space warp there, which they say is even better), is not compatible with the SSE ReShade Helper mod, and also isn't fully compatible with ReShade itself. From the mod's description:</p>
<p><em>Effects will run twice as slow, and depth effects are not supported. Basic effects are fine.</em></p>
<p>To ensure that everything is working as intended, you'll need to set the frame rate limit via SSE Display Tweaks (which is also a requirement) to half your refresh rate (rounded down).</p>
<p>The Community Shaders team acknowledged the sudden release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-adds-smooth-motion-a-driver-based-frame-generation-ai-model-for-rtx-50-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Smooth Motion</a> as a potential better way to add frame generation for the new GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards; however, this mod remains useful for GeForce RTX 40 Series owners.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Community Shaders suite was recently updated with some major graphics enhancements for Skyrim, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-true-pbr-with-community-shaders-1-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for Physically Based Rendering (PBR)</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-dynamic-cloud-shadows-thanks-to-new-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dynamic cloud shadows and skylighting</a>, just to name a few. There's more on the way, too, including a fix to unlock the amount of draw calls so that more of these graphics features can be enabled at once without crashes.</p>

The Tustin, California Micro Center store seems to have received the most stock, but other stores reportedly had 10 or less RTX 5090 cards. While Nvidia’s RTX 5080 was a little easier to purchase on launch day, cards rapidly went out of stock at retailers like Best Buy and Amazon.</p><p>One <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Microcenter/comments/1ie4y57/3_days_and_2_nights_later/">Reddit poster</a> claims to have secured an RTX 5090 after three days waiting in line, and others have posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Microcenter/comments/1idr7en/thank_you_miami_microcenter_for_the_surprise_fes/">purchase vouchers</a> that were handed out to people in line at a Miami Micro Center.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-fps-released/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-has-30-40-and-60-fps-modes-for-xbox-series-x.1096779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-fps-released/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new leak has shared that Avowed will have 30, 40, and 60 FPS Modes for the Xbox Series X.</p>



<p>Also leaked was that 30 and 40 FPS modes will also be available for the Xbox Series S.</p>



<p>The news was shared by <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a>, who shared the information from someone who appears to have got a review copy of the game (which were sent out earlier this week).</p>



<p>Avowed faced some criticism in mid-2024 following an announcement via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxBL4jTHs5w&amp;ab_channel=IronLordsPodcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Iron Lords Podcast</a> that the game would be “targeting a baseline of 30FPS,” even on the more powerful Xbox Series X. </p>



<p>“It’s a first-person, single-player game, you don’t <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-doesnt-need-60-fps-mode-says-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">necessarily need that 60 frames</a>. And that allows us to get a lot juicier with VFX and lighting and all this other stuff,” said Obsidian art director Matt Hansen. Of course, after the comments, social media blow up in rage at the lack of 60FPS, but it’s a feature that Obsidian has seemingly overcome.</p>



<p>Even so, Insider Gaming’s Senior Editor Grant-Taylor Hill got hands-on with Avowed at Gamescom 2024 and failed to see any issue with how Avowed ran. “Even in intense combat sequences filled with blasts of magic and clashing swords, the game looked brilliant on screen,” he said.</p>



<p>On social media, players seem to be happy with the leak, with some even going saying that 40fps is the best FPS for single-player console gaming.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, it’s currently unclear on if Avowed will be capped at 60FPS or not on PC.</p>



<p>Avowed releases on February 18, with its review embargo lifting on February 13. You can see more dates on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Calendar</a>. </p>



<p>What do you think of Avowed’s 30, 40, and 60 FPS options? Let us know what you think about this news on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

		<p>Ridge Racer 64 is the latest game joining the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> library of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/n64">N64</a> games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo 64 – January 2025 – Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_AB_X-Blv4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ridge Racer has always been heavily tied to the PlayStation brand – “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaBUeINW_3s">Riiiiidge Racer! Remember that one?</a>” – but Ridge Racer 64 broke that trend, bringing the arcade racer series to Nintendo 64 for the first time. While it drew upon the original Ridge Racer and Ridge Racer Revolution for some of its tracks, this wasn’t a simple port. In actual fact, the game was developed by Nintendo Software Technology – the company’s US-based team founded in 1998 – with Namco licensing the IP to the console manufacturer to develop and publish their own game. RR64 was originally only released in America and Europe.</p>


<p>The game features three different environments and a total of nine courses, which you can play in Quick Play or with a Grand Prix mode. There’s also Car Attack, Time Attack and a few multiplayer modes.</p>
<p>RR64 was ported in 2004 to Nintendo DS as Ridge Racer DS, adding things like touch-screen and wireless support, but the N64 original was skipped over for Nintendo’s Virtual Console scheme over the last few generations.</p>

<p>The game has now been brought to Nintendo Switch Online and the N64 library that is locked behind the higher priced Expansion Pack. As is often the case, online multiplayer has been retrofit into the game, allowing you to play with others online across&nbsp;Battle Mode, Stage Mode, and Team Mode.</p>

			<p>The new NVIDIA RTX Mega Geometry tech seems to bring significant performance and VRAM usage improvements even on previous generation RTX GPUs, as highlighted by a new Alan Wake 2 comparison video.</p>
<p>The video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Compusemble">Compusemble</a> puts the survival-horror game developed by Remedy running on an RTX 4090 GPU at 4K resolution with DLAA and DLSS Quality, high path tracing, and maxed-out settings running side-by-side with and without RTX Mega Geometry, which was introduced to the game with updated 1.2.8, highlighting how the new NVIDIA tech brings an average 13% improvement and a significant reduction in VRAM usage. Considering the RTX 40 series lacks the 4th generation ray tracing cores designed for RTX Mega Geometry featured in the RTX 50 series cards, the results should be even better on the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/">RTX 5090</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/msi-geforce-rtx-5080-suprim-soc-16-gb-gpu-review-superior-cooling-stunning-looks/">5080</a> GPUs and the upcoming rest of the lineup that will launch in the coming months.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2 - First RTX Mega Geometry On vs Off Performance Comparison!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_lxg6TRvn70?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The RTX Mega Geometry tech seen in action in Alan Wake 2 above is only one of the new technologies that launched together with the RTX 50 series cards. Among them is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/">Multi Frame Generation</a>, which is capable of generating more frames than the regular DLSS Frame Generation tech. NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution is also seeing a massive improvement with the introduction of a Transformer model which improves <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-super-resolution-performance-better-dlss-3-8-quality/">image quality and detail</a> considerably over the previous CNN model. Except for Multi Frame Generation, all the tech above is compatible with all RTX GPUs.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The creator of frying pan simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arctic-eggs">Arctic Eggs</a> is working on a fishing game that I am certain will replicate the act of angling in an entirely ordinary and accurate fashion. Its approach to hooks, lines, and sinkers will combine the fishing from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a>, Sega Bass Fishing, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/webfishing">Webfishing</a>, says developer The Water Museum in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewatermuseum.bsky.social/post/3lbkxvnpxmc2o">post on Bluesky</a>. It may have <a href="https://x.com/WaterMuseum_/status/1870901507857817795">a splash</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a> when it comes to inventory management too. Oh, also, <a href="https://x.com/WaterMuseum_/status/1880394328885063771">a strange man</a> might imply you are "disappointing someone". Nothing to worry about. And the ocean may or may not <a href="https://x.com/WaterMuseum_/status/1881521452324954221">turn completely red</a>. These decisions have not been finalised. Everything is okay. It is possible the fish are safe to eat.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That is the sum of what I learned from a cursory creep upon The Water Museum's social media feeds. Though it may be a deeper hole than I can account for. There are hints that you might be selling your fish or buying things <a href="https://x.com/WaterMuseum_/status/1867366841602936854">at a stall</a> (or maybe just chatting to the lady who works there?). You might have <a href="https://x.com/WaterMuseum_/status/1868098692450066667">branching conversations</a> with some of the folks you encounter. It is, we are told, <a href="https://x.com/WaterMuseum_/status/1883567851661070599">"not a horror game"</a>. </p>
<p>As I've mentioned in other posts, I enjoy seeing devs share their ongoing progress, even if the stuff they're showing off will likely change in big and small ways. It also means you get to see the fun bugs. Like this attempt to implement <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewatermuseum.bsky.social/post/3lbx56ugr7s22">"triple-A immersive wall-touching technology"</a>. </p>
<p>Again, this is early days. But I am taking note. A previous demo for another short game by the same developer, <a href="https://the-water-museum.itch.io/eating-nature-demo-playtest">Eating Nature</a>, sees you playing as a big-eyed fish yourself, swimming in a small pond and leaping haplessly onto the rocks in an attempt to catch and eat ants that come to slurp at the water's edge. It's a very small prototypey thing, but features the same crispy, low-resolution visual style of their previous game, Arctic Eggs.</p><p>Fish would appear from time to time in your frying pan in that game too, alongside eggs, bacon, cigarettes, cockroaches, and other delicacies. We didn't review the game at RPS, because we are a dwindling sack of mortals whose fingertips wear closer to the bone with every passing day. But I did play it and found it to be a fine example of strong NPC dialogue. Remember when you'd walk around an RPG town and everyone would have just one comically short line, entirely bespoke to them? It's like that. Except everyone lives in a concrete polar apartment complex and some of them are prisoners and also they yearn for cooked shards of glass. Don't overthink it. It's normal to enjoy a bit of glass. </p>
<p>No idea when the fishing game is coming out, or even what it will be called. This is okay. These are the regular stages of creation. Weep if you must, but your feelings are irrelevant. We may choose to tell you when we learn anything of actual importance. Or we may not. Goodbye.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>I had to tell you about the latest game being published by Wholesome Games, because not only is it wholesome, it might be the most British idea for a game ever. Is This Seat Taken? is a game about matching the needs of different people as you try to shove them all into places like a bus, a waiting room, or a wedding. Basically, it’s a game where you have to manage spending time with people you’d really rather not. It’s quite possibly the most delightful idea for a puzzle game I’ve seen in a long while, and you should all definitely be excited to check it out when it launches later this year for PC, iOS and Android.</p>
<p><iframe title="Is This Seat Taken? Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5Nw0qzomec?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Go on, watch the trailer. You too can’t help but want to play it, and make all these people/shapes happy. Each level gives you a batch of characters that need sorting out, all of which have different needs, either that they have high hygiene standards and will refuse to sit next to someone smelly (if only this were an option on the tube), or that they want a window seat so they can see the view. Different events and places have different requirements too, so at the cinema you have to consider whether the seats are dirty, whether people are sitting too close or too far away, or if there’s someone next to them so they can steal some popcorn. I hope you can solve that by putting someone with low standards next to a dirty seat, and they’ll eat the popcorn off it. Just me? Oh, OK.</p>
<p>There’s actually a narrative at play here, and you have to help Nat to make their way through the world, while organising everyone around them, leading them on a journey of self-discovery and correct seating plans.</p>


<p>If you too are interested in social engineering you won’t have to wait long, with a Steam demo arriving on the 10th of February. I can’t wait!</p>

			<p>A Dark Souls 3 official remaster isn't getting developed anytime soon, but from today, PC players can enjoy playing the third entry in the series by FromSoftware with some amazing visual improvements that wouldn't look amiss in an official remaster.</p>
<p>The Dark Souls 3 Visual Overhaul mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/1849?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, has been developed by fromsoftserve, the same modder behind the excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-pointlights/">Bloodborne Remaster Project</a>, and packs many of the same visual improvements, which include modified reflectance maps to fix an overly metallic look, improved SSAO, improved pointlights, dynamic shadows, removed hero lights from the player and enemies, introduces TAA via Reshade while disabling in-game AA and more. Also, these improvements are only the beginning, as the modder has plans to upscale all textures and add parallax occlusion mapping to more surfaces in the future.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dark Souls 3 Visual Overhaul is out now!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bzl0coaV3cc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Before releasing the Dark Souls 3 Visual Overhaul mod and the release announcement video above, fromsoftserve also shared a lengthy video detailing the process of improving the game's visuals and how the work on the Bloodborne Remaster Project helped. You can check it out below.</p>

<p>Dark Souls 3 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the third and, for now, final entry in the series by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dark-souls-iii-review/">review.</a></p>

            <p>
Hidden away on NASA's <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/resource/voyager-golden-record/">Golden Record</a>, an interstellar archive of music, image and sound, there is a recording of a poem by Charles Baudelaire, <a href="https://fleursdumal.org/poem/102">Élévation</a>, which describes the astral ascent of the soul. Well, part of a poem. Both to free up room on the disc and perhaps, to edit out "the vast sorrows and all the vexations" of the second half, only the first two stanzas appear. The recording in fact ends halfway through a line, which conjures up an intriguing problem for the listener, inasmuch as the thwarted rhyme scheme reveals that the piece is incomplete. A poetically-minded alien might be tempted to fill in the gap. A fancier alien who took a module in postmodernism might hail the poetics of the fragment. A resolutely practical alien who thinks poetry is for losers might read the whole thing, instead, as a set of incoherent navigational prompts, made up of loose prepositions - au-dessus, au-dessus, par delà, par delà.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I'm shamelessly piggybacking on my own academic research here. But look, it's on point. Three Verses is a grid-based first-person "typing RPG" in which you help poets finish their poems by asking various gods to supply the concluding line. "You" being a disembodied soul seeking elevation from a purgatory of royalty-free, PS1-style spaces - washed, pixel-scabbed streets tormented by metronomic trains, interiors made up of soiled slabs and motel doors. Not vast, but certainly sorrowful and vexing. Oh, and hovering synthwave mazes. And minigames featuring bubbled green cats and chunky dice. Your equipment consists of a pop-up organiser for note-taking, with phrases manually typed in. Typing is also how you'll cast spells during simple turn-based battles with creatures like door-blocking gargoyles.
</p>
<p>
The poems themselves - all awaiting recombination, with no apparent opportunity to improvise or deviate - aren't original to Three Verses. As detailed on <a href="https://d-mag.itch.io/three-verses">the Itch page</a>, which includes a free version of the game, they're lifted from Brion Gysin's Permuted Poems and Robert Ashley's TV performance Perfect Lives: an opera, among other texts. As such, the game is something of a restless archive that triangulates some interesting links between various literary traditions, a cousin of the Golden Record that, again, invites the recipient to resolve or toy with the gaps. I played about 30 minutes of the Itch demo yesterday and got stuck on a puzzle involving sewer valves. I'd like to play more, perhaps after it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3139120/THREE_VERSES/">launches on Steam</a>. Now, what would be the most obvious and obnoxious way to finish this article. Ah, of cour

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ridge-racer-64">Ridge Racer 64</a> is now available for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers.</p>
<p>Up until now, the arcade racer - the first Ridge Racer game to come to a Nintendo-flavoured console - was only playable for those who still have a Nintendo 64 hooked up.</p>

<p>Released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64, Nintendo states this "arcade classic" takes you on "fast-paced races across three different environments for a total of nine courses".</p>
<p>"Dive right in with Quick Play to race three laps around the Revolution Novice course or take on Grand Prix and choose any available track to test your skills," the blurb teases. </p>
<p>"Other modes include Car Attack, which lets you compete for better cars, and Time Attack, where the only thing you're racing against is your own best time! Challenge your friends in Multiplayer and put the pedal to the metal in three modes: Battle Mode, Stage Mode, and Team Mode."</p>
<p>Last week we learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-online-adds-three-more-snes-games-promising-puzzles-brawls-and-ninjas">Nintendo added another three classic games to its SNES Switch Online collection</a>, including one not seen in the west before: Fatal Fury 2, and Super Ninja Boy.</p>
<p>For those not in the know, Nintendo Switch Online is Nintendo's answer to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PS Plus</a>. </p>
<p>It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-must-pay-to-play-nintendo-switch-online-from-next-week">launched back in 2018</a>, and marks the first time Nintendo has locked the ability to play multiplayer games online behind a paid service.

			<p>Sony angered a lot of PC gamers when it demanded that players register for a PlayStation account in order to play some of their ports, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-will-soon-require-a-psn-account-even-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helldivers 2</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-pc-upgrade-adds-mandatory-psn-account-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-review-bombed-on-steam-amid-the-psn-linking-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God of War Ragnarok</a>, just to name a few. It wasn't just a matter of not wanting to create another account beyond those required to actually purchase the game on Steam or the Epic Games Store; there's also the simple fact that some countries aren't even supported by PlayStation Network accounts, which made those games impossible to get there.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it appears that Sony has finally heard all the negative feedback on the subject. Four big single player games, two already released, one just released, and another due soon, won't require a PSN account on PC anymore. Instead, Sony is <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implementing</a> some exclusive bonuses for those who choose to connect their PSN accounts anyway.</p>

		<p>Another mainstay Xbox franchises is coming to PlayStation, With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> set to release for PS5 this spring.</p>
<p>The port is being developed by Panic Button in collaboration with Turn 10 Studios and Playground Games, and will be like-for-like in terms of content with all the previously released car pack, and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/27/forza-horizon-5-hot-wheels-review/">Hot Wheels</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/24/forza-horizon-5-rally-adventure-expansion-revealed/">Rally Adventure</a> expansions also available.</p>


<p>This follows on from comments by Xbox boss Phil Spencer, who said in the last few weeks that “To keep games off other platforms… it’s not a path for us.” This certainly tied in with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/rumours-suggest-more-xbox-games-will-be-coming-to-ps5-and-switch/">the latest rumours</a> that had other core Xbox franchises like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-the-master-chief-collection">Halo</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag-microsoft-flight-simulator">Microsoft Flight Simulator</a> potentially coming to PlayStation, and with Bethesda’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-confirmed-for-may/">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/rumours-grow-of-starfield-indiana-jones-more-xbox-games-coming-to-ps5/">Indiana Jones</a>, and Obsidian’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/the-outer-worlds-2-is-coming-to-ps5-as-well-as-pc-and-xbox-in-2025/">The Outer Worlds 2</a> already confirmed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forza Horizon 5 Review (Xbox Series X in 4K 60fps)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KEl0KBy5I-U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Forza Horizon 5 is the latest in Playground Games’ spectacular open world arcade racing spin-off to the main Forza Motorsport series. Where previous games took us to Australia and the UK, Forza Horizon 5 takes players to a gorgeous approximation of Mexico, really showcasing the variety of environments that you can find in the country.</p>

<p>Originally released in late 2021 across Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and PC, t<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/halo-infinite-20-million-players-forza-horizon-5-18-million-but-how-many-bought-the-games/">he game set records for Xbox Game Pass at the time</a>. It’s over three years old now, and has had countless updates, car packs and a pair of great expansions as well. PlayStation 5 owners are in for a treat when it arrives.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/04/forza-horizon-5-review-xbox-series-x/">Forza Horizon 5 review</a>, we scored the sequel a sublime 9 out of 10 with Dom saying, “Forza Horizon 5 continues the series’ legacy, usurping Forza Horizon 4 as the new pinnacle of open-world racing and as a graphical showcase for the new generation of Xbox console.”</p>

He thought he could stare at a light burning the question “Who is alive?” (the title of the episode) into his eyes and the afterimage would last long enough that his Innie would momentarily be able to see it. He gets an F for effort from us, and thankfully some helpful advice from Regabhi (Karen Aldridge), the former Lumon employee who helped Petey (Yul Vazquez) reintegrate.</p><p>After letting him know that the severance switch dilating his pupils would mean the afterimage would be erased, that going this route could blind him, and that Innie Mark would have no way of communicating back to him, she tells him his wife Gemma (Dichen Lachman) was alive the last time she saw her. Then, she gives him one glimmer of hope of reconnecting with her: reintegration.</p><p>The last time we heard about reintegration was when Petey described it to Mark as “having two different lives suddenly stitched together” in Season 1. Unfortunately for Petey, his reintegration led to hallucinations of his past on the Severed Floor and in his present in the outside world, frequent nosebleeds, crippling paranoia, and his eventual death in a convenience store bathroom. Those reintegration scenes were heartbreaking because you could see a man struggling to trust who he is at any given moment, showing the most devastating effects of the severance process. </p><p>Regabhi assures Mark she’s improved her reintegration process, and we get our first glimpse of how this mysterious procedure works. She wires Mark up to a complex arrangement of equipment that monitors his brainwaves while asking him a series of questions to see when his Innie memory merges with his Outie’s. The Mark from the outside could probably tell you his date of birth instantly, but the Innie Mark would have no idea. That’s why him forgetting and then later implying he only knows time by business quarters were signs of his reintegration working. Then, we see his first memory at Lumon—him being interviewed by Petey the same way he interviewed Helly R (Britt Lower) on her first day—but this time his clothes glitch between his Severed Floor attire and his present-day attire, and his environment switches between Regabhi’s basement and Lumon. For a second, we see a severed employee dressed in their severed attire in the outside world. Reintegration is complete...somewhat.</p><p>The show exploring reintegration with a character it showed us was indispensable to Lumon in last week’s episode could mean we see the first Innie-Outie team-up on <em>Severance</em>. Regabhi does say the only way to get information in and out of the Severed Floor is through reintegration, so we could see the lengths of reintegration’s powers. </p><p>With Innie Dylan George (Zach Cherry) spending time with his Outie’s wife in the Family Visitation Center, Helly R’s mysterious behavior prompting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/s/Ugd4dzH6UH&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/s/Ugd4dzH6UH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit message boards</a></span> to question if it’s really her, and now Mark reintegrating, this season of <em>Severance </em>is quickly shaping up to be one in which the inseparability of the Innies and the Outies leads to the truth coming out...for better or worse. Let’s just hope Mark doesn’t bleed out at Pip’s.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The streamer announced the news <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1861071895484879274">via social media</a> and <a href="https://corp.rumble.com/blog/dr-disrespect-will-lead-rumble-gaming-join-rumble-premium/">Rumble confirmed it in a press release</a>, stating that the streamer will provide a mix of free and paid content for the platform as well as “acting as an advisor and helping to build the Rumble Gaming community.”</p><p>The move to Rumble is the latest development in the Dr Disrespect streaming saga that began four years ago. In 2020, Dr Disrespect, whose real name is Herschel “Guy” Beahm, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304907/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-no-reason-given">was banned from Twitch with little explanation</a> mere months after signing a multi-million dollar exclusivity deal. Earlier this year, <em>The Verge</em> and other outlets broke the news that the reason for his ban was due to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">inappropriate conversations Beahm had with a minor</a>. Beahm <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185821/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation-inappropriate-messages">denied any wrongdoing</a> stating that there were no “real intentions” behind the messages. He then took a two-month break before returning to stream on YouTube. In response to the allegations, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/28/24188157/dr-disrespect-youtube-channel-demonetization-partner-program">YouTube suspended monetization on his channel</a> and his membership in YouTube’s partner program and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/26/youtube-rejects-dr-disrespects-application-to-re-monetize/">denied his appeal to re-monetize his channel</a> late last month.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305606/dr-disrespect-rumble-streaming-youtube-twitch">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjMxNjI=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/28/24188157/dr-disrespect-youtube-channel-demonetization-partner-program">YouTube is stopping Dr Disrespect’s channel from making money</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by David Becker / Getty Images</cite></p></div><div><p>Dr Disrespect’s YouTube channel has been demonetized.

And the lead image for that story on Gamerant.com is EA's logo. Yet on this Facebook post promoting that same story <em>Dragon Age</em> is mentioned before <em>EAFC</em>, <em>Dragon Age</em> is used as the background of the image, and front and centre is a picture of a <em>Dragon Age</em> character.

            <p>
Midnight Society, the studio co-founded by controversial streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm, is shutting its doors, four months after making "significant" layoffs. The news comes as Google announces it's lifting Beahm's YouTube monetisation ban, which was put in place following his admission of "inappropriate" behaviour with a "minor" last year.
</p>
<p>
Midnight Society was founded by Beahm and former Call of Duty community manager Robert Bowling in 2021, and the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-footage-of-deadrop-from-the-nft-fuelled-developer-backed-by-dr-disrespect">announced its first title</a> - free-to-play vertical extraction shooter Deaddrop - the following year. Development on Deadrop has continued since then, but 2024 proved challenging for the studio amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">Beahm's admission</a> he exchanged "messages with an individual minor back in 2017" that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate".

Bowling and Midnight Society were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-ousted-from-own-studio-as-new-twitch-ban-allegations-surface">quick to distance themselves from Beahm</a> when the allegations around his behaviour first surfaced, but the studio was seemingly unable to weather the resulting storm. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-studio-midnight-society-confirms-significant-layoffs-due-to-multiple-unexpected-challenges">announced "significant" layoffs in September</a>, blaming "multiple unexpected challenges in recent months." And now Midnight Society is shutting down.
</p>
<p>
"Today, we are announcing Midnight Society will be closing its doors after three incredible years, with an amazing team of 55 developers contributing to our new IP Deadrop," the studio wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1885061680398213160">statement shared on social media</a>, adding it is "actively seeking other game studios that would be interested in offering employment opportunities to our talented team members."
</p>
<p>
"We express our sincere gratitude to each and every one of our community members," the developer concluded, "and [are] deeply sorry we were unable to reach our ultimate goal."
</p>
<p>
Midnight Society's closure coincides with the news Google has lifted its suspension preventing Beahm from monetising his YouTube channel. The channel was initially demonetised following Beahm's admission of "inappropriate" behaviour with a "minor" last June, and Google chose to uphold that suspension following an appeal in October - despite Beahm's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-returns-insisting-conversations-with-minor-were-inappropriate-jokes-taken-out-of-context">attempts to backtrack on his statement</a> a month earlier, when he began referring to the messages as "jokes". Now, however, Google has announced a reversal of its decision.
</p><p>
"DrDisrepsect was previously suspended from the YouTube Partner Program for violations of our Creator Responsibility policies," it wrote in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lgykx4q7zc2k">statement shared by Kotaku's Ethan Gach</a> . "Creators who are suspended from this program can reapply for access, and after careful review of the channel's recent activity, we've reinstated it. If there are further violations, we'll take appropriate action." Google did not specify what had changed since last year's appeal.
</p>
<p>
"What a fucking weird world, huh?", Beahm said in a stream following YouTube's reversal (via <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-twitch-ban-minor-youtube-monetization-1851752083">Kotaku</a>). "On the day that Midnight Society closes, we get monetisation. What a fucking trip."
