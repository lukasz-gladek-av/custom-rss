Back as f**k" in regards to the Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal trailer. He clarified in another post that it's <a href="https://twitter.com/locust9/status/1950990958914363485" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too soon to say</a> if Battlefield 6 will indeed be the return to form that it may appear to be. "For sure, we are not back until, you know, we can verify firsthand. But optically, we are back," he said.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Battlefield series is known for destructive environments and combined-arms combat across large-scale maps, but for the first time in several years, Battlefield 6 returns the franchise to the modern era for an entry that has the potential to be a proper successor to Battlefield 3 and 4. Major environmental destruction is back, and the game steps away from the unpopular specialist operators of Battlefield 2042 in favor of the more traditional class system.</p><p dir="ltr">"We loved Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4, and we wanted Battlefield 6 to be inspired by that," VP and executive producer Christian Grass said when discussing the studio's focus for the game. "We wanted to make sure we nailed the tactical destruction system, we wanted the classes to be great, and we wanted the core combat system to be the best we've ever created."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Combat, Classes &amp; Destruction Breakdown Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"We knew what we knew what we needed to do in the beginning," Ripple Effect creative director Thomas Anderson added. "To take the best parts of Battlefield 3 and 4 and just push those to quality."</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 dives back into this modern setting with a global conflict that provides a pleasant variety of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-maps/2900-6834/">map locations</a>. We were able to get hands-on with five different maps across various modes. We fought gritty, close-quarters fights in the streets of New York on the Empire State map, while Liberation Peak served as a large, mountainous landscape with tons of wide-open spaces for snipers. Siege of Cairo is a sprawling desert map for large-scale modes like Conquest, but we also played a smaller slice of the locale for the more condensed Squad Deathmatch mode. These smaller maps are pulled from the larger map designs, but placement of objects and how destruction is used has been altered to fit the smaller play area.</p><p dir="ltr">The Squad Deathmatch mode provides the opportunity to step away from Battlefield's typical large-scale warfare and go for a more hectic pace with in-your-face action moments that feel more in line with an experience you’d get from a Call of Duty multiplayer match. These feature four squads of four fighting on small maps to be the first to rack up a certain number of kills. You still have roles to play in Squad Deathmatch, and with such close-quarters action and more opportunities to die, the medic-style Support class is very useful here.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, Battlefield 6's large-scale modes are where the game shines. Our multiplayer session included the familiar modes of Conquest, Domination, and Breakthrough. This is where the destruction feels more impactful, as certain buildings can serve as power positions to hold flags, but you can change the direction of the fight by simply collapsing all the floors with well-aimed rockets or a grenade launcher. I've always found the destruction in older Battlefield games to be extremely satisfying, and it feels even more so in Battlefield 6. Targeting a building often doesn't just take away the frontside or a specific chunk; you can collapse several floors and sometimes an entire building of a structure on top of opponents. And that makes it a significant hazard to watch out for when moving through interior spaces.</p><p dir="ltr">Tanks can now more easily drive through structures as well. Enemies behind a wall? No problem: You can just drive a tank right through concrete walls to take them out, while also forging new pathways for your teammates. Tanks were really fun to drive and use to bully right through enemy defenses. As for air support, I'm the pilot most likely to crash and wipe my whole squad. From what I can tell, flying vehicles seem like a blast to use; helicopters and jets were crashing everywhere in a way only Battlefield does.</p><p dir="ltr">All of these destructive and cinematic moments come at a cost, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-skipping-ps4-and-xbox-one/1100-6533611/">Battlefield 6 is moving away from last-generation consoles</a>. When discussing the improvements in technology, Christian Grass said, "It's really difficult from a technological and balancing point of view to create the package that is Battlefield. There are so many things that are competing in terms of computation power that we need. The vision of Battlefield 6 wouldn't have been possible on the previous generation."</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of the destruction elements, another Battlefield signature is its class system with weapons tied to each role. Being an Engineer once meant you had to use a submachine gun if you wanted to repair tanks, or you'd need to wield a light machine gun if you wanted to play a support role for the match. Now, Battlefield 6 aims to break that mold without losing the feel of the class-based roles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542165-bf68large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4542165" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542165-bf68large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4542165"></a><figcaption>Tanks in Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542165-bf68large.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542166-bf61large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542167-bf62large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542168-bf63large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542169-bf64large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542170-bf65large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542171-bf66large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542172-bf67large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542173-bf69large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4542166,1300-4542167,1300-4542168,1300-4542169,1300-4542170,1300-4542171,1300-4542172,1300-4542173" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542166-bf61large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542167-bf62large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542168-bf63large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542169-bf64large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542170-bf65large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542171-bf66large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542172-bf67large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542173-bf69large.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542166-bf61large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542167-bf62large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542168-bf63large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542169-bf64large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542170-bf65large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542171-bf66large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542172-bf67large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542173-bf69large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The traditional class system was one of the loudest talking points prior to Battlefield 6's reveal. Originally, the developers announced that every weapon would be available regardless of class, but there was backlash from the community, as many players didn't want the game to lean away from the traditional Battlefield class system. Battlefield Studios listened, and now players will have the freedom to choose between having weapons unlocked or choosing a classic weapon-locked system for Battlefield 6.</p><p dir="ltr">As someone who's played a ton of Battlefield games over the years, I was curious which way I'd lean in the great class debate. We spent around seven to eight hours playing the Battlefield 6 closed beta, and I often found myself choosing to go outside the specialized weapons for the Support and Engineering classes. Honestly, call me a Battlefield disloyalist if you want, but I rarely wanted to use a light machine gun when playing Support, and I almost never wanted a submachine gun when playing as an Engineer on the large-scale maps and modes. That's not to say that the submachine guns don't feel great, but I preferred to use them when playing in close-quarters scenarios on the smaller Squad Deathmatch maps.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer says the choice for locked or unlocked weapons will be available in the beta and at launch. Additionally, there are no XP penalties for choosing one option or the other. "We're confident in our design," Andersson said, "But if people don't agree or a niche of players don't agree, they can play [weapons locked.]” "They can play however they want," Grass said, jumping in. "We're happy as long as you're having a good time playing Battlefield 6."</p><p dir="ltr">Each class will still have its own role to play, and my time with Battlefield 6 never felt like I wasn't playing a meaningful class type when I did swap my weapons. However, it can be beneficial to stick with a class's specialized weapons, as you get trait bonuses for using that weapon type. For example, the Recon class rewards snipers with faster rechambering between shots, decreased scope speed, and improved breath control to stabilize aim for longer. Non-Recon players who use a sniper might feel at a slight disadvantage, but they can still complement that weapon choice with other tools available to their class.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the specialization bonuses, each class comes with its own unique gadgets and a special class-specific Active Ability that can be used and recharged over time. For example, the Recon class features the Active Ability to call in a UAV, and the Engineer Active Ability allows you to repair more efficiently for a limited time.</p><p dir="ltr">Movement is also improved in Battlefield 6. The game features what Battlefield Studios call a "Kinesthetic Combat System," which is basically a whole mouthful just to say there are new maneuvering actions to help you excel on the battlefield. With this updated system you can now peek and lean around corners, mount weapons against a surface to reduce recoil, hitch a ride on the sides of tanks, and even drag teammates while simultaneously reviving them. These actions are very situational, but the most impactful is the ability to drag and revive downed friendlies while moving them to the safety of cover. I definitely saved more lives during my time with Battlefield 6, and it really makes you feel like a hero while performing these revives .</p><p dir="ltr">These are early impressions that point to a strong start for Battlefield's return to a modern landscape. It's also worth mentioning that this beta build of the game felt extremely polished, and I didn't encounter any lag or performance issues. Out of the several hours played, I only experienced one instance of a bugged optic on my assault rifle, which caused a prismatic color pattern to appear in the scope and block my view.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, we only got to play a handful of maps and modes, with a total of nine maps confirmed for launch, including the return of Battlefield 3's Operation Firestorm. The popular game mode Rush is also confirmed to return, but we didn't get a chance to play it at the reveal. There is still content yet to be seen, and we also don't yet have a good indication of what the game's post-launch content might look like.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked if the game would keep thematically appropriate skins and bundles for Battlefield 6, or if they had plans to add wacky Call of Duty-style bundles, Grass said, "Battlefield 6 is a modern military shooter." The developer also referenced the skins designed for the premium Phantom Edition of Battlefield 6, which are soldiers in black suits that still keep the style and gear of modern military uniforms. Of course, that doesn't mean the future won't include something a bit more outlandish. "We're talking about now and not necessarily the future, but we are a modern military shooter," Grass reiterated.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, my early impressions for Battlefield 6 suggests a strong return to the modern-day setting and a positive step towards balancing the classic experience with updated mechanics and freedom for all playstyles. All the big action moments are there, the destruction is exciting and more impactful than ever, and the gunplay feels solid. So far, it's shaping up to be the more direct successor to the beloved Battlefield 3 and 4 that many fans have been waiting for.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>COVID has hung like an albatross around <em>Death Stranding’s </em>neck<em> </em>since lockdown. The original game was released, almost prophetically, at a time when people were exclusively connecting online, akin to the chiral network that players are tasked to complete. Like 9/11 and the social violence of misinformation on the internet in <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em>, <em>Death Stranding</em> accidentally wielded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lathe_of_Heaven" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lathe of Heaven</a> more powerfully than it ever had before in any Kojima-directed game. But being anchored to a physically and mentally traumatic event that everyone on Earth experienced is a difficult thing to build a sequel on. Kojima himself has said in the 2022 announcement that <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>was already written prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, but that he rewrote the entire thing from scratch following that experience.</p><p>“I also didn’t want to predict any more future, so I rewrote it” Kojima joked at the 2022 Game Awards through a translator. The trailer ended with the uncertain tagline: Should we have connected?</p><figure><figcaption>Man this game is pretty. Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s a strange thing to call a Kojima game “breezy,” let alone the follow up to <em>Death Stranding.</em> But there is a simple joy that permeates <em>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach: </em>winking fun that, while present in the man’s entire career, is now fully unleashed like an unruly dog. In <em>Death Stranding 2</em>, Kojima is having a blast. It is a joy that I find infectious, and the correct choice tonally given everything that the first <em>Death Stranding </em>had come to represent.</p><p>When <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>was announced it was done in a shockingly straightforward way. While there were hints of its development, none of the normal puzzle box horseshit that Kojima pulls was on display here: no <a href="https://metalgear.fandom.com/wiki/Joakim_Mogren" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mummified Joakim Mogren,</a> <a href="https://metalgear.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_Gear_Rising:_Revengeance/ARG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no fake severed USB drive arms</a>, no <a href="https://metalgear.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_Gear_Rising:_Revengeance/ARG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beguiling trailer hidden inside one of the best short horror games ever made</a>. Just the man stating in a matter of fact way that they were making another one of those, and asking, are you ready for more? I wasn’t sure, given the bloated ending of the original <em>Death Stranding</em>. But the ease of that simple announcement belied a sensation that has carried through the entirety of my second playthrough, a commitment to lean into the things that were fun in the first game and throw out or tweak the things that weren’t.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Death Stranding 2 Full Presentation with Hideo Kojima | The Game Awards 2022" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iAB___ZxgmM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><h3><strong>“The blues they send to meet me won’t defeat me”</strong></h3><figure><figcaption>Showertime. Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Death Stranding 2 </em>picks up following the events of the first game, with Sam (played by Norman Reedus) raising Lou (aka BB-28) in a shelter near Mexico. Lou is now a toddler, and Sam is a doting single father. Fragile (played by Léa Seydoux) enters into Sam’s life once again, trying to get the legendary porter back into the game to help connect Mexico to the Chiral Network. After getting back into the swing of things tragedy strikes, and Sam goes back to his old ways as a means of just moving forward, this time connecting the continent of Australia to the network.&nbsp;</p><p>It is not particularly easy or illuminating to summarize the events of the first <em>Death Stranding</em>, although the game does have a rough summary of what went down in case it’s been a minute. It is unfortunately a game that requires, bare minimum, binging a big Youtube compilation of the cutscenes if you haven’t played the first. It is also a pointedly similar game to the first one, with the same core gameplay loop and boss structure.</p><p>Sam still schleps between unconnected shelters and bases like the most daring deliverista-slash-FIOS-technician (his job itself a modern interpretation of <a href="https://www.japan.travel/national-parks/plan-your-visit/guides-and-stories/ozes-mighty-bokka-porters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Japanese porters known as Bokka</a>). You are rewarded with new tools and resources by increasing the connections between people, and those resources can be then invested into building the infrastructure of the world in the form of roads, buildings, monorails, and now mines. You also will have to fight an occasional big sloppy field boss fight (which can be straight up skipped) or a series of complex boss fights akin to the Mads Mikkelsen fights in the first game, with the Clifford Unger character instead being replaced by Luca Marinelli doing his best <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/even-death-stranding-2s-luca-marinelli-was-fooled-by-his-solid-snake-appearance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impression of Snake from <em>Metal Gear Solid</em></a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>I have seen the game called iterative by some and “the same game” by others. I think the first part is technically true but misses the point and the latter is a little uncharitable but speaks to something important. Namely, that the quality of life improvements in the Director’s Cut and the global brain damage of COVID can make it difficult for anybody but diehard fans to parse what is actually new in this game. But I should be clear that <em>Death Stranding 2</em> is categorically a better and more enjoyable game than its predecessor. The first <em>Death Stranding </em>took its sweet time to get off the ground, whereas <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>comfortably shoves you into what would normally be the midgame, with vehicles and weapons given to you early.&nbsp;</p><p>Combat in the first game was largely something to be avoided, lest killing an NPC cause what’s called a voidout—a giant temporary crater that happens in the universe when a dead body is not properly disposed of. <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>tacitly acknowledges that, while interesting, the experience itself of avoiding combat wasn’t as fun as going clown mode on a base of baddies. Weapons are implausibly non-lethal by default now, and the game just throws more tools than you can handle to deal with enemy threats. The grenade launcher is an MVP, and I found myself using it as a “get out of jail free” card in tough situations, but I found myself preferring melee whenever possible. There is an argument to be made that the game is “<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/death-stranding-2-is-too-damn-easy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too easy</a>” (I disagree with this a little when you hit the big ass mountain), but to me the game hews closer to the large open world of <em>Metal Gear Solid V</em>, a game that I feel has been more harshly reappraised in the years since its release but one that I still find a joy to play.</p><p>I thank my lucky stars that I did not have to review this game under embargo. <em>Death Stranding 2, </em>like its predecessor, is a game that is not structured to be rushed. There is an even greater emphasis on infrastructure this time around, and the decreased stress of every interaction gives it an almost cozy feeling. I refused to continue in any story mission until a road to that destination had been at least halfway built, and by the time I hit credits I had built every road and monorail, restored every mine, found every base, and built what was functionally a zipline ski resort on top of the one giant snowy mountain that takes up 50 percent of the mass of Australia. I clocked over 90 hours in the game, and at no point did I tire of it.</p><h3><strong>“Something special, just for you.”</strong></h3><figure><figcaption>The gang's all here.

As the game goes on, the ship collects characters from the previous game as well as newly introduced ones, including the captain Tarman whose likeness is based on <em>Mad Max</em> director George Miller. This conceit is the beating heart of the game, as characters are no longer isolated individuals trapped in their respective spaces, but friends and comrades working towards a common goal.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>George Miller provides the likeness for Tarman and is voiced by Marty Rhone. Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>Of all the new cast members, the one you interact with the most is Dollman. Dollman is a guy whose Ka, or soul, was trapped inside a doll. His body moves in a troubling, jerky way which makes him appear as though he is animated via stop motion. He also serves the same purpose that codex calls in previous Kojima games; a means to keep the player on track with the most obnoxious and obvious exposition humanly possible.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Dollman is voiced by Jonathan Roumie and his likeness is based on director Fatih Akin. Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>At first this made me deeply loathe Dollman, but I am pleased to report that I was wrong. Dollman rocks. He’s like if Jigsaw’s puppet Billy was your homie; a chipper bit of positivity and a more enjoyable vehicle for information. When the game lets you know that you can chuck his ass into the air and use him to scout terrain or enemy encampments, I was fully on board. We love Dollman.</p><figure><figcaption>We do, in fact, love Dollman. Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>Dollman gets to the center of what makes <em>Death Stranding 2</em> distinct instead of a route regurgitation of the previous game: it’s goofy as hell. Another prime example of this is the return of Higgs, played by Troy Baker.&nbsp;</p><p>I cannot stress how much Higgs sucks in the first game. It’s not that he was simply repugnant, he was irritating too. Well now he’s back, he’s worse, and that was absolutely the right move. Higgs in <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>is a queeny-cyborg-cowboy-ninja who is constantly chewing the scenery. I believe it was Ian Broudou who pointed out that he’s basically that one <a href="https://x.com/dril/status/575121631846227968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dril tweet</a> that goes “the jduge orders me to take off my anonymous v mask &amp; im wearing the joker makeup underneath it. everyone in the courtroom groans at my shit.” Troy Baker is clearly having the time of his life hamming shit up, and both this and his uncanny Harrison Ford impression in the MachineGames <em>Indiana Jones</em> video game have elevated him as an actor in my personal esteem. A jarring amount of pathos is yanked out of him in the final act, an incredible feat for a character that’s basically every Jared Leto acting impulse shoved into one weird robot.</p><figure><figcaption>Love this man. Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>The thing that I cannot shake from my time with <em>Death Stranding 2</em> is how everyone involved is clearly having a blast. I have not seen a game in Kojima’s orbit that’s so much fun since <em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengence, </em>which is convenient because that’s my favorite <em>Metal Gear </em>game. The last four hours of <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>are some of the most absurd spectacle the man has ever been associated with. Kojima is constantly mugging at the camera through his characters, leaving silly, obvious references to his previous games as if to suggest that even he thinks it’s a bit absurd. Inhabiting the space often feels more like you are inhabiting Kojima’s instagram feed, like he’s gotten all the actors and directors that he personally enjoys together, put them in his weird little scanner, and he’s smashing them together like little action figures a la Rick Moranis in <em>Space Balls</em>. It is like he has reassessed his life, discarded the bullshit he’s tired of, and emphasized the stuff that he really loves.</p><h3><strong>“You of all people should understand. The loneliness.”</strong></h3><figure><figcaption>Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>This is also one of the few times that I have played a Kojima game that feels ruminative instead of attempting to predict the future. Norman Reedus’ physical performance is notably haunting, conveying with his presence a man who has collected more hurt than he can bear. There is a clear message from the beginning that, as Sam enters Mexico over the rusted ruins of Trump’s border wall, the United States is a cancer on the world whose entire existence is extractive and violent.&nbsp;</p><p>Kojima’s metaphorical usage of pregnancy is still fairly sloppy and many of his characters are gender essentialist in ways that <a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/death-stranding-2/the-women-of-death-stranding-2-are-stuck-in-a-sad-cycle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maddy Myers does a fantastic job of cataloging</a>, but I do appreciate that he leans much more heavily on the ways in which the state sees pregnant people as a purely extractive resource with little regard for their safety. And while he has yet to write a woman in his games as complex and self-assured as The Boss in <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>, there are times where you can see him getting closer to that again.</p><figure><figcaption>Rainy, played by Shioli Kutsuna. Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>But the more I think about the game the more I cannot see it beyond the albatross of COVID. It is an unprecedented scar we all carry with us that we have neither the strength nor the patience to interrogate any more. <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>swims in the various ways that experience hurt us: children were raised wrong with years of their childhood erased; people were pushed to mental oblivion in a state of lockdown that was neither alive nor dead, the state and capital have extended their grasp with violence and repression; and workers were forced back on the job without being given a chance to assess what had broken inside off them.&nbsp;</p><p>For all its goofiness, <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>is one of the few pieces of media to point out, if only obliquely, that every person on earth is damaged goods now. As Higgs, a former porter, mockingly screams repeatedly in a paroxism of pain at one point “I’ll take the damage and the goods. I don’t break that easy.”</p><h3><strong>“The physical sensation of movement is something that we all crave. That unity of body and soul.”</strong></h3><figure><figcaption>Horizon Dreamer by Daichi Miura, originally showed off at TGS. Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>When lockdown finally loosened a few years ago, I noticed club music had changed. Places that had previously played mathematically dire Berlin-style techno suddenly shifted their tone, and people started playing<a href="https://soundcloud.com/2shy2dj/dj-fart-in-the-club-sustain-release-year-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> sets that were goofy and fun</a>, often full of aggressive breakbeats like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnxbreSfQ48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toonami ad break</a>. Nobody wanted to be reminded of the drudgery that came before, being trapped in the coffin of your own home. Everyone instead wanted to be present and alive in a physical space with people again. This needed to be fun, and we needed to be surrounded by people in a physical space.&nbsp;</p><p>“We survived the pandemic because of the internet and the fact that people were about to connect online. Now there are people who work for our studio from home and whose faces I don’t even know.” Kojima <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-covid-19-changed-hideo-kojimas-vision-for-death-stranding-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said to Wired in June</a>&nbsp; “Live concerts were canceled, and everything moved to online streaming. I understand that it was inevitable during the pandemic. It was the same with school. Instead of playing with friends or learning from teachers, you watched a screen, as if you were watching a YouTube video.”&nbsp;</p><p>Kojima also credits the trajectory towards the (now failed in one sense) Metaverse as an inspiration “Communication between human beings shouldn’t be like that. You meet people by chance and see unexpected things. With the path we were on, all of that would be lost.”</p><p><em>Death Stranding 2 </em>is the only game it makes sense to make when you are associated with something of that magnitude. AAA titles take a little longer to cook up than DJ sets, but the same impulse is there. It is a goofy, soothing, and occasionally introspective game about coming together with friends and family to heal. It is about being alive and physically present again in spite of an increasingly hostile world. And though it is often overwrought, lumpy in its pacing, and recursively referential, it is the game with a heart that is lighter than a feather, an oddly cozy game to play, a balm to a weary soul, and by far the most human thing that Hideo Kojima has produced in ages.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/harry-potter-jk-rowling-cge-codenames-board-game"><h3>Board Game Company Fucks Around (Announcing A New Harry Potter Game), Finds Out (When Fans Revolt And Media Announce Boycotts)</h3></a><p>'It’s a product to sell to people who prioritise their nostalgia for children’s fantasy over the culture their trans friends and family live in'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/steam-itch-porn-censorship-collective-shout-visa-mastercard-paypal"><h3>Inside The Mass Call Campaign To Stop Video Game Censorship [Update]</h3></a><p>"This is a marathon, not a race," say organizers who plan to keep calling payment processors for months, if need be</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/clues-by-sam-wordle-daily-puzzle-game"><h3>Clues By Sam Is My Favorite Daily Puzzle Game</h3></a><p>It’s a nice little thing to do as my last thing before falling asleep.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/peak-multiplayer-streamers"><h3>Peak Is A Playground For Slapstick Comedy</h3></a><p>Peak creates space for players to really fuck around, punctuated by a swift emphasis on finding out</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-covid-lockdown-hideo-kojima]]></content:encoded>

And in an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel MrMattyPlays</u></a>, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there has been little news since, leading Starfield players to express their dissatisfaction at the level of communication coming out of Bethesda on the future of the game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-starfields-xbox-no-show-even-its-most-loyal-fans-are-starting-to-worry-bethesda-makes-it-so-hard-to-defend-this-game"><u>with its no-show at June’s Xbox Games Showcase considered the final straw for some</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new IP in 25 years, and it went on to reach 15 million players. But it was not as well received as the studio’s previous games in the Fallout and The Elder Scrolls franchises, and the Shattered Space expansion did nothing to improve sentiment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer later revealed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-wondered-if-starfield-should-have-delayed-buggies-for-shattered-space">he had had a conversation with Bethesda development chief Todd Howard about the release cadence for Starfield content</a>. “Todd and I were talking about Shattered Space,” Spencer said. “Starfield is a game I put a ton of hours into and really love, but they've had this thing where they've added features throughout the year and then they had an expansion. I think some of the feedback on the expansion is: ‘We wanted more features.’ And he's like, ‘Well, should we have waited to put buggies out?'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And so, I think you're trying to tune both development effort and the impact of the expansion. And I think there will always be a balance to managing the game month to month. But not every game will do expansions.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, though, Shattered Space was criticized more for its lack of space content than its lack of ground content. As IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-shattered-space-review"><u>Starfield Shattered Space review</u></a>: "As far as I can tell there’s absolutely nothing added for spacefarers other than now you have a way to legitimately acquire Va’ruun ships instead of stealing them from Zealots who attack you in space. That’s fine, as an expansion doesn’t always have to meaningfully expand every aspect of a game – but I was surprised that there wasn’t at least a token feature thrown in for space jockeys in an expansion with 'space' in the title."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Bethesda finally broke its silence on the future of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield"><u>Starfield</u></a>, insisting it was still working on updates and would share details on the “exciting things” it had planned in the coming months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda was seriously affected by Microsoft’s latest round of layoffs, with cuts to its London office and ZeniMax Online Studios. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unannounced-mmo-from-the-elder-scrolls-online-dev-canceled-veteran-studio-head-steps-down-amid-microsoft-layoffs"><u>Its unannounced MMORPG was canceled, and its veteran studio head stepped down</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Adult games--and games with adult themes--have been delisted from digital game sales portals Steam and <a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow ">Itch.io</a> recently, following pressure from companies that process those platforms' payments to remove them. After an extended period of silence on the matter, Mastercard has released a statement and says that its recent actions are based on the "rule of law" and aren't an attempt to enforce censorship.</p><p>"Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations," <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/us/en/news-and-trends/press/2025/august/clarifying-recent-headlines-on-gaming-content.html" rel="nofollow ">the company said</a>. "Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content."</p><p>It's worth noting that there has been no evidence that the games removed from Steam and Itch.io included illegal content, and for an even deeper breakdown, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gamers-are-furious-about-the-censorship-of-nsfw-games-and-theyre-fighting-back/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired</a> and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/steam-itch-takedowns-credit-cards-1.7597563" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CBC have detailed timelines</a> on the entire situation so far. Visa also put out a pre-written response to complaints (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/616835/visa-mastercard-steam-itchio-campaign-adult-games/" rel="nofollow ">Polygon</a>), adding that it didn't aim to "make moral judgments on legal purchases" and that it was also adhering to the letter of the law.</p><p>The pressure from payment processors was apparently the result of a campaign by the Australian anti-porn lobbying group Collective Shout, which has taken credit for the actions. Collective Shout released an open letter claiming that Steam and indie games storefront <a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow ">Itch.io</a> hosted games with "rape, incest and child sexual abuse" content.</p><p>It has also released statements claiming to have sent about 1,000 emails and calls to payment processors, urging them to threaten to pull support from those portals unless those games were removed. But the result has been the delisting of any game with vaguely defined adult content. Developers say that games with LGBTQ themes or content have been caught in the purge, and many have criticized the payment processors for arbitrarily enforcing their moral standards--and Collective Shout's--on what adults are allowed to buy and play.</p><p>In the weeks since payment processors have stopped supporting payments for adult content, several sites have been forced to take drastic measures. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/">Steam began purging content</a> from its storefront--and it made a vague update to its terms of service--while Itch.io <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-is-reaching-out-to-other-payment-processors-following-ban-on-adult-games/1100-6533545/">also began to de-index content from the site</a>.</p><p>Earlier this week, the site began to "re-index" adult and not safe for work content, adding that it is still in ongoing discussions with payment processors. Itch.io has long used Stripe as its payment processor, but the financial site will no longer support the sale of adult content that fits the description of “content designed for sexual gratification" on Itch.io.</p><p>The last couple of weeks have seen massive pushback against payment companies, as game organizations, developers, and artists have rallied together. The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/international-game-developers-association-seriously-alarmed-by-recent-delisting-of-games/1100-6533536/">has called for "greater transparency and fairness"</a> in the moderation of adult games, while other groups have urged people to put pressure on the two payment processors and flood them with calls to register their concerns about censorship.</p>

<p>"We always said that with all of this investment and with all the potential of this franchise, we would not have put it in harm's way, and we would not have put it out in the blast radius of something really large," she said. "We were pretty unblinking, and we weren't allowing ourselves to play the, 'What if?' game with the schedules and development. We were like, 'No, we have to get this done,' because the opportunity is so big and the potential is so significant for the company."</p><p>GTA 6 was originally scheduled to release in Fall 2025 before Take-Two delayed the game to May 2026. After the GTA 6 delay, EA management said the launch window for Battlefield 6 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">"clearer than before."</a></p><p>As for Black Ops 7, Activision has not announced a release date yet, but a report said the game will launch on November 14, which would give Battlefield 6 about a month's space.</p><p>Timing is important for game releases, and some have theorized that another EA game, Titanfall 2, launching sandwiched between Battlefield 1 and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare back in 2016 negatively impacted that game's sales. There was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfall/comments/amrf7h/jason_schreier_on_the_tf2_release_date_mishap/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more to the story</a>, however.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on October 10. An<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515"> open beta</a> kicks off very soon, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">battle royale mode is coming later. </a></p>

<p>A brand new infographic shared on the <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1951311967353737462">Nintendo of America</a> Twitter account highlights all the games that cropped up in the showcase, split into Switch 2, Switch 2 <em>and</em> Switch 1, and pure Switch 1 categories.</p>
<p>It might not have been the big summer blowout that many of us were hoping for, but seeing all the games laid out like this can't help but get us a little excited. Let's not claim that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot</a> are anything to be scoffed at!</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hlgktu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>All in all, it felt like a somewhat subdued affair (where the heck was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>??), but we have to remind ourselves that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> are all on the horizon from the first-party side of things, so we're still looking at a <em>hell</em> of a launch year for Switch 2.</p>
<p>If you're after a more detailed rundown of the entire presentation, you'll find our full round-up below, where we've compiled every game's trailer and blurb text for you to check out as you please.</p>

            <p><em>Beware minor spoilers for Chairbound in this piece. I think they're minor. I have no idea what's truly significant in this dreary purgatory of flourescent lights and rippled glass facades. Only one thing seems guaranteed: I have to get out of here in 10 minutes or I'm doomed.</em></p>
<p>I met the weird little girl again. She was loitering in the shadow of a pillar on the eighth floor. I found her goblin-esque <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-strapped-to-a-rolling-office-chair-with-a-ticking-timer-in-a-huge-scary-building">during our first meeting</a>, but up close she seems relatively ordinary, a pale 10-year-old in a nightie with shoulder-length hair. At least, until she burbles distorted sounds at me and runs away into the darkness. I gather she is looking for her "toy". I don't think it's the rubber duck I'm holding.</p><!--more-->
<p>Some other observations about the eighth floor: there are more rubber ducks down here. This is handy intelligence indeed, because it means I don't have to grab the one in the starting office above, saving me 30-60 seconds of abject swivelling and fumbling. I'm still not clear why I would need this rubber duck. It seems perfectly useless. But I don't know for sure that I <em>don't</em> need it, and squeaking the thing pathetically lifts my mood somewhat as I trundle through the office's neat and tidy desolation.</p>
<p>Another thing I've learned: the thing strapped to my chest isn't explosive. When the timer runs down, the display clicks "on", and there's a hiss of initially harmless gas. The first time this happened, I almost died of relief. I figured the timer must have been a prank, a red herring of some kind. Ten minutes to make it down nine stories while tied to a rolling office chair? Of <em>course</em> they were joking. But then my surroundings wobbled and blurred and the shadows took me.</p>
<p>I feel like there must, must be a way to disable this gadget, or extend the timer, because even when I'm being efficient, it takes a good few minutes to descend a single floor. It occurs to me that I dropped the duck on my last attempt, shortly before the gas overwhelmed my senses. Perhaps the duck offers protection from the gas. A voice repeats in my stomach: <em>the duck is the key</em>.</p>

<p>Final observations: I managed to get into some kind of computer room on the eighth floor, just below one of the red lights. It contained a stack of displays and another chair, standing in a pool of what I'm pretty sure is blood. This Bodes, for sure. I don't fancy my chances at fighting anybody or anything off while I'm strapped to this chair. Let's reconvene to compare notes on the seventh floor, assuming I make it.</p>

              <p>Mastercard has broken its silence <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-itch-io-sex-game-nsfw-censor-visa-mastercard-1851787281">after being thrust into the middle of a gaming culture war</a> between anti-porn advocates and anti-censorship activists. While Valve previously laid blame for a recent purge of adult sex games from Steam at the feet of “payment processors and their related card networks and banks,” Mastercard released a statement on Friday denying any responsibility for a new wave of censorship that’s recently led some gamers to flood payment company call centers with complaints.</p> <p>“Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations,” the company wrote in a statement published on its website on August 1. “Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content.”</p> <p>Mastercard and Visa have been on the receiving end of an anti-game censorship backlash after anti-porn group Collective Shout <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-sex-censorship-hentai-gta-5-collective-shout-1851786636">claimed victory</a> in a write-in campaign targeting payment company CEOs for allegedly profiting off of what the group called “violent pornography.” Critics of the move recently told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> they’ve been calling the companies multiple times over the last week to complain about Valve and indie game shop itch.io purging seemingly legal NSFW content from their platforms over fears of reportedly being dropped by Mastercard and others.</p> <p>To be clear, Mastercard doesn’t say it hasn’t been involved at all, just that it’s gone no further than enforcing its existing guidelines against “unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content.” But a renewed crackdown on those requirements, which can be vague in practice, has resulted in Valve and itch.io delisting anywhere from hundreds to thousands of games they worry could get it in trouble with Mastercard and others.</p> <p>Earlier today, itch.io founder Leaf Corcoran <a href="https://kotaku.com/itch-nsfw-adult-games-visa-mastercard-collective-shout-2000614199">announced the indie storefront</a> is bringing back delisted NSFW games that were free, but is “still in ongoing discussions with payment processors” over paid content which will be reintroduced “slowly.” It could suggest the recent call-in campaigns castigating the credit card companies have changed the calculus for the companies involved. It certainly sounds like Mastercard regrets ever being dragged into this fight, even though it’s the one in the driver’s seat.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">As the calendar transitions from summer to fall, one thing is on the mind of every sports game fan: the release of a new EA Sports FC. EA Sports FC 26 is set to release in a couple of months, and it's going to introduce a slew of new gameplay mechanics and features, while returning with all of the game modes that fans know and love. We've already seen a solid chunk of what the game is going to offer, but there could still be some surprises from EA over the next two months.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a lot to know about the next entry into EA's soccer franchise, so we're going to take a deep dive into everything we currently know about EA Sports FC 26. Here's what to expect when the game launches later this year.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_EA_Sports_FC_26_be_released_">When will EA Sports FC 26 be released?</h2><p dir="ltr">EA has confirmed the release date of EA Sports FC 26 is Sept. 26. This is almost one year to the day of when EA Sports FC 25 was released, which came out on Sept. 27, 2024.</p><p dir="ltr">However, if you can't wait that long to play EA Sports FC 26, you can gain up to seven days of early access and start playing on Sept. 19--but only if you pre-order a specific edition of the game. The early access period features the full game, and you'll keep all of your progression during this period after EA Sports FC 26 has been released worldwide. So if you wanted to get a head start in Ultimate Team, for example, the seven days of early access is a huge boon.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TSi0iJYSQ24" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_preorder_EA_Sports_FC_26">How to preorder EA Sports FC 26</h2><p dir="ltr">There are two editions of EA Sports FC 26 you can preorder: the Standard and Ultimate Edition. Preordering either edition will net you some exclusive bonuses that aim to give you a head start across a variety of game modes. However, preordering the Ultimate Edition is how you gain the seven days of early access that begins on Sept. 19.</p><p dir="ltr">You can see the prices and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-26-preorder-guide/1100-6533269/">preorder bonuses for the Standard and Ultimate Editions of EA Sports FC 26 in GameSpot's preorder guide.</a></p><p dir="ltr">You can preorder either one of these editions of EA Sports FC 26 on your system's marketplace (PS Store, Microsoft Store, Nintendo Store, Steam, EA App). Alternatively, you can visit the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-26/buy" rel="nofollow ">official EA FC 26 section of EA's website</a> and preorder using your system account through there.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Watch_the_EA_Sports_FC_26_trailer_here">Watch the EA Sports FC 26 trailer here</h2><p dir="ltr">If you want to see some actual gameplay of EA FC 26, then you can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24&amp;pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD">official reveal trailer</a> below.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24&amp;pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24&amp;pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD</a></p><p dir="ltr">The trailer was received generally well by fans, with many calling it the best reveal trailer for the franchise in years. However, there was a consensus that EA needs to focus on Career Mode with the new game.</p><p dir="ltr">EA went a little deeper into the gameplay side of EA Sports FC 26 with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GE8YCIQF2M">Gameplay Deep Dive trailer</a>, which you can watch if you want some more detailed explanations of the changes the game is introducing and how they play out in real time.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="EA_Sports_FC_26_platforms">EA Sports FC 26 platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortunately for fans across the video game community, EA Sports FC 26 will be available on every major platform when it releases in September. This includes PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch, and Switch 2. EA has decided to make the game available on both Switch consoles, an interesting move considering it isn't doing the same for Madden 26, which is only coming to the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">If you decide to play EA Sports 26 FC on PC, you have the choice of playing on either Steam or via the EA App for Windows. Neither platform has an edge over the other, so pick the one you feel most comfortable with.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="EA_Sports_FC_26_gameplay">EA Sports FC 26 gameplay</h2><p dir="ltr">EA Sports FC 26 will offer the core content that the franchise has become known for over the years. You'll be able to play Player and Manage Career, Ultimate Team, Clubs, and Live Events, as well as basic Quick Play matches.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to gameplay, EA is making some stark changes to how you play EA Sports FC 26. For starters, there are now two separate gameplay presets: Competitive and Authentic. These presets determine the difficulty level at which you'll be playing, and each is designed for a specific area of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The Competitive preset features increased responsiveness and player control with an added emphasis on smarter passing, more intuitive rebounds, and so on. This preset is designed for online game modes, such as Ultimate Team and Clubs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4542053-screenshot2025-08-01at8.53.44am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4542053" data-ratio="0.55620316402998" data-width="1201" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4542053-screenshot2025-08-01at8.53.44am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4542053"></a><figcaption>EA Sports FC 26 is coming soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4542053-screenshot2025-08-01at8.53.44am.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">On the other hand, the Authentic preset is designed for offline game modes, like Career. You'll find added realism in this preset, making opponents more difficult to play against, and bringing a higher match speed to coincide with how players actually manage the pitch.</p><p dir="ltr">Between these two new gameplay presets, you can also take advantage of freshly tuned gameplay fundamentals. EA has taken community feedback and made sweeping changes across a variety of mechanics to make them feel smoother and more responsive. You'll experience better dribbling, more intuitive AI player positioning, and improved animations, among a flurry of other changes. You can read about all of the mechanics EA has changed in its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-26/news/pitch-notes-fc26-gameplay-deep-dive#gameplay-fundamentals" rel="nofollow ">dedicated blog post</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, EA has also updated goalkeepers in an attempt to make them more fluid and realistic. Goalkeepers have been given new animations and optimized with machine learning to improve their stances and attack readiness. They also have new deflection control mechanics, so you should see balls go where they're supposed to after a goalkeeper makes a nice save.</p>

            <p>Graham is gone. The longest-running editor of Rock Paper Shotgun worked his last day on the website earlier this week, and has leapt quietly into the mysterious realm of the games industry proper. The emotional fallout of this departure is roughly the same as any other time RPS has watched a writer swan-dive out of the RPS treehouse and into the mist far below. There is sadness tinged with hope. "There goes another one," you think, smiling through a single tear and imagining their future life far from these branches. </p>
<p>Only this time, well, it's Graham.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><strong>Brendan:</strong> I officially quit RPS myself back in 2019, but have since reappeared as a regular freelance phantom. This gives me the weird opportunity to write a goodbye post for the man who wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brendan-is-leaving-rps-come-say-goodbye">my own goodbye post</a>. Fuck you, Graham, I see your compliments, and I raise you. Eat it.</p>
<p>Back in the horrendous mists of 2014, Graham jumped ship as editor of PC Gamer. He was hired by the ancient founders of Rock Paper Shotgun because the ancient founders were terrible at spreadsheets and were always standing in the wrong place. In Graham Smith, they not only got a managing editor who could tell them what day of the week it was, but a writer who was able to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/worst-game-names">eviscerate developers for their terrible names</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-me-more-expressive-actions-in-videogames-please">champion funny new ways to play</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-nidhogg">celebrate the best games of all time</a>, all with the same decorous lethality. </p>
<p>Go through Graham's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/graham-smith">entire author archive</a> and you will find over 4000 articles that collage into a vivid desire for this industry to be more than it often is. Indie physics brawlers stand side-by-side with EA shooters in a swirling list of cool or heinous shit that was important enough to tell you about. Few can write this much this well for this long, and not emerge a master of the knife-like phrase. </p>
<p>"Fuck underscore that," he said of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watch-dogs-pc-review">Watch_Dogs</a>.</p>
<p>Reviewing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/proverbs-review">picrossy game Proverbs</a> he wrote: "It was there when I closed my eyes, as if my brain was defragmenting."</p>
<p>"Makes me feel like I'm on hold," he said of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/naiad-review">the wholesome nothingness of Naiad</a>.</p>
<p>I'm picking these articles basically at random. They are probably not the pieces Graham is most proud of writing - only he knows those. But it says a lot that I can dig through his archives in a single morning and find, so easily and quickly, countless examples of wit, energy, and humanity. A humanity that he often expressed privately in our daily meetings, rather than on these digipages. God I wish we'd recorded our meetings as a podcast. We would have broken SO many NDAs. </p>
<p>When I say "humanity" I mean just that. Graham knows that when you write about games, you're really writing about yourself.</p>
<p>"I'm reminded of how precious it is to play a videogame and never need to compete," he wrote of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-living-minecraft">Minecraft in 2014</a>, not knowing then that exploring those mountains and valleys would years later become <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecraft-is-turning-15-so-theyre-giving-away-some-character-creator-items">a regular ritual with his son</a>. "Minecraft is a toybox, a dressing-up box, a pencil case of colouring pens, and sometimes just a sunny hill. I played it in 2009 and I played it yesterday and I have no reason to doubt I'll be playing it in 2039." </p>
<p>As somebody who has freelanced for this beautiful cesspit since its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130501155136/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">scrappy red-faced days</a>, I also know the good Graham has done not as a writer, but simply as a guy who can get things done. He dragged this place kicking and screaming into a modern internet that none of us could avoid. Remember when RPS was a traditional blog? It was great. But articles would more or less evaporate when they left the front page. There was only space for three top stories at any one time. Graham oversaw the site as it got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141119123851/http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">an even bigger splash of top stories</a>. Some readers frothed at the mouth to see the blog roll pushed further down the landing page, reacting with that familiar viciousness we have grown to find adorable in you over years of subsequent RPS facelifts, minor and drastic. But, oh, whaddya know? YOU MOTHER FUCKERS CLICKED ON THOSE TOP STORIES DIDN'T YOU? You filthy, lovely, loyal dirtbags. It is for you Graham killed our darlings. Change is neither good or bad. Change is simply change.</p>
<p>When Graham was first hired, his welcome post wrote that "the tragedy of being editor of any magazine is it dramatically reduces the amount of writing you get to do" and this curse threatened to come to pass when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-not-editor-in-chief-of-rps-anymore-heres-who-is">ascended into the white halls of corpomanagement</a> eight years later to become a bigger, badder directorial man. But the truth is, Graham never stopped writing. He kept doing news posts at nights and weekends. He kept writing news. He kept crushing expensive action adventures and toothless indie darlings with equal knuckle-cracking insight. Okay, he took a hiatus from our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-sunday-papers">Sunday Papers column</a> (one of the site's longest traditions) but even that didn't last. </p>
<p>It's in those Sunday Papers pieces that I feel you get the most bang for your Graham buck. Rock Paper Shotgun has always been the home of great writing, and perhaps nobody has built the site's editorial ruleset as much as Graham (with the possible exception of Alice O'Connor, who wrote over 8000 articles and the style guide we use to this day - an untouchable legacy). His <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sunday-papers-769">final Sunday Papers last week</a> is a fangs-out manifesto for games journalism, and if there is any young pup who still covets this job over the glamour of being an influencer or the solitude of being a video essayist, then their greatest hope for honing their craft lies in Graham's words.</p>
<p>"There are infinite ways to play a game and none of them are wrong," he says. "There are infinite ways to write about a game and some of them are wrong, but you have to decide what those are for yourself."</p>
<p>Or you can just ask Graham. You can <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grahamsmith.bsky.social">follow him, and whatever he'll be doing next, on Bluesky</a>. I suggest you do. Words will burst out of this man if he doesn't write them down somewhere. You'll want to be there when he pops.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong> I'm still relatively new to the Treehouse and have known Graham for fewer months and years than the other folks here, thus rendering me incapable of writing anything as poetic as Bendy's ode above. But as someone who's read RPS since ye olden days prior to actually getting a job here, I've felt Graham's presence on the site for a long time, and it's been a superb guiding light.</p>
<p>As a fella who also had a long career working in non-games journalism, I feel compelled to add that I've suffered under the hands of many bad editors, and Graham was not one of those. He is the rarest of beasts, the ultimate of Achievements - an actual Chaotic Good guy-in-charge who cares not only about this bizarre corner of the internet, but the people behind it. A real one, in other words. We'll miss you, Graham, and now that you have left us I am currently gathering healing potions to prepare for our swift descent into Lord of the Flies territory.</p>
<p><strong>Edwin:</strong> Graham, I will miss all those moments in meetings when I'd try to act wise about video games journalism - sorry, videogames journalism - and shame-facedly realise that you'd heard it all before, probably a dozen times over, from successive generations of RPS scribes, all the way back through the great Google Meet invite list of History. You have absorbed everything worth knowing about this business, and it is only fit that you depart for a kinder realm, where you can enjoy your Crunchyroll subscription in peace, and spend less time fielding complaints about deal posts. Please shine down on us occasionally, great beardfather in the sky.</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> If Jeremy's still new to the Treehouse, my feet have barely cleared the topmost rung of the ladder into it as I write this. I'm sad I didn't get to work with Graham for a lot longer, even if just to try and glean more of the secrets that inevitably lurk within his face fuzz by staring at it in morning meetings.</p>
<p><strong>James:</strong> Looking at RPS from the outside in, Graham’s influence is far-reaching and obvious – there’s a reason this site has kept on trucking as long as it has, and that reason has a rich beard and an impressive collection of graphic tees.</p>
<p>I wish that everyone currently saying their goodbyes also knew the full extent of Graham’s impact behind the scenes, that they might clap and wave just that little bit harder. Relatively few people see the Graham that so effortlessly elevates our good ideas (while tactfully squishing our bad ones), or the Graham that lets us disappear for days on end, no questions asked, when things go wrong at home. Or the Graham that always encourages us down the most honest, integrity-paved road through an industry that often isn’t just unconducive to the principles of good reporting, but actively hostile towards them.</p>
<p>We’ll be fine – he’s seen to that too. But when you think of Graham the writer and editor, know that you can also think of Graham the leader, Graham the shield, Graham the engine. Let’s thank him once again, for all that and more.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/graham-smith-is-leaving-rps-come-say-goodbye]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Right, if your hearing's recovered enough from the sheer blaring blastiness of yesterday's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-full-multiplayer-reveal-sees-ea-trying-to-rebottle-the-lightning-of-battlefield-3-and-4">multiplayer reveal</a>, I'm here to tell you a couple of things you'll probably be happy about. Well, unless you're planning on buying it from the Epic Games store.</p>
<p>You see, amid last night's info drop, EA have revealed at least an estimate of the specs your hardware'll need to have to run it, as well as the very important detail of whether you'll need to fire it up via (whispers) the EA launcher.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While EA haven't included any PC specs in their <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/faq">lengthy Q&amp;A post</a> about the game, declaring that they'll provide more info further down the line, the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807960/Battlefield_6/">Steam page</a> has had minimum and recomended setups added to it. Battle in fields 6's minimum reqs comprise the following: an Intel Core i5-7600K or AMD Ryzen 3 1200 processor, 16GB of RAM, 55GB of storage space on a hard drive or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a> running at least Windows 10, and your choice of an Nvidia RTX 2060 or an AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT 6GB.</p>
<p>Judging by those, provided your rig's not beyond half a decade old, there's a chance you'll not need to look into upgrading to pass the low threshold required to at least get BF6 running, though EA don't specify the kind of quality and FPS count bang you can expect for that buck.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the recomended specs as as follows: Intel Core i7-10700, AMD Ryzen 7 3700X processors, 16GB of RAM, 80GB of drive space, Windows 11, and either an Nvidia RTX 3060Ti or an AMD Radeon RX 6700-XT. Again, no indication as to what that'll get you, aside from suggesting it should be decent. That said, buggy Battlefield launches have been a thing in the past. Our James only ran into one while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">diving into the multiplayer at a recent Battlevent</a>, though.</p>
<p>If you've been more worried about having to summon EA's app every time you want to play it, then the good news is that if you're on Steam that won't be necessary.. Though you will still need an EA account, because as French philosopher Denis Diderot apparently once said, man will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest. Those who buy it via the Epic Store'll need both EA app and EA account, because as French philosopher Denis Diderot definitely didn't say, sorry Fortnite platform peeps.</p>
<p>Oh, and before I go, EA also make clear that "you do not need to have played any other Battlefield game to understand or enjoy Battlefield 6". It's unclear whether an understanding of the concept of a battlefield, or the individual concepts of battles or fields will be required. I'm going out on a slightly exploded limb to say probably not.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-pc-specs-dont-look-too-lofty-despite-all-the-booms-and-steam-players-wont-need-the-pesky-ea-app]]></content:encoded>
