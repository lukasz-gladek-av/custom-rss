            <p>
Just a day after its launch, the Gex Trilogy - which bundles together the cult-classic 90s platformer Gex and its two sequels - has officially been deemed a success. And publisher Limited Run Games is celebrating the occasion by reinstating a conspicuously absent audio feature that should please European series fans no end.
</p>
<p>
The Gex Trilogy, if you're unfamiliar, gathers together developer Crystal Dynamics' original 2D outing (which launched for PS1 back in 1995), plus its two fully polygonal sequels; that's 1998's Gex: Enter the Gecko and 1999's Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko. Limited Run's bundle isn't a remaster as such, but it <em>does</em> include a variety of modern-day niceties, including native widescreen support, save states, and the ability to rewind the action.
</p>
<p>
Throw in a whole bunch of artwork and archival material, and content-wise the Gex Trilogy is probably as close to a definitive release as fans of the ageing mascot platformer could hope for. With one notable exception: it only launched with Dana Gould's portrayal of suave lizard protagonist Gex, as heard in the US release, while the PAL version's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC_-wP92b2Y">very different vocal performances</a> were nowhere to be found. Until now that is.

<p>
"Thank you for making the launch of Gex Trilogy a huge success!," Limited Run wrote in an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/limitedrungames.com/post/3lrr2bt5xyd27">announcement on social media</a>. "It's been in the works for a while and we're finally able to announce that the PAL versions of Gex 2 &amp; Gex 3, featuring the voices of Leslie Philips and Danny John-Jules, respectively, will be added in an update!... We're excited for European Gex fans to relive these games the way they remember and for others to hear them for the first time!"
</p>
<p>
As it happens, anyone that owns the Gex Trilogy on Steam can enjoy Philips and John-Jules' portrayal of Gex right now. Once the newly released update has been installed, players can select the PAL versions of Gex by changing the regional flag on the menu before starting the game. Limited Run notes these European versions are entirely separate builds, and save data is not transferable. Today's update also remaps the default keyboard controls for all three games following complaints at launch, but Limited Run is yet to address other customer concerns, including audio issues and a lack of upscaling or anti-aliasing.
</p>
<p>
As for PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch, they'll be getting PAL voices just as soon as the patch "has completed certification".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hades-2-update-scylla-sirens-new-song<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hades 2</em>, my game of the year in waiting – assuming Supergiant is able to keep its schedule of releasing version 1.0 before the end of 2025 – just dropped its third major early access update. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512960174905888548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest, longest set of patch notes yet</a> unfurls to reveal hidden weapon aspects, a new variation of each major boss encounter, new character bond-deepening events, and a veritable waterfall of changes to boons, blessings, and Daedalus Hammer upgrades. But most importantly, there’s new music, "including a hot new single from a certain band.”</p><p><strong>Mild </strong><strong><em>Hades 2</em></strong><strong> spoilers ahead.</strong></p><p>In <em>Hades 2</em>’s second boss fight, you come up against Scylla, a legendary man-eating sea monster, and the Sirens, known in Greek myth for using their enchanting voices to lure sailors to their horrific demises. They are in a band together. The whole encounter is a Supergiant masterclass; Scylla, Jetty, and Roxy are on vocals, guitar, and drums respectively, and when you render one of them temporarily or permanently indisposed, their instrument disappears from the soundtrack. Basically, the fight is a concert where the performers are trying to kill you with the power of music. It rules.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, there were two full band Scylla songs: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7QSavYWEE0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coral Crown</a>,” a hard rock banger about drowning people, and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQFEcBIf8z0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I Am Gonna Claw (Out Your Eyes then Drown You to Death)</a>,” a much more personal tune that Scylla begins playing sporadically as a passive-aggressive – or I guess just aggressive-aggressive – response to Melinoe’s repeated victories over her.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Hades II - The Unseen Update Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Gv0eQjJ-gY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Now we’ve got a third: “Rock and a Hard Place,” which serves as the backing track for the new patch’s trailer. It sounds sick and – I’m guessing – triggers when you activate the new “Vow of Rivals” variation of the Scylla fight. The trailer, however, explicitly mentions “new Scylla <em>songs</em>,” plural, so I am expecting/hoping for at least one more secret song, perhaps an anthem even more devastatingly personal than “I Am Gonna Claw (Out Your Eyes then Drown You to Death).”&nbsp;</p><p>In other hyper-specific <em>Hades 2</em> news that only a few of you will care about, but that I will nonetheless put under a microscope because it’s my website: Supergiant finally swapped Narcissus’ placeholder art out for a real portrait. I don’t know how to feel about this. Having a character who talks extensively about the terrible burden that is his own physical beauty enshrouded in a nondescript hood was a great bit, and I’ll miss it. But hey, I suppose this is yet another reason to <a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-technical-test-early-access-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play <em>Hades 2</em> the way god(s) intended</a> – in early access – while you still have the chance. After all, nobody waited around for the 1.0 version of the Greek myths of old. The story, both now and then, is in the telling.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kat-abughazaleh-congress-online"><h3>Young Democrats Are Running Very Online Campaigns In 2025</h3></a><p>Kat Abughazaleh's Congressional campaign wants to reach people both locally and online</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/relooted-game-africa-museum-visa-nyamakop-interview"><h3>How Relooted, A Game About Reclaiming African Artifacts From Western Museums, Ended Up Being Shown By A White Guy At Summer Game Fest</h3></a><p>"Fucked up to be making a game about reclaiming African artifacts that are in Western countries, and Africans can't even visit those artifacts"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mindseye-rocket-boy-impressions-review-pc"><h3>MindsEye Fuckin’ Sucks, Man</h3></a><p>'It looks like a parody Game Awards trailer.

            <p>
Supergiant Games have released the latest big patch for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> today, The Unseen Update, bringing in a number of changes so big I won't be able to tell you about them all here, but I'll pick out a few good ones. First of all, and perhaps most importantly, Narcissus finally has character art and, oh no, he's hot! I'm not going to embed any pictures of him here just in case you want to witness him in game for yourself, but here's a little <a href="https://x.com/belllmonts/status/1935026960461140303">tweet</a> for those that can't wait. Very much a "why does he have to be obsessed with himself and be attractive enough for that to be understandable" kind of vibe.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Anyway, you can put the spray bottle down, I'll tell you about some gameplay additions. All of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike's</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nocturnal">Nocturnal</a> Arms now have their own Hidden Aspects for you to unlock, though you'll have to find them yourself. Some new music has been added in too, including a "hot new single from a certain band…" Zero prize for guessing this is likely to be Scylla and the Sirens.
</p>
<p>
Several, optional new events have been added in for when you get close to a number of the game's characters, and there's even some new artwork for certain characters in the salt bath (and some "visual flourishes" have been added to the artwork in general). There's a new Vow of Rivals feature that makes each Guardian (i.e. boss) "more challenging in unique ways; the first Rank affects the first Guardian of both the Underworld and Surface routes; prevail against both to reveal the next Rank, and so on."
</p>
<p>
There's also just a ridiculously long list of additions and tweaks to boons, Daedalus Hammer upgrades, Hexes, enemies, and more, so you're probably going to want to read the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512960174905888548">full patch notes</a> if you like to dig that deep.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/blog/hades2-unseen-update/">blog post</a> on their website, Supergiant Games also offered up some development progress. While they didn't have a release date to share, after some follow-up patches to iron out some Unseen Update kinks, the big next steps will be adding in the game's anticipated true ending. There's also plans for achievements and other finishing touches, but the big thing here is that they are gearing up for the 1.0 release at the very least. For now, just uh, drool over Narcissus or something.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/688483/nintendo-switch-2-ban-error-code-mig-flash-cartridge-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/cameron-faulkner">Cameron Faulkner</a> <span>is an editor covering deals and commerce. He joined in 2018, and served as commerce editor at Polygon until May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Some Switch 2 owners have received the<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fau%2Fsupport%2Farticles%2Ferror-codes-2124-4007-2124-4508%2F" rel="sponsored"> error code 2134-4508</a>, which results in their consoles being permanently banned from accessing any of its online services, as spotted by <a href="http://against/"><em>IGN</em></a>. It’s not a ban hammer from sucking at <em>Mario Kart World</em>, thankfully for me, but one that’s targeting consoles that have used a Mig – a microSD card-equipped Switch cartridge that can be filled with copies of games. </p><p>Running games on the Mig requires you to download them from others who have dumped files off of cartridges, or dump the games yourself with something like the <a href="https://www.migflashunited.shop/products/mig-switch-dumper">Mig Dumper</a>, then load them onto a microSD card. Whether you’ve used one to play pirated games, or to play copies of games that you own, Nintendo’s stance on the matter is broad: It considers both to be violations of its user agreements.</p><p>The makers of the Mig cartridge have taken reasonable efforts to distance itself from what a majority of buyers will likely do with it, which is play pirated games. The cartridge’s product page notes that it “serves as a backup and development device solely supporting gaming using personal game backups. [...] To maintain the Mig Flash warranty during online play, it’s essential to utilize self-dumped backups with authentic Certificate, UID, and Card Set ID.”</p><p>Nintendo isn’t bricking the consoles of offenders, at least, not immediately. YouTube creator Scattered Brain posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExgYTA18_vo">video</a> about their banned Switch 2 in which they tried to find a way around the ban. Attempting to visit the eShop wasn’t possible, nor was unlinking an account from the console, since both activities require the internet. They were able to unlink Virtual Game Cards from their Switch 2 from Nintendo’s account management site and load them onto a Switch OLED, suggesting that the ban is limited to the hardware and not the account. However, a factory reset essentially bricked their Switch 2, as it no longer allowed signing into any Nintendo Account. This is something that Nintendo reserves <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/665765/nintendo-privacy-policy-update-switch-2">the right to do</a> per its updated account services user agreement and privacy policy.</p><p>No one, but especially Mig users, should be surprised about this ban. Nintendo has a rich history of aggressively pursuing those who pirate its games, as well as those <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">who build emulators</a> that can run pirated copies of games originally made for its platforms. Considering that the Switch 2 is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">fastest-selling console of all time</a>, Nintendo’s clearly throwing everything it’s got at making sure gamers are playing by its rules. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The news comes via </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/VOCtRanwXrA?si=ppjf30BtefyUO220">an announcement</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> today from Xbox president Sarah Bond that the company has entered into a "strategic, multi-year agreement" with hardware and chip manufacturer AMD to "co-engineer" a number of devices, including the "next generation" of Xbox consoles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Her description of those next-generation Xbox consoles heavily implies the company isn't restricting itself to a singular device that sits under the TV—and that future hardware won't restrict players to the Xbox store. "This is all about building you a gaming platform that's always with you, so you can play the games you want across devices anywhere you want, delivering you an Xbox experience not locked to a single store or tied to one device" she stated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Breaking away from making Xbox a singular device—and opening it up to other video game stores—would be a major diversion from the conventional product strategy for video game consoles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Earlier in the video, Bond specified that these future devices could be used "in your living room, and in your hands." It's entrusting AMD to build the graphics chips that will allow these devices to display advanced graphical displays—a common expectation of new console launches.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/who-benefits-from-the-nintendo-switch-eshop-discoverability-update-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Who benefits from the Nintendo Switch eShop discoverability update?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The two companies are also promising to deliver "more immersive gameplay" using "the power of AI."

Game Pass promised easier access to games through a subscription and making them accessible on more devices through cloud streaming (the notion that Xbox was acquiring studios like Activision Blizzard for the purpose of releasing games exclusively on Xbox consoles prompted </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-triumphs-over-ftc-again-in-challenge-to-69-billion-activision-blizzard-deal">regulatory scrutiny</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> over the $69 billion acquisition).</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/nintendo-switch-2s-dlss-support-to-be-a-big-part-of-future-nintendo-games" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo Switch 2's DLSS support may be a big part of future Nintendo games</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2024 it hawked this strategy under a prophetic marketing campaign called "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">this is an Xbox</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">," referring how Xbox games can now be accessed on a wide variety of devices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the background, console competitors Sony and Nintendo dominated their respective ends of the console market.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As first reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-1236434385/">Variety</a>, Warner Bros. has restructured its WB Games branch into four divisions focused on four key franchises: Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat, and the DC Universe.</p>
<p>The restructuring has promoted three former studio heads to oversee games made for each of these major franchises. Former WB Games Montreal studio head Yves Lachance is now a senior vice president of development for Harry Potter and Game of Thrones projects, while NetherRealm studio head Shaun Himmerick is now a senior vice president of development for Mortal Kombat and DC Universe projects.</p>
<p>Last but not least, former WB Games New York studio head, Steven Flenory, is now the senior vice president of central technology and services, overseeing publishing technology, customer service, quality assurance, and user research.</p>
<p>Every studio under WB Games will now report to Lachance and Himmerick, in accordance with the games they're making and which franchises those games come from. So, the team at Avalanche Software working on a new Hogwarts Legacy game would report to Lachance, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/dc-studios-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-for-new-dc-video-games/">Rocksteady</a>, who is presumably working on a new game set in the DC Universe, would report to Himmerick.</p>
<p>Lachance, Himmerick, and Flenory will all report to WB's global streaming and games chief executive officer, JB Perrette.</p>
<p>According to Variety's report, this restructuring did not result in any layoffs or executive departures, which is good news on the layoff front.</p>
<p>"<em>Our company is home to some of the biggest franchises in the world, and we are optimizing our team structure to develop long-term franchise roadmaps to delight players and fans of Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat and DC games</em>," said JB Perrette per Variety's report.</p>
<p>"<em>We are very fortunate to have a strong stable of development and technology talent, and Yves, Shaun, and Steven are respected leaders with excellent track records in their areas of expertise. I'm looking forward to working closely with them nd the team as we work to make the best games possible for our key franchises</em>."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Warner Bros confirmed that its WB Games division reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-gaming-financial-reports-disappointing-2024-revenue-continues-to-fall/">"<em>disappointing</em>"</a> revenues, shortly after former WB Games chief executive officer, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/">David Haddad,</a> left the company following the failure of games like Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and MultiVersus.</p>
<p>Warner Bros also shut down veteran studio Monolith Productions, MultiVersus developer Player First Games, and its San Diego Studio, which was meant to develop a mobile game but never had the chance to release anything.</p>
<p>This is also the latest example of the company doubling-down on <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wb-games-to-refocus-business-around-tentpole-franchises-and-top-tier-characters-">previous statements</a> that it would focus its games business on the four aforementioned franchises.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fbc-firebreak-review-trouble-in-old-house</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fbc-firebreak-review-trouble-in-the-old-house.1221294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fbc-firebreak-review-trouble-in-old-house<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy is often known for creating artistic games that are loved across the industry. You don't have to look too hard to find out why many people love games like <em>Control </em>or <em>Alan Wake 2</em>. Funny enough, both games are within a shared universe that's ever-expanding. This time around, Remedy decided to try something entirely different with its newly released multiplayer shooter&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>.</p>

<p>Instead of being a third-person game where players are controlling a washed-up writer or a director of a top-secret organization, they play a member of the FBC in first person while trying to survive the onslaught of Hiss that is coming their way. For better or worse, the game often forgets that it can get very dull very fast.</p>

<p>I had a lot of hope when I initially loaded into <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>. After all, throughout the years, I've found myself getting more and more invested in the world that Remedy has been creating. To see more of the Old House, which is the main location where <em>Control </em>takes place, seemed like a no-brainer. <em>FBC </em>has a simple concept, too; in short, the Old House has been in lockdown for quite a while now because of the Hiss, and due to this, anyone who can take up arms has in hopes of driving them back.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc_-firebreak-5251171-6_16_2025-11_12_23-am.jpg?itok=fx7CkKyZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc_-firebreak-5251171-6_16_2025-11_12_23-am.jpg?itok=fFOC_laI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Old House needs some fixes.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, that's where a lot of the main story ends, too. But little tidbits of lore can be found throughout the game if you really look for them. One example can be seen in the game's loading menu, where notes are signed off by Alex, Jesse, and other characters from <em>Control</em>, offering a glimpse into what's happening. On top of that, every so often, the game's announcer will drop clues on what's going on overall.</p>

<p>But getting story beats like this seems like a major disservice to a studio that has prided itself on telling compelling stories. A lot of the core gameplay loops players into doing the same thing more and more until they've done it enough to progress further in the level.</p>

<p>For example, in one of the main stages, I was tasked with destroying a bunch of sticky notes because of how dangerous they were. At first, this task seems easy enough, but it quickly becomes dull when you find yourself shooting yellow pads for what feels like five to ten minutes. Even more so when you realize that's the only objective for one level, and you find yourself doing it all over again once you load into the next level.</p>

The way it works is if it's your first time playing a level, you'll have a Clearance Level 1, it'll and the task will be simple. But the catch is that, oftentimes, the job you're assigned can drag, and once it's completed, you'll unlock Level 2 and 3. To get to the extended parts of the level, you'll need to essentially play through all of Clearance Level 1 and 2, which is always the same extract thing.</p>

<p>Getting to the end of a Clearance Level 3 can be a lot of fun because it's where the full level truly shines. In one of mine, when I got to the end, I found myself fighting a giant sticky note monster the size of a kaiju. Getting to that point can be such a drag, it's easy to drop said level and try a new one altogether.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But it's not all doom and gloom. Because the Corruption System is sometimes enough to keep things interesting, even if you've played the same level three or four times. This effectively works as another difficulty modifier. The level you put it on will often change things drastically.</p>

<p>For example, when using it, it can sometimes buff enemies, make them fly, or even move around key locations, such as the showers and ammo stations, which can cause a bit of anxiety to arise during a fight. So if you're looking to challenge yourself, the Corruption System is definitely worth checking out.</p>

By all accounts, these serve as classes for players to pick from. The three players can pick from Splash, Jump, and Fix. In short, Splash allows you to spray water at objects and allies via a water hose, which can be useful when you need to clean someone off. Fix gives players a wrench that lets them instantly fix any machine that is broken, and Jump lets them power up key locations on a moment's notice. The thing is, though, FBC: Firebreak does a poor job of explaining the significance of these, and oftentimes it can be easy to forget to use them.</p>



<p>It's a real bummer because a lot of the game follows the same formula. You unlock a level and are tasked with doing a remedial task over and over until you've unlocked a second stage in it. But by that time, it's extremely easy to feel burnt out in the game. It's clear<em> FBC: Firebreak </em>took a lot of inspiration from games like <em>Left 4 Dead</em> or <em>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</em>, but one of the main things that separates those games from <em>FBC </em>is the gunplay.</p>

<p>This is another part of where the game handicaps itself. I found myself bored whenever I was getting swarmed by hordes of enemies. It was because the guns felt dull. Oftentimes, you want them to feel powerful or have some kind of kick to them. However, that wasn't the case with <em>FBC</em>; in fact, many of them felt janky and run-down. Although that may have been by design, it doesn't translate into good gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc_-firebreak-5251171-6_16_2025-12_22_19-pm.jpg?itok=BnKkntaH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc_-firebreak-5251171-6_16_2025-12_22_19-pm.jpg?itok=9GPW9EFk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;Federal Bureau of Control better pay good.</figcaption></figure><p>To make matters worse, upgrading weapons and perks is a drag. The way the progressive system works is rather odd and feels more like a battle pass system than anything else. After each level, players are awarded in-game points, and they can sometimes gain more by picking up files as they run through levels. Once you've reached the end, you'll be able to spend these points on various things.</p>

<p>But there's a catch. To unlock more of the high-end gear, they'll have to unlock everything leading up to that. This means that if pages two through four have nothing but cosmetics, you'll have to purchase every single one of them before you can get to page five and unlock an upgraded weapon or something new to use in the game. So, it can often feel as if you're stuck with a pointless weapon or perks for quite a while, with no light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

I often found myself asking questions like "Do I need to heal faster, or do I need to upgrade my Spray Kit?" Even though this can be a fun way to challenge yourself for each run, it does make things unnecessarily complicated.&nbsp;</p>

If Remedy is good at one thing, it's nailing down aesthetics. Walking through the Old House in first person does give the game a fresh coat of paint that I didn't know it needed until then. And the game isn't afraid to get weird with itself, either. There are still plenty of moments where you'll be confused about what you just shot at or did, and that's all part of the Remedy charm that a lot of folks have come to know and love.</p>

<h2><em>FBC: Firebreak</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>FBC: Firebreak</em> seems like a giant swing and a miss. It's straightforward. Remedy attempted to step out of its comfort zone, but it failed in the process of doing so. The progressive system is dull, the gunplay is boring, and the overall loop isn't enough to keep players coming back for more.</p>

It’s a message that comes with the promise that an update, as well as a new release date, will be delivered this fall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear,” Bungie said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft Marathon into the game that truly reflects your passion. After much discussion within our Dev team, we’ve made the decision to delay the September 23 release.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Marathon delay follows criticism revolving around a Marathon alpha test held in April. The conversation around Bungie’s new take on the live-service, extraction shooter formula has been heated to say the least, so a delay isn’t too shocking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Alpha test created an opportunity for us to calibrate and focus the game on what will make it uniquely compelling — survival under pressure, mystery and lore around every corner, raid-like endgame challenges, and Bungie’s genre-defining FPS combat,” Bungie’s message adds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re using this time to empower the team to create the intense, high-stakes experience that a title like Marathon is built around. This means deepening the relationship between the developers and the game’s most important voices: our players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hermen Hulst went as far as to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-admits-marathon-feedback-has-been-varied-but-insists-it-will-avoid-repeating-concord-mistakes-and-commits-to-launch-by-end-of-march-2026">address feedback</a> just last week, calling the response from fans “varied.” His comments also included the promise that the Marathon reboot would get a release date set by March 31, 2026, while assuring naysayers that the company had no intention of repeating <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-wave-goodbye-to-playstation-flop-concord-as-it-goes-dark-maybe-forever"><u>the mistakes</u></a> seen with last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord"><u>Concord</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While no new Marathon release date has been revealed, it appears as though players can at least expect to get their hands on Bungie’s latest by March 2026. In the meantime, the studio has laid out three major points of feedback it plans to address that should leave a better taste in players’ mouths. These include “upping the survival game,” which means more challenging and engaging AI encounters, more tense and strategic combat, and a more rewarding experience overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie adds that players can expect increased visual fidelity across the Marathon experience along with more story to uncover and a darker tone that falls more in-line with the original Marathon universe. The delay also grants the studio the opportunity to add “more social experiences,” including improvements for solo and duo runs as well as proximity chat.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marathon - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“You’ll hear from us again later this Fall when we can share the progress we’ve made, alongside the game’s new release date,” Bungie concluded. “Thank you again for your patience and — much more importantly — your passion. Your continued feedback will help us make Marathon the incredible gaming experience we all know it can be.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-reveals-new-marathon-game-at-playstation-showcase"><u>announced its Marathon reboot in May 2023</u></a> and remained quiet as its development progressed throughout 2024.

            <p>
Bungie has announced an indefinite delay for its live-service extraction shooter Marathon, citing the community's "passionate" feedback following its reveal in April and a subsequent playtest.
</p>
<p>
Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">formally unveiled its Marathon reboot</a> in May 2023, but the response wasn't an immediately enthusiastic one, given the decision to ditch the classic Marathon series' single-player focus in favour of PvP - and the reboot has largely remained in the news for all the wrong reasons since then. It's faced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">leadership changes</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">substantial legal challenges</a>, it's seen ongoing reports of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">declining staff morale</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-management-vehemently-shut-down-destiny-2-subscription-idea-as-reports-of-toxicity-continue">accusations of toxicity aimed at Bungie management</a>, it's been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">embroiled in a plagiarism scandal</a>, and more.
</p>

April's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">big reveal</a>, then, was a chance for Bungie to shift the narrative to something more positive. But reactions weren't especially kind - some went as far as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-concord-developer-hits-back-at-criticism-of-bungies-marathon-reveal">draw comparisons with Sony's ill-fated Concord</a> - and it seems Marathon's alpha playtest last month also generated substantial negative criticism, judging by <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update">Bungie's latest blog post</a>.

"Thank you not only for your passionate feedback around the Marathon reveal and Alpha playtest," the studio wrote, "but also for your patience while we took the time to listen closely and chart our next steps. Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear. We've taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft Marathon into the game that truly reflects your passion."
</p>
<p>
As a result, and "after much discussion", Marathon will no longer launch on 23rd September as originally announced, and has instead been indefinitely delayed. "The alpha test created an opportunity for us to calibrate and focus the game on what will make it uniquely compelling," Bungie continued. "We're using this [extra] time to empower the team to create the intense, high-stakes experience that a title like Marathon is built around."
</p>
<p>
As it looks to get Marathon back on track, Bungie will hold more closed testing over the "next few months". These will bring new game updates and features, with the studio's "immediate focus" being on the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Upping the Survival Game</li>
<ul>
<li>More challenging and engaging AI encounters</li>
<li>More rewarding runs, with new types of loot and dynamic events</li>
<li>Making combat more tense and strategic</li>
</ul>
<li>Doubling down on the Marathon Universe</li>
<ul>
<li>Increased visual fidelity</li>
<li>More narrative and environmental storytelling to discover and interact with</li>
<li>A darker tone that delivers on the themes of the original trilogy</li>
</ul>
<li>Adding more social experiences</li>
<ul>
<li>A better player experience for solo/duos</li>
<li>Prox chat, so social stories can come to life</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Bungie says it'll provide a progress update, alongside a revised release date, some time this autumn. "Thank you again for your patience and - much more importantly - your passion," it concluded. "Your continued feedback will help us make Marathon the incredible gaming experience we all know it can be."
</p>
<p>
Today's delay announcement follows a wave of live-service project cancellations at Sony, as it continues to reassess the viability of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan's ambitious live-service strategy</a>. In 2023, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">pulled the plug on Naughty Dog's multiplayer The Last of Us game</a>, and it opted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">not to revive Concord after its disastrous launch last year</a>. The company has reportedly also cancelled a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">live-service adaptation of Twisted Metal</a> in development at Firesprite, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">live-service Spider-Man at Insomniac</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">live-service God of War at Bluepoint</a>, and an unknown live-service project at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> studio Sony Bend. Despite that, the company recently insisted it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-remains-committed-to-diverse-and-resilient-live-service-games-including-forthcoming-marathon-and-fairgames-despite-high-profile-failures">remains committed to "diverse and resilient" live-service portfolio</a>.

<p>As the press release states, Power Word Resist isn't just an event, it is a rallying point for the tabletop community, one of solidarity and creative generosity.</p>

<p>"This show and auction strive to uplift our community as an act of joyful resistance,” notes Sara Lang, one of the event organizers. “We chose these causes to support people both on the local and national level who are being targeted by the current administration.”</p>

<p>“We’re always ready to support critical causes in our community like these, and happy to work with and alongside such great groups to do so this year,” said Ian E. Muller, CEO of Gehenna Gaming, one of the event sponsors. “Charities like RAINN and GenderNexus serve a critical role in both the tabletop community and on local and national levels to help protect, educate, and empower some of our most vulnerable.”</p>
</blockquote>

            <p>
Welp! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> has been delayed. The writing was not only on the wall, but on the floors, the doors, the ceiling, cripes, how did it hit that one spot? A lukewarm (at best) reception mixed with a discovery that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bungie">Bungie</a> had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">wholesale lifted the work of another artist without permission</a> all led to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-a-rough-reception-and-evidence-of-art-theft-in-marathon-morale-is-reportedly-in-free-fall-at-bungie">reported free fall of morale at the studio</a>, so this is honestly the least surprising thing in the world. In any case, let's look at the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update">post Bungie made</a> explaining their decision to delay the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear," Bungie wrote. "We've taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft Marathon into the game that truly reflects your passion. After much discussion within our Dev team, we’ve made the decision to delay the September 23rd release." Worth noting here that a replacement date hasn't been set, so this seems like quite a big one.
</p>
<p>
Bungie outlined some key areas that they plan to focus on with this delay too. For one, they plan on making it more challenging and making the AI encounters more engaging. They intended to make runs feel more rewarding with "new types of loot and dynamic events," and to make combat "more tense and stratetigc."
</p>
<p>
There are a few interesting lines too. They plan on "doubling down on the Marathon Universe" with "increased visual fidelity", "more narrative and environmental storytelling to discover and interact with," and a "darker tone that delivers on the themes of the original trilogy." A lot of the complaints I've seen anecdotally have been about the presentation of the story, which has felt very unclear.
</p>
<p>
Bungie also quite vaguely wrote that they'll add in more social experiences, part of that being a better experience for solo and duos, and the addition of proximity chat, "so social stories can come to life." The solo and duos part will be welcome news to many, as being forced into trios was offputting to a lot of people. I hope that there's something akin to a hub area to hang out in too, Destiny is very much a hang out and vibe kind of game, and it's why people like the series.
</p>
<p>
The post ends with the studio saying that they'll have more to share in the fall/ autumn, including the game's new release date. It's quite clear that Bungie, and presumably Sony/ PlayStation, are afraid of a bomb, something all involved parties will be desperate to avoid. The ghost of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a> can still be felt, after all.
</p>
<p>
I don't expect this to be a minor delay. While Bungie didn't go into a huge amount of specifics, they outlined a lot of big changes. I'm not confident that they can all be fixed in less than a year. We'll find out in due time.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo 4 x Berserk | Official Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As highlighted by Loika on the Diablo 4 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1l9hng1/i_think_its_devious_of_blizz_to_put_buy_with/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">subreddit</a> and broken down by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/is-diablo-4s-new-reliquary-battle-pass-predatory-377282" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, the issues with the Reliquary system actually go deeper. While players can earn "favor" tokens for free while playing to unlock some rewards, the game also prominently presents the option to buy those same rewards with Diablo 4's premium currency.</p><p dir="ltr">In the example screenshot Loika gives, one set of armor can be redeemed for 15 tokens or 750 Platinum (roughly $7.50). The option to spend Platinum is featured prominently in the middle of the screen, and spending Platinum can be done without a confirmation screen. It's easy to see how players might accidentally click the wrong button one time and suddenly be out $7.50.</p><p dir="ltr">Another player points out in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1l9hng1/comment/mxcvm69/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">comments</a> how when using a controller, the button used to claim rewards with tokens or buy with Platinum actually changes. Initially, the left face button is used to "Claim" a reward, but upon pressing the button, another menu appears where "Claim with Favor Token" instead moves to a different button and purchase with Platinum is instead on the left face button. This issue was corroborated by GameSpot. Once again, it's easy to see how someone just clicking through the menus could easily spend money without meaning to.</p><p dir="ltr">The game's bundle system is also drawing criticism. Players can purchase individual premium Reliquaries separately for 500 Platinum or 1,500 Platinum for all three. However, the game offers a "Battle Pass Bundle" (confusingly named, since the battle pass terminology is no longer found anywhere else in the game) that nets players all three premium Reliquaries for 1,000 Platinum. Buying the bundle is definitely the way to go and saves players 500 Platinum, but if a player already bought one Reliquary (whether intentionally or by accident) they become locked out of the 1,000 Platinum bundle and instead are forced to buy each Reliquary individually. That means players who purchase one Reliquary but then later decides they want the others are essentially forced to spend an extra $5.</p><p dir="ltr">Then there's the Deluxe Battle Pass Bundle. One might think that for 2,800 Platinum (nearly triple the price of the standard bundle) that the number of new rewards would be significant, but that's not the case. The Deluxe Battle Pass Bundle grants instant access to an armor set already available in the standard bundle, as well as two additional rewards--a pet and a pair of wing cosmetics. That means players are spending an extra 1,800 Platinum, nearly $20, for just two minor cosmetic items.</p><p dir="ltr">During a recent Campfire Chat livestream, Blizzard stated it has heard "overwhelming feedback" about the Reliquary system and is looking to improve it, but that changes won't be coming in Season 9. Diablo director of social and content marketing Adam Fletcher further elaborated in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1kt05z4/comment/mtsld3l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit comment</a> that the goal of the Reliquary system is "to add something for all players and not just paid." Additionally, Fletcher said for future IP collabs Blizzard will look to bring "better options and value, so players aren't only given some higher priced tier options and are left with that only." That came in response to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-berserk-crossover-is-a-huge-wasted-opportunity/1100-6531373/" data-ref-id="1100-6531373">Diablo 4's disappointing Berserk crossover</a>, which was largely just an opportunity to buy high-priced cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">Thanks to Blizzard releasing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-2025-roadmap-highlights-new-crossovers-endgame-updates/1100-6530666/" data-ref-id="1100-6530666">Diablo 4 2025 roadmap</a>, players already know what to expect for the rest of the year in terms of new content. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-let-players-build-their-own-spells/1100-6531782/" data-ref-id="1100-6531782">Diablo 4 Season 9 will let players craft their own spells</a>, including one <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-may-introduce-a-game-changing-teleport-spell-if-blizzard-doesnt-nerf-it/1100-6531986/" data-ref-id="1100-6531986">teleport spell that might be a tad overpowered</a>. Another IP crossover is also slated for later this year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">Diablo 4's second expansion, however, isn't coming until 2026</a>.</p>

"We've taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft Marathon into the game that truly reflects your passion. After much discussion within our Dev team, we've made the decision to delay the September 23rd release."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fvbEnWLRo1s"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fvbEnWLRo1s" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Bungie continues, stating the recent Alpha test period created an opportunity for the Marathon dev team to calibrate and focus on what will make the game compelling in the survival FPS genre. It will use additional closed testing (including Alpha participants) to deploy gameplay updates and test new features as they come online over the next few months. Those features include "upping the survival game, doubling down on the Marathon universe, [and] adding more social experiences."&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding upping the survival game, Bungie plans to add "more challenging and engaging AI encounters, more rewarding runs, with new types of loot and dynamic events, [and] making combat more tense and strategic." For doubling down on the Marathon universe, the developer plans to increase visual fidelity, add more narrative and environmental storytelling to discover and interact with, and a darker tone that delivers on the themes of the original trilogy. And finally, in terms of adding more social experiences, Bungie wants a better player experience for solos and duos, and to add proximity chat, "so social stories can come to life."&nbsp;</p><p>Bungie says players will hear from it this Fall when it can share its progress alongside the game's new release date. This indefinite delay follows news last month after an artist online <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262">claimed</a> Bungie had stolen her work and used it in Marathon, which <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/16/bungie-confirms-unauthorized-use-of-art-after-artist-claims-her-work-is-present">Bungie confirmed as an "unauthorized use" of art shortly after</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting to learn the new release date, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/12/bungie-shares-first-marathon-gameplay">check out this Marathon gameplay trailer</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Do these improvements for Marathon sound like something you want?

						<h5>Mario Kart World</h5><p><span>June 5, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>Nintendo Switch 2</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>It’s been a while since Mario upgraded his wheels. To be fair, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mario-kart-8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart 8</a> is a pretty tough act to follow, selling over 75 million copies between its Wii U and Switch iterations, but with the long-awaited launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, the Mushroom Kingdom crew are once again hitting the asphalt in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>Does Mario Kart World successfully expand the beloved franchise's horizons? Or does this open-world variation on the series take a wrong turn? Buckle up racers, it's time to find out...</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFmariokartworld10.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As its title implies, Mario Kart World goes the full-on open-world route, stitching all of its 30 courses together into one interconnected sandbox covering the usual array of biomes (city, beach, jungle, desert, Bowser’s castle, and beyond). While you’ll mostly stick to the track while racing, a new Free Roam mode allows you to go offroad and drive wherever your heart desires.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, vehicle handling feels quite similar to Mario Kart 8, with all the standard techniques, such as drifting and hitting tricks to earn mini turbo boosts, still being intact. That said, some MK8 features, most notably the game’s trippy anti-gravity racing, have been left in the toybox this time around. There are additions as well, including a doubling of the number of competitors per race (up to a full 24) and a number of new techniques. The most important of these added techniques is the Charge Jump, which allows players racing in a straight line to build up and release energy in order to jump and get a small speed boost. The boost isn’t terribly useful, but the jump plays into two other techniques, as you’ll usually need that hop to pull off new-to-Mario-Kart-World rail grinds and wall rides.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFmariokartworld11.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Mario Kart World’s new techniques definitely don’t come as naturally as classic moves like drifting, and most of the time you don’t actually need to do them to best the AI, but they’re fun to do and great for bragging rights when playing against friends. Perhaps most importantly, new moves like rail grinding and wall riding introduce another level of skill to a series that has often been criticized for being a bit too random, so I welcome their addition, even if you can largely ignore them unless you’re looking to dominate online.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFmariokartworld12.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, solid racing mechanics only matter if you have a good set of courses to race on, and, thankfully, Mario Kart World largely delivers. Nintendo has really gone all out with interesting and varied course themes, with the game’s new tracks taking you through an animal-filled safari, a ghostly living movie, and a spaceport lorded over by a giant robotic Donkey Kong, just to name a few. A number of classic courses, such as the OG Mario Circuit and Dino Dino Jungle, also return, but in most cases their layouts have been significantly updated, to the point they feel like completely new experiences. I’d be lying if I said the removal of anti-grav racing isn’t felt, as most courses don’t quite have that instant mind-bending wow factor Mario Kart 8’s tracks did a decade ago. That said, many of Mario Kart World’s courses are plenty memorable in their own right, as Nintendo has gone out of their way to really push each track’s specific theme, serving up plenty of unique sights, features, and hazards.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFmariokartworld13.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Many of Mario Kart World’s courses are also downright gorgeous. When the first trailers and clips for Mario Kart World dropped, there was some grumbling that the game didn’t look that much better than Mario Kart 8 (partly because Nintendo decided to debut the game with a look at one of its least-visually-interesting tracks for some reason) but let me assure you, playing the full game on a big 4K HDR-enabled screen is a treat. From the rich autumnal colors and rushing rapids of Cheep Cheep Falls, to the cloud-shrouded Great ? Block Ruins, to a truly epic version of Bowser’s Castle, Mario Kart World is a consistent stunner and never drops below its 60fps target no matter how much bedlam is on screen.</p>
<p>While most of Mario Kart World’s main courses are good to great, changes to classic modes like Grand Prix brought about by the game’s new open-world structure don’t always serve the racing experience that well. While each Grand Prix cup begins as they always have, with players taking three laps around an opening course, you’re then required to actually drive to each following course, with the first two or three “laps” of the second, third, and fourth Grand Prix races consisting of transitional routes followed by a single lap around a more traditional track.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFmariokartworld14.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While these connecting routes are fine, they also serve a utilitarian purpose – to get you from one place to another in the open world – and thus tend to be filled with a lot of lengthy straightaway sections. Now, in most racing games, straightaways are fun! They’re the place where you get to build up speed! But in Mario Kart games, you tend to get up to maximum speed quickly, with most challenge traditionally coming from skillfully navigating hazards and drifting around corners. As such, straightaways can sometimes feel kind of dull, particularly if you’re at the front of the pack and can’t even ping anyone with a red shell for laughs.</p>
<p>It seems likely these transitional routes were one of the reasons Nintendo added some of Mario Kart World’s new maneuvers, as finding a new rail to grind adds a bit of challenge to these otherwise undemanding stretches of straight track. That said, sometimes these straightaways don’t even <em>have</em> rails to grind, leaving you to just hold the acceleration button for seconds at a time. Now, don’t get me wrong, these transitional bits don’t <em>ruin the game</em> or anything so dramatic, but I’ll admit, while connecting all the tracks together within a larger world is a neat trick, most of the time, I’d probably prefer to just do three laps on each of the Grand Prix’s main courses as that’s where the best racing moments are concentrated.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFmariokartworld15.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>But Grand Prix isn’t the only big single-player mode this time around, as Mario Kart World adds the new Knockout Tour. This mode is a battle royale of sorts, consisting of a continuous race through six interconnected courses, with the four bottom racers eliminated at each checkpoint. Survive to the final four and come in first to win. It's an interesting new idea, and the fact that you always have to be concerned about your placement in the pack does ratchet up the intensity, but the mode has a few issues. For starters, the mode focuses even more heavily on those so-so connecting routes than Grand Prix, and secondly, the mode doesn't really mesh well with Mario Kart's inherent randomness. You can play through an entire 6-race Knockout Tour Rally only to be hit with a red shell right before the final finish line and come in second (something that's happened to me more than once). Knockout Tour is a promising concept worth keeping around and refining, but, at least for now, I still prefer Grand Prix, even if it has its own issues.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFmariokartworld16.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>So, if Mario Kart World’s sandbox doesn’t necessarily benefit its traditional racing experience, is it at least worthwhile in its own right? How does Free Roam mode stand up? You can enter Free Roam any time you want from the main menu and there really are very few restrictions on where you can go – if you see something, and you’re clever enough, you can probably drive there. As for what you actually do in the open world beyond just driving around, it’s somewhat limited as there’s no story mode nor any NPCs you can interact with in a meaningful way. Players can find P Switches scattered around the world, which allow you to tackle simple missions (collect the blue coins, drive through the checkpoints, etc.) You can also find ? Panels and Princess Coins hidden in out-of-the-way locations. You don’t get much reward for doing these things – mainly, you unlock stickers, which can be affixed to your kart but mostly act as a basic achievement system.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFmariokartworld17.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As simple as Free Roam is, I’ll admit, I still found myself quite enjoying my time with it. It brought to mind Peach’s Castle from the classic Super Mario 64, in the sense that there’s not a lot of structure to driving around Mario Kart World’s sandbox, there’s not a lot of traditional <em>reward</em> for doing it, but it’s still fun to do for its own sake. The world is packed with nooks and crannies to explore, tricks to pull off, and often-gorgeous vistas to take in. Are you going to spend hours straight totally immersed in Free Roam mode? Probably not, but it’s an entertaining and relaxing way to spend a few minutes when you’ve had enough of Grand Prix or battling online.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFmariokartworld18.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>And hey, if you’re not that into Free Roam, there are other traditional Mario Kart distractions to take part in. Mario Kart World gets a full Battle Mode right from the get go, with players being able to jump into Balloon Battle or Coin Runners matches in one of eight modestly-sized closed-off arenas. Battle Mode is surprisingly old-school in its approach, but that isn’t a bad thing, as it remains good, simple fun, with the increased 24-player limit adding some intensity to the proceedings. Of course, Time Trials also return, so get ready to take on those ghosts.</p>
<p>Most of Mario Kart World’s modes can be tackled online or against bots, if you’re the antisocial type. Online play felt nice and smooth to me, and certain modes, Knockout Tour in particular, really take on a life of their own with a crew of rowdy online opponents. That said, the larger player count meant I was often left waiting for minutes at a time for a race to start (thankfully, you can mess around in Free Roam while you’re in the queue).</p>

<p>There’s certainly no shortage of things to see and do in Mario Kart World, but the big-money question is… is it worth the big 80 coins? Mario Kart World’s collection of 30 courses is nothing to sniff at, but they are less than the 48 you get with the $60 Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. How much does the game’s open world count for? And, of course, we can’t pretend inflation doesn’t exist -- that $60 you paid in 2017 (the year MK8 Deluxe came out) translates to around $80 today. Personally, I’m not really a fan of breaking down a game’s worth in such a mercantile way. What I can say, is that Mario Kart World feels like a very full-featured ride, one that will hopefully end up even more tricked out as additional updates roll out. But, at the same time, I definitely understand if the game’s price tag makes you pump the breaks.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Mario Kart World is a bold and ambitious new entry in the world’s most popular racing franchise, delivering smartly updated mechanics, a collection of gorgeous courses, and an open world that impresses with its scope and variety. Admittedly, the game doesn’t quite manage to eclipse the giant that is Mario Kart 8 and some classic modes don’t mesh perfectly with the new sandbox approach, but there’s no denying Mario Kart World gets the Switch 2 off to a peppy start.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Core mechanics smartly updated
</li><li>Courses are clever, varied, and fun
</li><li>Dazzling visuals and smooth performance
</li><li>Free Roam is a pleasurable time waster
</li><li>Classic Battle Mode remains a blast
</li><li>Sprawling, catchy soundtrack
</li><li>Lots of content</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Connecting routes not always thrilling
</li><li>Free Roam may be too unstructured for some
</li><li>But is it $80 worth of content?</li>						</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/editorial/688415/state-of-handheld-gaming-editorial-switch-2-deck-oled-sold-out<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I love modern handheld gaming, and I recommend it to anyone and everyone. Just maybe not <em>today</em>? If you decided today was the day to finally drop hundreds of dollars on your first handheld, I might advise you to wait.</p><p>Four reasons:</p><div><ul><li><span>The best handhelds are sold out</span></li><li><span>The second-best handhelds just got more expensive</span></li><li><span>Third-tier handhelds are riddled with compromises </span></li><li><span>The entire state of gaming handhelds will improve if you wait</span></li></ul></div><div><p id="the-best-handhelds-are-sold-out"><h2><strong>The best handhelds are sold out</strong></h2></p></div><p>If you’re reading this story, I suspect you’ve been on the fence about handheld gaming machines — until the Nintendo Switch 2, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">the fastest-selling game console of all time</a>, caught your attention. Perhaps you liked the idea of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">bigger <em>Mario Kart</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/681222/fortnite-nintendo-switch-2-hands-on">smoother <em>Fortnite</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/679031/pokemon-violet-scarlet-switch-2-update-hands-on"><em>Pokémon</em></a>; perhaps you liked the idea of taking graphically intensive games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on the go.</p><p>Unfortunately, the $450 Nintendo Switch 2 is sold out everywhere as of this writing, and its alternatives may not offer the experience you’d hope.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">$550 Steam Deck OLED</a> is the best, most Switch-like handheld you can buy thanks to its pick-up-and-play SteamOS operating system, its similarly decent battery life, and an eye-popping HDR OLED screen. You might even be happier with a Deck OLED than a Switch 2 if you prefer the freedom of PC gaming to Nintendo’s first-party games. But the Steam Deck OLED, too, is entirely <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck" rel="sponsored">out of stock</a> in the US and Canada. You’d have to wait.</p><div><p id="the-second-best-handhelds-just-got-more-expensive"><h2><strong>The second-best handhelds just got more expensive</strong></h2></p></div><p>If I were buying today and couldn’t get a Switch 2 or Deck OLED, what would I buy instead? A few months ago, the choice seemed clear: I would personally spend a bit more money for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">the $800 Asus ROG Ally X</a>, the best Windows gaming handheld yet — and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">arguably the best PC gaming handheld period</a> once you replace Windows with the SteamOS-like Bazzite. </p><p>If I couldn’t afford that, I would have waited for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">$500 Lenovo Legion Go S</a>, the first true Steam Deck competitor authorized to use SteamOS. </p><p>But both of those prices no longer apply. Ahead of the Nintendo Switch 2’s launch on June 5th, Asus and Lenovo’s handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/682594/asus-rog-ally-x-price-hike-legion-go-s-steam-deck-oled-supply">suddenly cost $100 more</a> than promised in the US. So does their rival the MSI Claw, with both 7- and 8-inch models $100 pricier than originally communicated. It’s possible these increases are tied to China tariffs and could go down again, but neither company would tell us so. </p><div><p id="third-tier-handhelds-are-riddled-with-compromises"><h2><strong>Third-tier handhelds are riddled with compromises </strong></h2></p></div><p>If money were burning a hole in my pocket, the next thing I’d probably do is talk myself into buying a first-gen handheld PC. I’d (correctly!) point out that the original $650 Asus ROG Ally and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">original Lenovo Legion Go</a> have the same AMD Z1 Extreme chips as the newer Ally X and Legion Go S. But I’d be tricking myself into buying dramatically shorter battery life and a less comfortable experience. </p><p>Both the Ally X and the Legion Go S are better than the originals, with slightly better performance and <em>far</em> longer playtime from the Ally X’s doubled battery pack. Asus and Lenovo have made their cooling systems quieter and more efficient, the Legion’s speakers and charging are improved, and its lower-res variable-refresh-rate screen can sometimes make games run smoothly that’d be choppy on its predecessor.</p><p>In some cases ignorance is bliss; some power users would be perfectly happy if they found a good deal on the original Ally or Legion Go. But for a new buyer, the totality of these changes could be profound — the difference between “I don’t know why anybody would want a PC gaming handheld” and “where has this been all my life?” </p><div><p id="the-entire-state-of-gaming-handhelds-will-improve-if-you-wait"><h2><strong>The entire state of gaming handhelds will improve if you wait</strong></h2></p></div><p>But the most profound change, for many gamers, would be having a potent portable game system that just works. The original Nintendo Switch offered portability and ease of use, but it’s never been a powerhouse; almost all of today’s Windows handhelds are more powerful than a Switch 2 or a Steam Deck, but I can’t rely on them to wake and sleep and launch games reliably. </p><p>Excitingly, both Valve and Microsoft finally appear poised to fix that.</p><p>Valve is finally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/673114/valves-huge-steam-deck-update-is-now-ready-for-everyone-including-rival-amd-handhelds">bringing its pick-up-and-play SteamOS to other handhelds</a> beyond the Steam Deck, including official support for the Legion Go S and unofficial support for the Legion Go and Asus ROG Ally line. (But as I’ll explain, you might not want to rush out and download Valve’s recovery image just yet.)</p><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft has announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">a stripped-down version of Windows for gaming handhelds</a>, one that ditches the desktop in favor of an “Xbox full-screen experience” that will come to various handhelds next year, including the existing Ally and Ally X. It promises to improve sleep, wake, performance, and battery life while making non-Steam storefronts into first-class citizens. </p><p>Presumably, any major PC handheld will soon let you choose between Windows and Steam. But that’s not a reason to buy them today.</p><p>For one, it seems that both Microsoft and Valve are prioritizing their partners’ flashiest hardware launches first. The new Xbox-ified Windows will first arrive on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">a pair of “Xbox Ally” handhelds co-developed with Asus</a> this holiday season, which could suck all the air out of the room for rival Windows machines, particularly if Microsoft decides this is the moment to compete with Valve’s Steam Deck on price.</p><p>And while you can indeed install Valve’s big SteamOS update on rival Windows handhelds with AMD chips, it only fully supports the SteamOS version of the Lenovo Legion Go S at this point. When I tried installing it on an Asus ROG Ally or even the Windows version of the Legion Go S, it was missing necessary power modes to keep it from unnecessarily draining its own battery and had some bugs as well.</p><p>Here’s Valve’s Lawrence Yang to <em>The Verge</em> on the rollout plans:</p><div><blockquote><p><em>Currently, the SteamOS model of Legion Go S (dark purple model) is the only officially supported non-Steam Deck device with SteamOS. We are continuing to improve compatibility with more devices, starting with other AMD powered handhelds like the ROG Ally. Features like RGB controls and power management for the Ally are in the pipe, and will be noted in patch notes as we ship updates. </em></p><p><em>We’re looking at support across AMD powered handhelds, including Legion Go, Legion Go S + Windows, and ROG Ally models.</em></p></blockquote></div><p>Even the SteamOS version of the Legion Go S didn’t launch 100 percent baked: I keep seeing the tiny trackpad stop working properly (Valve tells me it’s investigating), and there’s no official way to control the RGB lighting. </p><p>Speaking of fully baked, it seems even Nintendo launched its Switch 2 with notable issues. We’ve heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQG7R5mcHPE">reports of crashes</a> and freezes, an issue <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fau%2Fsupport%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-2-freezes-locks-up-or-will-not-power-off%2F" rel="sponsored">that has its own Nintendo support page</a>, and some (including me) have found intermittent issues getting a system to stay connected to wired ethernet. Many are having trouble <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688152/nintendo-switch-2-hdr-washed-out-bright-fix">getting content to display properly on a TV</a> without washing out or oversaturating. </p><p>It’s not clear when the biggest issues facing today’s gaming handhelds will get fixed, or how evenly distributed the fixes might be. I’m not saying that’s a reason to stay away for <em>long</em> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">nobody’s expecting a Steam Deck 2</a> or a Switch 2 OLED anytime soon, so I don’t fear that particular flavor of buyer’s remorse. </p><p>But knowing what I know today, I wouldn’t rush to buy a handheld now. I’d wait a month or three until Switch 2 and Steam Deck OLED supplies return — or at least until the future of Windows and SteamOS get a little less fuzzy.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The final phase of <em>Hades II</em> development involves adding the story’s true ending and other finishing touches. Some additional details are in the in-game Development Roadmap.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Luy1bWjMOeA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Luy1bWjMOeA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A dramatic reading</a></span> of the new patch notes runs over 38 minutes and includes things like revamping The Flames of Ygnium for snappier combat, new final forms for Nocturnal Arms, and enemies spawning in faster during waves to limit downtime. Probably most noticeable at the outset is that Narcissus has an actual 3D model, animations, and an updated portrait now. No more being self-obsessed with placeholder art. The game’s main menu has also been updated to state that the next update will coincide with the 1.0 launch on PC, Switch 1, and Switch 2 (PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S will come later). </p><p>While <em>Hades 2 </em>is confirmed to be coming out in full sometime in 2025, Supergiant Games isn’t ready to reveal the exact timing just yet, and I wouldn’t necessarily be surprised if it slips to 2026. “We really appreciate your patience on this,” Kasavin wrote. “Sometimes the last stretch of development on a game can make all the difference, so we have always taken this phase seriously and appreciate your continued support.” We also don’t know what the final price will be. <em>Hades 2</em> is currently $30 on Steam ($27 with the current 10 percent discount), but it could go up to $40 once it’s out on consoles.</p><p>The action roguelite is launching simultaneously on both Switch 1 and Switch 2, with improved visual fidelity and framerate on the newer hardware. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-switch-2-exclusivity-pc-steam-1-0-date-1851775233&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-switch-2-exclusivity-pc-steam-1-0-date-1851775233">Supergiant hasn’t confirmed yet whether that “next-gen” upgrade will cost more</a></span> or be a free upgrade. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-team-cherry-1851743081&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-team-cherry-1851743081"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a></span>, another sequel to a critically acclaimed indie action game, is also set to arrive later this year.
