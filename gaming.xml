<p>STALKER 2 has been on the market for three days, and it seems that for every person ranting about the game, there’s someone there singing the title’s praises. It’s a divisive game, that’s for sure – but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in my review</a>, I gave it a 9/10 and recommended gamers everywhere invest at least a little time in the post-apocalyptic epic.</p>



<p>GSC Game World is hard at work patching up the game, addressing the bugs that have caused some users to leave negative reviews or order refunds of the game that took more than a decade to piece together.</p>



<p>The next update is said to be a doozy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-changes-incoming">Changes Incoming</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455843903878203415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on Steam</a>, GSC Game World revealed that the next STALKER 2 update is a hefty one. It’s going to target some of the stickiest issues players have been dealing with since the game was released on November 20 on Xbox and PC.</p>



<p>This includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Issue and memory allocation failures (PC)</li>



<li>Main quest progression fixes (game-breaking bugs)</li>



<li>Gameplay balancing and adjustments (trader prices and NPC behaviour)</li>



<li>Cutscene fixes (facial animations and clipping)</li>



<li>‘Softlock’ fixes (menu freezing)</li>



<li>UI improvements (quest notifications, interaction prompts)</li>
</ul>



<p>In a future update, the team will work on ironing out bugs in the ‘A-Life’ system that powers the game’s AI-driven NPCs. It has been a notorious issue since the game dropped, with the intelligent, realistic AI that was promised not having been delivered.</p>



<p>GSC will also work to address controller-based issues, such as dead zone bug fixes.</p>



<p>In a statement, the team said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We want to reassure you once more that we will make every effort to constantly improve your S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl experience. We are truly grateful for your feedback and suggestions for improvement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Disrespect, the disgraced content creator who found himself at the centre of a dire scandal in recent months, has teased a departure from YouTube in favour of Rumble, a competing platform.</p>



<p>It all started with a new ‘DrDisrespect’ profile cropping up on Rumble, which according to <a href="https://streamscharts.com/platforms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">StreamsCharts.com</a> is the sixth largest streaming site by viewer numbers. From there, Rumble’s CEO posted a cryptic message on social media that many saw as a connection to Dr Disrespect.</p>



<p>This move has come from Dr Disrespect’s failure to regain monetisation on YouTube, which he lost when he admitted to using Twitch to inappropriately message a minor in 2017.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-home-same-old-doc">New Home, Same Old Doc</h2>



<p>Rumble’s CEO has been flying in the face of controversy, refusing to acknowledge Dr Disrespect’s wrongdoing and seemingly teasing the scandalous creator’s impending arrival several times on social media. In a post on October 26, Chris Pavlovski, Rumble’s CEO, said that he’s securing the ‘biggest gaming streamer’ with a contract in 2025.</p>



<p>At the end of <a href="https://x.com/layer_cake/status/1860133482930094342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dr Disrespect’s most recent stream</a>, the veteran creator faded out with a cryptic sequence. His broadcast dropped to bars and tones before pivoting to a loading screen that read ‘Connection Redirected’. </p>



<p>Fans and critics alike have surmised that Dr Disrespect is about to announce a move to Rumble which could kickstart in 2025.</p>



<p>In June, the infamous streamer admitted to messaging a minor on Twitch several years ago but stressed that nothing criminal took place and that the business was long since settled. Regardless, he lost the support of hundreds of thousands of followers, had ties with other content creators cut, and was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-studio-cut-ties-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped by sponsorship partners</a>.</p>



<p>Despite the scandal, he returned to streaming in September and pulled in substantial numbers, with his core following standing firm in the face of blatant issues.</p>



<p>Will you be following Dr Disrespect over to Rumble? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

			<p>Modder HalkHogan has finally released <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-nextgen-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project NextGen Edition</a>, the final version of his texture overhaul for CD Projekt RED's next-gen version of the open world RPG masterpiece. According to HalkHogan, though, the improvement is far more extensive than just a texture upscale.</p>
<p><em>The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project NextGen Edition is a project created from the heart that improves and reworks a huge amount of game assets (textures, models, materials and more), and the number of these changes can be counted in thousands. Everything is carefully made with attention to every detail. All this is aimed at making the game more detailed, realistic, consistent, and as faithful as possible, reflecting the atmosphere of the dirty world of The Witcher. Now you can experience the most beautiful adventure yet with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt!</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ultra quality detailed lore-friendly textures (many of them are reworked to 4K)</em></li>
<li><em>Implemented relief mapping on many surfaces, making them look much more realistic and 3D now</em></li>
<li><em>High quality smooth and more detailed models</em></li>
<li><em>Better object LODs (level of models details from distance) and increased draw distance for many objects</em></li>
<li><em>Specially customized materials and shaders for all reworked assets, that give the objects and surfaces a more realistic look</em></li>
<li><em>Everything consistent with the original CD Projekt RED artistic vision of The Witcher 3</em></li>
</ul>

            <p>Developer Asobo has advised <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> players to "move your community packages" if they experience persistent stability issues or long loading times.</p>
<p>In a notice appended to the 1.1.9.0 Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-update-1-1-9-0-available-now">release notes</a>, Asobo noted that outdated packages in the Community Folder could adversely impact performance, adding that relocating the packages to another folder and relaunching the game should help.</p>

<p>"If you are playing on PC, outdated packages in your Community Folder may have an unexpected impact on the title’s performance and behaviour," the statement said. "If you suffer from stability issues or long loading times, move your Community package(s) to another folder before relaunching the title."</p><p>The patch itself also addresses a crash when you select "As Arrival" in the EFB, a crash that could occur when "closing and invoking the Camera menu after changing the Drone focus mode option to a value other than undefined", as well as "various" other crashes across the title".</p> <div>

<p>A few other "general" bug fixes have also been resolved, including the missing cursor on Xbox Live sign-in popup, a problem where you could lose focus when creating a new input profile, and a bug wherein the aircraft selection is accessible via the control menu, but can only be changed from the home page.</p>
<p>It also fixes an issue where you could get stuck when accessing the menu bar from any help page.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-studio-apologises-for-issues-as-it-increases-server-capacity">the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 team apologised to its community</a> for the game's less than perfect debut, admitting, "this is not the launch experience we want for our players", admitting it vastly underestimated how many of us would be looking to take to the skies in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 at launch.</p>
<p>In related news, we recently learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-borrowed-all-its-animals-from-planet-zoo">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 borrowed all its animals from Planet Zoo</a>.</p>
<p>"I called my friend, the CEO. His name is Jonny [Watts], and I said, 'Hey, Jonny, I'm working on Flight Sim, can I have your animals from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-zoo">Planet Zoo</a>?' And he's like, 'Yeah, why not?'," said Flight Simulator boss Jorg Neumann. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Intel is preparing to reveal its next generation of graphics cards, and it looks like some early specs have been leaked thanks to a, now removed, store listing.</p>



<p>Amazon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gxp8e0/amazon_has_leaked_a_few_intel_arc_b580_gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">accidently listed</a>, then removed, what appeared to be two Intel Battlemage GPUs from ASRock. According to the store listing, the Intel Arc B580 features 12GB of GDDR6 memory with a speed of 19Gbps. The card also features a 192-bit memory bus which would result in a 456 GB/s or so bandwidth.</p>







<p>A couple interesting bits from the listing were the cards being PCIe x8 only as opposed to x16. Regarding boost frequency, the listing suggested a 2.8 GHz boost frequency compared to a 2.0 GHz from the Arc A580.</p>



<p>When reached for comment in the past, Intel has declined to comment on any rumor or speculation. That said, a store listing adds credence to rumors that an announcement of their new graphics cards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-battlemage-gpu-to-be-announced-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was set to come in December</a>.</p>

            <p>A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> fan believes they've discovered a hidden message that adds further credence to a long-held fan theory about the seminal horror game.</p>
<p>The player believes that on two television sets found in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> – the TV in the hospital cafeteria, and another in the nurses' lounge – a secret message is being played via Morse code.</p>

<p>"A message is playing on the TV in Brookhaven Hospital, transmitted in morse code," YouTuber Shiba explained.</p>
<p>"The sound is mostly drowned out by the static from the TV, making it difficult to hear clearly. However, the Morse code is distinct, with a clicking sound that resembles a telegraph. The loud clicks mark the beginning of a signal, while the softer click signal its end. If we listen closely, we can decipher the following message."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Another fun Silent Hill 2 Remake discovery, a TV in Brookhaven Hospital in morse code repeatedly says, "Again and Again and Again and Again" endlessly: <a href="https://t.co/v1OcX7r8tb">https://t.co/v1OcX7r8tb</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1859864583252607265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The message itself is pretty short, consisting of just two words and played on a loop: "Again and."</p>
<p>Coupled with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fan-cracks-mysterious-silent-hill-2-remake-photo-puzzle-revealing-secret-message-hidden-by-bloober-team">hidden message discovered hiding behind the mysterious photos found in Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, the morse code message adds further validity to the popular fan theory that James Sunderland is trapped in the town of Silent Hill, reliving his search of Mary on a loop "again and again and again and".</p>

The “game-aware” overlay lives in the Microsoft Game Bar and is designed to automatically find and show you links to tips and guides for the game you’re playing, using the Edge browser.</p><p>Game Assist uses the profile you’re logged into in Edge, so it’ll give you access to your data, like cookies, autofill, and favorites, so “you don’t need to log into sites again.” Like other Game Bar widgets, you can pin it above your game as you play. Game Assist is currently available in English, and you’ll need to opt into the preview and set Microsoft Edge Beta 132 as your default browser to use it.</p><p>Here’s a video of the feature in action: </p><p>You’ll have to find content yourself for most games for now, but the game-aware part of Game Assist will surface information automatically for a few games, including <em>Baldur’s Gate 3, Diablo IV, </em>and <em>Hellblade II: Senua’s Saga</em>. Microsoft says it’ll be adding support for others “throughout the preview and over time.”</p><p>In a second video, Microsoft shows how the overlay looks when used to follow along with video guides:</p><p>Microsoft says it’s collecting feedback in a few ways: </p><div><blockquote><p>You can share your feedback in Game Assist by going to&nbsp;<strong>Settings and more</strong>&nbsp;(“…”) &gt;&nbsp;<strong>Send feedback</strong>. You can also vote on which features you want to see added to Game Assist using the new&nbsp;<a href="https://feedbackportal.microsoft.com/feedback/forum/9612778f-73a0-ef11-8a69-000d3a4e63db">Game Assist Community feedback portal</a>, and we’ll be monitoring feedback on&nbsp;<a href="http://reddit.com/r/MicrosoftEdge">r/MicrosoftEdge</a>, X, and other social channels as well.</p></blockquote></div><p>Game Assist only supports mouse and keyboard input for the moment, but Microsoft writes it’s adding support for handhelds and gamepads in the future. Compact Mode support is also coming later, the company says.</p><p>Below are Microsoft’s instructions for getting started with Game Assist.</p><div><ul><li>Make sure Windows 11 and Game Bar are up to date.</li><li>Game Assist requires the Beta or Preview channel of Microsoft Edge. If you’re running Windows Insider builds on your PC or have opted into Edge Preview, you already have Edge Preview and can skip to Step 3. Otherwise:</li><li>Install the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/">Microsoft Edge Insider Beta channel</a>&nbsp;(you can also use the Dev channel for the latest updates, but things may be slightly less stable).</li><li>Set Edge Beta as your default browser: go to&nbsp;<strong>Windows Settings</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Apps</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Default apps</strong>, search for&nbsp;<strong>Edge</strong>&nbsp;and, at the top of the page, click&nbsp;<strong>Edge Beta</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Set as default</strong>.</li><li>To opt-into Game Assist (Preview) and install the Game Bar widget, in Edge, go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings and more</strong>&nbsp;(“…”) &gt;&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>, then search for&nbsp;<strong>Game Assist</strong>&nbsp;in the search box, find the Game Assist option (above the&nbsp;<strong>Page zoom</strong>&nbsp;setting), and select&nbsp;<strong>Install widget</strong>.</li><li>If you haven’t used Edge Beta/Preview before, in Edge, go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings and more</strong>&nbsp;(“…”) &gt;&nbsp;<strong>Close Microsoft Edge</strong>, and then re-open the browser. You may have to repeat this step a few times for the Game Assist option to appear.</li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is calling for an investigation into Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/22/apple-and-google-could-face-uk-competition-probe-over-app-store-rules.html">CNBC</a>, the CMA may use its powers under the new Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCC) to examine possible anti-competitive behaviour from the two companies given their dominance of the UK's mobile markets.</p>
<p>However, it proposes that no further action be taken on cloud gaming given "primary concerns have been addressed".</p>
<p>Following a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-publishes-provisional-findings-in-mobile-browsers-and-cloud-gaming-market-investigation">preliminary investigation</a>, an independent inquiry group has recommended a review into the UK mobile ecosystem and assess if the two megacorps have Strategic Market Status (SMS) which potentially gives them a self-preferential position in the market.</p>

<p>The independent inquiry group alleged Apple's App Store rules "restrict other competitors from being able to deliver new, innovative features that could benefit consumers" and makes it difficult for smaller developers to operate without having to use the App Store.</p><p>The investigation also looked at mobile cloud gaming but said that as Apple made changes to allow cloud gaming apps to be sold via the App Store during the course of the investigation, "the group has provisionally concluded there is no need for intervention by the CMA in mobile cloud gaming".</p>
<p>The group also alleged Google and Apple have a revenue-sharing agreement to make Google the default search engine on iPhone which "significantly reduces their financial incentives to compete in mobile browsers on iOS".</p>
<p>"Markets work best when rival businesses are able to develop and bring innovative options to consumers," said Margot Daly, chair of the CMA's independent inquiry group. "Competition between different mobile browsers is not working well and this is holding back innovation in the UK."</p>
<p>Apple dispute the claims and said inteventions made under the DMCC "would undermine user privacy and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart".</p>
<p>"Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish," Apple said in a statement to CNBC. "We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users."</p>
<p>The CMA expects to make a final decision in March 2025. Google, Apple, and other interested parties have until 13th December to respond to the inquiry group's provisional report. The DMCC will come into effect in January 2025.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>World of Warcraft is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, November 23, 2024. Below, we talk with key developers about the journey to make the game what it is today, and the future ahead.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Two decades ago, World of Warcraft burst onto the scene and changed gaming forever. The once-niche MMORPG genre became mainstream overnight. Blizzard took ideas that came before in games like Everquest and refined, polished, and further elaborated on them until what was left would appeal to the gaming masses. The result was "WoW" becoming a household name and a cultural phenomenon in a way most video game creators can only dream of, with millions and millions of players willing to pay a $15-a-month subscription to this day for the privilege of continuing their digital adventures in the fantasy world of Azeroth.</p><p dir="ltr">It's hardly a surprise the WoW that first launched 20 years ago on November 23, 2004, while technically still the same game, is vastly different to the current version of the MMO players play today. Its most recent expansion alone, The War Within, added account-wide progression and a new endgame activity for solo players, two ideas that would have been unheard of even a decade ago but which have been received with near-universal praise from the game's community.</p><p dir="ltr">Modern WoW is so different, in fact, that Blizzard in 2019 began offering up "Classic" versions of WoW so players could re-live the game as it was at launch and first few expansions--something fans had been doing unofficially for years. There are currently five different versions of WoW to choose from, a fact that further emphasizes just how big, and how much of a cultural impact, Blizzard's MMORPG has had. Many live-service games in 2024 can barely survive a few months, let alone years, yet here is Blizzard operating five versions of the same game at once (WoW Classic, Season of Discovery, Cataclysm Classic, WoW Classic Hardcore, The War Within)--and finding great success doing so.</p><figure data-embed-type="comparison" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4404229-screenshot2024-11-22at2.07.42%E2%80%AFpm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4404230-wow_the_war_within_undermined_location_screenshots_%286%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4404229,1300-4404230" data-size="large" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1585/15855271/4404229-screenshot2024-11-22at2.07.42%E2%80%AFpm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_super/1585/15855271/4404230-wow_the_war_within_undermined_location_screenshots_%286%29.png"><p>Gallery</p>       <figcaption>Left: Early WoW footage from YouTube user SpecialAgentSqueaky / Right: World of Warcraft: The War Within</figcaption> <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4404229-screenshot2024-11-22at2.07.42%E2%80%AFpm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4404230-wow_the_war_within_undermined_location_screenshots_%286%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">For WoW's 20th anniversary, GameSpot talked with leading members of the WoW development team to get their thoughts on what makes the virtual world of Azeroth special, why WoW has endured for so long, and how the team is currently making plans for the next 20 years.</p><p dir="ltr">For executive producer Holly Longdale, she said the familiarity--the ability for players who may have played years ago to return and still recognize the game--contributes to its long-term success. The team strives for WoW to remain consistent over the years for that reason, whether it's the game's look, themes, or even something as small as its often not-too-serious quest text.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's something really powerful about coming home," Longdale said. "This fundamental idea we have is that if you haven't played in six, seven, or 15 years, we want it to be the place you remember and the place you fell in love with."</p><p dir="ltr">It's for that reason WoW won't be dramatically updating its graphics or art style anytime soon, something Longdale said Blizzard gets asked about a lot. As it stands, it would be "a risk that's not worth taking," she said.</p><p dir="ltr">She also wasn't shy when it came to admitting that WoW has an advantage new MMORPGs just getting started today don't--it was, in many ways, first.</p><p dir="ltr">"Let's be honest, when you're the first game of this sort, that came out of a genre that hadn't hit mainstream and you were the one that became mainstream, you have an advantage," Longdale said. "We don't take that for granted at all. We know that."</p><p dir="ltr">Using a mantra of "leave no player behind," Blizzard is looking at how to deliver on what the vast and varied communities that make up WoW want moving forward. Part of that means more frequent content updates, as has been the case since the launch of 2022's Dragonflight expansion (Longdale said every time in the past 20 years there has been an update drought, it has not gone well). It also means investing in a more data-driven approach to understand how players interact with the game in addition to listening to what they have to say.</p><p dir="ltr">She used the game's roleplaying community as an example of an area where Blizzard "could absolutely do better." She said the recent Netflix documentary, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-remarkable-life-of-ibelin-review-the-real-warcraft-movie/1900-6418311/">The Remarkable Life of Ibelin</a>, "sparked a fire" in the team to do more. The documentary tells the story of Mats Steen, a WoW player who suffered from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy but found comfort within Azeroth as part of a roleplaying community. Much of the film is animated using WoW's in-game assets, but also shows characters doing things in-game, like fully animated hugs or high-fives, that aren't currently possible in WoW. She said the team is now doing testing to see if those kinds of interactions could be added in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Longtime game director Ion Hazzikostas had his own thoughts on why WoW has continued to endure so many years later. He used factions as a measure of just how far the game has come and how it continues to evolve. For much of the game's life, the decision of whether to play as a Horde or an Alliance character dictated a player's experience--who they could play with, where they could quest, and the story they experienced. In 2024, that's, for the most part, no longer the case. Hazzikostas said the idea of Horde and Alliance players grouping up to play together, as they can for certain activities in the modern version of game, is an idea that would have at one time been "unfathomable."</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm sure if you'd asked the development team a while back, they would have said, 'No, never. That can never change. It wouldn't be Warcraft if it did,'" Hazzikostas said. "Alliance and Horde are playing together today in many cases, and it's still Warcraft."</p><p dir="ltr">He said the strength of the community--the bonds, friendships, and families that have been forged in Azeroth--is a large reason why WoW continues to thrive. It's that same community that pushes the game forward, encouraging Blizzard to adapt to the changing demands of its playerbase.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1622204319" data-promo-id="0"

on their own, and have a different vibe, and a different pace, and appeal to a different audience, I think is a testament to how much the game has changed along with our players and grown up along with our players," Hazzikostas said. "The release of World of Warcraft on November 23, 2004 was a magical moment, and millions of people discovered this world and the ability to connect with others. But if we hadn't continued to evolve along with them, we wouldn't be here 20 years later."</p><p dir="ltr">Two decades in, Longdale said it's time for WoW to change by "way of the community," as Blizzard puts a renewed focus on understanding its playerbase and listening to what it wants. She said as part of her role she's already thinking about the next 10, 15, and 20 years of WoW, and what foundations need to be laid out in the years ahead to get the game there. WoW may have been going for 20 years already, but that doesn't mean it's slowing down or looking to relinquish its MMORPG crown anytime soon.</p><p dir="ltr">"We want to keep doing better…the goal is to grow," Longdale said. "We want everybody on the planet to be in Azeroth, at some point."</p>
