            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> has "enacted" over 23,000 "actions" against cheaters after rolling out a new system to find and detect players who use mouse and keyboard in console lobbies, a practice known as ximming.</p>
<p>While "enacted" doesn't necessarily mean all 23,000 accounts were banned outright, Blizzard says that brings the overall total of banned accounts to over 1m players.</p>

<p>"The new Mouse and Keyboard support will impact how we action users who previously used unapproved third-party peripherals to gain an advantage over players in the Controller Pool," Blizzard explained in a new <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24223576/">blog</a> post. "Bypassing the set restrictions in that pool with unapproved peripherals will be considered cheating and actions will be taken on your account.</p><p>"Previously, we deployed technology to help find and detect players who were using those peripherals on consoles. We enacted over 23,000 actions against players since that deployment. This included players who were directly using unapproved peripherals as well as players who grouped up with them to benefit from that unfair advantage."</p>
<p>Blizzard then admitted that it had to "adapt to new workarounds" but was now ready to "take more aggressive actions against those who try to circumvent the competitive integrity of our console players."</p>
<p>"We’ve rolled out new tech for Season 18 that should help us spot players that use unapproved peripherals faster and with more reliability," the post added. "We’re also laying down harsher consequences on users of unapproved peripherals, since the legitimate opportunity to compete using Mouse and Keyboard on an even playing field is now available, regardless of whether you own a PC or console."</p>
<p>Previously, the team would "warn and restrict" any offenders and send them to the PC Pool, especially for cheats playing at Competitive levels above Diamond.</p>
<p>Now, however, "continuing to use unapproved peripherals and devices in the Controller Pool will result in a full game account ban regardless of the player’s rank or mode".</p>
<p>The recent action has resulted in over one million accounts being banned from playing Overwatch 2. This includes players who used aimbots, wallhacks, and other cheats, as well as those who grouped up with known cheaters.</p>
<p>"While the effort to stop cheaters and the cheats they use is an ongoing effort, we want to reiterate our commitment to ensuring the outcome of every <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> match is determined by skill and passion, and not through unfair advantages," Blizzard added.</p>
<p>Aside from the Stadium update, Overwatch 2 Season 18 introduced significant changes, including heroes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuyang-revealed-as-new-hero-in-overwatch-2">Wuyang</a>, Pharah, Winston, and Brigitte, plus the Route 66 and London maps, new game modes, new All-Star rewards, Endorsements, and more.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-assassins-creed-shadows-framerate-2000621760</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ports-cyberpunk-2077-ps4-ps5-xbox-dlss-outlaws-1851782817">coming to Switch 2</a> in just a few days. It’s Ubisoft’s first big port for Nintendo’s new handheld hybrid. So why isn’t the company talking more about its 2024 blockbuster coming to the best-selling console of 2025? Maybe because it’s the latest Switch 2 port to reportedly run less than great.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>, a stealth adventure about gangsters and bounty hunters on the fringes of the Galactic Empire, is currently the 10th best-selling game on the Switch 2 eShop thanks to digital pre-orders, but you won’t find it anywhere on the show floor at PAX West this weekend. Despite stations for fans to try big ports like <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Nintendo’s new hardware, a demo of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> was only playable behind closed doors, according to YouTube channel <em>GVG</em>‘s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5JbnfU0SVs">new hands-on video</a>.</p> <p>Even worse, the outlet was prohibited from sharing any direct capture footage of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> running on Switch 2. Over-the-shoulder recording wasn’t allowed either. The demo <em>GVG</em> tested included an early section inside of a Star Destroyer and a ship fight in space. The frame rate often appeared to dip below 30fps while the visual quality varied from good to unimpressive depending on the scene. And <em>GVG</em> didn’t even get to try any of the open-world sections down on planets.</p>

 <p>There have been some potential red flags around<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em>‘ performance on Switch 2 for a while now. At a Partner Nintendo Direct earlier this summer, Ubisoft only <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIBt_Qnf1_M">showcased the game for two minutes</a>, and most of that was developers (Ubisoft Red Lynx is doing the port) talking into the camera rather than direct feed of gameplay. What little snippets the publisher did share didn’t look outstanding either. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCYL2f49jyQ"><em>Digital Foundry</em> pointed</a> to some impressive lighting effects at the time, but was left mostly with concerns about just how downgraded it would be from the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions.</p> <h2>How will <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> run on Switch 2?</h2> <p>While not officially confirmed, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-release-date-1851786749">reading between the lines</a> of recent Ubisoft earnings calls leaves the strong impression that <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> isn’t the only current-gen exclusive the company is planning to port to Switch 2. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> sounds destined to arrive eventually as well. Has Ubisoft been investing more resources in optimizing that port, knowing it’s the bigger franchise, at the cost of quietly leaving<em> Outlaws</em> to flounder a second time (remember,<em> Shadows</em> was originally delayed precisely because of <em>Outlaws</em> launch struggles last year)?</p>

 <p>Right now, there are basically two buckets of third-party Switch 2 ports. One includes <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, which rarely remind you that you’re playing on weaker hardware than what the games were originally designed for. The other includes stuff like<em> Hitman World of Assassination</em>, which despite being serviceable, often feels like a noticeable downgrade (though things improved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STjJVzd-FWI">just this week</a> with a capped frame rate option).</p> <p><em>Elden Ring</em>, which reportedly ran like goop when you hit the open-world sections, and now <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> appear to be in that second bucket as well. Bandai Namco tried to prevent people from filming footage of FromSoftware’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-framerate-footage-video-gamescom-2000618923">first Switch 2 game at Gamescom 2025</a> as well, though that game at least doesn’t have a release date yet. Unless a day-one patch or series of other upgrades can improve <em>Outlaws</em> on Switch 2, there’s now a question of whether a potential <em>Shadows</em> port will fall into the “meh” column of ports as well.</p>

            <p>Escape from Tarkov is coming to Steam.</p>
<p>Rumours began to swirl when Battlestate's head of studio, Nikita Buyanov, posted a captionless gif to X/Twitter over the weekend showing an old man delightedly holding down the steam button on his iron.</p>

<p>Definitive proof? Hardly, even if Buyanov were willing to troll his own playerbase. Fast-forward to today, though – 31st August – and it's confirmed: Escape from Tarkov is coming to Steam.</p> <div>

<p>The page has yet to go live on Valve's digital store, so we're yet to get any of the specific details, but Buyanov shared an image of the Steam logo superimposed on a Steam listing for Escape from Tarkov (see above), and wrote: "Yes! The page on Steam will be available soon. All the details later."</p>
<p>The Steam launch could coincide with another milestone for Battlestate – version 1.0 the tactical FPS will finally release on 15th November, 2025.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/10-best-fallout-companions-ever/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/10-best-fallout-companions-in-franchise-history%E2%80%94from-dogmeat-to-danse.1285155/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a fact of the franchise that you don’t have to explore the wastelands of Fallout alone. There’s always the option of roaming the open, desolate world with a companion by your side, be that a human, robot, or animal companion. There are dozens of memorable partners stretched across the entire series, but in this list, we’re breaking down the 10 best Fallout companions <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p>Does your favourite Fallout companion make the list? Let me know in the comments.</p>



<h2 id="h-greatest-fallout-companions-ever">Greatest Fallout Companions Ever</h2>



<p>It was tough to narrow this list down to just the 10 best Fallout companions, but we did it. If your all-time favourite companion didn’t make the list, let us know in the comments and perhaps we’ll see where they can fit into the line-up. It’s worth stressing that this list isn’t a ranking; it’s just collectively the 10 best Fallout companions ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-dogmeat-fallout-4">1. Dogmeat (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dogmeat is a Fallout staple, having been introduced to the series back in 1997, in the first-ever game. This lovable pup resurfaced in Fallout 3 (2008), and then again in Fallout 4 (2015) – but it’s that latter title in which this canine companion made the most lasting impression on the player. </p>



<h3 id="h-2-boone-fallout-new-vegas">2. Boone (Fallout: New Vegas)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Boone’s story is one of heartbreak, revenge, and devastation, and that’s why he’s one of the best Fallout companions ever. In Boone, you’re not just getting a crack-shot sniper, you’re getting an emotional sub-story that will stay with you long after you’ve decided who gets ownership of The Strip.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-paladin-danse-fallout-4">3. Paladin Danse (Fallout 4)</h3>

<p>Like Boone, Paladin Danse is a well-trained soldier with an emotional story wrapped around him, only you don’t know that when you first meet him in Fallout 4. While journeying with Danse, you’ll uncover a crushing secret that could devastate or inspire you to change how you think about the rest of the game. </p>



<h3 id="h-4-goris-fallout-2">4. Goris (Fallout 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>That’s right, once upon a time, Fallout players could travel the Wasteland side-by-side with a sentient, intelligent Deathclaw by the name of Goris. From a band of Deathclaws turned hyper-intelligent comes Goris, a <strong>kind </strong>creature that attempts to hide his gruesome appearance by shrouding himself under a robe. Hint: it doesn’t work.</p>







<h3 id="h-5-strong-fallout-4">5. Strong (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Strong is iconic and one of the best Fallout companions for one reason – he bucks the trend. He’s a Super Mutant with a curious streak; a desire to seek out the ‘milk of human kindness’ and evaluate the human race at large. He’s not the first Super Mutant companion in Fallout, but he certainly is a memorable one.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-marcus-fallout-2">6. Marcus (Fallout 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>From one Super Mutant to another, we now come to Marcus, one of the few Fallout characters who has made an appearance in more than one game. In Fallout 2, the player can pair up with Marcus, an unusually intelligent and inspirational Super Mutant with a perfectly normal, reasonable personality. He resurfaces in Fallout: New Vegas, but cannot be recruited.</p>

<h3 id="h-7-maccready-fallout-4">7. MacCready (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Like Marcus, MacCready can be found in two different Fallout games – but he’s a less recognisable character. In Fallout 3, MacCready is the mayor of Little Lamplight, the cave in which a band of children survives the nuclear wastes. He reappears in Fallout 4, which is set around ten years later, as a well-honed marksman with a dark backstory.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-nick-valentine-fallout-4">8. Nick Valentine (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nick Valentine is crucial to progressing the core story of Fallout 4, and because of that, he’s vital to the player’s presence in the game. He’s also one of the most interesting characters in Fallout and easily one of the best Fallout companions ever. He’s a synth that’s accepted by the survivors of the Commonwealth, which is no easy feat, and his psyche is that of a classic private eye – an old-school detective. </p>







<h3 id="h-9-charon-fallout-3">9. Charon (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Charon is a super-effective, hyper-powerful Ghoul combatant with not much say but plenty of damage to dish out. He’s a machine, making use of a devastating shotgun to wreak havoc in a fight, but in true Fallout 3 fashion, he’s not invincible and can permanently die if you’re not careful. He’s one of the best companions in Fallout 3, without any doubt.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-ed-e-fallout-new-vegas">10. ED-E (Fallout: New Vegas)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>ED-E is a simple, charming robot with barely any personality whatsoever, and despite being a relatively passive companion, ED-E boasts some great boosts and one of the most curious and subtly complex side quests in New Vegas. ED-E is a permanent companion, cannot be killed, and can repair things at the press of a button – that’s not bad for a broken robot discarded in the town of Primm.</p>

<figure><a title="City Building RPGs" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a3954838839a1/city-building-rpgs.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Given that I love RPGs, I’m sure it’s no surprise that I’m <em>very</em> excited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>. What might shock you, however, is that it’s not the return to Osterra, or the excellent turn-based combat, or even the prospect of another new HD-2D game that has me jazzed, nope (I still love all of these things, though, be nice!). The thing I’m most looking forward to? I get to build my own town.</p>
<p>What is it about city building that I love? Is it the allure of making <em>my</em> own space? Is it a power fantasy, where I can make my town however I want, a way of expressing my creativity in a whole new way? Or is it simply that I grew up with <strong><a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/grand-designs">Grand Designs</a></strong> (a British TV show about people with money who build their own houses) on in the background?</p>
<p>Yet, doing it in real life is a complete pipe dream. Building a town — let alone a single <em>house</em> — in this economy? Nuh-uh. Thank god for video games.</p>
<p>While city building is its own genre (hello, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/simcity">SimCity</a>), it’s the cosiness it fosters when part of an RPG that has always enraptured me. Need a break from the Dunan Unification War? Go recruit some pals and improve your base in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/suikoden-iandii-hd-remaster-for-nintendo-switch-2-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars">Suikoden II</a>. Tired of getting rid of the monsters in Alefgard? Good thing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_builders">Dragon Quest Builders</a> is a <em>font</em> of creativity.</p>

<p>The first game that comes to mind where this unusual amalgamation is involved is one of the earliest and one of the most unique: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/actraiser">ActRaiser</a>. Here, though, you’re not doing any of the building yourself – simply facilitating it. Well, I suppose God shouldn’t meddle in everyday affairs, right?</p>
<p>But there’s a charm to flying around each map as your little angel, fighting off monsters as the humans build paths, settlements, and expand. Sometimes you’ll get advice from the townsfolk or have problems to solve — like famine — but for the most part, you need to defeat monsters and destroy forests and obstacles and guide the people towards sealing the magic seal.</p>
<figure><a title="ActRaiser Renaissance" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a97aa39ca86f7/actraiser-renaissance.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing city building does is invite power dynamics. In ActRaiser, you’re the absolute: ‘The Master’ (the English name, but in Japanese it’s 'God', so not subtle). But in something like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles</a>, where you’re rebuilding Colony 6, it serves more as a hub, a place where, if you put the time in, you can get a lot out of it.</p>
<p>You don’t have any actual power or agency there besides putting money and materials in, but you can encourage others to move there. Colony 6 becomes a community project, something that can <em>only</em> happen with Shulk and Juju leading the way; its growth and expansion are a great mirror to the way Shulk and his friends develop during the course of the game.</p>
<p>Back to the SNES and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/breath_of_fire_ii">Breath of Fire II</a> has a surprisingly robust, if simple, town-building aspect. Here, your town — later called TownShip (yes, the pun is deliberate) — starts off as one ruined building and, as Ryu hires the help of a carpenter, it grows from a small pile of rubble to a cosy little town with a laboratory which allows Ryu’s friends to fuse with Shamans to give them special powers.</p>

<p>I had no idea this quest existed until I watched my partner revisit the game earlier this year and, to my surprise, you even have to recruit villagers to move into the individual houses. And every single potential villager has their own function. The catch is that there’s only enough room for six people to move in, so you have to think wisely. Do you want to recruit someone who will sell rare weapons, or would you rather have poison protection for the next 30-odd fights?</p>
<p>It’s rare that a game makes its villagers feel like they have a purpose outside of being NPCs that you talk to, which makes TownShip feel particularly special to me. Imagine if I accidentally asked a man to move to my town and then your money disappears? I’d be pretty annoyed about that. And yes, that <em>can</em> happen – recruiting one potential villager causes all of your money to be stolen. You can get it back, luckily. And yes, it is annoying, but these kinds of events give these seemingly random characters a function, and a bit of personality.</p>
<p>Another game where every resident in your town — or in this case, sky island — has a purpose is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/skies_of_arcadia_legends">Skies of Arcadia</a>. When Vyse eventually becomes the captain of his own ship and starts building up a crew of men and women (and a dog), he realises he needs a base. So, he reclaims the island that he crash-landed on earlier in the game: Crescent Isle. The more crew members you recruit, the more stuff you have access to at your new home.</p>

<p>An item shop, ship parts, and even a kitchen – all of these things provide unique or powerful items that’ll help Vyse on his quest to gather the Moon Crystals. And while I could just flap around the skies trying to find the best healing items or weapons, well, I also have access to everything in one place. And I can decorate the island however I like – I’ll <em>always</em> take the Cupil fountain.</p>
<p>But most of these games are about building up the community and letting them thrive, not the actual <em>building</em> of a town or city. That’s where I look to Level-5. Now that's a developer that <em>loves</em> letting us build cities. It all started back with the studio's first game, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/dark_cloud">Dark Cloud</a> (yes, the "Zelda Killer"), where rebuilding towns and making the residents happy was front and centre. That, and its sequel, are PlayStation exclusives, though they set the template Level-5 RPGs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ni_no_kuni_ii_revenant_kingdom">Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom</a> is one of those, but instead of multiple little towns, you’re building your very own kingdom. Evermore starts off as a series of empty plots of land, but get some money, expand your coffers, and start investing, and you’ll soon have a fantasy metropolis that thrives on serving the king and his needs. Kingdom building is pretty on-rails – it’s both required for the story and gated by story requirements, and you can’t just build willy-nilly.</p>

<p>Every plot has a purpose, and you have to choose when to invest in those. Shops and a town square are easy early requirements, but eventually you’ll need resources like lumber, metal, and even ingredients. And you need people who are <em>good</em> at those things. There’s no point putting Floyd the cook in the Barracks when you have a Cookshop, after all.</p>
<p>Even though Ni no Kuni II is a little more strict with your creativity, I still got a real sense of joy watching Evermore expand and fill up. I love recruiting characters, so giving them tasks to actually do, which in turn rewards you with better items to buy or resources, is even more fulfilling. And then choosing what to invest research in to make that facility, and those staff, even better. Again, as King Evan of Evermore, I am the one with the power, but at least I’m making people happy.</p>
<p>But Level-5 has gone in the complete opposite direction in terms of creativity more recently with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a>. Now I’m not really building a city so much as populating an island… but I can build an art gallery, multiple homes, furnishings, island decorations, rivers, <em>and</em> terraform? It’s like playing a miniature version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> but with a massive RPG tacked on to it.</p>

<p>Outside of simply decorating and building for fun, customising your island doesn’t really serve much of a purpose. But it’s so easy and seamless that I just <em>had</em> to do it. Admittedly, it’s a bit of a mess right now, but I’m in post-game mode, so, y’know, resource gathering and all that. But it’s become a point of pride for me. Why shouldn’t all of my Buddies, who I’ve rescued throughout the course of the game, have a nice place to live?</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i gradually introduces new building mechanics, so while placing houses down might feel restrictive at first — I don’t know how many times I complained about the river — you can change things later down the line. I’ve gone from moving my favourite Buddies in to rotating them, completing crafting and delivery requests for them so they level up and improve their crafting, gathering, or combat techniques. I already have dreams to turn the island into some kind of cosy, forest-y nook with a little fountain and a town square.</p>
<p>But, like Crescent Island, like Evermore, and like Township, this island can act as a base for you as long as you level up your shop (situated inside the Guild Office) by completing deliveries and requests. Right now, I can get pretty much all the end-game resources from Marco, with only the rare and extremely rare items off-limits.</p>

<p>What encourages me to keep coming back to these cities, these locations that I’ve spent time building up, is that they eventually feel like a home away from home. Like a digital paradise. I’ve spent hundreds of hours in New Horizons perfecting the layout of my island, changing my mind, and redoing everything multiple times, because I want to create something that’s nice and comfortable for me, and somewhere that I think the digital inhabitants will like. It’s the same in all of these games – I’ll pore over every detail, every request, every need for my villagers, accommodating them while also trying to sneak in a little bit of my own flair.</p>
<p>I don’t know what Octopath Traveler 0’s town building will entail other than <em>beautiful</em> HD-2D houses and a new 'Architect' job, but I hope it puts community and creativity at the heart of it. I need another digital home away from home I can create and rejuvenate, and a pixel art one sounds perfect.</p>

<p>While it's not an official confirmation, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=I23MxTm2ku4&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fhollow-knight-silksong---nintendo-switch%2F432032.html" rel="sponsored noopener">a now-deleted listing on Gamestop</a> that marked the game's price as $20 was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1n3hj7a/gamestop_listed_silksong_with_price/">spotted</a> by fans of the series.</p>
<p>Many assumed this was merely a placeholder price, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n496oj/billbilkun_hollow_knight_silksong_price_is_1999/">Dealabs leaker</a> Billbil-Kun seems confident it's correct, and has even gone as far as to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/hollow-knight-silksong-on-vous-devoile-le-prix-de-sa-version-pc-60443">reveal</a> not only the Steam price but also how much it will be sold for on the rival GOG digital storefront.</p>
<p>The leaker has at least confirmed that the game will sell for under $20 / £20, with the UK price potentially being as low as £16.75 on Steam; the US price is pegged at $19.99.</p>

<p>For the sake of comparison, the original Hollow Knight game is currently available on Nintendo's eShop for $15.00 / £10.99.</p>
<p>Sadly, the Switch and Switch 2 price points haven't been revealed, and Dealabs appears to be confident that, at this point in time, there's no physical version of the game planned – that will almost certainly change post-launch, we'd argue.</p>
<p>If you are wondering if you'll get your money's worth out of this title, the ideas for Silksong have apparently been stacking up for some time, with the team previously mentioning how it could have kept going but ultimately needed to complete the game. In saying this, the developer has already got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/team-cherrys-already-got-ambitious-plans-for-hollow-knight-silksong-additional-content">amibitous plans for additional content</a>.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong launches on September 4th, 2025. It's coming to Switch, Switch 2, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Prime Day can’t compare to the discounts Amazon is offering today for Back to School, especially on HP laptops. Some of these models were released in 2025, and <strong>Amazon is slashing prices between 30 and nearly 80 percent off</strong> the standard retail price.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to save big, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3820/">this HP 15.6″ laptop designed for college students (16GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB PCIe SSD, Intel N100 CPU) is now available at an irresistible price of $399, down from $1,599</a>.</p>

<h2>Perfect for Everyday Tasks</h2>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will reportedly sell for around £17/$20/€20.</p>
<p>That's according to eagle-eyed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> fans who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1n3hj7a/gamestop_listed_silksong_with_price/">spotted</a> that the highly anticipated sequel was listed on <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/hollow-knight-silksong---nintendo-switch/432032.html">Gamestop</a> (link since deleted) for $20.</p>
<p>Initially, it was thought this <em>had</em> to be a placeholder price, as the game has long been the <a href="https://gaminganalytics.info/gbwish_last">most wishlisted title on the Steam platform</a>. When players tried to purchase the game but couldn't complete checkout, this only strengthened the feeling the listing had to have been incorrect.</p>

<p>However, since then, noted and usually reliable <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n496oj/billbilkun_hollow_knight_silksong_price_is_1999/">Dealabs leaker</a> Billbil-Kun has <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/hollow-knight-silksong-on-vous-devoile-le-prix-de-sa-version-pc-60443">all but confirmed the rumour</a>, revealing not just the Steam prices for Hollow Knight: Silksong, but also the price point on GOG.</p>
<p>According to the leaker's "recent research", Silksong will indeed retail for less than £20/$20/€20:</p>
<ul>
<li>UK: £16.75 (Steam) / (GOG Unknown)</li>
<li>Europe: €19.50 (Steam) / €8.29 (GOG)</li>
<li>U.S.: $19.99 (Steam) / $19.99 (GOG)</li>
<li>Canada: $25.99 (Steam) / $27.19 (GOG)</li>
<li>Australia: $29.50 (Steam) / $30.19 (GOG)</li>
<li>New Zealand: $28.99 (Steam) / (GOG Unknown)</li>
<li>Japan: (Steam Unknown) / ¥2939 (GOG)</li>
</ul>
<p>The price points for console and Switch versions remain unknown. Dealabs did, however, add weight to rumours that there is no physical version of the game planned at this time.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong will release on Thursday, 4th September 2025 for PC, Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series. Yet contrary to what you may believe, Silksong hasn't been in development hell for that time, however – in fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-silksong-hasnt-been-in-development-hell-hype-skyrocketed-sales-of-the-original-game-to-give-team-cherry-financial-freedom">Team Cherry's developers say they were just having too much fun making it</a>.</p><p>The end of months of speculation has not been good news for all, of course; announcing the date so late in the game's development - a mere two weeks from release - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksongs-release-date-causes-delays-for-more-games-than-you-might-think">meant a slew of games which already had early September release dates suddenly found themselves in a difficult position</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A computer is not just a bright new device: it’s also an entrance to your entire digital life. But with that entrance comes the <strong>threat of dark unseen dangers</strong>: hackers, scams, and viruses just waiting to leap at the most inconvenient time. And with Labor Day weekend and back-to-school season already upon us, there’s no better time to lock down your digital life with strong protection that works behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/">Avast is offering a fantastic deal with up to 60% off its security products</a>, making it easier than ever to secure your devices without stretching your budget. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/">Avast Premium Security is available for just $31.20 for the first year</a> ($2,60 a month) for one device. But if you’re looking to protect the whole family or all your gadgets, their 10-device plan wraps your laptops, phones and tablets under one simple subscription.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Avast Premium Security</a></p>

<h2>Protects Your Digital Life</h2>
<p>So, just what does Avast Premium Security do, then? It’s a lot more than your average antivirus: It prevents viruses, malware, and ransomware from causing harm. It also catches phishing scams that want you to give up sensitive information. And it blocks remote access attacks and keeps would-be digital hijackers at bay. <strong>Whether you’re buying online, streaming, banking, or just browsing</strong>, Avast Premium Security operates behind the scenes keeping everything private and secure.</p>
<p>If you desire the ultimate peace of mind, Avast Ultimate is where it’s at – <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/">and it’s currently on sale at $3.67 per month (60% off)</a>. You get all Premium Security features, plus Avast SecureLine VPN which keeps your internet connection safe and your identity hidden (just the thing when you’re browsing public Wi-Fi). And then there’s Cleanup Premium which streamlines and optimizes your PC by deleting junk files and speeds things up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Avast Ultimate</a></p>
<p>So the choice between Premium Security and Ultimate ultimately comes down to what you’re looking for: For superb malware, ransomware, and phishing protection, Premium Security is sufficient. But if you also want extra privacy, advanced device cleaning, and VPN protection, Ultimate offers those extras in one powerful bundle. No matter your choice, Avast is a security leader you can trust and protects hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide. Those days of the “free antivirus” are over—it’s an entire suite of tools for today’s world of connectivity.</p>

Autumn approaches, but we have one more summer month to look back on in this edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a>!</p>
<p>August has been a bountiful one, with an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Indie World</a> dropping some surprise hits and announcements. So there's been plenty to chew on alongside a couple of Nintendo highlights.</p>
<p>Before we dive in, let's remind you of the rules: Nintendo Life writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop exclusives for the month, from a list of games that we've reviewed. Afterwards, those games are scored (1 getting the most points, 3 the least) and tallied to determine the top three for the month.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vsxouh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>We've got a lot to get through, so let's not dilly-dally any longer.</p>

<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>We've got a familiar story again this month: a certain ninja is missing in action. This time it's Shinobi: Art of Vengeance, as Switch codes were only sent out on the game's release date. You'll have to stay tuned for the verdict on that one.</p>
<p>Still, we have <em>14 games</em> to choose from in total — an Indie World will do that to you! All of the below scored at least a 7/10 with us, so let's have a look at what just missed out on the top three.</p>

<p>Just one of the many shadow drops we saw during Nintendo's Indie World Showcase in August, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a> sees you as the manager of a dinky little bookshop on wheels by the ocean. Pure bliss, right?</p>
<p>Well, because you're on wheels, you can park your little store wherever you want around the town of Bookstonbury. You get to decorate your wagon and choose just what books you can sell — oh, and every single book in-game is a real novel, so it might even inspire you to read.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/tiny-bookshop">We scored Tiny Bookshop a nice 8/10</a> — it's extremely satisfying, pleasant, and just a feel-good game all-round.</p>

<p>Well, this one crept up on us out of nowhere. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a> was announced just a week ahead of its release, and this award-winning text-based RPG lived up to the hype. It launched on PC back in 2022 and fans have been raving about it ever since. We can see why.</p>
<p>Incredible writing and lovely, simple pixel art help to illustrate a beautiful journey to the peninsula, layered with mysteries and choices that shape your experience. If you love storytelling, this is a must play.</p>
<p>We're so glad more people can experience this one, so check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/roadwarden">our 9/10 review</a> to see why we loved it so much.</p>

<p>When Mossmouth's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> shadow-dropped at the end of the Indie World Showcase earlier in August, we were elated. We'd been asking for this one since we played it at Summer Game Fest 2024 and we watched longing as the game racked up rave reviews on Steam. Fortunately, we had to wait less than a year.</p>
<p>UFO 50 is magical and a must-play experience for anyone who's grown up with video games. The craft and curation that's gone into the whole experience, from the variety of games the fictional story of UFO Soft. And yes, there really are 50 individual games in one package here.</p>
<p>So, congrats to Mossmouth — and UFO Soft — for winning eShop Selects with UFO 50 this month! For those who have yet to dive in, have a read of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/ufo-50">our glowing 9/10 review</a>.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-august-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/heres-morrowind-running-elden-ring-engine/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here%E2%80%99s-morrowind-running-in-the-elden-ring-engine-because-why-not.1285050/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Here's something I really wasn't expecting to write about: YouTuber and modder InfernoPlus has successfully ported The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind to the Elden Ring engine.</p>



<p>Originally, InfernoPlus had planned to port Morrowind to Dark Souls 1, then shifting to Dark Souls 3 and eventually to Elden Ring. Not only is FromSoftware's latest game a better title in every regard, including fidelity and gameplay, but its (entirely unofficial and user-made) modding tools have also greatly matured to the extent of making even such a gargantuan undertaking possible.</p>



<p>InfernoPlus said he has been working on the project for quite a while and is now roughly halfway done, but also admitted it's hard to say with any accuracy at this point. The modder said world generation is finished, and lighting and world effects are nearly there, although some lighting processing is still needed.</p>



<p>Interiors are also basically finished, while dialogue generation still must have its scripting data loaded. Voice acting will be added toward the end of the mod's development. However, NPCs, be they animals or humanoids, still have to be properly converted: right now, they're either Elden Ring's default girl (for humanoids) and goats (for animals).</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="I ported Morrowind to Elden Ring" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n89NFtIUWDI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the video, InfernoPlus also touches on the inevitable copyright question, stating that the project cannot possibly violate any laws, as it does not include any Morrowind data. It requires the user to have that Morrowind data installed with a legitimate copy of the game, similar to A Tale of Two Wastelands, which combines Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas in a single game while requiring both games. This Morrowind port to the Elden Ring engine is also open source, by the way.</p>



<p>The modder then requested the community's help to keep going. InfernoPlus has a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/infernoplus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patreon page</a> where fans can support his work, but beyond that, the project could also use more expertise in certain areas. Between this and <a href="https://wccftech.com/skywind-gets-new-gameplay-demo-and-progress-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skywind</a>, Morrowind fans have two total conversion mods to look forward to. There's also the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind-path-tracing-rtx-remix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Morro RTX mod</a> that aims to take the original game and significantly boost its visuals with the help of NVIDIA RTX Remix. This mod is, however, still in its infancy.</p>

<figure><a title="Harvest Moon - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7ac80d9c62954/harvest-moon-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello everyone, and welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-chibi-robo-park-patrol">Last time</a>, we looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/chibi_robo_park_patrol">Chibi-Robo: Park Patrol</a>, in celebration of the launch of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">original game</a> on NSO for Switch 2. And let's be honest, we all knew which would win this one. Yes, with 77% of the vote, the far superior US variant won in a landslide. Good job.</p>
<p>This week, we're going all the way back to the SNES to check out the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/harvest_moon">Harvest Moon</a>. Released in 1996, it would go on to spawn an enduring franchise that, since 2014, is now known as Story of Seasons. Yes, Harvest Moon still exists, but it's a whole different thing now... Long story.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6xtosvj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEHFv10kUS0" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Anyway, it's a three-way brawl this week between North America, Europe, and Japan, so strap yourselves in folks; it's gonna be a belter.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/snes/related-articles:33221 @ 1756659082 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Harvest Moon - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/399e3e3ee4df2/harvest-moon-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/1821-harvest-moon13-chibi-robo-park-patrol">Natsume / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so this first one seems to be your pretty traditional Harvest Moon box art, showcasing the protagonist over on the right surrounded by a bunch of adorable creatures, and a typical farmyard setting in the background. It's simple, effective, and just... nice!</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Harvest Moon - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a7a751d2f63f3/harvest-moon-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/1821-harvest-moonils/6413-chibi-robo-park-patrol">Natsume / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ooh gosh, this is a real vibe, huh? Ditching the cartoon-y aesthetic for a slightly more realistic take, we've got a lovely landscape image of a farmer with his trusty doggy along with a cow and a horse. The figures look almost silhouetted against the gorgeous moonlight, and we love the blue/purple gradient used for the night sky.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Harvest Moon - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1e23ec56f90f1/harvest-moon-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/1821-harvest-moon">Natsume / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan's approach is similar to North America's, utilising the same main image of the protagonist and surrounding animals, albeit flipped. The portrait orientation means this can be placed front and centre with the game's title sitting just above. The background is gorgeous too! Man, this will be a tough one...</p>

<p>Gearbox has shared a roadmap of what's coming to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> in the "first few months" of its life.</p>
<p>This includes free and paid DLC content. After the launch, there's going to be some free content featuring new weapons, cosmetics and more, and then there'll be the first paid Bounty Pack. This follows with another dose of free content and after this in Q1 2026, there'll be <em>another</em> paid Bounty Pack DLC.</p>
<p>From here, there's a paid Story Pack, and beyond Q1 2026, there'll be more Bounty Packs, another Story Pack and "more". There'll even be weekly challenges along the way. Here's the full rundown:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The team at Gearbox is already hard at work on a Vault-load of post-launch content—including lots of new story content and two new Vault Hunters—and in-game events that will keep your adventures on Kairos going strong!</p>
<p>"For now, as we prepare to wreak havoc against the tyrannical Timekeeper as one of four badass new Vault Hunters, we hope the roadmap above offers an exciting sense of what's incoming after launch. Below, we'll break down the types of post-launch content you can expect, including Paid Content via DLC packs and Free Content available for all players."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-pc-users-add-lumen-rt-dlss-4-frame-gen/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-pc-users-can-add-lumen-rt-ray-reconstruction-and-dlss-4-fg-with-simple-tweaks.1285020/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launched a few days ago on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Developed by Virtuos, the remake of MGS3 is powered by Unreal Engine 5 but lacks a few features that PC gamers have come to expect lately.</p>



<p>For example, the game uses Software Lumen for global illumination, but there's a way to enable Ray Traced Lumen for better visual results, albeit at a performance cost. YouTuber MxBenchmarkPC <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF8w8pkeaw4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided the guide</a> on how to:</p>



<p><em>Go to AppData\Local\MGSDelta\Saved\Config\Windows and open the Engine.ini file. Then, add the following commands to the bottom of the Engine.ini file:<br>[SystemSettings]<br>r.Lumen.HardwareRayTracing=1<br>r.Lumen.Reflections.HardwareRayTracing=1<br>r.Lumen.ScreenProbeGather.HardwareRayTracing=1<br>r.LumenScene.DirectLighting.HardwareRayTracing=1<br>r.Lumen.Reflections.MaxRoughnessToTrace=0.6<br>r.Lumen.Reflections.MaxRoughnessToTraceForFoliage=0.6</em></p>



<p>For even better ray tracing fidelity, Ray Reconstruction can be enabled with:</p>



<p><em>r.NGX.DLSS.denoisermode=1</em></p>



<p>To get NVIDIA DLSS 4 Frame Generation, add these commands:</p>



<p><em>r.Streamline.DLSSG.Enable=1<br>t.Streamline.Reflex.Enable=1<br>t.Streamline.Reflex.Mode=1</em></p>



<ol></ol>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Metal Gear Solid Delta Hardware RT Lumen vs Software - Ray Tracing Comparison | RTX 5080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QF8w8pkeaw4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It is indeed a bit weird that all these commands just work in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and yet there is no way to enable them through regular settings. </p>



<p>Anyway, the game does take a slight hit (around five to six frames per second on an RTX 5080) when enabling Hardware RT Lumen, though DLSS Frame Generation more than makes up for it. With DLSS set to Performance, the RTX 5080 used in the test runs around 105 FPS. Of course, having access to Multi Frame Generation would accelerate performance even further. It is likely modders will find a way to get it working soon. By the way, you will need the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-mod-critical-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">frame rate unlock mod</a>, as Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is by default locked to 60 FPS on PC.</p>



<p>Read <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our PS5 review</a> to find out what Kai Tatsumoto thought about this remake:</p>



<p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is the de facto perfect way to experience the rise and fall of Big Boss. Each detail has been meticulously refined and brought to modern standards while leaving nothing behind in the past. While this also means retaining both the campiness and jank, there’s no better way to experience the first Metal Gear Solid title in the timeline.</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/donk-elo-might-not-matter-cs2-esports-pros/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cs2%E2%80%99s-donk-explains-what-gets-esports-players-into-the-pro-leagues.1285011/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Danil ‘donk’ Kryshkovets is one of the most popular Counter-Strike players in the world right now. His meteoric rise to fame began just a couple of years ago, and in the last 18 months, he has become one of the winningest players in the CS2 space.</p>



<p>Recently, donk offered up a home truth, explaining how esports players are more likely to ‘make it’ if they have the right attitude. He stressed that Elo isn’t the best representation of a pro player’s stature, and it shouldn’t be relied on when making decisions as a scout.</p>



<h2 id="h-elo-might-not-matter-in-cs2">Elo Might Not Matter in CS2</h2>



<p>In a statement captured by <a href="https://escorenews.com/en/csgo/news/71528-donk-getting-into-esports-directly-depends-on-dedication-and-persistence-not-on-some-metrics-like-elo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EscoreNews</a>, Team Spirit’s Danil ‘donk’ Kryshkovets explained what it takes to get into the pro leagues as an esports competitor:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The chances of getting into esports directly depend on dedication and persistence, not on some metrics like Elo. You can have a lot of Elo at 13, but stagnate and not develop for four years. Then no one will need you.&nbsp;Zweih&nbsp;had two thousand Elo in 2023, when I had 5k. Two years later, we ended up on the same team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an earlier interview, donk revealed that his Counter-Strike approach is built mostly around instinctive actions, which require a high level of self-trust and confidence in decision-making.</p>



<p>It’s certainly something to take away for the average esports aspirant, as donk has had a staggering year in the Counter-Strike 2 space.</p>



<p>Since early 2024, donk has exploded, picking up wins at various top-tier tournaments:</p>



<ul>
<li>February 2024 – IEM Katowice</li>



<li>June 2024 – BLAST Premier Spring Final</li>



<li>September 2024 – BetBoom Dacha Belgrade</li>



<li>December 2024 – Perfect World Shanghai</li>



<li>January 2025 – BLAST Bounty Spring</li>



<li>May 2025 – PGL Astana</li>



<li>August 2025 – IEM Cologne</li>
</ul>



<p>He’s fast becoming one of the most recognizable names in Counter-Strike, and he insists that players should stop focusing so heavily on Elo. It was mere weeks ago that he secured MVP in Cologne at one of the most prestigious events in the business, so he knows something.</p>



<p>Do you think donk is right? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-champions-2025-bundle-revealed-riot/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Riot Games has unveiled the VALORANT Champions 2025 bundle, including skins for the Vandal and a gorgeous Butterfly Knife. For the first time, the VALORANT Champions bundle will feature a Flex item, which is a neat replication of the VAL Champs trophy that is believed to interact with the leaderboard for each match a player appears in.</p>



<p>The VALORANT Champions 2025 bundle also includes, as expected, a spray, player card, and gun buddy.</p>



<p>Check out the entire bundle below and find out when it’s coming to the VALORANT store.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-valorant-champions-2025-bundle-coming-to-the-store">When is the VALORANT Champions 2025 Bundle Coming to the Store?</h2>



<p>The VALORANT Champions 2025 bundle will be added to the VALORANT store on September 4, and the bundle will remain live until October 9, 2025. This is a long enough window for any VALORANT esports fans to show their appreciation for the tournament by securing the bundle.</p>



<p>But how much will the VALORANT Champs bundle cost this year? The price hasn’t been confirmed, but it’s <strong>expected </strong>to cost around 6,100 VALORANT Points (VP). That’s around $65 USD in real-world money.</p>



<p>True esports fans will recognize that a portion of that price tag goes to the team partnered with Riot Games in the VCT circuit, so it might seem like a lot, but you’re paying a little something in the pockets of the players you love.</p>



<p>The VALORANT Champions 2025 bundle was revealed by Riot Games with a short, one-minute trailer on social media:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Both the VAL Champs Vandal and the Butterfly Knife look fantastic in the new bundle, boasting exclusive gold trim that shimmers and shines as you dominate the game.</p>



<p>This year’s VALORANT Champions tournament will take place in Paris from September 12 to October 5, and it’s toting a $2.25 million prize pool.</p>



<p>Do you think you’ll part ways with $65 to secure the VALORANT Champions 2025 bundle? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-1-7-update-coming-confirms/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Eric ‘ConcernedApe’ Barone has confirmed that Stardew Valley will get a 1.7 update, even as he works tirelessly to bring Haunted Chocolatier to life. This announcement came on social media with a charming graphic, and while it was revealed, Barone stressed that there’s ‘no release date, no estimate’ for the 1.7 Stardew Valley update.</p>



<p>It has been more than a year since the 1.6 update for Stardew Valley, which introduced new items, festivals, and various graphical improvements, was released on all platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-stardew-valley-getting-any-more-updates">Is Stardew Valley Getting Any More Updates?</h2>



<p>The running belief was that Eric ‘ConcernedApe’ Barone was <strong>finished </strong>with Stardew Valley updates as he started work on Haunted Chocolatier, his first new game in <strong>years</strong>. Following the rampant and wildfire success of Stardew Valley, one of the highest-rated and best-selling indie games of all time, Barone is looking to move to pastures new.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, Barone confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Okay, I revealed this at the concert last night and now the cat’s out of the bag, so I will confirm for everyone: There will be a Stardew Valley 1.7 update. No release date, no estimate. But it’s happening.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The image he used for the announcement was fantastic:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Stardew Valley has been around since 2016, and in July, it shattered a Steam record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-smashes-steam-record-portal-2/">held by Portal 2 for <strong>14 years</strong></a><strong> </strong>by becoming the platform’s top-rated game. As I write this, 98% of the nearly half a million reviews of Stardew Valley are positive, which effortlessly dominates every other game on the Steam platform.</p>



<p>To put that into perspective, Steam hosts more than 130,000 games.</p>



<p><span>Currently, we have no information&nbsp;<strong>on&nbsp;</strong>what the Stardew Valley 1.7 update will entai</span>l. Given the track record for ConcernedApe, it’s safe to assume it’ll be sizable, but the solo developer is tied up with Haunted Chocolatier, so who knows?</p>



<p>What do you want to see in the Stardew Valley 1.7 update? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Stardew Valley" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d42063c515174/stardew-valley.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Fans of the hugely successful farming and lifestyle sim <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> can look forward to another major update in the future.</p>
<p>The creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone actually shared this news at the Stardew Concert this week, and has now followed this up with an <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1961864959484412104">announcement on social media</a>. In brief, a Stardew Valley - Version 1.7 update is happening!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ConcernedApe:</strong> "Okay, I revealed this at the concert last night and now the cat's out of the bag, so I will confirm for everyone: There will be a Stardew Valley 1.7 update. No release date, no estimate. But it's happening"</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="r3KMxc-vq0o" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed35e359vkhyzu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3KMxc-vq0o" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Although there's currently "no release date" and "no estimate" about when it could arrive, and it's not been revealed what will specifically be added to this next major update, this news already has the Stardew Valley community buzzing.</p>
<p>The last big update for Stardew Valley was the 1.6 update (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/stardew-valley-version-1-6-is-finally-out-now-on-switch">which arrived on the Switch in November last year</a>). It added multiple new festivals and events, a new farm type, and much more content and improvements. Following this update, multiple other patches were also released, improving and adding to the overall experience.</p>
<p>In an interview earlier this year, Barone was asked about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/stardew-valley-creator-open-to-sequel-but-admits-updates-are-much-easier">chances of a sequel to Stardew Valley</a>, and admitted at the time it was "much easier" to just update the existing gameplay and systems. He's also previously stated how he doesn't necessarily want to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/stardew-valley-creator-doesnt-want-to-close-the-book-on-its-development">"close the book" the game's development</a> even though he's now working on his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/concernedape-shares-new-development-update-on-haunted-chocolatier">new project, <strong>Haunted Chocolatier</strong></a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-has-a-huge-surplus-of-bose-tv-speakers-so-its-selling-them-now-for-peanuts-2000621690</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-has-a-huge-surplus-of-bose-tv-speakers-so-it%E2%80%99s-selling-them-now-for-peanuts.1284888/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is shaking things up this Labor Day weekend, going after all the big names – and Bose is no exception. If you’ve been thinking about upgrading your audio setup, now’s a great moment to jump in: The Bose TV Speaker, which <strong>works as both a soundbar for your TV and a simple living room speaker</strong><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/">, is down to just $163 on Amazon (41% off)</a>. Considering that it normally retails for $279, that is a huge discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Favorite Speaker</h2>
<p>The speaker is designed to<strong> improve the audio from your TV without the bulk of standard soundbars</strong>. It’s simple to hook up with HDMI-ARC, so installation is fast and hassle-free. The HDMI-ARC (Audio Return Channel) permits the soundbar to both transmit and receive audio via the same cable as video, less cord clutter and neater installation. <strong>And it has Bluetooth</strong>, so listening to music or podcasts from your phone or tablet is ridiculously easy and wireless.</p>
<p>Another of the first things you’ll notice about this soundbar is just how evenly balanced and clean-sounding its sound is. Bose engineered it to maximize conversation clarity which is a big plus if you catch yourself from time to time having trouble hearing every word or being drowned out by other sounds when you watch TV. The speaker’s voice-centric design is made to prioritize voices without comprising the depth of your go-to TV movies or shows.</p>
<p>The speaker uses proprietary drivers and proprietary digital signal processing to deliver clear sound that fills the room beyond your TV’s built-in speakers. Bass is unexpectedly strong for something this compact, providing kick to action flicks and music rhythms without distortion, making it a more immersive experience. You feel the actual sense you’re bringing your entertainment to the next level without complicated setups or humongous speakers.</p>



<p>Compact and slim, the Bose speaker just sits on a shelf or TV stand without wasting space or being in the way of your room’s decor. Its black veneer adds a touch of modern sophistication. It can also sit flat on your TV or be mounted on the wall using the included mounting bracket with some adjustability to fit your living room.</p>
<p>The <strong>attached remote control</strong> is another thoughtful touch: It allows you to easily control your sound level, bass, and whatnot, without having to search through a bunch of devices just to get your sound in balance.</p>
<p><span>This is a great opportunity to treat your home audio to an affordable boost this Labor Day weekend.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 Post-Launch Roadmap Reveals The Return Of Something Fans Loved From Borderlands 2]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pearls-roadmap-takedown-dlc-free-update-2000621708</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-post-launch-roadmap-reveals-the-return-of-something-fans-loved-from-borderlands-2.1284876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Just a couple weeks before launch, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-tag-70-drama-pitchford-80-real-fan-1851784583"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> has announced its post-launch roadmap for free updates and paid DLC throughout the next six months and it’s a lot. But one of the smaller details fans were surprised to see is the return of Pearlescent weapons and shields from <em>Borderlands 2</em>.</p> <p>The <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/post-launch-roadmap/?linkId=856235028">rundown of <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s end-game</a> arrived alongside a developer panel at PAX West walking fans through how the XP-based loot grind will work this time around. The game’s first paid bounty pack arrives in the fall with new missions, a new boss fight, and a slew of Legendary gear and fresh cosmetics. There will also be Vault Cards that let players grind to unlock extra rewards, including gear that can keep being re-rolled until players find the version that fits their build.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000621710" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000621710"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000621710">Gearbox Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>But the big update is <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s first paid Story Pack coming in early 2026. It’ll feature a new Vault Hunter, a mini-story campaign, new area to explore, and another trove of collectibles. It’s a cosmic-horror-themed expansion based around Mad Ellie, a Pandoran mechanic who happens to be Moxxi’s daughter. Some other past characters will be returning as well, with a second Story Pack following later in the year.</p>

 <h2><em>Borderlands 2</em>‘s Pearlescent drops are back</h2> <p>There are plenty of free updates sprinkled in between each DLC, but the biggest will arrive alongside Bounty Pack 2 in early 2026. It adds the Pearlescent rarity to the game, something fans have been begging to be brought back from<em> Borderlands 2</em> after it was dropped for <em>Borderlands 3</em>.</p> <p>These drops are essentially like ultra-rare drops with unique gimmicks. When they arrived in <em>Borderlands 2</em> they didn’t make or break builds. There were more like Shinies from <em>Pokémon</em> than <em>Diablo’</em>s Uniques, sought after as prizes rather than the deadliest tools in the game. <em>Borderlands 4</em> might change that this time around, however. “Pearlescent gear drops will be incredibly difficult to find, but their power level will match their coveted rarity,” writes Gearbox.</p>

 <h2>Where are <em>Borderlands 3</em>‘s Takedowns?</h2> <p>A returning feature the studio hasn’t mentioned yet are Takedowns. <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3s-next-big-expansion-will-be-a-western-1843586642">These free updates for <em>Borderlands 3</em></a> were raid-boss-adjacent endgame modes that were designed to push squads of players to the breaking point with their difficulty. Gearbox hasn’t mentioned them by name yet, thought it has mentioned Invincible Bosses coming in a future free update for <em>Borderlands 4</em>.</p> <p>“Think of them as bosses on steroids: new unique mechanics, massive health pools (not literally invincible, but close to it), extremely lethal attack damage, and other new modifiers that can make quick work of any unprepared Vault Hunters,” the new announcement reads. The first of these will drop before the end of 2025. Weekly big encore boss fights, wildcard missions, and Maurice’s Black Market Machine are all coming after launch as well.</p> <p>If <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s base campaign can deliver a better story than <em>Borderlands 3</em> and make good on the <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-split-screen-coop-switch-2-amon-skill-tree-2000618064">promised variety, variability, and build-crafting depth</a> of the new Vault Hunters, the post-launch roadmap definitely looks like it will be showering players with all of the content they’ll want in the endgame. Those are two big ifs. But with <em>Destiny 2</em> currently spiraling and <em>Diablo 4</em> still awaiting its next big expansion, I’m as primed for some fresh, smooth-brained loot chasing as I’ll ever be.</p>
