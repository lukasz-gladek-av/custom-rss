            <p>
With Indiana Jones &amp; the Great Circle and Doom: The Dark Ages both waiting in the wings, Microsoft confirmed another of its first-party titles making the jump to PS5. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> is coming to Sony's console this "spring", and new content for all platforms is also on the way.
</p>
<p>
Forza Horizon 5 originally released back in 2021, taking the acclaimed open-world racing series to Mexico - or at least a fictional island amalgam, drawing extensive inspiration from the country's landmarks and features. Eurogamer called it "another gorgeous and enveloping pocket holiday" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-5-review-the-ultimate-big-tent-driving-game-cruises-to-mexico">our Recommended review</a>, highlighting its racing's "enviable tightrope-walk between structure and player freedom".
</p>
<p>
Which is to say it's another great former Xbox console exclusive for PlayStation owners to get acquainted with. Forza Horizon 5's PlayStation release will support cross-play with other platforms, and includes the same content as the PC and Xbox versions - with additional Car Packs and its two expansions, Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure, also available for purchase.

<p>
Additionally, Microsoft has <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-ps5">announced a free new content update</a> for all platforms, albeit one without a current ETA. Horizon Realms, as it's known, promises to give players the "chance to explore a curated collection of some of the community's favourite previously released Evolving Worlds", alongside some other "surprises".
</p><p>
Forza Horizon 5's leap to PS5 comes after Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-confirms-multiplatform-future-is-here-to-stay">confirmed its new multi-console release strategy</a> last year. 2024 laid the foundations with the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, Grounded, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, and Pentiment on PlayStation, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2 so far confirmed for 2025.
</p>
<p>
The start of this year also brought reports pointing to other Xbox games bound for PlayStation, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-getting-halo-and-another-big-xbox-game-with-microsoft-set-to-be-a-very-big-supporter">PS5 versions of Halo: The Masterchief Collection and Flight Simulator</a> claimed to be on the way. Previously, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said there were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">no "red lines"</a> when it came to the games Microsoft was willing to port to Sony's console.

			<p>It's been confirmed on the official website for Forza Horizon 5 that this previously Xbox-exclusive title will now be coming to PlayStation 5. This is a huge deal for those who were previously unable to play this game due to it only being on Xbox and PC. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-starfield-playstation-5/">rumors were circulating</a> months prior, fans will now be able to dive into this game on PlayStation 5 in the Spring.</p>
<p>Since the game was released, it has received over 40 thematic updates, with two expansions and other content added into the game to keep it fresh for the Forza Horizon fans. Now that it's coming to PlayStation 5, players will have access to the nearly 900 cars available in the game, where they will finally be able to drive along Mexico's roads and experience the Horizon Festival.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news post</a> on the Forza website, it was stated that the PlayStation 5 version of Forza Horizon 5 was developed by Panic Button in partnership with Turn 10 Studios and Playground Games. For those who may be worried about missing out on content, fear not. The game will come with all of the same content as the Xbox and PC versions of the title. Additionally, Car Packs and the Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure expansions will be available for PlayStation 5 users to purchase should they want to.</p>
<p>The news post also announced that there will be a special free update being added to the game across all platforms, titled Horizon Realms. Realm will allow players to explore a curated collection of the community's favorite previously released Evolving Worlds. There will also be "some other surprises," with details to be released in the future.</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 5 is now available to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010647" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlist on the PlayStation Store</a> today, where players will be able to get updates about when the game is set to release.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will be cross-play for all Forza Horizon 5 players across Xbox consoles, PC, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>With Xbox deciding to do away with console exclusives, it will be interesting to see what further Xbox exclusives are revealed to be making their way over to PlayStation 5 in the future. Whether this means PlayStation will see titles like Halo or Senua's Saga: Hellblade II remains to be seen, but we can only hope they will be ported over in the future.</p>

Sure, the game is young and there’s plenty of time for something to go wrong. But right now <em>Marvel Rivals </em>has a lot of goodwill and <em>Overwatch 2 </em>doesn’t.</p><p>I’m still hopeful that <em>Overwatch 2 </em>can rise from the ashes. Sure, fumbles by top-level management have pushed incredibly talented designers, artists, writers, and others out of a team that was once brimming with passion and promise, but I know there are still people in Blizzard who want <em>Overwatch 2 </em>to be the best version of itself. If it’s not going to be the feature-rich narrative sequel we were promised, I do hope that Blizzard can at least find something to bring the magic back. The team is no doubt aware that <em>Marvel Rivals </em>hangs over <em>Overwatch 2</em>. Every perceived misstep right now might feel like a point on the board for NetEase, and every underwhelming update or recolored skin looks like <em>Overwatch 2 </em>falling further behind.</p><p>I don’t know that a new PvP mode is the update <em>Overwatch 2 </em>needs to get back on top. Returning to the 6v6 format won’t wipe away the stench people associate with the game overnight,  and after gutting <em>Overwatch 2 </em>into a husk of its former self, Blizzard has to know the window to reclaim its place in the hierarchy of hero shooters is closing. The faded glow of its long-gone status as undisputed king has largely sustained <em>Overwatch 2 </em>through years of content droughts and failure to live up to its potential. In the volatile live-service market, you can only stay in the shadow of something else for so long before players stop searching for you on their desktops. I hope <em>Overwatch 2 </em>can find a way out of the darkness it’s found itself in.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There's only one thing worse than being chased across the desert by a sandworm in Dune: Awakening, and that's getting eaten by a sandworm in Dune: Awakening. Not only does the giant phallic cretin suck you down into the bowels of Arrakis, it eats everything you're carrying. Your clothes, your weapons, and especially your Spice Liquor. Suddenly you're respawning at your base in nothing but your underwear and are forced to do the run of shame across the sands to start rebuilding your inventory. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easy to be sceptical about an MMO survival game set in the Duniverse, but after a few bouts of dehydration and sunstroke, the day I spent in Arrakis convinced me that Dune: Awakening is one to watch. More than that, if the developer can deliver on its plans for the endgame, it could see an EVE Online-style future for its hardcore playerbase. This massive project is the work of Funcom - the studio of the Conan: Exiles dong slider fame - and sets you on a path from broke-ass Arrakis hobo to an influential figure harvesting Spice on an industrial scale and pushing their personal agenda at the Landsraad. It's got everything you expect from an MMO - intricate skill trees, PvP mechanics, base building and character customization, but with ornithopters and mind-altering substances thrown in. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dune: Awakening - January 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dune: Awakening is set in a world where Lady Jessica had a Sliding Doors moment and chose to follow the instructions of the Bene Gesserit and have a daughter, Ariste, instead of the little twink we know and love, Paul Atredies. Cut to 29 years later and the Harkonnens and Atredies are at war over Arrakis, the Fremen have been (apparently) wiped out, and alternative religions have evolved to fill the gap left by Lisan al-Gaib. The alternate timeline isn't meant as a nipple twist to fans, Funcom needed the narrative space to make the player character consequential. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The alternate timeline isn't meant as a nipple twist to fans, Funcom needed the narrative space to make the player character consequential. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“Obviously we did the somewhat controversial but I think very correct choice of creating the alternate history, which allowed us to detach a bit from what was going on in the movies and kind of focus on developing the game," explains producer Nils Ryborg. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's also been very helpful in that it allows us to bring a lot of the big-name characters that people really want to interact with back into the story. So in the books, a lot of the big-name characters die off quite early. With our story, we get to keep them around, which is really cool. There are obviously things that we want to include more of in the future that were very popular in the movies. We won't have sandworm riding at launch, for instance. But sometime in the future we'll look at that."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If it still doesn't sit right, Dune purists should know that Funcom got the blessing of the Herbert estate for the project, working with it and the makers of the current movies to keep everything true to the lore. It influences everything from the skills you can learn to the crafting progression, and it's a key part of trying to ensure that Awakening stands out in an ever-growing pack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Survival games are all over Steam right now, and I've tried most of them. Drop me naked in a jungle and I'll happily bash rocks and branches together for hours. Abandon me penniless in a fantasy landscape and I'll be crafting swords before breakfast. Dune: Awakening stands out the minute you exit character creation for one very stressful reason; Arrakis isn't exactly a tropical island or verdant forested ecosystem. In the opening area, Hagga Basin, there's no water, scarce wildlife and a distinct lack of coconuts. Oh, and the sun is like really, really hot and you're susceptible to sunstroke, there are scavengers who want to kill you everywhere, and did I mention the sandworms? For the first few hours my entire life hinged on dew drops, granite, and plant fibers, and the advice of an NPC with a pet bat who babied me through covering the basics of weapons, armor, and hydration until I could make it on my own. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You're not totally pathetic during this time thanks to a selection of abilities that you can unlock as you gain experience. I leaned into my manipulative wifey side and chose the Bene Gesserit skills, giving me the power to compel enemies towards me and to hang in front of me for a few moments before going back to trying to kill me. Don't get me wrong, I was still very much a toddler in the eyes of Dune: Awakening - one ability I unlocked was better sunstroke tolerance - but by the end of the day in Arrakis I had slightly better weapons and had mastered a super fast dash move that got me out of some trouble.  I could only dream of the wild combinations of ranged and melee combat, combined with passive and active abilities that could be swapped in and out according to need, shown off by the developers, but the skill point acquisition felt fast enough that I'll get there without too much hanging around once I'm playing at home. You won't be tied to your first specialty of choice either, so you'll be able to mix and match. The other starting classes are Trooper, Mentat (recon and strategy focused), and Swordmaster.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Spice of Life</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Another key element we only got a taste of was the very lifeblood of the Dune lore, Spice. Spice is powerful in the world of Dune: Awakening in every sense of the word, but it's also not easy to amass as a lone noob in the early hours. You'll find Spice Liquor and food in the world which unlocks a brief period of Prescient power -  though it comes with withdrawal symptoms - but later in the game you can build transports, harvesters, and automated Spice-collection systems to score the quantities you'll need for trade, serious crafting or managing a raging Spice addiction. I suspect the value of Spice to players, versus the pain of collecting it, will be something Funcom will be balancing long after the game is released. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think Spice is really cool. Obviously super important in the lore and we use it not only to… it has some story aspects that I won't get into, but it's also the fact that we can use it to improve the strength of our abilities and how well we get to interact with them," says Ryborg.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you're constantly high up on Spice, you will start seeing weird and wonky things.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"But then having the drawback of Spice addiction and needing more of it, and it's like constant need of more and more and more. A lot of the endgame systems being reliant on, 'Hey, can you get enough Spice to pay all your taxes for your huge base and to have the correct political sway that you need and build whatever endgame things that you need to build?' I feel that's been a very rewarding thing to pull off because we're now allowing all the iconic things that you think of from the Dune books to become natural mechanics that fit very well into the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you're constantly high up on Spice, you will start seeing weird and wonky things. I think it's fun, right? Because you're empowering your abilities, but you're also potentially putting yourself in a situation where you have worse possibilities. So you're balancing that whole act of, ‘Oh, I need to do this or this.’ And then also knowing that you need this resource for progression in other mechanics. So you're tapping into it now for a temporary boost for this fight but long-term I need this to pay taxes, gain political sway, and so on."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you've learned to live Arrakis style, you can start to focus on more than just beverages. There's a simple building system so you can start to construct your base, or sub-fief, and which you'll slowly start to fill with machines that automate the basics of survival. A machine to extract water from blood that you can harvest from enemy corpses, another to purify the ores you find. You'll need a fabricator to create armor and weapons. We only had access to very basic granite building blocks at the early stage of Dune: Awakening, but options for customization will increase as you progress. Personally I can't wait to build some severe mansion with Harkonnen aesthetics. You can also copy your base to move as your focus turns to new areas of Arrakis, so none of that tedious multiple base nonsense that survival players are sometimes cursed with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easy to picture my time spent in a loop of harvesting materials, completing side quests or contracts, and taking out Scavengers whenever I come across them. And I did come across them a lot. There are camps dotted around the map, and enemies will respawn there on a regular basis, so you'll always have some walking blood bags to exsanguinate when you need to. At times the enemies and the camps felt a little cut-and-paste. Early on I was passing the same camps over and over as I ran across the map, staying in the shadows to avoid the heat of the sun, and dealing with them started to feel like a grind.  Close to the end of the demo the development team took pity on us and spawned ornithopters, and it's easy to see how that issue won't reappear once you're not trudging back and forth across the map looking for a new supply of ore. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You're free to just wander the desert collecting twigs, but there are multiple story arcs - or Journeys - that push you deeper into the world. As well as bat boy's Arrakis 101 seminar, there's a Herbertian set of trials you're tasked with completing after a Spice Dream, and that's where things get trippy. No spoilers, but the first, the Trial of Aql, involves stealthing around a cavern to avoid the notice of a giant golden glowing eye. The weirdness was a welcome interlude in the cycle of harvesting materials, killing scavengers, and fulfilling basic contracts for the tradepost, and I'm hungry to know what the other trials have in store. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are multiple story arcs - or Journeys - that push you deeper into the world.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Some stuff we didn't get to try for ourselves were the more social aspects of Dune: Awakening. Prove your skills for survival and skulduggery in Arrakis and you'll get to the endgame, wielding influence at the Landsraat, where factions of players can make choices that will affect the world. Being as we were in the toddler end of the Dune: Awakening pool, we only got to experience the PvE part of the experience, which with everything else I was trying to deal with felt like a blessing. Ryborg says that while you can enjoy the game as a loner, those later social aspects will be vital to being an Arrakis Kingpin, from taking on the tough dungeon-style lab locations to trading for items.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"So we've got the whole story and there's a lot of single player content but there are areas where you definitely need other people. If you want to get into the really tough ecological testing stations, some of the tougher ones, you definitely need people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But especially when you want to delve into the deep desert, the full endgame. If you want to engage in the endgame political loop, you will need more people. If you want to do the proper big Spice raids and actually get enough resources to really make a dent into the endgame, you will need people. But I think one way to think about it is you don't have to do that every second of the day. That can be like, let's plan a big event as a group of people, let's go do that. And then the rest of the time you can enjoy building your base and engaging with the story and building up your character in different ways."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It might not be easy, living in the world of Dune: Awakening, but as a Frank Herbert fan I'm confident that the experience is in good hands. It's a combination of solid mechanics that put a twist on the usual scenarios, and a deep deep obsession with the work of Herbert that strengthens the world building beyond the abilities of most narrative designs. Yes, I'm basically peeing in my Stillsuit with excitement, even after all the sandworm trauma. Now I just need Funcom to add an ability to make a Muad'Dib my in-game pet, rather than just another furry blood bag. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Last summer, much of the PoE 1 development team was shifted to PoE 2 in order to help the developer hit its planned early access release date. Grinding Gear Games had promised to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-wont-replace-the-first-game-after-all/1100-6516398/" data-ref-id="1100-6516398">keep updating the original PoE after the release of PoE 2</a>, and internally slated a new "league" (PoE's version of seasons) for February. Rogers said he believed the team had time to both get PoE 2's endgame ready for early access while preparing the new PoE league for February.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF4rqnPoo80" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wF4rqnPoo80" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, that's not what happened. Rogers said they "were fooling themselves" thinking that plan would work. After PoE 2's early access release was delayed several weeks, the PoE 1 team continued to work on the sequel. Even after PoE 2 launched, it continued to run into problems, and Rogers said he couldn't justify taking the PoE team off the project until the fires were put out.</p><p dir="ltr">"How could we think about making a PoE 1 expansion, when we still had hundreds of thousands of people having bad experiences in PoE 2?" Rogers said.</p><p dir="ltr">It was after the developer's holiday break that it decided the goal was to get PoE 2 to a state where it didn't have major issues before moving forward with full development of PoE's new league. As a result, major work on PoE update 3.26 won't happen until a few weeks after the release of PoE 2 update 0.2.0, Rogers said. PoE 2 is currently on update 0.1.1, with no given release window for when 0.2.0 might arrive.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm really sorry for how this went down," Rogers said. "Honestly, I should have predicted the fact that taking the PoE 1 team off PoE 1 would lead to this outcome, and I probably should have resisted doing it. But at every stage I just kept thinking, 'We still have time, we still have time.' And then we didn't have time any more."</p><p dir="ltr">The silver lining is that some pre-production work on PoE update 3.26 is currently underway, and Rogers said once update 0.2.0 is out the door, the studio will devote as many resources as possible to releasing the new PoE league as soon as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">"We still have a lot to learn about how to run two games simultaneously," Rogers said. "We were overconfident. We still need to work out how to structure our studio to make this possible. But we do have a solid plan for what we want to do with [update] 3.26."</p><p dir="ltr">PoE 2's launch has largely been a major success story for Grinding Gear Games. The anticipated ARPG sequel saw <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-passes-over-1-million-early-access-players-dev-warns-of-server-struggles/1100-6528281/" data-ref-id="1100-6528281">more than 1 million players pay for early access</a> despite the fact that PoE 2 will eventually be free-to-play, and it's regularly one of the top-played games on Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">Its launch hasn't come without some unforeseen consequences, however. Grinding Gear Games stated its support staff was wildly unprepared for the amount of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-huge-early-access-launch-is-overwhelming-its-support-staff/1100-6528388/" data-ref-id="1100-6528388">support tickets related to PoE 2's early access launch</a>, and has had to double its support team to better meet demand.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/30/gran-turismo-7-update-1-55-adds-f3500-a-90s-inspired-formula-car/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Update 1.55 is out now for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>, and it’s got some great new cars and additions to the racing game, including a new formula car inspired by classic 90s F1 designs, and wider support for the Gran Turismo Sophy AI.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing the &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot; Free Update - January 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tLBtn5F5j2o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Four cars have been added in Gran Turismo 7 update 1.55:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gran Turismo F3500-A</li>
<li>Honda Civic Si Extra (EF) ’87</li>
<li>Hyundai IONIQ 5 N ‘24</li>
<li>Toyota C-HR S ’18</li>
</ul>
<p>All four can be purchased from Brand Central, giving us a modern crossover SUV, a rather popular electric car, an 80s touring car classic, and the original formula racing car as well.</p>
<p>The F3500-A is inspired by early 90s F1 cars, and I can definitely see shades of the Williams FW14B and FW15C, the McLaren MP4/8 and Jordan 191 in the curved from nose down to the front wing – there’s going to be some awesome custom liveries for this probably by later today! In-game, this will have a 3.5L naturally aspirated V12 that’s going to scream with high RPMs as you go through the 6-speed semi-auto gearbox.</p>

<p>Beyond the cars, there’s a new Extra Menu No. 43 for Group C cars, and there’s new World Circuit events:</p>
<p>Sunday Cup: Kyoto Driving Park – Miyabi<br>
Japanese FF Challenge 450: Sardegna – Road Track – C<br>
World Touring Car 600: Autódromo de Interlagos</p>
<p>Gran Turismo Sophy has also been expanded to two more circuits, no available to race against at Autódromo de Interlagos and Mount Panorama Circuit.</p>
<p>A strong update to start 2025!</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mandragora">Mandragora: Whispers Of The Witch Tree</a> is a 2.5D Soulsvania from Primal Game Studio, in which you electrify, bisect or incinerate handsome, ravening night creatures in a world of heaped skulls and burning spires. Yes, I'm well aware that "2.5D" and "Soulsvania" are nonsense words, woven by pestilent market forces. Samuel Johnson is turning in his grave, I expect. He has risen from his grave and equipped himself with an ironbound dictionary and is even now making his way through the layers of the English language, hellbent on slaughtering every 'vania yet coined.</p>
<p>But never mind Samuel. Oversized rodents and spiders aside, Mandragora is notable for being written by Brian Mitsoda, writer of the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brian-mitsoda-has-been-fired-as-narrative-lead-on-bloodlines-2">former narrative lead for its sequel at Hardsuit Labs</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-and-now-under-development-by-dear-esther-studio">lives on in the hands of The Chinese Room</a>.

<p>Some plot from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721060/Mandragora_Whispers_of_the_Witch_Tree/">Steam page</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>"Mankind has surrendered the world to the monsters. The people of Faelduum hide away behind walls of brick and palisades of ignorance, constructed by their leaders. Joy and delight are coveted jewels, out of reach of the masses. This is not the world you were promised. Travel by night and take it back."</p></blockquote>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>You get a choice of classes and a set of nodular skill trees which look like blood spatter from a recent murder. You also get a travelling caravan you can populate with artisans who'll craft your kit. While some of the bigger munsters seem a bit spongy in the footage, I find them appealingly diseased and frenzied. I don't get the impression you'll be duelling many proud knights in armour. I also like the specific gradation of rotten beauty they're going for with the "painterly", seeping backdrops.</p><p>As for Mitsoda's contribution, you will "make devastating choices in a sinister and immersive story". He joined the project back in 2022. Here's an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1721060/view/3689050339694282320">interview from 2023</a> in which he breaks down what a narrative designer actually does, and offers some advice to game devs on "how to introduce a new world in a way that feels organic to the player". An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Don't wholesale copy something else, but feel free to mash up a bunch of influences. Figure out what you can do to make it different from other games in its genre while also appealing to fans of that genre. Focus on the characters - you can have a cliche plot, but the characters will keep people interested and keep the story relatable. Don't "magic" or "technobabble" for a solution - try to make sure everything in the game follows rules that are established and the player understands."</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps you'd like to wash that down with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/interview-without-a-vampire-bloodlines-b-mitsoda">one of our own interviews with Mitsoda about the craft of writing video games</a>, from way back in 2009.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Sony has announced that the 30th anniversary classic PlayStation, PS2, PS3, and PS4 themes will be removed from consoles tomorrow, January 21st, 2025. However, due to their popularity,&nbsp;they will return.</p>
<p>“Thank you for the fantastic response to the classic PlayStation, PS2, PS3, and PS4 limited-time console themes, which will be leaving tomorrow,” reads a post on <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1884979891067863448">Twitter</a>. “Due to the positive response on these 4 themes, we’re doing some work behind the scenes to bring these special designs back in the months ahead.”</p>


<p>“While there aren’t plans to create additional themes in the future, we’re excited to keep celebrating legacy PlayStation hardware with you all,” added Sony.</p>
<p>Themes were popular for both the PS3 and PS4 console user interfaces but are notably absent on PlayStation 5 with the 30th anniversary themes being the only ones available. Clearly, the tech is in place for themes to work on the console but for some reason, Sony has decided not to make any for the PS5. They used to be a regular occurrence on the older consoles with themes launched to promote upcoming games or events.</p>

<p>With the 30th anniversary period coming to a close, it’s odd Sony didn’t make a bigger event of it. There were no game announcements,&nbsp; no parties, no celebrations,&nbsp; not even a fan vote for the best PlayStation game of all time. What we did get was a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/sony-reveal-my-first-gran-turismo-to-celebrate-playstations-30th-anniversary/">free-to-play version of Gran Turismo,</a> some soundtracks on Spotify, and a weird board game though so… yay for those?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-directorate-novitiate-reveal-trailer-drops-third-person-action-rpg-set-in-2006/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The official reveal trailer has dropped for The Directorate: Novitiate, revealing a new narrative-driven single-player game that will be a third-person action RPG, with the game taking place in Los Angeles. This title is being developed and published by Nesting Games.</p>
<p>The year is 2006, and the world is magic-infused. In this game, you'll be playing as Mercury, where you will get to use a mixture of guns and magic to fight off supernatural threats and chase down a serial killer across Los Angeles. To see what you can expect from The Directorate: Novitiate, make sure to check out the official reveal trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Directorate: Novitiate – Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-XH0XEYavkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1883830/The_Directorate_Novitiate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a> for this game has been released, revealing the base features you need to know about the game. If you liked<a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-trademarks-fbc-firebreak/"> Control</a> or Alan Wake, then this may be a game you want to keep an eye on. It has very similar themes and styles of combat, from what is seen in the GIFs on Steam.</p>
<p>Kana Luna (Mercury) finds her life turned upside down as she becomes involved with the Costa Muerta, a Dark Syndicate of the Directorate. Because of this, she now needs to hone her skills, where you'll help her rise up from the rank of Novitiate.</p>
<p>It will be much more than just guns and magic, as there will be a high-stakes story to go along with it. While you will get to experience the traditional third-person shooter mechanics, there will also be magic spells that you can utilize, as well as the ability to upgrade your skills and perform finishing moves that add flare and style to the scene.</p>
<p>As with any high-stakes story, there will also be important player decisions to be made, where your choices will impact the story later down the line. You have to make the decision on whether you want to remain loyal to the Edicts of the Directorate or choose to stay in the real world. However, this will all have consequences for friends, foes, and more.</p>
<p>At the moment, the game doesn't have a planned release date, with more details to come in the future and a release period to be confirmed at a later date.</p>
<p>Will you be playing The Directorate: Novitiate when it releases?</p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month? </em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>At the end of every month, we have an edition of Remap Recommends focused on video games. But in the middle of the month, we'll have an edition focused on...everything else. It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h2 id="patrick-recommends-blade-chimera">Patrick Recommends: <em>Blade Chimera</em></h2><figure></figure><p><strong>Very Cool Game Name:</strong> <em>Blade Chimera</em><br><strong>Platforms: </strong>Switch (it runs great on Steam Deck), PC<br><strong>Developer: </strong>Ladybug, who I had not heard of but apparently has made a whole series of great games that are as good as, if not better than, <em>Blade Chimera</em></p><p>On some level, it's my job to be aware of upcoming video games, and yet, it's always great when a video game can surprise you. <em>Blade Chimera</em> is one of those, a game I discovered while casually scrolling through Steam's chaotic new releases category and going "oh, <em>what's that</em>?" (<a href="https://remapradio.com/video/whats-new-on-steam/" rel="noreferrer">It directly inspired our new video feature</a>.)</p><p>A little more than 10 hours later, I had absolutely devoured this sci-fi take on <em>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</em>, full of delightful and colorful bouncing damage numbers, endorphin-releasing level up sequences, and genuinely thrilling (if a lil' easy) combat. The exploration leave something to be desired, as it's awfully straightforward and gatekept, but if you're looking to scratch an itch, <em>Blade Chimera</em> is happy to do so with  sick ass guns. It's too bad the "true ending" is locked behind a boring collectible hunt, but eh...the "normal" ending is just fine.</p><p>This game put me on a <em>Metroid</em> kick, as I've already dumped a bunch of hours into another excellent (but dour!!!) one-of-these, <em>Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist</em>.</p><hr><h2 id="rob-recommends-the-dynasty">Rob Recommends: <em>The Dynasty</em></h2><figure></figure><p>Until Patrick Mahomes’ second season in the NFL, it seemed unthinkable that the predominance the New England Patriots enjoyed within the NFL would ever be repeated. For two decades, with only brief runs of poor form, the Patriots were consistently in contention to win the Super Bowl despite the league’s long-term efforts to make it impossible to build durable championship teams. They were also frequently embroiled in scandals that ranged from oddly petty to grimly violent. <em>The Dynasty</em>, streaming on AppleTV+,<em> </em>is a detailed history of this era, unpacking the team’s unlikely rise and chronicling the ways it breached rules and doubled-down on a reputation and attitude that made them widely loathed.</p><p>Post <em>The Last Dance</em>, every sports documentary seems to have a legacy-burnishing angle. <em>The Dynasty </em>seems like it is team owner Robert Kraft’s attempt to write himself into the history books as more than just the deep pockets behind the team. As he lays out, he was the nurturing, caring figure at the top of the Patriots in contrast to Bill Belichick‘s pathological coldness that crossed into cruelty. There might be an argument for Kraft’s importance in keeping Tom Brady from cracking under his coach’s psychological brutality, but even in this sympathetic telling, it’s hard to tell how much an impact Kraft really had in shaping the identity of the Patriots and the vaunted Patriot Way.</p><p>However, <em>The Dynasty </em>is more than just a reputation exercise. It’s a study in how miserable success can be. Players describe a tense atmosphere where at any moment you might find yourself replaced or publicly humiliated or both. Tom Brady is described by teammates as one of the most brutally picked-on members of the team, held to impossible standards almost to underscore to the rest of the team that if Bill can treat the greatest QB in history like a junior varsity scrub, imagine what he could do to the rest of them. </p><p>The dissonance is fascinating to watch. Everyone involved with the Patriots is proud of what they achieved, they love going back and telling the stories of their unlikely triumphs and the way they won in spite of a league that was always trying to hit them with exaggerated cheating charges. But the players especially seem ambivalent. They’re still relatively young, far from the age when they emerge like graying veterans to attend team events and reunions and everything is recast through rose-tinted lenses. They are a group of men nearing or in the midst of middle age, trying to explain how the place where they did the greatest work of their professional lives was a place of personal angst and dread, constantly on the verge of imploding from black hole of ambition and demand that was their coach. It‘s not the primary question of <em>The Dynasty </em>but it’s the most interesting one that takes increasing prominence in the background: was all this worth it?</p><hr><h2 id="cado-recommends-desierto">Cado Recommends: <em>Desierto</em></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of itch.io</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Itch.io Descriptipon: </strong>This is a game about getting lost.<br><strong>Platform: </strong><a href="https://josyan.itch.io/desierto?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">Browser/HTML 5<br></a><strong>Developer: </strong><a href="https://josyan.itch.io/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">José Sanz "Josyan"</a></p><p>You ever randomly scroll on itch.io and get bodied by a stunning piece of art? Well, that's what happened to me when I randomly came across <em>Desierto</em> one night. Something about the monochrome digital pointillism of the cover drew me instantly in, and the game itself did not disappoint (aside from the fact that I wish there were more). It's amazingly short. 25-ish minutes, free, and you can play it in your browser. If this piece of art calls to you the way it called to me, I implore you to jump in and spend a little time getting lost.</p>

But some options are clearly better for others, especially if you’re shopping within a specific price range. To help with that decision, I’ve put together a list of my three favorite choices for gaming phones. Let’s get into it.</p><h2 id="h26081"><a id="rog"></a>Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro: A premium experience for hardcore mobile gamers</h2><p>Most phones can play the majority of mobile games in some capacity, so you don’t necessarily need to buy a gaming-specific phone to enjoy playing. But if you want the best of the best performance, software designed specifically for gaming, and a battery that beats basically every other phone on the market, then you should take a look at the Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro. That is, of course, if you’re willing to stomach its rather high price of $1,000 for the 256GB model, with an extra $200 and $500 charge for 512GB and 1TB respectively.</p><p>The Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro’s massive 6.78-inch display can hit up to a 185hz refresh rate to ensure your games look and run the best they can. Additionally, this beastly phone comes packed with a variety of hardware and software features that help it stand out as a “gaming phone”, such as air-trigger shoulder buttons and a wide selection of settings that let you customize your gaming experience well beyond that of any other phone. </p><div><h4> <strong>Also consider: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</strong>   </h4><p> Though not technically a “gaming phone”, a large display and flagship  specs make this popular flagship a great choice for daily use and  gaming.  </p></div><h2 id="h26082"><a id="1+"></a>OnePlus 13: A standard flagship phone with solid gaming performance</h2><p>The OnePlus 13 is one of the most versatile flagship phones around with its exceptional battery life, gorgeous OLED display, and near-stock Android software. Luckily, it’s also a wonderful choice for gaming thanks to what’s under the hood. If you’re willing to drop flagship money on this phone, you’ll be rewarded with a high-end processor, plenty of RAM, and some very impressive temperature control that makes sure you stay cool while gaming. The OnePlus 13 starts at $900.</p><p>Like the Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro, the OnePlus 13 also includes baked-in gaming-related features that allow you a lot of customization over how your games look and perform, which can make you feel like you’re using a more specialized “gaming phone” during your play sessions. Sure, it can’t quite compete with the Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro in terms of features, but it still offers an impressive set of bells and whistles for gamers that elevate this device above many others in its price range.</p><div><h4> <strong>Also consider: iPhone 16 Pro Max</strong>  </h4><p> It’s hard to go wrong with any recent iPhone for killer gaming  performance on a large screen, but the iPhone 16 Pro Max is your best  choice as an Apple user.  </p></div><h2 id="h26083"><a id="gal"></a>Samsung Galaxy A51: An entry level device at an entry level price</h2><p>The Samsung Galaxy A51 proves you don’t have to buy a flagship phone to have fun gaming. While this aging budget phone is missing a lot of the gaming-focused features that you can get with more expensive devices, it’s still capable of keeping up with most modern mobile games even when pushing for high settings with decent framerates.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A51's 6.5-inch screen serves up a nice 1080p picture, but it won’t exactly blow you away with incredible picture quality. Even so, it’s more than enough for the average gamer who isn’t counting pixels. Plus, it’s bright enough to play outdoors or in other well-lit environments. However, the battery isn’t going to hold up to extensive unplugged gaming sessions, so keep a charger on hand if you go with this budget offering. You can snag a Samsung Galaxy A51 for around $200.</p><div><h4> <strong>Also consider: OnePlus 13R</strong>   </h4><p> This mid-range device offers shockingly excellent gaming performance  without sacrificing too many of its older brother’s flagship features,  but it’ll cost a good chunk more than the Galaxy A51 as a result.  </p></div><hr><p>The best gaming phone for you will come down to your own personal needs, but hopefully, this list gives you a few options to consider. Whatever you decide to go with, happy gaming!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Riot Games will reportedly establish an official Game Changers circuit in League of Legends this year. The establishment of a Game Changers scene will ideally women and players representing marginalized genders a viable path to the top tier of competitive LoL.</p>



<p>After the success of the endeavor in the VALORANT space, Riot is hoping to see similar results in their flagship title, League of Legends.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-game-changers-lol-seeks-similar-success-as-valorant">Game Changers LoL Seeks Similar Success as VALORANT</h2>



<p>According to reports from both <a href="https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-to-launch-lol-game-changers-tournament-in-2025-for-marginalized-genders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dot Esports</a> and <a href="https://www.sheepesports.com/articles/sources-riot-to-launch-first-ever-lol-game-changers-initiative-in-emea-starting-in-april/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sheep Esports</a>, Riot will establish a League of Legends Game Changers initiative in the EMEA region this year. The 2025 season will reportedly consist of two splits, with Riot also considering a LAN finals at the end of the second split.</p>



<p>Riot is reportedly looking to invite organizations that field teams in the LEC, the top European league for LoL. Both SK Gaming, G2, and Vitality currently field women’s rosters in LoL. Sheep Esports is reporting that “at least three existing LEC teams – none of which had previously invested in the [GC] scene” have explored roster options “contingent on the launch of a Game Changers initiative.” SK Gaming is also being considered as the host for online qualifiers that could begin in March.</p>



<p>In the VALORANT space, the Game Changers inititiative has been nothing short of a success. Just in the past month, two-time GC champions Shopify Rebellion became the first GC team to qualify for an official Challengers league. This occurred right after the team’s former duelist star, Ava “florescent” Eugene, became the first Game Changers player to compete in the international VCT leagues. The scene as a whole has also provided full-time competition and opportunities to its many players, and has done quite well in regards to viewership.</p>



<p>How exciting is the idea of a Game Changers scene for League of Legends?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hello-kitty-island-adventure-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I found a lot of joy in Hello Kitty Island Adventure when I first started playing its closed beta for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hello-kitty-island-adventure"><u>IGN’s guide</u></a>, way back before it hit Apple Arcade in 2023. Getting to create my own little Sanrio character and run around a tropical island collecting bits and bobs to gift to my new animal friends was pretty relaxing and fun. But day by day, that motivation to complete all my quests, find missing friends, and unlock new regions started to wear off. At a certain point it felt like a chore to log in, spam friends with gifts until I hit obnoxious daily limits, and hope I’d be allowed to progress my friendship levels a little further. Sadly, it’s the same situation on Switch and PC a year and change later: this island is still just as large, colorful, and geographically diverse as it was on my iPad, but it’s as frustratingly gated, repetitive, and stale too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t get me wrong, there’s plenty to like about Hello Kitty. The crafting, for instance, feels simple and intuitive. There are many different things you can make, from a variety of food items to cute plush pals. But at the end of the day, the main purpose of crafting is to get better gifts for your island friends. The better your gifts, the quicker you’ll advance friendship. That means there is very little incentive to craft things outside of gift giving or unlocking the next step of the very light “story.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hello Kitty Island Adventure - First Nintendo Switch Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Gifting is what makes the world go ‘round in Hello Kitty Island Adventure. Everything revolves around giving your island residents presents and receiving resources (which you’ll use to make better gifts) in exchange. Progression in the story is largely locked behind different Friendship levels, which can be a slog to get through unless you’re gifting your residents two- or three-heart items – but the catch is that you won’t even be able to craft those higher level items until you’ve hit certain Friendship levels. It feels like a carefully curated maze of roadblocks to keep you from progressing too far too fast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although discovering the best order to level your residents while trying to figure out each of their favorite three-star gifts can be a fun challenge, gifting eventually starts to feel more like a tedious chore. You can’t even deliver multiple of the same gift at once to hurry up the process. And since gifting whatever earns you the most Friendship points is the only correct option, there’s nothing creative or rewarding about it – it’s a thinly veiled spreadsheet color-coded in bright, bubblegum pink. Even the dialogue triggered by gifting remains largely the same from friend to friend, only varying depending on the “tier” of the item you give.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The characters are super cute, but talking to them each day feels fruitless.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The characters themselves are super cute, and are sure to spark some nostalgia for longtime Sanrio fans. They have a bit of spunk to them, with the odd moment of humor which livens up otherwise-dull dialogue interactions. Other than that, though, talking to the island residents each day feels fruitless. You don’t really get any new interactions with them as time goes on. You just have to keep plugging along giving gift after gift to unlock their quests if you hope to see anything new or different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if Friendship and gifting are simply the keys, surely the questing door they open is where more interesting or engaging experiences must be hidden… right? Unfortunately, all that awaits you is even more flavors of busy work. From quests unlocked by reaching new levels of Friendship, to the story quests which reveal the “mystery” of the island, these objectives are another never-ending list of to-dos, with very little variety in the simple puzzles, object fetching, crafting, and more they ask of you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That means quest tasks get repetitive fast, and I had very little motivation to complete them outside of unlocking more of the story (which itself is full of dialogue that often falls flat) because rewards felt either minimal or inconsequential. We’re talking about a crafting material here, a “spooky” furniture item there – nothing that changed anything about the way the next task would unfold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s because furniture and decorating are just as underwhelming as the crafting and collecting that precede them. You can decorate your own island home, plus the other homes you unlock to attract new Visitors, using the friendship and quest rewards. If you’re lucky, you might find something in a random chest hidden around the island. It’s a while, though, before you’re able to craft your own furniture.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’ve unlocked some variety, the options are… okay. While you <em>could </em>mix and match, the decor isn’t very versatile, leaving little room to get creative and design your own style outside of the “themes” each furniture set comes in because they just don’t play well together. What am I supposed to do with a Hello Kitty bookcase, a Spooky Candelabra, and a Pirate chair? I can’t make my house look like a bookstore, or a cafe, or even redecorate for an upcoming holiday with such limited options. Heck, you can’t even rotate furniture at quarter turns or place objects on tables! Overall, unless you like decorating your houses in full-on Kawaii styles, you’re out of luck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the areas where Hello Kitty Island Adventure’s customization is more successful is its character creator. I love that you get to build your own little Sanrio character, rather than the Animal Crossing approach of you being the only human on an island full of sentient, talking creatures. There’s a nice variety of different animals to choose from, including birds, bunnies, and even sheep (though I am bewildered that it doesn’t have frogs as an option). As you play more and level up your Friendship, you unlock even more “avatar” color options to choose from.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A lack of interesting hooks is why my motivation started to wane.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Tuxedosam has some cute clothes available to purchase at his island shop, and you’ll get the odd outfit from a chest or quest. However, much like the decor, there isn’t enough variety to inspire my creativity or make me want to dress up every day (or even very often) like I usually enjoy doing in games like this. I found one outfit I kind of liked and it became my “uniform.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This lack of interesting hooks is a big reason why my motivation to continue playing started to wane once I reached a certain point. Sure, there are lots of things to collect in Hello Kitty Island Adventure, including furniture, clothes, critters, fish, and more, but there is very little incentive to do so other than simply for the sake of keeping you busy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is at least the Nature Preserve to fill up with critters, as well as the Fwishing Well to give fish to, both of which would normally satisfy someone like me who enjoys “catching ‘em all” and hitting collection goals. But, once again, the rewards for adding these places are so minimal they might as well be nonexistent. You’re telling me that for donating all the critters that can be found in the bog area of the island I get… 10 mushrooms? I could gather those myself in a single day!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It does help that the designs for the critters themselves are unbearably adorable, branching off beyond bugs to also include frogs, chickens, and even turtles. But that’s not enough to change the fact that bug catching itself is overly simplistic, and doesn't offer much to make certain bugs more of a challenge than others besides having them vanish quicker. Of course, you can enlist Kerropi’s help to get a buff that makes the bugs stick around longer – but, as you might have guessed, this too is locked behind their Friendship level.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In comparison, I really like the fishing minigame, which puts a small spin on the typical “keep the fish in the colored bar” mechanic by turning the bar on its side and testing your reaction time to keep an arrow balanced in the center. However, there isn’t much more to fishing beyond this. There are no upgrades to get and no fishing collection challenges that I could find, other than hitting certain milestones by giving gifts… sorry, I mean <em>making donations </em>to the Fwishing Well. That’s a shame, because the designs of the fish are really cute, colorful, and match the unique vibe of the regions they are found in perfectly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At this point, you’ll probably be making comparisons to another cozy tropical island game. Allow me to be the bearer of bad news: No, Hello Kitty Island Adventure is not really comparable to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-for-switch">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>. While these two games might seem very similar on the surface (you are stuck on an island with some cute animal companions, tasked with sprucing the place up), they couldn’t be more different once you actually jump in.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Shailyn's Favorite Cozy Games</h3><p>My go-to games for some satisfying brain-off, no-think time</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Animal Crossing is all about collecting and crafting as you shape your own personal dream island, essentially a sandbox decorating game full of fun little guys who live alongside you. Hello Kitty, on the other hand, is all about transforming an abandoned island amusement park into the best (read, predetermined) version of itself along a linear path. The lack of customization for not only the island itself, but also your own house and visitor’s houses, means it feels less like <em>your</em> dream island, and more like a dream of Hello Kitty’s that you’re just visiting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That makes it feel like Hello Kitty Island Adventure is asking nothing of me except for my time. While a game coming to more platforms is never a bad thing on its own, I fear this one was better off played on a phone – something to open up and fill the dull moments on long commutes or in waiting rooms. Despite the disdain mobile games often unjustly draw, there is no shame in wanting something that serves as a casual distraction for short spurts at a time. (That isn’t even to touch on the fact that many mobile games are <em>so much more</em> than that.) But even in that context, this isn’t one I want to spend my spare time on, and it makes me sad to think it could be what some people now think all cozy mobile games are: colorful, cutesy, and totally mindless.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Geoff Keighley has confirmed that the next Summer Game Fest showcase will take place on June 6.</p><p>Summer Game Fest is an annual event Keighley started in 2020 in lieu of E3. Since 2021, there has been a kickoff showcase each June, and it serves as a console-agnostic showcase where developers can announce or debut new trailers for their upcoming games. We knew that Summer Game Fest would return sometime in 2025, but we didn't have a specific date until today. Keighley confirmed all of this on X and debuted Summer Game Fest 2025's brightly colored key art.</p><p>Summer Game Fest will return on June 6, although a specific time for the showcase isn't confirmed yet. Summer Game Fest 2024 took place 2 p.m. PT on June 7, 2024. It will be livestreamed for viewers at home, but people can also attend the event in person at the YouTube Theater in Los Angeles. No specific games or studios have confirmed their involvement in Summer Game Fest 2025 at this time, with Keighley simply saying that it will "showcase what’s next from the entire video game industry."</p><p>Keighley also affirmed that Summer Game Fest will once again be followed by a Play Days event for media and influencers this year. For those of you at home, the showcase on June 6 is the main thing that you should be looking forward to.</p>

            <p>
Sony has announced it's very nearly time to bid a fond farewell to those PS5 themes it released in celebration of PlayStation's 30th anniversary last year. But the good news is it has plans to bring them back following a "fantastic response" from players.
</p>
<p>
Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-playstation-30th-anniversary-ps5-update-turns-your-console-retro-for-a-limited-time">released a number nostalgia-laden PS5 themes</a> last December, featuring visuals and sounds intended to evoke memories of different console eras. There was one for PlayStation 1, PS2, PS3, and PS4, plus a theme more broadly celebrating the PlayStation brand's big three-oh.
</p>
<p>
The party, however, is almost over, with Sony having now confirmed all its limited-time anniversary themes will cease to be available from Friday, 31st January. Announcing the news on social media, it thanked fans for the "fantastic response" to the themes.

<p>
In fact, the response appears to have been good enough that Sony's had a bit of change of heart regarding the classic console themes' temporary nature. It also revealed it'll be making the designs available again "in the months ahead", just as soon as it's finished "doing some work behind the scenes" to bring them back.
</p><p>
Alongside those retro themes, PlayStation's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-30th-anniversary-celebrations-include-digital-soundtracks-and-a-board-game">30th anniversary celebrations</a> also saw the release of some strikingly designed, PS1-inspired <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-and-digital-edition-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-consoles-announced">limited edition PS5s</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-to-release-free-to-play-my-first-gran-turismo-to-celebrate-playstations-30th-anniversary?view=comments">free-to-play version of Grand Turismo</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-death-stranding-and-the-last-of-us-star-in-playstations-nostalgia-fuelled-30th-anniversary-thank-you-video">nostalgia-heavy thank-you video</a>. Eurogamer also got in the celebratory mood with our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-30th-anniversary">PlayStation 30th anniversary theme week</a>, which is well worth a browse.
