			<p>It's been exactly a year since Frogwares <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-goes-to-kickstarter-soon-as-frogwares-needs-a-safety-net-from-the-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> its fans that The Sinking City 2 would get a Kickstarter funding campaign. Back then, the Ukrainian studio aimed to launch it shortly, but clearly, there were some hiccups.</p>
<p>The campaign is finally <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2?ref=discovery_category&amp;total_hits=21544&amp;category_id=35" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live</a>, though, and its minimum goal of €100K has already been nearly doubled as of this writing. So far, Frogwares has not shared any info on the stretch goals, but they're sure to come with 29 days left in the campaign.</p>

<p>Wael Amr, CEO of Frogwares, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>After 3 years of this horrid war hanging over our daily lives, we've learned to adapt, though it has never been easy. In 2023 when we released Sherlock Holmes The Awakened with the help of Kickstarter and our loving fans, we built ourselves a safety net that saved us more than once. From power outages and the need for team members to relocate on short notice, to having to pause development for days, this safety net was crucial. Given that The Sinking City 2 is a far more complex and demanding game, we’ve decided to take the same route as before.</em></p>
<p>Frogwares Publishing Director Sergiy Oganesyan also spoke about the previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-announcement-ue5-horror-frogwares-deliver-ukraine-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> slight genre change, moving away from adventure to a full-fledged horror title:</p>
<p><em>When we announced The Sinking City 2 back in 2024, we stated this is going to be our chance to shift our studio into creating games that are more “horror first” focused and the results we’re all seeing internally are extremely promising. We’re not ditching our investigation roots entirely, but the chance to spread and challenge our norms has really helped the team grow. We’ve placed combat and exploration first while still keeping an air of investigation that adds depth but is entirely optional.</em></p>

<p>The Sinking City 2 is being made with Unreal Engine 5 and will launch on PC (Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-confirmed-to-have-been-co-developed-with-sony/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>AMD FSR 4, the latest version of the upscaling technology made by AMD, was co-developed with Sony. The news came <a href="https://x.com/amdradeon/status/1897741520200962308" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a tweet</a> pushed by AMD itself, where it was added that this is just the beginning:</p>
<p><em>Happy Radeon Day! We’re proud to collaborate with PlayStation on Project Amethyst!</em></p>
<p><em>FSR 4 is looking fantastic! Excited for the co-development with Sony Interactive Entertainment on the models used for the AMD FSR 4 upscaler. This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for what’s next!</em></p>
<p>For those who may not remember, the joint machine learning project Amethyst was announced in late 2024 by Sony. In an <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive Wccftech interview with Mark Cerny</a>, the PlayStation 5 Pro System Architect explained:</p>
<p><em>Pretty much when PlayStation 5 Pro was wrapping up, we began discussions and development of those various aspects of Amethyst. To get more specific, I think we were getting pretty good momentum by the end of 2023. But as you know, it takes a phenomenally long amount of time to go from discussions and concepting to actually having a piece of hardware out in the marketplace.</em></p>
<p><em>We're looking to co-develop performant new AI architectures that can be used freely in any space that anybody chooses to use them, whether that is PC, console, or cloud. For the software, if I look at it today, we have games that run on a TV and there's a certain set of developers that make them, and AMD for PC has games that run on PC monitors that have a somewhat overlapping set of developers that make games for them. There are different needs and different relationships there, so really what we're looking to do is to co-develop those network architectures and those training strategies that can then be freely used in both contexts.</em></p>
<p>The collaboration is specifically on the AI models, then. It's the big AMD FSR 4 change, after all. FSR 1 was just a spatial upscaler, whereas FSR 2 switched to a temporal upscaler. Neither could possibly perform as well as an AI model, though, which has now been proven with the launch of FSR 4, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-better-fsr3-dlss-cnn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described as a massive improvement over FSR 3</a>. Of course, the trade off is that AMD had to restrict it to the new Radeon RX 9000 Series, just like NVIDIA has been doing with DLSS and its GeForce RTX Series.</p>
<p>Still, AMD should definitely be commended for its efforts to catch up with NVIDIA. While the DLSS 4 transformer model remains the gold standard for upscaling, AMD FSR 4 has reduced that gap considerably, a far from easy feat to accomplish given NVIDIA's headstart. The increased competition in the space will no doubt spur NVIDIA to further improvements and so on, eventually benefiting all users.</p>

As in Pokemon Go Fest's previous stops, Niantic will provide a curated route that will let players take in some of Paris' landmarks while keeping an eye out for elusive Pokemon. The Parc de Sceaux will have real-life Pokemon habitats where players can meet Pokemon mascots and trainers, compete head-to-head in the PVP battle ground, and shop for exclusive merchandise.</p><p>"The charm of Paris, its walkability, and its globally recognized landmarks create the perfect playground for Pokémon GO Fest," said Pokemon Go Live Events Marketing Manager Lena Cillis in a statement.

Following Pokemon Go Fest: Paris, Ninatic will hold a Pokemon Go Fest Global event from June 28-29.</p><p>If you're looking for something to do sooner, Niantic has already shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-march-2025-events-raids-spotlight-hours-community-days-and-more/1100-6529806/" data-ref-id="1100-6529806">the Pokemon Go events for March</a>.

                <p>In WWE 2K25's new Island mode, you'll explore an open-world PvPvE hub full of shops, events, and other players. But one thing you might lose track of is how to change your character's appearance in The Island. In our brief guide, we'll walk you through how to do just that, so your future WWE superstar can look just the way you want them to. Better yet, this same method we'll show you also lets you adjust their moveset to your liking.</p><h2>How to customize your character's appearance and moves in WWE 2K25 The Island</h2><p>There's only one way to change what your character looks like in The Island, since it's a mode split off from your library of create-a-wrestlers (CAWs) and your MyRise story mode superstar. When you create your Island character, the game might usher you right past the customization suite, leaving you to need to get back to it after some brief onboarding into the new mode. </p><p>Once you can freely explore the Island, you'll want to look for a pathway between the pink-colored barber shop and the Nike and Jordan stores. Down that way, you'll see an elaborate building decorated with Cody Rhodes' American Nightmare logo.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455035-4597630f-d8bd-4d82-b2b6-7d09927064d7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455035" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455035-4597630f-d8bd-4d82-b2b6-7d09927064d7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455035"></a><figcaption>Head down the pathway you see in the image behind Larry David here...</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455035-4597630f-d8bd-4d82-b2b6-7d09927064d7.jpg"></figure><p>Head down that pathway and look to the left of Rhodes' hub. There, you'll see a kiosk called MyBooth--these 2K games love branding by removing the space between words. Interact with the circular kiosk to jump into a menu where you can change your wrestler's appearance or moves. There are other MyBooth stations around the Island, but this is the one closest to where you load into the world. Since the mode strangely lacks a map, we'll just say you can generally expect to find a MyBooth kiosk near a few of the distinct zones within the Island hub. There's another one by the Hall of Legends, for example, and another in the Temple of the Ancestors. </p><p>Everything currently available to your character will be there, and beyond the build options you chose at their creation--like their fighting style, height, and weight--nothing is untouchable, so you can continue to edit them as much as you'd like. As you see in the screenshots here, I tried making Larry David. If you see him around the Island, just leave him be. He hates a stop-and-chat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455036-a4a38d44-938d-49f0-a4c3-194f1ed64eb4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455036" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455036-a4a38d44-938d-49f0-a4c3-194f1ed64eb4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455036"></a><figcaption>...then interact with MyBooth to change your character's look and moveset.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455036-a4a38d44-938d-49f0-a4c3-194f1ed64eb4.jpg"></figure><p>For more on WWE 2K25, don't miss the full <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wwe-2k25-showcase-match-list-all-bloodline-matches-and-rewards/2900-6302/" data-ref-id="2900-6302">Showcase matches list</a>, with all rewards and unlockables detailed.

Frogwares' <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2?ref=checkout_rewards_page">Kickstarter campaign for The Sinking City 2</a> is now live, and has smashed through its crowdfunding target in less than a day - raising over £140K at the time or writing.
</p>
<p>
As part of its crowdfunding drive, Frogwares has shared new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a> details - confirming the Lovecratian sequel to be a standalone story featuring new characters and locations. It's once again set in 1920s America, but instead of revisting Oakmont, players'll this time be exploring the flooded streets and crumbling buildings of Arkham itself.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-will-pivot-to-a-horror-focus">previously revealed</a>, The Sinking City 2 - which is Frogwares' first Unreal Engine 5 game - marks a shift away from the deduction focus of its predecessor. It's a sequel firmly in survival horror territory, with combat and exploration said to be the core mechanics this time around - which is perhaps a gamble given combat has historically been Frogawares' achilles heel.

<p>
Investigation work <em>does</em> return, but now it's described as an "optional yet highly useful tool", that'll help players uncover secrets, gameplay bonuses, and lore. The Sinking City 2 is also set to feature a smaller map - explorable both on foot and by boat - that's aiming to provide a "better flow and concentration of things to discover".
</p>
<p>
You'll find a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2?ref=checkout_rewards_page">few more details on The Sinking City 2's Kickstarter page</a>, and there's a look at some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtyEOb2IBZQ">pre-alpha gameplay</a> in the trailer above.
</p>
<p>
Frogwares is aiming to release The Sinking City 2 on  PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S later this year. And if you want to get involved with its crowdfunding campaign - which it says will help "essentially guarantee our team the time and resources needed to explore" new features - there's still 29 days left before things come to a close.
</p>
<p>
The Ukraine-based Frogwares successfully took a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frogwares-remaking-sherlock-holmes-and-cthulhu-crossover-the-awakened">similar crowdfunding approach with 2023's Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened,</a> as  it continued to adjust to life during Russia's ongoing invasion. "This financial safety net proved invaluable to us," the studio writes in its latest Kickstarter campaign, "so we need to do the same now with The Sinking City 2 as this game is vastly bigger and more complex."

<h2>Viral success (for someone else)</h2>
<p>VoltekPlay <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1j3zr6n/comment/mg4va8a/">writes on Reddit</a> that it was only alerted to the existence of <em>My Baby or Not!</em> on iOS by "a suspicious burst of traffic on our itch.io page—all coming from Google organic search." Only after adding a "where did you find our game?" player poll to the page were the developers made aware of some <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@moonliteskye/video/7478018135375842568">popular TikTok videos</a> featuring the iOS version.</p>
<p>"Luckily, some people in the [Tiktok] comments mentioned the real game name—<em>Diapers, Please!</em>—so a few thousand players were able to google their way to our page," VoltekPlay writes. "I can only imagine how many more ended up on the thief’s App Store page instead."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the $2.99 iOS release of <em>My Baby or Not!</em> was <a href="https://app.sensortower.com/overview/6742455066?country=US&amp;tab=category_rankings">quickly climbing iOS's paid games charts</a>, attracting an estimated 20,000 downloads overall, <a href="https://app.sensortower.com/publisher/ios/1758988688/?page=1&amp;page_size=25">according to Sensor Tower</a>.</p>

<p>The App Store listing credited <em>My Baby or Not!</em> to "Marwane Benyssef," a new iOS developer with no apparent history in the game development community. Benyssef's only other iOS game, <em>Kiosk Food Night Shift</em>, was released last August and appears to be a direct copy of <em>Kiosk</em>, a pay-what-you-want title that was <a href="https://vividev.itch.io/kiosk/">posted to itch.io last year</a> (with a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3126330/Kiosk/">subsequent "full" release on Steam</a> this year)</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1j3zr6n/someone_stole_our_game_from_itchio_renamed_it_and/">a Reddit post</a>, the team at VoltekPlay said that they had filed a DMCA copyright claim against <em>My Baby or Not!</em> Apple subsequently shared that claim with Bennysof, VoltekPlay writes, along with a message that "Apple encourages the parties to a dispute to work directly with one another to resolve the claim."</p>
<p>This morning, Ars reached out to Apple to request a comment on the situation. While awaiting a response (which Apple has yet to provide), Apple appears to have removed Benyssef's developer page and all traces of their games from the iOS App Store.</p>

The game, like 2020's <em>THPS 1+2</em>, is a full remake of two past games from the Tony Hawk franchise, specifically <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 </em>and <em>4</em>. The new remake is being developed by Iron Galaxy and is set to launch in July.

Instead, like in the first three games, each <em>THPS4 </em>level will feature a list of challenges to complete in a 2-minute run.</p><p>This isn’t how it worked in the original <em>THPS4</em>.

While many of these challenges did have timers, between those challenges players were free to skate around, explore, and collect money. </p><p>When news of this first broke on the<em> Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> subreddit, there was a lot of disappointment from fans of <em>THPS4. </em>They had hoped that the more freeform career mode—which later evolved into the open world of<em> Tony Hawk’s Underground</em>—would be recreated for the new remake. That’s not the case. </p><p>There will still be a free skate option in <em>THPS4</em> levels, letting you freely skate around and explore, but you won’t able to complete level challenges in that mode.

<p>This upcoming weekend, Rainbow Six Siege will be free-to-play for all Xbox Game Pass members. If you’re like me, you might be surprised to learn that Siege, a live-service tactical shooter from Ubisoft, is not already a free-to-play game. </p>



<h2 id="h-siege-somehow-isn-t-free-to-play-after-10-years">Siege Somehow Isn’t Free-To-Play After 10 Years</h2>



<p>As part of its <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/06/free-play-days-03-06-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#FreePlayDays program</a>, Rainbow Six Siege will be free to play on Game Pass, starting now until Monday, March 10. AEW: Fight Forever, Born of Bread, and Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown are also free-to-play during the weekend. But Siege’s inclusion is a fascinating one, because if you didn’t know any better, you’d assume that Siege was a free-to-play game already.</p>



<p>Siege hits all the characteristics of a free-to-play game. It’s a live service shooter with all the live service fixings: seasonal passes, loot boxes, a robust cosmetics shop, and dozens of operators that require vigorous grinding or premium currency to unlock. Not only does the standard edition of Rainbow Six Siege cost money, but there’s also three separate upgradeable versions: Deluxe Edition, Operator Edition, and Ultimate Edition. Now currently, there’s a Ubisoft sale on Steam, so you can get the standard version or the Deluxe Edition for less than $7. However, nowhere on the Steam store listing does it explain the differences between the versions.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Way back when the game first launched in 2015, Siege struggled to bring in the numbers that Ubisoft hoped for. However, it slowly improved in player numbers as it released a wave of free content and became a shining example of how a “live service game” could flourish. By 2017, Ubisoft said Siege was attracting 2.3 million players every day. Games like Fortnite, VALORANT, and Apex Legends adopted those same live-service tendencies, but removed a huge entry barrier by releasing as free-to-play.</p>



<p>But why is Siege still not free-to-play at this point? Some players would say it keeps cheaters at bay by making them pay to get in. Maybe the pay-upfront approach is the right one, since Siege is celebrating its 10 year anniversary, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heading toward its next “major evolution” in Siege X</a>. Coincidentally , the Ubisoft sale on Steam ends on March 13, the same as the Siege X world premiere. Between that premiere and the release of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, it’s going to be a big month for Ubisoft.</p>



<p>Were you also surprised to learn Siege wasn’t free-to-play? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

That was the claim CEO Jensen Huang made on stage at CES 2025 a couple of months ago. It turns out it was (mostly) bullshit, but the RTX 5070 is already selling out regardless, despite major price hikes. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Reviews for Nvidia’s  GeForce RTX 5070 went live this week and all of them harped on Huang’s claim. “To call [the two cards] the same is an absolute flat-out lie,” tech channel <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntSylZ1Bp1Y&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntSylZ1Bp1Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gamers Nexus said in its video</a></span> after comparing the performance with the 4090. “This is a 4090 Killer… and I’m a Liar,” was the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUaztYdgoj0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUaztYdgoj0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">title of Linus Tech Tips’ review</a></span>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review-no-its-not-4090-performance-at-549/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review-no-its-not-4090-performance-at-549/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ars Technica</em> wrote</a></span> that it was “hard to classify the RTX 5070 as anything other than a disappointment.”</p><p>The site’s testing showed performance for the 5070 at just slightly above that of last year’s 4070 Super, despite a significant increase in power consumption. The only way Nvidia’s claim of performance parity with the 4090 even begins to make sense is by using the company’s new DLSS Multi-Frame Generation tech.<strong> </strong>It significantly boosts framerates by interpolating three frames for every one actually rendered frame. The result made <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>and other games feel sluggish and subject to lots of visual artifacting while moving.</p><p>But broken CES promises are only part of the story. Outside of that context the 5070 might be a fine incremental improvement on last year’s models at a similar price. But the graphics card market right now is so chaotic and undersupplied that no one actually expects to be able to get the new budget cards at the official $550 MSRP. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/news/nvidias-rtx-5070-was-in-stock-on-launch-day-but-at-terrible-prices&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/nvidias-rtx-5070-was-in-stock-on-launch-day-but-at-terrible-prices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As <em>PC Mag</em> notes</a></span>, launch day stock almost immediately sold out, if it was ever really available to begin with.</p><p>The 5070 cards people could actually find for sale were $650 or more, and things will seemingly only get worse until new stock emerges. In the meantime, there are scalper listings in the $1,000s. One ray of hope is AMD’s new Radeon RX 9070 line, which has been getting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-graphics-cards&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-graphics-cards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rave reviews so far</a></span>. It’s also selling for above the $550-600 MSRP at the moment, but seems to be less scarce overall. There’s no telling just how the broader graphics card market will shake out amid trade wars and the ongoing AI arms race, but decent competition for Nvidia can’t hurt. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

April's a busy month in the world of The Last of Us. Not only is Part 2 coming to PC, the long-awaited second season of HBO's live-action TV adaptation begins too - and Sony is squeezing into the middle of that mushroom-scented sandwich with a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/06/first-look-at-the-dualsense-wireless-controller-the-last-of-us-limited-edition/">limited edition DualSense controller</a> themed around developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s acclaimed games.
</p>
<p>
The DualSense wireless controller – The Last of Us Limited Edition, as it's officially known, arrives on 10th April (Part 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-finally-gets-itself-a-pc-release-date">comes to PC on the 3rd</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">show starts on the 13th</a>), featuring "glossy trophy icons" representing key moments, characters, and events from both games.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, you've been lumbered with me instead of Eurogamer's resident The Last of Us expert Victoria Kennedy for this one - so instead of an insightful breakdown explaining how all the little pictures relate to the game, my only passing thought is the black and white design and subtle embossing looks surprisingly tasteful. Not sure about those big white icons though.

<p>
Anyway, here's what Naughty Dog has to say about the whole thing: "We wanted to ensure that both instalments of The Last of Us are represented, via trophy icons printed in black gloss across the controller body. Among the trophies, three particular images will immediately stand out for TLOU fans: The firefly, moth, and wolf. Players will recognise the Fireflies’ iconic spray-painted logo that originated in Part 1, while the moth and wolf represent the intertwining lives and duality between Ellie and Abby in Part 2."

<p>
Sony's The Last of Us DualSense controller launches on 10th April and costs £74.99 / €84.99 / $84.99. However, anyone looking to jump in line early - given the "limited quantities" it's being released in - can <a href="http://direct.playstation.com/">pre-order on the PlayStation website</a> starting at 10am, 14th March, local time.
</p>
<p>
All this The Last of Us activity comes as Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann this week warned fans, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-boss-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3">"don't bet" on there being a The Last of Us Part 3</a>.

            <p>
A year after developer Ironmace managed to get its free-to-play medieval extraction looter Dark and Darker back on digital storefronts amid a lengthy legal tussle with South Korean game company Nexon, it's been delisted again, this time from the Epic Games Store.
</p>
<p>
Dark and Darker's legal troubles began in 2023 (shortly after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/medieval-battle-royale-alike-dark-and-darker-is-having-a-moment-in-steam-next-fest">demo had a bit of a moment on Steam</a>) when Nexon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-developer-denies-stolen-code-allegations-following-police-raid">accused Ironmace of copyright infringement</a>, claiming members of the development team had used "materials and assets they worked on during their time" at Nexon to create Dark and Darker - an accusation Ironmace repeatedly denied.
</p>
<p>
As the legal accusations continued to fly, Nexon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-has-been-removed-from-steam-following-a-cease-and-desist-demand">issued a cease and desist order forcing the game off Steam</a>, but things appeared to be looking up for Ironmance after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-dev-says-nexons-trade-secret-and-copyright-lawsuit-against-it-has-been-dismissed">court dismissed Nexon's request for an injunction</a> last January. By March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-has-been-removed-from-steam-following-a-cease-and-desist-demand">Dark and Darker had released on the Epic Games Store</a> and it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-is-back-on-steam-and-now-its-free-to-play">finally returned to Steam in June</a> - but it looks like the dance is beginning again, with Dark and Darker having now been removed from the Epic Games Store.

<p>
Addressing the situation in a message shared on the official Dark and Darker Discord (as <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dark-and-darker/delisted-epic-games-store">spotted by PCGamesN</a>), developer Ironmace wrote, "The decision appears to be based on claims made by opposing parties in an ongoing legal dispute. We are currently working to understand the exact reasoning behind this removal."
</p>
<p>
"It seems that the removal process is not yet fully complete," the studio added, "as Dark and Darker is no longer listed, but Dark and Darker: Legendary Status is still available for purchase. Please be aware of this potential confusion."
</p>
<p>
Ironmace didn't explicitly name the opposing parties in its "ongoing legal dispute", but these latest developments are almost certainly connected to the studio's battle with Nexon, which reached another milestone earlier this year. In February, a South Korean court ruled Ironmace hadn't committed copyright infringement with Dark and Darker, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-and-darker-developer-sued-by-nexon-for-copyright-infringement">Nexon had argued</a> - but the studio wasn't entirely off the hook. The court also decided Ironmace <em>had</em> infringed on Nexon's trade secrets, ordering the studio to cough up around $6m USD in damages.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Nexon said it "planned to seek further legal judgment through a higher court", so there's a good chance Dark and Darker's removal from Epic is related to Nexon's escalation. We've reached out to Epic and Ironmace for comment on the situation.
