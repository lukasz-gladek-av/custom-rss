		<p>Ubisoft have revealed how<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Assassin’s Creed Shadows </a>will play in a new video released as part of Ubisoft Forward.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Extended Gameplay Walkthrough | Ubisoft Forward" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FjAzNpMYTxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes us back to 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama era, featuring a female ninja and a male samurai for its lead characters. That man is a historical character based off Yasuke, a man of African origin who was one of the rare immigrants to Japan and who served Oda Nobunaga.&nbsp;The female ninja is named Naoe from Iga Province, who is inducted into the local Assassin’s order to battle all those dastardly Templars.</p>
<p>Her story will be intertwined with that of Yasuke, letting you master complimentary playstyles as both characters have contrasting abilities – Naoe for stealth, Yasuke for direct combat. This will be a fresh take on the twin protagonists that we’ve seen on occasion through the Assassin’s Creed series.</p>
<p>The game will have a full year cycle that will change the weather and give you different things to do depending on the season.&nbsp; Most importantly, you can also pet the doggos!</p>

<p>There will be three editions of the game, beyond the Standard Edition:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Gold Edition</strong> will include the base game, the Season Pass (including a bonus quest with additional unlockable content as well as two upcoming expansions) and 3 days early access to the game.</li>
<li><strong>The Ultimate Edition</strong> will include the base game, the Season Pass, the Ultimate Pack and 3 days early access to the game. The Ultimate Pack will contain the Sekiryu Character Pack (Naoe and Yasuke outfit and weapon, trinket and mount), the Sekiryu Hideout Pack, 5 Skill points and a Red and black photo mode filter.</li>
<li><strong>The Collector’s Edition</strong> will include the base game, the Season Pass, the Ultimate Pack, physical content and 3 days early access to the game. The physical content will be a Steelbook, the World map, Naoe &amp; Yasuke Figurine, life-size Naoe’s Katana Tsuba, a Wall Creed Scroll, an 84 pages collector’s artbook and 2 sumi-e lithographs.</li>
</ul>

		<p>Yoou think you’ve won and defeated the RDA on Pandora? Think again. The Na’vi clans are threatened once more in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> – The Sky Breaker, the first story pack which will launch on 16th July.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - The Sky Breaker Story Pack Trailer | Ubisoft Forward" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AWq6m8rQMHw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A mysterious shadow appears in the sky above Pandora, just as the Na’vi clans are celebrating their festival of games and victory over the RDA from the main campaign. Death and destruction follow and you’ll have to deal with another new threat to the native populace. This will take you to The Heart of the Plains, a new area of the Upper Plains with new environments to explore such as the Prism Fields, Feathered Grasslands, Stone Rapids and more. Here you’ll face the AMP Defender enemy type, which features an indestructible shield and top-mounted gatling gun, as well as new RDA lieutenants with AMP suits.</p>
<p>The Sky Breaker is included in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora Gold Edition or will be available separately and in a season pass. Story Pack #2 will release later this year, dubbed Secrets of the Spires.</p>
<p>A technical marvel on consoles and PC alike – and especially after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/24/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-gets-40-fps-performance-mode-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/">the 40FPS performance mode patch</a> not too long ago – we loved Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora when it launched late last year. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/19/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-review/">our review</a>, Dom said, “Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is an astonishing achievement, with exquisite visuals and a remarkable balance between pacifism and action. This is an enthralling alien world that plays host to a unique FPS.”</p>

        <p>Plus, Lost Crown update out today.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Prince of Persia: Sands of Time's troubled remake has resurfaced during tonight's Ubisoft Forward showcase with the news it'll finally be arriving in 2026, some six years after it was initially revealed. More happily, Price of Persia: The Lost Crown and The Rogue Prince of Persia both have new updates launching today.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">revealed</a> it was remaking Sands of Time back in September 2020, when it was originally due to launch the following January. However, following a less than positive reception to its debut trailer, Ubisoft announced the first of several delays for the project, eventually moving it from original developers Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal.
</p>
<p>
When we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-gets-a-brief-update">last heard from the remake</a> at the end of 2023, Ubisoft announced it had "passed an important internal milestone", but things didn't sound especially far along given the publisher had revealed the rebooted project was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-on-ubisofts-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-still-in-the-conception-phase">still in the "conception" phase</a> in May. A year on, it seems the Sands of Time remake still isn't a state that Ubisoft is confident to show; its re-appearance during tonight's showcase was anticlimactic to say the least, taking the form of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdhrdKu1SCA">30-second teaser trailer</a> showing... a candle. We did, at least, get an updated release window, with Ubisoft confirming the remake is now targeting a 2026 launch.

<p>
Thankfully, we're not short of Prince of Persia at the moment, so that elongated wait isn't so harshly felt. And today brings updates to both of Ubisoft's current Prince of Persia titles, starting with acclaimed Metroidvania, The Lost Crown. The third of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-roadmap-includes-boss-rush-permadeath-story-dlc">three previously announced free updates</a>, titled Divine Trials, is available now, introducing new combat, puzzle, and platform challenges, as well as revised bosses, new amulets, and new outfits. Ubisoft has also revealed The Lost Crown's paid story expansion, Mask of Darkness, will arrive in September.

<p>
And that brings us to developer Evil Empire's The Rogue Prince of Persia, which today launches its first major early access update, Temple of Fire - introducing the titular Temple of Fire biome, new mobs, and new weapons. We've already been impressed with Evil Empire's work on this one - Christian Donlan called The Rogue Price of Persia a "lovely game, lovely on the eye and lovely in the controls" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-definitely-still-room-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia">his preview</a> - so it'll be exciting to see how it evolves. And yes, at this rate, it'll probably have reached version 1.0 before we see Ubisoft's remade Sands of Time.

            <p>It’s been five years since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anno-1800">Anno 1800</a>, but we’ve finally seen what’s next for Ubisoft’s history-hopping city-building series. Anno 117: Pax Romana will be the earliest period for the franchise yet, travelling back to the time of a peaceful Ancient Rome. After the biggest gap between Anno games yet, we at least won’t have to wait too long for the newly revealed entry: it’s out next year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anno 117 was revealed on-stage by developers Ubisoft Mainz - one third of series devs Ubisoft Blue Byte - during tonight’s Ubisoft Forward showcase. There was a fairly charming live-action skit about a guy spouting Roman scripture to an empty field of sheep, to make up for the fact we didn’t see any gameplay.</p>
<p>We did at least get some details, including the note that for the first time in the long-running series you’ll be able to choose between different starting provinces: choosing to rule over either the Roman empire of Latium or the Celtic Britain of Albion, looking to spread the cultural influence of either the Romans or the Celts accordingly.</p>

<p>That’s about all we know for now, with the rest sounding very much true to the Annoe we know - you’ll be seeking a successful civilisation through economic and cultural heft, rather than straight-up military campaigning, which will involve overseeing everything from hosting colosseum battles (including the naval battles ones where they turn the arena into a giant pool) to building aqueducts. While the earlier era means Pax Romana drops a digit from the Anno title years of old, keen-eyed fans will note that the individual digits still add up to the series’ hallmark total of 9.</p>
<p>Anno 117 will be released in 2025, and will be part of Ubisoft’s Ubisoft+ Premium subscription offering as well as by itself. We’ll find out more during a dedicated livestream on June 18th.</p>

        <p>It was originally announced back in 2020</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Ubisoft’s remake of time-rewinding Prince of Persia classic The Sands of Time has finally reappeared to tease - with the emphasis on tease - a release not this year, not next year, but in 2026.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">The Sands of Time remake</a>, you might recall, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-announced">originally announced way back in 2020</a>. A do-over of the 2003 3D entry in the long-running platforming series, it was confirmed to be bringing back the Prince’s OG actor for a fresh recording while showing off a slightly more realistic visual style.</p>
<p>At the time, Ubisoft said to expect the Sands of Time remake in 2021. That <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-to-2022">then slipped to 2022</a>, before slipping into “indefinite delay” territory - with pre-orders being refunded, despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-isnt-cancelled-but-pre-orders-have-been-refunded">Ubisoft’s insistence the game was still in the works</a> - as original Sands of Time developers Ubisoft Montreal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-development-jumps-to-ubisoft-montreal">took over development</a> from their Indian colleagues in Pune and Mumbai.</p>
<p>Even three years after its original reveal - and two years after it had originally been schedule to come out - The Sands of Time remake was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-is-now-in-the-early-stage-of-development">still said to be in an “early stage” of “conception”</a> according to producer Jean-Francois Naud. Not exactly reassuring news.</p>

<p>Over a year on from that last update - and coming up on four years since it was first unveiled, for those keeping count - Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time reappeared, to describe its flitting tease generously, during tonight’s Ubisoft Forward showcase.</p>
<p>We didn’t see any gameplay, only a plume of smoke winding backwards to a candle in a holder in front of a blurry window with buildings visible in the distance. All that we got otherwise was a year: 2026. So, two years away. Which will put the release date of The Sands of Time remake - if it does indeed finally come out, rather than sliding into the void occupied by Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 - around six years on from its original announcement.</p>
<p>Still, an actual release is theoretically better than nothing, right? See you in two years to find out if the long wait has been worth it.</p>

            <p>It's a good thing I'm a big fan of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>, because it's only that underyling fandom that's making me write this post about the upcoming story DLC. The tease during this evening's Ubisoft Forward did nothing for me, other than confirm a name, Mask Of Darkness, and a release window in September.

<p>The rest of the information in the trailer above focused on streamers reacting to the base game, and on free updates with additions that have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-adds-boss-rush-mode-extra-fast-travel-and-an-outfit-from-the-2008-reboot-if-you-can-unlock-it">already been released</a> or that we already knew were coming. They're not insubstantial, they're just not news.
</p>
<p>But I <em>do</em> really like The Lost Crown, which is probably my favourite game of 2024 so far. It's a great Prince Of Persia game, but also a great metroidvania in general, with tricky combat, a moveset that develops slowly over the course of the game, and some great puzzles and platforming challenges. If you don't believe me, read Katharine's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review">Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown review</a> for more.
</p>
<p>I'm glad that more of the game is on the way, and not just extra challenges that require a level of skill I don't possess, but proper story DLC. I just wish they'd shown more of it. As not-E3 crimes go, leaving me wanting more isn't the worst - although Ubisoft were guilty of the same thing when it came to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-resurfaces-after-years-of-silence-to-tease-a-release-in-2026">re-announcing the Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time reboot</a>.

			<p>During Ubisoft Forward, Ubisoft shared the release date for the first Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora story DLC, which will be released on July 16 on all platforms. The Sky Breaker Story Pack is included with the game's Gold Edition, but can also purchased separately for owners of the Standard Edition.</p>
<p><em>A mysterious shadow looms in the sky, threatening the Na’vi clans below who are celebrating at their great festival of games. Face the RDA and protect the unity of the clans in Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora first Story Pack.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - The Sky Breaker Story Pack Trailer | Ubisoft Forward" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AWq6m8rQMHw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora launched in December 2023. Developed by Ubisoft Massive, it earned a 7.5/10 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> penned by Nathan Birch:</p>
<p><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora pulls you in with its dazzling world, then pushes you away its frustrating combat. After a play session I 80 percent enjoyed, I’d leave with a sour taste in my mouth after repeatedly banging my head against some maddening RDA outpost. If you can handle this push and pull, there is plenty to enjoy here. Frontier of Pandora’s main campaign will take you around 20 hours, more if you’re easily distracted, and 100 percenting the game is at least a 40-hour effort. Whether you’ll actually want to explore until your face is blue is up to you.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-outlaws-preview-finally-a-galaxy-full-of-scum-and-villainy.897315/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/star-wars-outlaws-preview-finally-lets-us-see-galaxy-of-scum-and-villainy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the least explored in visual media, yet most yearned for among many <em>Star Wars</em> fans, is a story focused on those with no connection to the force, jedi, or lightsabers. Star Wars Outlaws is poised to perfectly satisfy that craving.</p>
<p>Set between <em>Empire Strikes Back</em> and <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, you take on the role of Kay Vess, a scoundrel looking to swindle her way to a new life. The criminal underworld is a complex one that Kay can take advantage of, pitting rival gangs against one another.</p>
<p>During my time with the game, a little over an hour, I got to play three different sessions. In one I escaped an Empire base, another I scavenged some rare materials from an old ship long ago crashed, and the last I infiltrated a gang's base to steal a valuable artifact.</p>

<p>My time on the Empire base was short, but I did get to see the simple hacking and lockpicking mechanics on display. I imagine it gets more complex, but the hacking I saw was to take 8 different symbols and correctly input three in order. You get some hints, like if it is one in the sequence or it is in the correct spot -- <em>Wordle </em>like you might say.</p>
<p>Lockpicking is certainly more interesting and rhythm-based. A light and tone will flash to a beat that you then have to match. It's simple but oh-so-satisfying, particularly when the lockpicking was a little more complex.</p>
<p>Once I hacked the mainframe to order an evacuation, making all the stormtroopers run out of the hangar with my ship in it, it was time to escape. Of course, there were still some enemies in the way.</p>

<h2>Outlaws Gunplay is Deliberate and Strategic</h2>
<p><em>Outlaws </em>is a third-person shooter with some light melee to get you out of a tight spot. Punching a stormtrooper in the face is indeed satisfying. Think <em>Uncharted</em>'s melee here.</p>
<p>The gunplay is strategic and more deliberate - <em>Outlaws </em>certainly isn't about running and gunning. Your regular plasma shots are good against the normal fodder, but you'll want to switch to ion shots to take out shields and droids. Then you can stun folks to instantly take them out, albeit with a cooldown.</p>
<p>Kay's trusty blaster doesn't have ammo, but you have a certain amount of shots before it overheats. If you time it right, you can get an instant reload, but in the thick of battle it's not an easy thing to consistently do.</p>
<p>Enemies can take a bit of a hit, so making sure your shots count is key. Getting stuck in a long reload with a bunch of stormtroopers bearing down is exactly where I found myself in the demo, and it made things way more stressful.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other tools like grenades and dropped enemy weapons you can use as well. Those are sparse, so using them wisely is a good idea as well.</p>

<p>There's no doubt you can get by with just the blaster running from cover to cover, popping out to pick off people one by one, but these stormtroopers are a little more accurate than their movie brethren, so that may not work for long.</p>
<p>Eventually I was able to get on my ship and escape into space. However, some pesky TIE Fighters had the audacity to try to stop me.</p>
<p>The dogfighting I did get to experience was brief, though it was satisfying and intuitive. It's certainly not quite as complex as <em>Star Wars Squadrons</em>, but Kay's ship is equipped with a few kinds of weapons and abilities to get out of a scrap.</p>
<p>What I experienced was pretty simple lock on targeting, where you had to keep aimed in a certain reticle to hit your enemy. Standard stuff.</p>
<p>Escaping the base introduced me to the wanted system, similar to that in the<em> Grand Theft Auto </em>series. The higher the wanted level, the more you have angered the Empire and they can send some pretty hefty assets to try to kill you.</p>
<p>Once I dispatched the TIE Fighters, I was able to go to a beacon that cleared my wanted level -- essentially clearing the tracking the Empire had on me.</p>
<p>After escaping, I was able to fly towards a planet -- Toshara Moon, a new location to <em>Star Wars</em> lore -- and check out the landing sequence. It is not<em> No Man's Sky</em> in that you'll just fly into a planet. Once you get close enough to one, you'll be prompted with a menu of where to land. That then starts a cutscene to that landing location.</p>
<p>I landed in Mirogana to see a bustling city full of people milling about. Unfortunately I did not have the time or ability in the demo to explore too much, but it was obviously fairly sprawling and I can't wait to see more of it. That session ended promptly afterward.</p>
<h2>Outlaws Exploration is Very Uncharted-like</h2>
<p>The next slice of gameplay took place in a crashed ship that had been there a while. I was there to scavenge something from the trip, so I spent my time climbing, parkouring, and figuring out how to get past jammed doors and the like.</p>
<p>This is where <em>Outlaws </em>will feel the most familiar. Pretty much any big budget third-person action game has the exact same exploration mechanics in its climbing and jumping around. Kay can rappel down and swing across gaps, but that's nothing new.</p>

<p>I couldn't help but think of comparing it to the <em>Star Wars Jedi</em> series, which features similar parkour and movement but has the added elements of force powers to make it more interesting. Plus wallrunning.</p>
<p>Kay could use her blaster's ion shot to power up some generators briefly, but that's pretty standard fare as well.</p>
<p>Obviously, what I saw and experienced was not exhaustive, so there's a good chance Kay will have some more tools and abilities at her disposal in the full game.</p>

<p>The final mission took place on the planet Kijimi, which you may remember from <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>. Its frigid mountains became a haven for all kinds of criminals, making it the perfect place for Kay to find some opportunities.</p>
<p>Essentially, Kay is on Kijimi to break into one of the big gang's strongholds and steal an ancient relic from one gang to then give to another gang.</p>
<p>Lurking around every corner of <em>Outlaws </em>are the various gangs in power. Kay's reputation with one or another will affect how people react to her and will of course change how those factions treat her.</p>
<p>Keeping a balance, or not if you choose to really hate one of the gangs, is an ever-present part of the decision making in <em>Outlaws</em>.</p>

<p>While going in to steal that relic, Kay's partner, ND-5, reminds her that she should probably be as quiet as possible and try to go unnoticed as she was stealing from the Crimson Dawn, a faction she had a good relationship with. If nobody is the wiser, then it's a win-win.</p>
<p>Stealth in <em>Outlaws</em> has quite a few options, mostly due to Kay's trusty sidekick and pet Nix. When skulking about, Nix can distract enemies, sabotage items to explode, and even crawl up stormtroopers to detonate the grenades on their belts.</p>
<p>With artifact in hand, I hit the streets of Kjimi. Just as before, I didn't get to explore much, but I did get to take a long guided pathway to the destination of my quest. There was obviously a lot to explore, it was just not open to me in the demo.</p>
<p>Kijimi featured a huge city with a ton of people. While running through it, there were points of interest galore. A haven for criminals that we can run around in is the best look we have had yet in the world of scum and villainy in <em>Star Wars</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Star Wars Outlaws Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>That aspect is what I am personally the most excited for in <em>Outlaws</em>. What helped set <em>Star Wars </em>apart from the beginning was how so much of the universe is run-down, used, and worn. Dirt, grime, and rust cover the daily objects people use.</p>
<p><em>Outlaws </em>is the first time we really get to dig in with what they day-to-day people in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe deal with. Jedi stories are often just too high level and take players to ruins or sterile environments, like Empire bases, or empty ancient ruins.</p>
<p><em>Star Wars </em>is a rich universe that is now spending some serious time beyond the Jedi, like with <em>The Mandalorian</em> and <em>Andor</em>. <em>Outlaws </em>joins those ranks to further expand the different unique lifepaths that make <em>Star Wars</em> so interesting.</p>
<p>We've had many games where we could be a Luke Skywalker stand-in, now we've all got a chance to shoot first as our own Han Solo.</p>

<p id="3rREGY">When you ask him to <strong>“give me the necklace,”</strong> he’ll offer to sell it to you for 1,000 runes. Buy <strong>Rya’s Necklace </strong>from him (despite the insults). While you’re here, speak with Boggart again and buy a <strong>boiled prawn</strong> from him — that will make him friendly to you and you can summon him in a later fight.</p>
<p id="bTdnq3">Return the necklace to Rya in here pavilion. She’ll finally introduce herself and invite you to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23013379/questline-boss-invitation-locked-door-npcs-hidden-wall-secret-wall-stonesword-key-room">Volcano Manor</a> with the unsurprisingly named <strong>Volcano Manor Invitation</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="6WciTP"><strong>How to reach Volcano Manor with Rya</strong></h3>
<p id="epTxqP">Rya’s next location depends on how you get to the Altus Plateau:</p>
<ul>
<li id="qzb8TB">If you found both halves of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24173497/dectus-medallion-left-right-locations-how-to-use-join">Dectus Medallion</a><strong> </strong>— one from <strong>Fort Haight</strong> in southeast Limgrave and the other in Dragonbarrow at <strong>Fort Farroth</strong> — Rya will be waiting for you at the top of the <strong>Grand Lift of Dectus</strong>.</li>
<li id="EudQC8">If you traveled through the <strong>Ruin-Strewn Precipice </strong>to reach the plateau, you’ll find her at <strong>Lux Ruins </strong>right next to the <strong>Erdtree-Gazing Hill Site of Grace</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p id="MlLHZZ">Meeting her in either of these places will let her teleport you straight to Volcano Manor.</p>
<p id="IkffOH">However, if you traveled straight into the Royal Capital through the <strong>Deeproot Depths</strong> as part of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23001617/fia-questline-quest-hug-ending-dagger-location-hold-you">Fia’s questline</a>, she won’t show up in either place.

<p id="zx7bCT">From the Altus Plateau and the <strong>Altus Highway Junction Site of Grace</strong>, head to the northeast and the <strong>Forest Spanning Greatbridge Site of Grace</strong>. There, you’ll find a portal that will take you to the north. Head southwest, through the <strong>Witherblood Ruins</strong> and across to the <strong>Bridge of Iniquity Site of Grace</strong>. From there, continue west and watch the cliffs on your left for a tall ladder that leads to the <strong>First Mt. Gelmir Campfire Site of Grace</strong>.</p>
<p id="hnsHvP">Keep heading generally west to cross some stone bridges and climb several more ladders. You’ll eventually come to a fight against a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23013639/full-grown-fallingstar-beast-weakness-level-drops-reward-how-to-beat-melee">Full-Grown Fallingstar Beast</a> (you can just run away). From that crater, you can jump off to the west and wind your way down to the front door of the Volcano Manor.</p>
<h3 id="ldQjMa"><strong>How to reach Volcano Manor from the Academy of Raya Lucaria</strong></h3>
<p id="9DwUKr">Alternately, way back when you met <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23033809/patches-questline-location-chest-cave-volcano-manor-where-is">Patches</a> in Liurnia, he told you about an Abductor Virgin in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22971221/academy-of-raya-lucaria-map-tips-tricks-hidden-path-illusory-wall-strategy-red-wolf-radagon-rennala">Raya Lucaria</a> that can teleport you to “the base of the Erdtree” — he was, of course, lying. It actually takes you to Volcano Manor. Kind of.</p>
<p id="qeewRD">Head to the <strong>Schoolhouse Classroom Site of Grace</strong> and ride the elevator outside all the way to the bottom. Let Abductor Virgin there grab you (and kill you), and you’ll wake up in the basement of Volcano Manor. After a lot of exploring a lava-filled area and a fight against a pair of powerful Abductor Virgins, you’ll find an exit that will lead you to the <strong>Seethewater Site of Grace</strong> in Mt. Gelmir.</p>
<p id="LZeKCv">From there, you’ll have to loop counterclockwise around the huge lava lake, past <strong>Fort Laiedd</strong> and the <strong>Hermit’s Shack</strong>, and then through the <strong>Craftsman’s Shack</strong> and <strong>Hermit Village</strong>. After you deal with (or sprint past) <strong>Demi-Human Queen Maggie</strong>, you can cross the narrow stone pillar to reach <strong>Gelmir Hero’s Grave</strong>. Keep heading north, and you’ll meet up with the other overland route just before the part with all the ladders.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24175099/star-wars-outlaws-preview-impressions-stealth-gameplay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="NArwqy">As I walked down the stairs of the Belasco Theater in Los Angeles, the location of Ubisoft’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24124341/star-wars-outlaws-story-trailer-release-date"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a> demo event at Summer Game Fest 2024, my accompanying PR person asked me the question I’m sure she asked every reporter who walked down those stairs with her: “Do you like Star Wars?” A simple question, and yet a weirdly hard one for me personally to answer in 2024. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23473565/andor-season-1-review"><em>Andor</em></a> was a revelation, yet I still taste the ash of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/12/18/21024586/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-review-spoiler-free"><em>The Rise of Skywalker</em></a> in my mouth. And so, when I answered “yes,” I forced my brain backward into remembering why I had ever liked Star Wars in the first place.</p>

<p id="UWCBRl">As a child, the Harrison Ford fantasy-adventure movies that played over and over in my household were <em>not</em> Star Wars; they were Indiana Jones. For that reason, when my 12-year-old self finally saw Star Wars — previously ignored in the Myers family household — I was flabbergasted. I already thought I had seen the coolest possible Harrison Ford character, and yet here was Han Solo, who was <em>so</em> much cooler that he destroyed my entire barometer for coolness. All future “cool” characters would hereby be measured against him.</p>
<p id="pMtv3J">As I told this polite, probably bored PR person that story, I realized I was summarizing how difficult of a situation <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> actually faces. Imitating Han Solo’s coolness is no small feat, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/15/17353438/solo-a-star-wars-story-review-alden-ehrenreich"><em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em></a> unfortunately showed how difficult it is for somebody who isn’t Harrison Ford to pull off anything close to his alchemical coolness formula. At this point, the whole idea of an open-world Star Wars game in which you play as a Han Solo type is the pipe dream that dorks like me have been claiming they want for years (and it even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Ragtag">almost happened</a> once). That means the stakes are even higher — and the couple of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24124341/star-wars-outlaws-story-trailer-release-date">trailers</a> we’ve seen for the game have made it look <em>fine</em>, but not great.</p>
<p id="6FACL4">Now that I’ve played three 30-minute chunks of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, I have some hope that developer Massive Entertainment can actually pull this off.</p>

<p id="bp0R7A">When the demo loaded up, the introductory screen promised me “scoundrel gameplay,” a hilarious phrase that admittedly got me into the right mindset. The first sequence started in an Imperial base, where heroine Kay Vess and her tiny little alien friend Nix are sneaking around. Nix serves a similar gameplay function to the droid companion BD-1 in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23696594/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-release-date-ps5-xbox">Star Wars Jedi</a> games, but has the same lax moral code and ride-or-die BFF sensibilities as Chewbacca.</p>
<p id="ReQnmS">A little blue circular indicator would appear on screen any time I could call on Nix for help, either to distract an enemy or to pick up a valuable item for me. From moment one of seeing Nix fling his tiny body at a stormtrooper’s face, I fell in love with my badass little buddy. I then took advantage of almost every moment that I possibly could to call upon Nix, since it was a lot cuter to watch him scamper around picking up items for me than to walk over and do it myself. Nix is not exactly a powerhouse in combat given his size, of course, but he can certainly throw off bad guys and grab health packs.</p>
<p id="GG4v5B">It’s possible I could have snuck my way past this first section, but I’m about as good at that as Han Solo would be (“I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around,” as he says). So by the time I reached the station’s docking bay, I had triggered a shootout with Imperial forces. Once my own starship arrived to bail me out, I ran right past the laser fire onto it and flew out of there with the Empire on my heels. Then it was time for some dogfighting. I dispatched a couple of TIE fighters and flew over to a communications satellite, which I then hacked to clear my “wanted” status so that the Empire wouldn’t keep on chasing me around. Mission complete.</p>

<p id="lopGgd">The second 30-minute chunk appeared to take even more significant inspiration from the Star Wars Jedi games, which have their fair share of parkour-based environmental puzzles. Before that bit began, I did get to check out a more densely populated hub area where I could see question marks on the waypoint marker at the top of the screen and overhear conversations with NPCs that probably could have led to side quests. Once I got to the place Kay was told to go, I found an excuse for some parkour and platforming, as Kay took a cue from Nathan Drake (you know, the <em>other</em> character inspired by a Harrison Ford performance). </p>
<p id="0046Cs">People who hate seeing convenient yellow paint on various surfaces in order to be able to tell where your character can climb will not be fans of this aspect of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, but as somebody who gets lost in games constantly, I appreciated it. Kay doesn’t have Jedi powers like Cal Kestis, but she has definitely been to the same rock climbing gym or whatever. She also has a grappling hook, plus an electric setting on her sidearm that lets her power up elevators and other devices for puzzle-solving purposes. Almost this entire sequence was enemy-free platforming and exploring, climbing across various hazards to flip switches. It was fine; you’ve played something like this before in any number of third-person action games in the post-Uncharted landscape.</p>
<p id="ovTrZm">The third and final 30-minute segment of this demo was where I really got my scoundrel on. In this section, I was stealing an artifact — one that had apparently been previously stolen from some other faction, to whom Kay intended to return it. This sequence was far more clearly intended to be a straight-up stealth mission, and I stayed undercover for at least the first few minutes, creeping Samus-style through air shafts and doing silent takedowns of guards until one of them dropped a keycard I needed. Soon there weren’t as many enemies left, and I had noticed some conveniently placed explosive barrels, so I decided to go with a full Han Solo-style shootout (with Nix’s help, as usual). This was significantly louder and a lot more fun. After clearing out the room, I grabbed the artifact, then shot my way out of the rest of the building.</p>
<p id="LdUG1N">As she walked, Kay had a fun conversation over her communicator with one of her shipmates, a mysterious droid ally named ND-5. What I remember about the conversation was Kay being mocked for assuming that by returning this artifact, she wouldn’t be presumed to be the original thief herself. ND-5 told me I should be “terrified.” Kay responded with the equivalent of “<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fuck-it-we-ball">fuck it, we ball</a>.” I didn’t get to see how the rest of the scene played out, but I really liked the whole heist setup, and the banter was refreshingly snappy.</p>

<p id="JOHOM2">The best thing about the “Han Solo simulator” concept is that you’re playing as a Star Wars character who doesn’t have a lot of power — no Jedi powers, obviously, but also no significant social or structural power. The actual power fantasy here is being a cool person with high charisma, because that’s really all you’ve got. Well, also a grappling hook and weirdly good parkour skills, but you get where I’m going with this. It’s part of why <em>Andor</em> was an interesting slice of the Star Wars pie; it was about regular people, albeit regular people who became rebels rather than scumbags. It’s fascinating to see what the Star Wars universe looks like at ground level rather than from an epic space-opera vantage point — and that’s what an open-world Han Solo simulator could potentially achieve, provided it has some decent story beats and good one-liners along the way.</p>
<p id="OVzwlk">Based on what I played, whether you like this game will depend in part on whether you like the Uncharted and Star Wars Jedi games. And yet, those aren’t open-world games, and I didn’t get to see enough of the hubs or side quests to know if <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is going to be as sweeping and borderline overwhelming as some other Ubisoft open-world games have been (looking at you, <em>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em>).</p>
<p id="FYH81S">The biggest responsibility of all — being the Han Solo at the center of the simulator in question — rests on Kay’s shoulders. I’m now very curious to see if she can handle that challenge this Aug. 30 when <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is released for PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. </p>

<p>During today’s Ubisoft Forward showcase, Ubisoft revealed a brand-new look at Assassin’s Creed Shadows featuring an in-depth gameplay walkthrough.</p>



<p>You can watch the brand-new gameplay walkthrough below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Extended Gameplay Walkthrough | Ubisoft Forward" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FjAzNpMYTxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Most recently, Ubisoft surprised fans with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay-trailer/">a new trailer</a> for Assassin’s Creed Shadows during the Xbox Games Showcase.</p>



<p>The official game description reads, “In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you will live the intertwined stories of Naoe, an adept shinobi Assassin from Iga Province, and Yasuke, the powerful African samurai of historical legend. Against the backdrop of the turbulent late Sengoku period, this remarkable duo will discover their common destiny as they usher in a new era for Japan. From chaos to purpose, from darkness to light. A new Creed rises over Japan.”</p>



<p>Ubisoft continues to ramp up marketing for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Last month, Ubisoft revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-editions-preorders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all of the game editions</a>, and later an anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-collectors-edition-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collector’s Edition</a>.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Ubisoft also confirmed that Assassin’s Creed Shadows gameplay will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-require-a-mandatory-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not require a mandatory connection</a> at all times. Players will get to explore and enjoy their journey completely offline.</p>



<p>Following some datamined leaks, fans also got a potential glimpse at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season Pass and DLC prices</a>. The leaks imply that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is due to receive at least two post-launch expansions.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft's Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora The Sky Breaker DLC is coming July 16, Ubisoft revealed during its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ubisoft-forward-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5462/" data-ref-id="2900-5462">Ubisoft Forward press conference</a>, continuing the story of the open-world shooter set in the same universe as James Cameron's blockbuster film franchise.</p><p>Picking up after the game's main story, the Na'vi are celebrating their victory with an Olympic-like sports festival called The Great Games. The games, however, are interrupted when a massive ship crashes into the festivities, once again forcing the Na'vi to take action to defend their home again the RDA.</p><p>The Sky Breaker DLC will take players to a new location: The Heart of the Plains. They'll also encounter a new enemy type--the AMP Defender--a mech-suit equipped with a huge riot shield and gatling gun, as well as more well-equipped RDA lieutenants. Players will be able to take on various challenges as part of The Great Games' festivities. The DLC will also further extend the game's character progression, adding the ability to reach master crafter status and new Legendary-rarity items alongside new ways to spend skill points.</p><p>The DLC is included as part of the game's season pass. A second DLC, titled Secrets of the Spires, is slated to release later in 2024. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora launched in December 2023 to solid reviews.

data-ref-id="1100-6482030">Ubisoft announced its remake for The Sands of Time way back in 2020</a>. At the time, it dropped a trailer showing some updated graphics that were definitely a step up from the 2003 original, but were widely derided as still being extremely dated-looking and unimpressive. The Sands of Time is an all-time classic, and as cool as it'd be to get a remake, what Ubisoft showed didn't inspire a ton of confidence.</p><p>The Sands of Time remake subsequently sank into the background of Ubisoft's development slate. It was originally supposed to drop in 2021, but missed that date and then <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-changes-developers/1100-6503046/" data-ref-id="1100-6503046">changed developers</a>, with Ubisoft Montreal, the studio responsible for the original game, taking over from Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai.</p><p>Info about the remake has been pretty thin since 2022, with Ubisoft basically saying little more than, essentially, it still exists and please stop asking about it. Back in 2023, producer Jean-Francois Naud and game director Michael McIntyre said the game was still early in development and in "conceptual stages."</p><p>The new reveal image doesn't give much in the way of details, showing only a candle with the icon of the Dagger of Time on it and the setting of the ancient city behind it. A lighting change in the image suggests the passage of time, but that's about all we get. The upside, if there is one, is that waiting until 2026 will at least hopefully help guarantee that The Sands of Time remake lives up to the legacy of the original.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the tease for Mask of Darkness was quite short, showing just quick look and an image revealing the September release window.

Basically, Ubisoft confirmed the game is still in development, but it won't be releasing until 2026.</p>

<p>The game has hit some development difficulties over to course of its creation. When announced, Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai were said to be developing the game, but in 2022 it was shared that development duties would be handed over to Ubisoft Montreal. It seems at that time development was effectively fully reset because it will be some time before release.</p>

<p data-characters="229" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">During the Ubisoft Forward Stream, the company has again assured us that their remake of <em>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time</em> <a href="https://youtu.be/fdhrdKu1SCA?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still exists</a>.

		<p>Marking 35th anniversary of the Prince of Persia franchise, Ubisoft gave a very, very, very brief teaser of what they’re calling a love letter to one of the series’ most “timeless” games. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake is now set for release in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Prince of Persia The Sands of Time - Teaser Trailer | Ubisoft Forward" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fdhrdKu1SCA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A Sands of Time remake was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/10/trailer-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-ps4-xb1-pc-reveal/">first announced back in 2020</a>, with Ubsioft entrusting Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai to spruce up the classic adventure for modern consoles and audiences. However, development dragged on with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/12/10/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-until-march-2021/">several</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/05/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-delay-ps4-xbox-one-pc/">delays</a>, until Ubisoft leadership decided that it needed a whole new direction and put the game in the hands of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/03/ubisoft-montreal-takes-over-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-development/">Ubisoft Montreal</a>.</p>
<p>It’s quite likely that development was almost completely rebooted at that point in 2022, and now, around two years later, Ubisoft is comfortable with sharing a fresh release target of 2026. Let’s see if they can hit that target.</p>

		<p>Ubisoft had a slick trailer to show off what’s new and coming to their budding free-to-play shooter XDefiant on 2nd July. There’s a new character faction, new weapons, maps, modes rewards and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="XDefiant: Season One Reveal | Ubisoft Forward" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5IB4Lur9YjM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>GSK from Team Rainbow is joining XDefiant as a new player faction for Season 1, bringing tactical urban assault gear to the mix of factions already in the game.</p>
<p>Alongside that there’s a new mode, the FPS staple Capture The Flag, three free new weapons to try out, and there will be a new map each month of the season – Clubhouse, Daytona, and Rockefeller. Season 1 will also introduce a ranked progression system for ardent players to work through.</p>
<p>That’s not all that will be included in the first season of content, and Ubisoft will be giving a full reveal on 1st July, just hours ahead of its launch.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/01/is-xdefiant-a-cod-killer/">Is XDefiant a “COD Killer”?</a></h2>
<p>Having gone hands on with the game at launch, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/01/is-xdefiant-a-cod-killer/">here’s what we had to say</a> of the COD challenger:</p>
<p>“Exactly how much stopping power XDefiant gains will depend largely on its future roadmap. Thankfully, Ubisoft is no stranger when it comes to running a successful live service, with Rainbow Six Siege making a dramatic turnaround in its first year to become one of the biggest FPS games of all time. XDefiant fans are seemingly in good hands, then, and Ubisoft will need to keep its momentum if it wants to ward off 2024’s upcoming class of shooters from this year’s Black Ops 6 to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>&nbsp;and Sony’s&nbsp;<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>.”</p>

		<p>Star Wars Outlaws has got an extended gameplay during Ubisoft Forward. The footage starts with Kay Vess playing an arcade game, showing one of the minigames you will be able to play. The footage then quickly moves to Elusive Experts, people that are scattered across the galaxy that can teach you new skills.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars Outlaws: Official Gameplay Showcase | Ubisoft Forward" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QP_wXv2ErgI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Soon, after Kay takes off into space and quickly gets embroiled in a space fight against some pirates that are attempting to take down a Pyke freighter. This optional event has allowed Kay’s reputation with the Pykes to improve, as well as earn some credits. From this fight, Kay moves to Tatooine, the heart of Hutt territory. Mos Eisley has a lot of opportunities to make credits and make a name for yourself, including working for the Hutts and some gambling. There is a large presence of Imperial troops, so you will need to be aware of them. As your reputation and wanted level increases, the Empire will send ever increasing enemies after you. This will start with basic Stormtroopers, to TIE Fighters flying in, and Death Troopers being sent after Kay.</p>
<p>Kay leaves Mos Eisley to go to a storehouse out in the wilds to find one of the experts. The storehouse is heavily protected, but a scanner allows you to pick out enemies and plan a route in. Kay’s companion Nix can be used to attack enemies and scout out areas to see if there are more enemies around. During this mission, an alert does come up saying that the Hutt reputation is going down due to trespassing in their storehouse. Kay and Nix are soon found and a blaster battle ensues. The combat looks simple enough, with Kay able to switch firing modes while moving. She makes her escape on a small speeder to find her target. One of the blaster skills that Kay can learn is to mark multiple enemies, and fire at each one quickly.</p>

<p>Star Wars Outlaws will be released on August 30th for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

			<p>During today's Ubisoft Forward event, the French publisher released a short teaser for the upcoming Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake.</p>
<p>As part of the franchise's 35th anniversary, Ubisoft Montpellier's Brand Director, Gwenn Berhault, briefly mentioned the highly-anticipated remake of the 2003 title with a 30-second-long teaser trailer showing a burning candle as well as the game's planned release year - 2026. We've included that teaser trailer below, but please keep your expectations in check:</p>
<p><iframe title="Prince of Persia The Sands of Time - Teaser Trailer | Ubisoft Forward" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fdhrdKu1SCA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Officially announced back in 2020, the game's development is said to have been completely rebooted over the last four years. As covered back in April of this year, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake will offer a complete graphical overhaul alongside overhauled combat, animations, and much more</a>. Earlier this month it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-dev-team-adds-ubisoft-toronto-far-cry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that Ubisoft's Far Cry studio - Ubisoft Toronto - will be aiding in the development of the game. "<em>Ubisoft Toronto is joining the development of the remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time", t</em>he official Ubisoft Toronto X account posted last week<em>. "We’re excited to rewind time and bring our studio’s creativity, expertise and updated tech to refresh this beloved classic with our partners at Ubisoft Montreal.”</em></p>
<p>No platforms have been mentioned in the trailer, but you can expect this remake to be released on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and possibly Nintendo's Switch successor as well.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, the upcoming open-world action-adventure from Massive Entertainment set in a Galaxy Far, Far Away, is slated to be the biggest game of the summer, and today during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ubisoft-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft Forward</a> showcase, we got a fresh look at the game in action. The new gameplay footage mostly focuses on the game’s expansive world and the activities you’ll encounter there, including a visit to Tatooine and Mos Eisley, including the infamous cantina.</p>
<p>Interestingly, unlike your typical open-world game, it seems you don’t improve your skills in Star Wars Outlaws by gaining XP, but rather, by tracking down “experts” who can teach you new skills. In the footage we Kay Vess a gunslinger who will improve her shooting skills. On the way, we see Kay seamlessly take to space, engage in a quick dogfight, explore Mos Eisley and Tatooine, and engage in a stealth mission at a Hutt cartel base. You can check out the new Star Wars Outlaws footage for yourself, below.</p>

			<p>Microsoft and Bethesda <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-drops-new-content-creations-mod-kit-and-shattered-space-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped the highly-anticipated Starfield Creation Kit yesterday</a>, and Xbox players will be happy with the mod limit on their console.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldNews/status/1799919872505467077" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by @StarfieldNews on X, Xbox players won't have to worry about mod space as Bethesda has allocated 100GB for mods - that's a massive upgrade over the 2GB within Fallout 4. For reference, Skyrim players on Xbox could use 5GB for mods. It will be interesting to see what the Starfield modding community will do with the Creation Kit now being available on PC and Xbox.</p>
<p>As covered last year, the official Creation Kit for Bethesda's sci-fi action RPG allows players to create their own planets, stories, and much more. Here's what Bethesda's former marketing head, Pete Hines, said about Starfield's Creation Kit last year:</p>
<p><em>“We're doing it, we said we are. There's going to be mods, we're going to release the Creation Kit. If you've played Elder Scrolls or Fallout, it's going to work like that. It's post-launch, we have no other information. We have a launch to get through. It's coming.</em></p>
<p><em>I get excited about this game because I love it so much, and I love what we've made and what the team made, but... there's a lot more coming. And when you start to think about the kind of communities that come around Bethesda Game Studios games, and putting a tool like [the Creation Kit] in the hands of people to go... "How'd you like to make a planet?" All of that is just going to be off the charts when you start getting the community to come in and add all the different things they want to bring to it. Their own stories they want to tell, whatever it is. Hell, I have a list of things I already want to mod.”</em></p>
<p>What are your thoughts about this massive mod size limit on Xbox? Hit the comments below.</p>

<p>When it first launched, Skull and Bones felt shallow. But it appears Ubisoft is working tirelessly to fill its pirate adventure with a sea full of content. With the upcoming seasons, we’ll see brand-new game modes, ship upgrades, a fleet management tool, a unique ship type, and a flying dragon world boss to tackle! It might be a good time to return to Skull and Bones!</p>



<hr>



<p>As part of Ubisoft Forward, we were treated to a glimpse at the upcoming content in Skull and Bones. Most notably, how seasons will work moving forward. There’s a lot of content to tackle this summer, such as festive events, solo and PvE game modes, and, most notably, Season 3. Skull and Bones Season 3 features The Dragon’s Claw—an Asian-inspired faction with unique ships, stories, and rewards—and the Flying Dragon sea monster!</p>

</p></figure>



<p>But if that’s not enough for you. They also teased a 5v5 PvP game mode that promises to be a key part of the entire season. In my experience with Skull and Bones, the PvP felt lackluster, and most players stuck to PvE, so hopefully, they wind up rectifying that issue!</p>

<p>As already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported by Insider Gaming</a>, Prince of Persia Sands of Time Remake has essentially been remade, again. You can watch the new trailer of the game below:</p>



<p>Per our original report and sources, one of the most noticeable changes for long-time Prince of Persia fans is that Yuri Lowenthal, the voice behind The Prince in the original, will no longer be reprising his role. Earlier this month, Ubisoft confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-toronto-joins-development-on-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Toronto will also be joining the game’s development</a>.</p>
