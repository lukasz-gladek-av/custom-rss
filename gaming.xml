It makes sense considering this game is a spin-off of <em>Story of Seasons</em>; it’s a farming game at its core. That said, you likely won’t specialize in farming for every village, but I do recommend you prioritize crops in Spring Village and Autumn Village. They both offer abundant space and the ideal climates for crop growth.</p><p>In Autumn Village, the sprawling development zone just down the hill from the shrine is large enough for a few shops, houses, and rows upon rows of crops. In Spring Village, there are multiple development zones, two of which are quite large, with enough room for tilled fields in all three.</p><p><strong>When planting crops, prioritize those with the highest return in the least amount of time.</strong> Anything over 30 gold per crop is a sound strategy, so long as they don’t take too long to mature. Some crops to prioritize include:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Rice</li><li>Corn</li><li>Pink Melon</li><li>Strawberry</li><li>Mandarin</li><li>Carrots</li><li>Golden Anything (Cabbage, Potatoes, Pumpkins, Turnips, etc.)</li></ul><h2 id="h570244"><a id=""></a>Herding bees</h2><figure id="" data-id="6874d2101cfa9887c858af4b05db9219" data-recommend-id="image://6874d2101cfa9887c858af4b05db9219" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A small barn for herding in Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A small barn for herding in Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvelous / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6874d2101cfa9887c858af4b05db9219" data-recommend-id="image://6874d2101cfa9887c858af4b05db9219" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A small barn for herding in Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As you finish up the first part of Autumn Village, you’ll unlock the Herding mechanic, which allows you to construct stables in your villages and then defeat and capture monsters out in the wild. Most of these monsters will drop usable goods in the stable once you assign someone to manage the herd, and then you may sell said items.</p><p>Not all monsters are equal, though. <strong>If you want to optimize the mechanic for money-making potential, then opt for bee monsters. </strong>They’ll produce high-quality honey that sells for large sums, making you a thousandaire daily!</p><h2 id="h570245"><a id=""></a>Completing requests on the board</h2><figure id="" data-id="ff52c4fdf3e97debb48c8999eabd71c2" data-recommend-id="image://ff52c4fdf3e97debb48c8999eabd71c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a variety of objectives." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a variety of objectives." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvelous / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ff52c4fdf3e97debb48c8999eabd71c2" data-recommend-id="image://ff52c4fdf3e97debb48c8999eabd71c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a variety of objectives." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Early on, you’ll unlock the request board. But it’s soon forgotten, as the main story pushes you in so many directions to save the gods and goddesses, restore the villages, and build relationships with men and women from around the land. When are you meant to help the villagers?</p><p>As it turns out, some of those requests pay quite well. Some offer gold, food, raw resources for crafting and construction, and even rare materials. A few pay really well, though. They’ll net you thousands of gold upon completion. The more challenging the task, the better the pay. </p><hr><p><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> is available now on Nintendo Switch and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/rune-factory-guardians-azuma-farm-gold-monsters-teeth-1851786408]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A few days ago, PlayStation's Insomniac team shared a social media post of Marvel's Spider-Man perched on an antenna making a peace sign with his right hand. "Hey, how are ya?" the post read, along with a couple of accompanying hashtags. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>Except, these days a post can't just be a post, and this little and fairly casual bit of engagement from Insomniac now has many replies calling for an Xbox port of Marvel's Spider-Man.</p>
<p>"So Spiderman 2018 coming to Xbox?" <a href="https://x.com/chaosprimeZ/status/1944745186312982790">reads one reply</a>. "Looks good wrapped in green," <a href="https://x.com/ThunderDomeGam1/status/1944785699749642574">another added</a>. "Xbox announcement," <a href="https://x.com/Stormzy010/status/1945082964183789785">reads a third</a>, and really I am only sharing a few examples.</p>

<p>Does this mean Spider-Man will make the swing to Xbox? After all, in 2018, when Insomniac's game was initially released, the <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/981334875188809728">studio did post a tweet to say it would "never" come to Microsoft's consoles</a>.</p>
<p>But that was several years ago now, and since then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-in-august-as-first-sony-published-game-on-the-platform">Sony has announced former PlayStation console exclusive Helldivers 2 will be available on Xbox</a> later this year (this is despite Arrowhead's community manager once saying it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/getting-helldivers-2-on-xbox-would-need-sony-and-phil-spencer-to-duke-it-out-arrowhead-community-lead-says">need "Sony and Phil [Spencer] to duke out" in order to get an Xbox port of the shooter off the ground</a>).</p>
<p>Then again, Insomniac has also shared a <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/1945272265630691375">more recent post</a> showing Kit from Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart giving us all a cheery thumbs up. Maybe the team is just wanting to share some love.</p>
<p>So, would you like to see Insomniac's Peter Parker don his Spidey ensemble and use his web-tastic skills to plop on over to Xbox consoles soon?</p> <div>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-remaining-thoughtful-about-how-and-if-it-brings-games-to-additional-platforms">Sony execs Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst said PlayStation will remain "thoughtful" with which of its games it brings to other platforms</a>.</p>
<p>The company is "continuously exploring new ways for players to interact with their franchises", Hulst said, before adding: "It's important to realise that we're really thoughtful about bringing our franchises off console to reach new audiences and that we're taking a very measured, a very deliberate approach in doing that.</p>
<p>"Particularly on the single-player side, our tentpole titles, they're such a point of differentiation for the PlayStation console. They are real showcases of the performance, of the quality of the hardware, so we want to ensure that players get the best experience from these titles."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/insomniac-shares-casual-spider-man-post-now-fans-want-an-xbox-port]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Full Circle and EA have shared the world map for their upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/skate">Skate</a> revival, diving into the city of San Vansterdam with the latest dev diary update.</p>
<p>The team are building up to playtests for those who signed up for Insider access, with anyone that RSVP’d before 27th June guaranteed to be invited at some point. Once you’re in the play ground, you’ll retain access through to the Early Access launch. Three weekly waves have already gone out with one more on the 22nd July. After that, they’ll keep adding people day-by-day until all RSVP’d players are invited.</p>


<p>Part of the latest testing update – they’re up to version 0.27, which people are already hand on with – is the reveal of San Vansterdam’s world map with four neighbourhoods to skate through in Hedgemont, Gullcrest,&nbsp; Market Mile, and Brickswich.</p>

<p>Hedgemont is where players will start off, getting introduced to challenges and missions in the skatepark under the bridge, along the waterfront and more. Once you’ve completed enough stuff, take the Skateway elevated path to Gullcrest Village. The centrepieces here are the House of the Rolling Reverence church which has been converted for skating, and there’s a car park right next door as well.&nbsp;Market Mile then has a bunch of tall buildings and elevated walkways to explore, and Brickswich bring a big sports stadium with the exterior surrounded by skate ramps and smooth lines.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At the beginning of the month, Naughty Dog and Neil Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/neil-druckmann-hbo-the-last-of-us-naughty-dog/">announced</a> that Druckmann would be stepping away from his role with HBO's The Last of Us, to put his full efforts back to his day job, being the studio head of Naughty Dog and working on their next project, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/hbo-casey-bloys-the-penguin-season-2-the-last-of-us-future-1236461127/">Variety</a>, HBO chairman and chief executive officer Casey Bloys spoke about what Druckmann's departure means for the show from their perspective, and for Bloys, Druckmann leaving the show doesn't seem to be a huge concern. </p>



<p><em>"Obviously it was great to have Neil involved in the beginning</em>," Bloys began. "<em>The whole reason that I wanted to do 'Last of Us' is after 'Chernobyl,' I said to Craig [Mazin], 'What do you want to do next?' And 'Last of Us' was what he wanted to do. That's what was most important to me, Craig's creative excitement about the show. It was fantastic to have Neil involved. A lot of people don't realize that Neil has a full time job creating video games and running Naughty Dog. It's a really big job that he's got. So I understand why he needs to focus on that. But I believe he's given us a good blueprint with the show. And obviously Craig is a pro, so I think we'll be in excellent shape. I'm not worried at all.</em>"</p>



<p>Bloys continued to say that season 3 of the show is slated to arrive in 2027, and whether there will be a fourth season is up to showrunner Craig Mazin. "<em>I'm following Craig's lead on that</em>," Bloys said.</p>



<p>Druckmann's departure might be cause for concern for some viewers, but it's not surprising that Bloys isn't outwardly concerned, especially since the show was just<a href="https://www.televisionacademy.com/files/assets/Downloads/77thnominations-list-v1.pdf"> nominated for 16 Emmy Awards</a>, bringing the series total up to 40 nominations between two seasons.</p>



<p>Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal both picked up Emmy nominations for lead actress and actor in a drama series, respectively. Kaitlyn Dever also picked up a nomination for outstanding guest actress in a drama series, while the overall show was nominated for outstanding drama.  Other notable nominations among the 16 include nominations for prosthetics and makeup, special effects, and Catherine O'Hara also getting a nomination for her guest role in the show. </p>



<p>Any major production is a team effort, and while Druckmann's involvement was clearly an important part of the show's first two seasons, it's not like it earned 40 Emmy nominations based on Druckmann's efforts alone. There's a whole team of people who are making this show, and it'll be interesting to see how Mazin continues the story, without Druckmann leaning over his shoulder and weighing in on the details as much as he might've been for the first two seasons.</p>



<p>And players can rejoice over the fact that, hopefully, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet will arrive on time in its current release window slated for 2026.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Typically, when a live-service game is shut down by its publisher, the assumption is the game failed to perform in some way--usually financially--and that its underwhelming performance resulted in its discontinuation. Star Wars Hunters--Zynga's multiplayer shooter set in the Star Wars universe--is being shut down in October, but despite a lower-than-anticipated attach rate, Zynga CEO Frank Gibeau says it was "no failure" at all.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/star-wars-hunters-was-no-failure" rel="nofollow ">The Game Business</a>, Gibeau said that the team at Zynga built a "great tech base" and a "fun game" with Hunters, but the game did not emerge as a "viable business." Specifically, Gibeau cites a lack of "organic installs from the license" as a contributing factor in its imminent discontinuation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533070-hunters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533070" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="750" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533070-hunters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533070"></a><figcaption>Star Wars Hunters</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533070-hunters.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We had some issues with how we could explore the intellectual property--could you play Darth Vader or could you not? That sort of thing," Gibeau said. "We ended up with a cross-platform game on Switch and mobile that ran perfectly. It was fun. But it didn't engage over the long term. And it wasn't a viable business."</p><p dir="ltr">Gibeau also says that ending Hunters will result in another "shot on goal" with another IP, only now with the knowledge and technical base. "The action shooter category on mobile is very large and growing, and we'd like to be there," Gibeau said. "Now we have an Unreal tech base, with some great leads in terms of the engineering, developers and designers…. Now it's taking the learnings from Star Wars Hunters and applying it to another shot on goal with another intellectual property."</p><p dir="ltr">Zynga first announced Star Wars Hunters during a Nintendo Direct presentation in February 2021. It finally launched in June 2024, only for Zynga to announce that the game would cease operations on October 1, 2025--with one final update pushed to all users on April 15. A PC port of the game was also canceled.</p><p dir="ltr">Star Wars Hunters is still available now for mobile devices and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Now with GameFlex Consultants, Wein stated that he and his team "were mightily proud" of Dead Island 2's reveal trailer--seen above. The video sees a jogger going for a run on the beachfront before turning into a zombie himself. About a month after the trailer's debut, Wein said that "we had a major milestone with the development studio that was in charge at that time. And boy, that game sucked."</p><p dir="ltr">At that time, Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager was working on Dead Island 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-loses-its-developer/1100-6428894/">before being removed in 2015</a>. Wein stated that the game back then "had nothing to do with what [made] the original Dead Island [...] really fun." Wein added that they received "horrific feedback" from a playtest, which the studio claimed it would address. But that didn't happen, according to Wein. This set off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-has-been-delayed-again/1100-6509232/">a chain of delays for Dead Island 2</a>, and ultimately the game went through another developer in Sumo Digital before Dambuster Studios delivered the final product.</p><p dir="ltr">"Sometimes you have to make hard decisions," Wein said. "Because we could have, at that point, put out a shit game. It might have made some money, but it would have killed the franchise."</p><p dir="ltr">In 2019, Koch Media made a similar <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2s-long-development-is-a-good-sign-pub/1100-6471576/">argument for Dead Island 2's long development being a good thing</a>. The sequel finally arrived in 2023 and sold over 3 million copies.

            <p>
Obsidian Entertainment has been quietly beavering away on its well-received fantasy action-RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, and the latest of the studio's toils are now available in its newly released 1.5 update, introducing Steam Deck verification, new class abilities, and more.
</p>
<p>
Starting with that Steam Deck verification, it's exactly what it sounds like - providing enough under-the-hood tweaks to tick off all of Valve's boxes. And there's also a new 40fps frame rate limit option that's presumably been added as a part of Obsidian's handheld finessing.
</p>
<p>
Arguably the most significant addition in 1.5, though, comes in the form of a Ranger and Fighter refresh, with both classes getting new abilities and passives on their skill trees. This, Obsidian says, should "round out the classes compared to the Wizard tree". The full list is pretty extensive, but Fighter upgrades include the powerful block-breaking Driving Kick and pulverising Barbaric Smash, while Rangers can deploy the sneaky Shadow Step, as well as Deadly Poison. The latter, as you might imagine, makes poison more deadly.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, 1.5 adds more unique gear across a number of regions, meaning you'll now find (among other things) a new unique two-handed hammer and wand in Dawnshore, and a new unique one-handed axe in Shatterscarp. "We found that players were not able to play specific builds that they wanted to early on in the game," explained Obsidian, and this is the solution.
</p>
<p>
Beyond all that, there are tweaks to enemies that introduce two new types of barriers they can use - one blocking melee attacks and the other blocking magic attacks. They can also now access a number of player abilities, including Clear Out, Blizzard, and Tanglefoot. If you're looking for more granular detail, however, you'll find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2457220/view/510711823303967381?l=english">full patch notes over on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
Avowed's 1.5 update - which is available now on all platforms - arrives as the second planned update in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avoweds-2025-roadmap-promises-new-game-plus-and-more-with-an-arachnophobia-mode-out-now">Obsidian's previously announced post-launch roadmap</a>. A third update, scheduled for this autumn, is set to include New Game Plus, a photo mode, a new weapon type, new character presets, and more.
</p>
<p>
"What Avowed lacks in gloss it makes up for with charm, depth and a playful heart," Eurogamer's Robert Purchese wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">four star Avowed review</a> earlier this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Destruction is the core focus of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>'s gameplay, but that all started as a goomba with giant arms.</p>
<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> platformer's release this week, Nintendo published an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-1/">interview with the development team</a> where they detailed the decision to have destructible environments at the game's core, built using voxel technology.</p>
<p>It turns out the programming team had been experimenting with destruction shortly after the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>. They were inspired by that game's Knucklotec boss who attacks Mario with giant hands.</p>

<p>As one of Bananza's game directors, Wataru Tanaka, explained, "The programmer who created [Knucklotec] tried attaching those arms to a Goomba as an experiment. The Goomba could smash terrain, tear off pieces to use as weapons, and throw them.</p>
<p>"Those actions felt surprisingly satisfying, and we got a sense that this destruction-based gameplay could be a compelling core mechanic."</p>
<p>Nintendo even <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/">shared a video of the goomba in action</a> as part of the interview. Below is a screenshot.</p>

</figure>
<p>As a result, the team's desire to define a new Donkey Kong aligned with the destruction-focused gameplay they were testing.</p>
<p>Indeed, Bonanza's producer Kenta Motokura noted how in a long-running series "novelty and continuity are both important" but the team wanted to "fully convey the appeal of Donkey Kong as a character".</p>
<p>As such, they wanted to split between 2D and 3D Donkey Kong games and bring the gorilla's "strengths and new actions to the forefront". The concept of destruction was seen as a good fit.</p>
<p>This also led to the use of voxel technology to create detailed destructible environments. However this proved difficult on the original Switch console with the detail the team aspired to, as this sort of technology uses a lot of system memory. Nintendo even shared comparison screenshots to show how differently the game looked across the two machines.</p>

</figure>
<p>"With the move to Switch 2, we gained not only more memory but also greater processing capacity," said Tanaka. "That gave us the freedom to incorporate gameplay ideas we'd previously abandoned because they were too demanding. When we got down to trying it, we discovered that not only could it handle the heavy processing requirements, but it also ran at 60 fps. Things we'd given up on, like explosions flinging large objects or causing them to collapse, were now possible. Designers could also place as many objects as they wanted. There were so many moments when we thought to ourselves, 'Now we can really do this.'"</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza will release on Switch 2 later this week. "A brilliant core mechanic and clever design twists make Bananza a delightfully sticky 3D platform adventure topped off with a sweet central character relationship," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Donkey Kong Bananza review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananzas-destruction-gameplay-all-started-as-a-goomba-with-giant-arms]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tech specs wreck'd</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>For those interested in how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> holds up on the Switch 2 in terms of its technical presentation, the chaps over at Digital Foundry have presented their latest analysis for your persual.</p>
<p>It's mostly positive stuff, with John Linneman praising the destructive nature of the environment, noting how it can grant access to new routes with the game still maintaining a pretty solid camera setup when underground.</p>
<p>The potential issues begin with pop-in, which is frequently present when moving forward in the world. It's then noted that shadow rendering is "extremely poor" and proves to be quite distracting during gameplay. Lighting is also considered to be pretty dated, and it's noted that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>'s Switch 2 update removed a lot of that title's visual issues, while Bananza seemingly takes us "right back to the same types of Switch-like compromises".</p>
<p>Resolution generally falls between 1080p and 1200p with dynamic resolution scaling. Some aliasing is mentioned with the environment, and it's thought that some areas can look a little "soft". In portable mode, though accurate testing doesn't seem possible, it's likely that the game is running at 1080p, so image quality is generally thought to be much better in handheld.</p>
<p>As for the frame rate, there is some slowdown during specific animations, like picking up a banana or on certain camera cuts. Unfortunately, however, it's apparent that performance drops down to 30fps during some boss battles and actually <em>stays there</em> for the duration. This is made even more noticeable with the choppy destruction animation.</p>
<p>Frame rate also drops to around 30fps during photo mode, which isn't entirely surprising, to be honest. Portable mode seems to be a bit better with VRR, but it's still not completely eliminated.</p>
<p>Overall, image quality and performance is described as "somewhat mixed". It doesn't seem to be quite so poor that it ruins the experience, necessarily, but it's something that we certainly hope to see addressed in updates later down the road.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In past <em>Donkey Kong</em> games, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/1/17301860/nintendo-switch-ports-wii-u-obsolete"><em>Tropical Freeze</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24343009/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review-nintendo-switch"><em>DKC Returns</em></a>, I would often find myself stuck against a particularly challenging platforming sequence. And there wasn’t much I could do. If I wanted to progress, I had to nail those jumps or avoid those spikes to move on. <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em>, on the other hand, offers a different tactic: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/703468/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-interview-switch-2">smash some shit up</a>. While the game is a 3D platformer, it also introduces destructive gameplay that lets you find new solutions or pathways just by smashing up the world around you. It perfectly suits the character, and also builds on a design trend Nintendo has steadily been pushing on for years now. In some way or another, all of its biggest franchises are opening up and becoming more exciting as a result.</p><p>The most obvious example of this is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>. Before it, the <em>Legend of Zelda</em> adventures were comparatively linear, pushing players along a preordained path. But <em>Breath of the Wild</em> featured a true open world, letting you explore in any direction you chose. Its sequel, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, took things a step further with underground areas and gameplay built around combining objects to build something new, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/22/23732888/tears-of-the-kingdom-builds-crafting-wildest">which players took in all sorts of creative directions</a>. Even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em></a>, which was a return to the top-down structure of classic <em>Zelda</em> games, introduced a mechanic that turned everyday objects into useful tools, creating all kinds of opportunities for creative problem solving.</p><p>A similar ethos was infused into many of the Switch’s biggest games. But instead of simply adding an open world, Nintendo opened these games up in a way that makes sense for each franchise. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a> let players both craft their own items and customize the island landscape around them, making their spaces feel more personal; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a> may not have been open-world, but it introduced levels that were both bigger and denser than its predecessors, offering more opportunities for exploration and discovery.</p><p>Now we’re seeing the same thing play out with the first few tentpole releases for the Switch 2, starting with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> at launch. Instead of simply adding more tracks than <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/1/23941695/mario-kart-8-deluxe-wave-6-dlc-tracks-release-date-characters">which was already massive</a>, <em>World</em> introduced a new structure, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interview/678097/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-interview-kosuke-yabuki">putting all of the courses on a single landmass that can also be explored outside of racing</a>. The idea was to create a sense of a cohesive whole, so that there was a progression as you made your way from one end of the continent to the other. There’s even a “free roam” mode where you can simply explore, either solo or online with friends, driving around in search of fun details or extra challenges to complete. These ideas expand on the idea of <em>Mario Kart</em> without getting in the way of what the series is about.</p><p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> does something similar. Like <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> before it, <em>Bananza</em> is not an open-world game (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/695726/donkey-kong-bananza-developers-super-mario-odyssey">the similarities shouldn’t be too surprising given the games were developed by largely the same teams</a>). But it does feature large, dense areas to explore, which are big enough that there’s a musical tool that points you in the right direction if you get lost. More importantly, the game changes things up by giving you a new way to interact with the world around you. For me at least, being able to smash things required a new way of thinking, as I often had to remember to explore three-dimensionally, using DK’s brute force to open up hidden pathways above and below me. Sometimes this helped me find a way forward, or avoid challenging obstacles. Other times I discovered some kind of secret. Plus, in those moments when I do get frustrated or stuck, it’s a great way to let off steam. Sometimes you just gotta break stuff.</p><p>Both <em>World</em> and <em>Bananza</em> started life on the original Switch, but were able to fully explore their ideas — in one case an open world, in the other a destructible one — by utilizing the added horsepower of the Switch 2. As producer Kenta Motokura said in <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-1%2F" rel="sponsored">a recent interview</a>, the shift in platform “increased the amount of things players could destroy, which amplified the exhilaration of being able to demolish anything and everything.”</p><p>Which means that we’re likely to see this trend continue as Nintendo brings more of its franchises to the new console, including announced titles like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684199/splatoon-raiders-switch-2-spinoff"><em>Splatoon Raiders</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641602/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-masahiro-sakurai"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a>. They may be familiar favorites, but the exciting part is seeing which way Nintendo decides to expand them.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/707449/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-nintendo-design-open-world]]></content:encoded>

            <p>You already knew hectic 1v1 bullet sprayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a> was going to add 2v2 matches and a four-player free-for-all mode. You knew because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brutalist-shooter-straftat-teases-a-four-player-free-for-all-mode">I told you months ago</a>. Don't pretend you forgot. Please, it's insulting. Anyway, the update that adds these modes arrived yesterday and it also adds - surprise! - a ton of new maps. Which brings the game's total number of killing arenas to over 300. Straft THAT, other shooters. </p>

<p>"We're happy to launch today the official 4 Players Straftat update FOR FREE," yell developers Lemaitre Bros in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2386720/view/497201025048904106?l=english">an update post on Steam</a>, probably in an effort to be heard over the sound of gunfire. "It includes both 2v2 and Free For All (1v1v1v1). Team matches can be 1v2 and 1v3 as well. This was by far the most requested feature for the game since release back in October. We hope these new gamemodes will meet your expectations."</p>
<p>I just played a bunch of matches and I left smiling as widely as ever. Having a rando teammate to carry my carpal tunnelled corpse through each burst of low-stakes, quickfire <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> murder certainly helped. The free-for-all matches were just as snappy, and there is a familiar glee in avoiding a straight fight and stealing that last kill with a snipey shot from across the map to win the game. God, it's wild that video games can just be good, you know? YOU CAN PLAY THIS FOR FREE.</p>
<p>The update also adds a heap of new maps, a practice <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-1v1-shooter-you-keep-hearing-whispers-about-now-has-an-obscene-226-maps">the developers continue</a> with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-resurrects-a-counter-strike-map-you-either-love-or-hate-cannibalising-fps-history-in-the-best-way-possible">a frequency</a> that would drive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-map-makers-map-more-maps-into-straftat">a man to madness</a>. There are ten new free maps, plus an extra 28 maps for DLC owners. Although note that even matching up with someone else who owns the DLC will let you play the maps you don't have. There are some new weapons too, the devs say, including a "Curved Knife" which boosts jumping, and a couple of fast-firing but low-damage machine guns.</p>
<p>I've only devoted a few hours to this shooter, yet I can't help but recommend it. It is pure, old-school adrenaline administration software. You bumslide and wall run and miss nine out of ten shots in a wild panic when your foe appears around the corner. You can lose and lose and lose, and never care, because a round lasts about 30-60 seconds and how can you get annoyed about ragdolling across the map when you're already shooting rockets again.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/free-shooter-straftat-gets-a-2v2-update-and-if-my-maths-are-correct-this-makes-it-twice-as-intense-1v1]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re a regular user of Steam, you’ll know that Valve’s industry-dominating PC games store is absolutely buried in adult-themed games. Sex stuff. Porn. So much of it. Scrolling the new release lists reveals the astonishing number of both crap and quality adult games that are released every day. But on the advent of a new update to the Steamworks Documentation for developers, it appears vast numbers of extreme adult games have been delisted from the service. Which raises a lot of questions.

If you’ve never shown any interest in sex-themed games, you could be forgiven for not even knowing just how many are available on the store. But, dig a little deeper and it’s boobs all the way down. As someone who regularly scrolls the unfiltered <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=Released_DESC&amp;os=win&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=Released_DESC&amp;os=win" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Releases page</a></span> searching for unknown indie games that deserve attention, I’m aware just how ubiquitous such games are. Some look interesting, most look astonishingly dreadful. Some just sound foul.</p><p>What’s allowed, however, has now become extremely confusing, with potential repercussions for developers looking to explore controversial territories. In Steam’s guidance for developers, under <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding?language=english#5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding?language=english#5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“What you shouldn’t publish on Steam,”</a></span> is a list of 15 characteristics a game might have that aren’t wanted on the store. They’re things like “sexually explicit images of real people” and “applications built on blockchain technology that issue or allow exchange of cryptocurrencies or NFTs.” The latest, added only yesterday, reads:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult only content.</p></blockquote><p>It’s a very unclear and difficult-to-interpret statement, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogamer.com/news/new-steam-rules-prohibit-games-that-upset-payment-processors/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/new-steam-rules-prohibit-games-that-upset-payment-processors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as <em>Videogamer</em> points out</a></span>, it follows <em>Nexus Mods</em> similarly restricting certain mods in light of the wildly unhelpful <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eff.org/pages/uk-online-safety-bill-massive-threat-online-privacy-security-and-speech&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eff.org/pages/uk-online-safety-bill-massive-threat-online-privacy-security-and-speech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK Online Safety Act</a></span> that soon comes into force in the UK. Whether this move is related—if it’s Valve rolling out a new rule for the entire world in order to cover its backs with the implausible restrictions the British government is imposing on websites and banks—is not known. But <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://automaton-media.com/en/news/steam-rules-updated-to-prohibit-content-that-violates-rules-set-forth-by-payment-processors-and-banks/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/steam-rules-updated-to-prohibit-content-that-violates-rules-set-forth-by-payment-processors-and-banks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as <em>Automaton</em> noticed</a></span>, this rule change has coincided with a purge of extreme adult games on Steam, with hundreds <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/history/events/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/history/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marked as delisted by <em>SteamDB</em></a></span> over the last 24 hours.</p><p>We’re talking about games themed around topics like incest, rape and slavery, titles like <em>Incest Tales: Webcam Daughter</em> and <em>Reincarnation in another world going to rape All NPCs VR</em>. One franchise alone, called <em>Interactive Sex</em>, appears to have had 54 games removed, meaning you can no longer play <em>Incest Daughters Episode 4</em> or <em>Daddy Daughter Incest</em>.</p><p>That latter example (which does not feature children) has been on sale on Steam since February 28 of this year. The <em>Reincarnation</em> rape-themed VR game had been available since March 14. Both are now gone. But it’s important to note this isn’t a banhammer situation. The developer of <em>Daddy Daughter Incest</em>, EroticGamesClub, still has <em>hundreds</em> of porn games on sale on Steam, and more confusingly, these still include incest-themed games, labelled as such on the store. So it’s very hard to understand what’s happening.</p><figure id="" data-id="f17165cf4b907793187752f08b6ff863" data-recommend-id="image://f17165cf4b907793187752f08b6ff863" data-format="jpg" data-width="1016" data-height="571" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A selection of adult games on Steam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A selection of adult games on Steam." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f17165cf4b907793187752f08b6ff863" data-recommend-id="image://f17165cf4b907793187752f08b6ff863" data-format="jpg" data-width="1016" data-height="571" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A selection of adult games on Steam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The vast majority of these games are utterly awful “visual novels,” barely interactive combinations of static images and briefly looped animated models, mostly depicting bog-standard porn-like sex acts. Most are priced at around $5, and have either no reviews or very negative remarks, the shovelware output not worth the wank. And look, I have my own opinions on these games and you have yours. I’m not here to pronounce my own boundaries, and your personal taste or distaste isn’t really relevant. Valve is very clear that it’s happy to host adult content on the store, and it offers options for customers to have all such games hidden from view. That’s why rule #3 on its guidelines says you should not attempt to distribute “Adult content that isn’t appropriately labeled and age-gated.”</p><p>The issues that I see come down to the complete ambiguity with which this new rule has been introduced. How is any developer supposed to be able to divine what might “violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers”? Should they email Mastercard and T-Mobile to ask the corporations if they’re happy with their sex-themed tile-sliding puzzle game? (Oh god, there are <em>so </em>many sex-themed tile-sliding puzzle games on Steam.) And what are the “certain kinds” of adult content? Does everyone have to guess?</p><p>Honestly, I couldn’t care less about all these dreadful, smutty sims. They’re churned out by content factories, presumably hoping to catch the attention of horny customers, and everyone gets what they deserve when they pay $5 to watch two barely-animated custom nude models rutting back and forth. Whatever. But what concerns me is the collateral damage.</p><p>One of the real positives of Valve’s incredibly liberal approach to what it will sell is that it allows incredibly complex and difficult topics to be explored by brave developers. People regularly interrogate their own traumas through visual novels and interactive fiction, while others explore their sexual kinks via similar mediums. Victims of incest might want to create incredibly challenging games that process such experiences in healthy and productive ways—what happens here if it’s to turn out that “certain kinds” of adult themes includes such topics? And who’s deciding what’s allowed? Valve, or Visa?</p><p>And then what comes next? If we start deciding <em>this</em> is unacceptable, then where does that stop? Of course LGBTQ+ developers will be the most immediately vulnerable to such entirely ambiguous rules, where moral authority appears to have been handed to vast banking corporations.</p><p>So no, yeah, I’m grossed out by <em>Daddy Daughter Incest</em>, and don’t want to play that. (And managed not to for all the months it was available.) But that’s not the point. The point is that rules like this are deeply concerning when they’re so unclear and vague. </p><p>The UK’s Online Safety Act is a terrible, badly-constructed confusion of responsibilities, created with the pretense of protecting children, but its 250 pages are far better suited to enforcing censorship. It’s ambiguous itself, despite its enormous length—something that itself meant most politicians who voted for it had never read it. It moves responsibility for “harmful content” to internet providers and payment processors, without ever being clear what “harmful content” is, nor indeed what anyone is supposed to practically do to prevent it in the real world. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eff.org/pages/uk-online-safety-bill-massive-threat-online-privacy-security-and-speech&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eff.org/pages/uk-online-safety-bill-massive-threat-online-privacy-security-and-speech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can read why it’s so bad here</a></span>. And while we cannot say that this is why Valve has suddenly added this confusing new rule, it’s hard not to draw parallels. And its implications become international when it means companies start trying to crack down in such confused, extreme ways.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Valve to try to get more clarity about these changes, what’s expected of developers, and whether there’s any more clear guidance on what the mysterious “certain kinds” includes. We’ll update if they get back to us.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-valve-adult-content-sex-games-online-safety-act-1851786391]]></content:encoded>

It’s entirely possible plans have changed after the creative shakeup, but Bloys says that Druckmann gave the team a “good blueprint” for the rest of the show, even if he’s not working on it himself.</p><p>“Obviously it was great to have Neil involved in the beginning,” Bloys said. “The whole reason that I wanted to do <em>Last of Us</em> is after <em>Chernobyl</em>, I said to Craig, ‘what do you want to do next?’ And <em>Last of Us</em> was what he wanted to do. That’s what was most important to me, Craig’s creative excitement about the show. It was fantastic to have Neil involved. A lot of people don’t realize that Neil has a full-time job creating video games and running Naughty Dog. It’s a really big job that he’s got. So I understand why he needs to focus on that. But I believe he’s given us a good blueprint with the show. And obviously Craig is a pro, so I think we’ll be in excellent shape. I’m not worried at all.”</p><p>Bloys isn’t worried, but I am.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="DK - Score" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a1158cde5278/dk-score.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well folks, the reviews are now in for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>; Nintendo's first proper 3D platformer for the Switch 2. So, what's the verdict?</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the game is sitting at 90 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/donkey-kong-bananza/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">Metacritic</a>, though it's worth considering that new reviews will likely make themselves known in the coming days, so this might change in either direction. Regardless, it sounds like DK's first 3D outing in decades has been worth the wait.</p>
<p>Before we crack on with the round up, let's see what we said in our own review first. We awarded the game a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">9/10</a> and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Donkey Kong Bananza is an almighty re-introduction to the world of 3D platforming for DK, and arguably the Switch 2's first absolute must-play. The punching and crashing is a passing novelty that, once you get your fill, quickly becomes just another way of exploring the wonderfully varied and beautifully presented layers."</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184766 @ 1752681811 -->
<p>So for now, let's see what some other outlets have said:</p>
<p>First, we start with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">IGN</a>, who scored the game a perfect 10/10 while calling it "a truly groundbreaking 3D platformer":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The leader of the bunch is finally back to kick some tail in Donkey Kong Bananza, a brilliant successor to Super Mario Odyssey and a smashing return for a classic Nintendo character. It was a bold choice to build the Switch 2’s first 3D platformer around Donkey Kong instead of Mario, but it’s proven to be the best decision Nintendo could’ve made. DK’s satisfying, expressive movement and powerful, dynamic abilities create a truly groundbreaking adventure. The ambitious, destructible layers of this underground world are densely packed with satisfying collectibles, abundant charm, and clever challenges that never seem to run out of smart ideas, even long after the credits have rolled. Bananza is a constant crescendo across its 20-hour campaign and beyond, with puzzle-platforming concepts that only grow richer as DK and Pauline dive deeper toward the Planet Core. Every element comes together in complete harmony to create Nintendo’s first Switch 2 masterpiece."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Next up, <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/review-donkey-kong-bananza-is-superb/">Siliconera</a> also provided a 10/10 review and said that Bananza provides "a constant series of pleasant surprises:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Explore a vast underground world—by smashing your way through it! Bash through just about anything with the raw power of Donkey Kong! Crash through walls, carve tunnels with your fists, punch straight down into the ground, and even tear off chunks of terrain to swing around and throw in groundbreaking exploration—the more you smash, the more areas open up for you to move through. Switch 2 version reviewed. Review copy provided by company for testing purposes.</p>
<p>"Donkey Kong Bananza is a constant series of pleasant surprises and shows exactly what the Switch 2 can handle."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza-review/">VGC</a> awarded Bananza a score of 4/5 stars and said that it falls "short of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a>'s genius", but is nevertheless a "top-tier" platformer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Donkey Kong Bananza has a lot of heart – and that can take you a long way. While DK’s subterranean adventure doesn’t reach the heights of the masterpiece it takes great influence from, Bananza is still a thoroughly entertaining platformer that gives the ape his most memorable adventure in a while, and the best reason so far to buy a Switch 2."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-a-new-start-for-nintendos-first-star/1900-6418382/">GameSpot's</a> 9/10 review is full of praise while also pointing out the performance hiccups and camera issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Donkey Kong Bananza offers a new start for Donkey Kong that is distinct from the Donkey Kong Country games. The focus on destructability captures what makes DK different from other platforming characters--his titanic strength--and giving him a cute sidekick grants the game unexpected emotional depth. As part of the launch line-up for the Switch 2, this nicely fills the gap for one of Nintendo's signature substantial single-player adventures. But more importantly, it's an excellent game in its own right, and deserves to be mentioned alongside games like Mario Odyssey as among Nintendo's best recent work."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Eurogamer</a> also calls Bananza "one of DK's best" in its 4/5 star review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When Bananza smashes it's totally remarkable. Occasionally it feels like it gets a bit lost, or fails to expand on some of the excellent foundations it's laying down. That's the sort of thing that keeps a game from being declared as a total classic for me - even if it nevertheless earns a hearty, full-throated recommendation. And even with my myriad quibbles, certainly it is the new best Donkey Kong adventure that doesn't have the word 'Country' in its title - which puts it in high standing indeed."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review/">TheSixthAxis</a> says that the game can sometimes get a little lost amongst all the destruction, but nevertheless awards it a solid 8/10:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Donkey Kong Bananza is an intoxicating cacophony of brawling, digging and platforming. It's a new style of 3D platformer from Nintendo that, for better and for worse, embraces the destructive chaos of letting players tunnel through and deform the world."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer is launching a new $350 external graphics enclosure that can boost the visual performance of gaming laptops or handhelds, provided you make a few other investments. <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-egpus%2Frazer-core-x-v2" rel="sponsored">The Razer Core X V2</a> is the first of Razer’s Core X eGPU chassis lineup to support the faster Thunderbolt 5 connectivity standard, providing a single cable that provides up to 140W of power to connected host devices.</p><p>Some generational upgrades provided by the Core X V2 include support for larger four-slot AMD and Nvidia GPUs, and backwards compatibility with Thunderbolt 4. Laptops equipped with Thunderbolt 5 are still pretty rare, but the Core X V2 should theoretically support bandwidth speeds of up to 80 Gbps for devices that can make use of it.</p><p>Aside from a 120mm cooling fan, that single Thunderbolt 5 cable is the only other accessory, however. That means customers will not only need to purchase a compatible desktop graphics card (which can get pricey for the more powerful models), but also a standard ATX power supply that meets their GPU requirements in addition to the 230W for the Core X V2 itself.</p><p>Previous Razer Core enclosure models, like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18624843/razer-x-chroma-gpu-enclosure-thunderbolt-3-gaming-review">$399 Core X Chroma</a>, came with a pre-installed power supply. The change perhaps offers more flexibility for GPUs with lofty power requirements, but for everyone else, it’s just an additional expense.</p><p>The Razer Core X V2 also loses the integrated USB and Ethernet ports provided by its predecessors. Users who need more connectivity for peripherals will therefore <em>also</em> need to buy a compatible Thunderbolt 5 dock — just like the <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-pc-accessories%2Frazer-thunderbolt-5-dock%3F_gl%3D1*1rms8ds*_ga*NzgxNjk2MTA5LjE3NTI2NjEyODY.*_ga_3TRK53PM75*czE3NTI2NjQ1MzYkbzIkZzEkdDE3NTI2NjUyNzYkajMyJGwwJGgw*_gcl_au*MjEyODI2NjM3NS4xNzUyNjY1MjU0" rel="sponsored">$390 one that Razer conveniently announced</a> alongside the Core X V2.</p><p>The Thunderbolt 5 Dock is currently available to buy on Razer’s website. The Core X V2 is also listed, but isn’t on sale yet. We have asked Razer to share when the eGPU will be available to purchase.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/708202/razer-core-x-v2-egpu-price-thunderbolt-5]]></content:encoded>

As far as third-party games go, both Cyberpunk 2077 and Civilization 7 have mouse-control options.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike the more expensive first-party releases like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza, Drag x Drive is launching as a digital exclusive for $20.

                <p>Bethesda Game Studios has teased plans to add more content to Fallout 76 based on the Prime Video TV series. Creative director Jon Rush said in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/fallout-season-2-fishing-tips-video-game-76-1236451304/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that the game studio and TV teams are in discussion "all the time," but it's too soon to say what specific content may be in the works.</p><p>"Lining things up with the seasonal releases of the show, it's stuff that we talk about all the time, and we do have plans for things here and there. I'm not going to go into detail on any of those now, but the two teams do talk to one another," Rush said.</p><p>While there may be opportunities for crossover content, Rush pointed out that Fallout 76's story is the furthest back in time for the series and the TV show is the furthest into the future. "So there's a lot of room where we don't necessarily need to overlap. There are some things that we could overlap the stories ,that could exist, but we largely try to keep those pretty simple," Rush said.</p><p>Fallout 76's Season 21 update launched in June, and the introduction of fishing was its biggest draw.
