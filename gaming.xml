            <p>The rebooted 2013 Tomb Raider made its Switch debut just a matter of weeks ago, and thanks to the "passionate response" from the community, port developer Aspyr may now consider bringing the trilogy's final two entries to Nintendo's platform as well.</p>
<p>The Tomb Raider Survivor trilogy kicked off when the team at Crystal Dynamics dropped an inexperienced and somewhat naive Lara Croft on the storm-riddled shores of Yamatai. Her story then continued in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a>, which took Lara to Siberia, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>, where the trilogy concluded in the sweltering jungles of South America.</p>

<p>Of course, many Switch players are now wondering if these last two entries in the most recently released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> will eventually make their way to the platform as well, and allow them to finish Lara's rebooted arc.</p>
<p>"We have definitely seen this question," <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/aspyr-explains-how-it-approached-the-nintendo-switch-2-version-of-tomb-raider-definitive-edition-patches-planned/">Aspyr told Nintendo Everything</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-fans-might-get-the-entire-tomb-raider-survivor-trilogy-thanks-to-their-passionate-response">Nintendo Life</a>). The studio added it has already reintroduced Nintendo players to the classic era of Tomb Raider with its remasters of the first six games in the series.</p>
<p>"We've successfully brought back the classic era (1-6) and now the 'origin story' of Lara Croft to modern Nintendo platforms," Aspyr said when asked about future Tomb Raider ports of Rise and Shadow.</p>
<p>"We can't announce anything at the moment but the passionate response to this release is strong encouragement for us to continue exploring those possibilities," the studio closed. So, would you like to see Rise and Shadow of the Tomb Raider arrive on Switch consoles?</p>

<p>Along with Tomb Raider 2013 arriving on Switch, this month has been a rather exciting one for fellow fans of Lara's. At The Game Awards, two new games were also announced to be in the works. The first - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">a remake of the original Tomb Raider known as Legacy of Atlantis</a> - is due to be released next year. Then, in 2027, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-tomb-raider-catalyst-sits-on-the-series-timeline">all-new series entry known as Tomb Raider: Catalyst will arrive across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam</a>.</p>
<p>There is also Amazon's live-action show still to come, with filming beginning next month. Cast members so far include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Sigourney Weaver as a character called Wallace</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-series-adds-white-lotus-star-to-the-cast">Jason Isaacs in an undisclosed role</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Polyphony Digital's <strong>Gran Turismo 7</strong> may have been released nearly four years ago, but according to series creator and studio founder Kazunori Yamauchi, it's still doing extremely well.</p>



<p>In an interview with media outlets that attended the Gran Turismo World Series 2025 World Finals in Fukuoka, Japan, the legendary game designer (and racing driver) revealed that the game <strong>is regularly played by over two million players each month</strong>, and perhaps even more importantly, its player base is still growing. Here's the relevant quote <a href="https://www.gtplanet.net/gt7-2-million-monthly-users-20251221/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as GTPlanet reported it</a>:</p>



<p><em>Gran Turismo 7 has been released for several years, but still, the active users are currently over 2 million people, and the new users are increasing. The status that Gran Turismo 7 is in now is probably the best of any Gran Turismo titles that we’ve had in the past. We’ve never experienced this phenomenon before, and neither has PlayStation.</em></p>



<p>Polyphony Digital experimented with live service in the previous entry, GT Sport, but it's clear that GT7 has received a much warmer welcome from series fans and continues to keep many players interested through various updates. The most recent one, Spec III (Update 1.65), launched on December 4 and introduced:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eight cars (Ferrari 296 GT3 ’23, Ferrari 296 GTB ’22, FIAT Panda 30 CL ’85, Gran Turismo F3500‑B, Mine's BNR34 GT‑R N1 base, Mitsubishi FTO GP Version R ’97, Polestar 5 Performance ’26, and Renault Espace F1 ’95).</li>



<li>Two tracks (Yas Marina Circuit and Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve).</li>



<li>The new Data Logger feature lets players load data from the previous attempt or replays to view and compare data such as racing lines, throttle and brake inputs, speed, and engine RPM, all in real-time.</li>
</ul>



<p>Alongside Spec III, Gran Turismo 7 players can also purchase the new Power Pack for $29.99. This premium DLC adds 50 new races across 20 themed categories, such as 24-hour races, six unique cars specially tuned by Gran Turismo, tail-to-nose battles with <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-sophy-announced-by-sony-ai-and-polyphony-its-an-ai-breakthrough-capable-of-competing-against-top-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gran Turismo Sophy</a> 3.0, and is bundled with 5,000,000 in-game Credits.</p>



<p>The game's only real downside is the aggressive microtransactions system, which also caused its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gran-turismo-7-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Wccftech review score</a> to drop from 9 to 8/10. From the point of view of PC players, there's also the 'downside' that the game still isn't available, whereas most other PlayStation exclusives have already been ported. </p>



<p>Three years ago, a Yamauchi statement about a PC version being considered <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-pc-ports-are-being-considered-by-polyphony-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was widely reported</a> in the press. However, a few weeks later, the founder of Polyphony rectified the statement, clarifying that the possibility was 'not zero' but that there was still nothing being actively done on that front yet. Unfortunately, as of the end of 2025, there are still no updates on the port.</p>

<p>It's no Fiorentina jersey, but it's something</p>

<figure data-uuid="26ca35de83f1c"><a title="Pikmin 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/26ca35de83f1c/pikmin-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo has a long history of sponsoring professional sports teams, and one club it's continued to support over the years is the Japanese football side, Kyoto Sanga, which currently competes in Japan's top-flight competition known as the J-League.</p>
<p>Nintendo owns 16.6% of this club, <a href="https://www.lukeplunkett.com/the-story-of-kyoto-sanga-nintendos-favourite-football-team/">and ever since it signed on in 1993</a>, the video game giant's traditional 19th-century kanji logo has appeared on the back of the kit, above the player number. Now, in a slight and subtle update to the shirt for the new season, the logo is surrounded by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin</a>.</p>
<p>So, while the traditional logo might not be quite as recognisable here in the west, you can now at least impress fellow Nintendo fans (<em>and maybe some sports ones</em>) with these colourful Pikmin.</p>
<figure data-uuid="15b9952a8d147"><a title="Pikmin 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/15b9952a8d147/pikmin-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: via @Genki_JPN on X</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>Again, while it might not be <em>quite</em> as easy to spot as <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2019/09/feature_remember_when_video_game_football_shirts_were_a_big_deal">Nintendo's ACF Fiorentina kit featuring the company's red (and iconic) "racetrack" logo</a>, any fan of Nintendo should definitely notice. As for the rest of the kit, as you can see in the images above, it features the usual purples, white and red colours – matching the club's emblem.</p>
<p>As Nintendo fans should know, Shigeru Miyamoto has a soft spot for Pikmin, and has previously mentioned how he considers them to be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/07/miyamoto-considers-pikmin-to-be-nintendos-most-global-characters">Nintendo's most "global characters"</a>, so it's no surprise they continue to pop up pretty much everywhere.</p>
<p>On a <em>slightly</em> related note, Nintendo this week rolled out a new game update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> on the Switch to fix multiple bugs.</p>

<p>"I can't really play it now though"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Hideo Kojima has rightly cemented himself as a legend in the games industry, having created iconic titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/silent_hills">P.T.</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/silent_hills">Death Stranding</a>. Although it probably shouldn't come as a surprise, however, Kojima cites <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> as the reason he started making games in the first place.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02Ah5VQrzvA">new interview</a> with WIRED in which Kojima answers questions submitted online, he's asked which game he has played the most. His immediate answer was Super Mario Bros., claiming to have played it for "a year" when he was a college student. He states that "without Super Mario, I probably wouldn't be in this industry".</p>
<p>Although he alludes to its simplicity (it was, after all, a launch title for the NES), he says that it pushed him to believe in the potential of games, claiming that "this medium would one day surpass movies".</p>
<p>Here's the full quote from Kojima:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Super Mario Bros., definitely. Played it for a year. I was a college student. I skipped school to play at home. Without Super Mario, I probably wouldn't be in this industry... Yeah... I can't really play it now, though.</p>
<p>"It's a side-scrolling action game. Mario just goes left to right. Basically just jumping. But there's a dash button. Using that and jump subtly changes the jump trajectory to attack or dodge. It has almost no story, but it felt like you were on an adventure. When I saw that, although it was pixel art with no story, I felt this medium would one day surpass movies."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kojima has recently released <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> and is currently working on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/od">OD</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/physint">Physint</a> (working title). The original Death Stranding, initially a console exclusive for the PS5, has since been released on everything from the Xbox to the Amazon Luna, leading many to speculate that it might eventually wind up on the Switch 2.</p>

            <guid>1389901</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Blue Prince’s publisher has spoken out against sudden allegations of using Generative AI in the title. The news comes after Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 had its wins at the Indie Game Awards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revoked due to using AI-generated elements</a>.</p>



<p>Generative AI usage in video games has been a hot topic for quite some time. Just recently, Larian Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-larian-employees-fire-back-at-bosss-ai-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted to using Gen AI</a> for pre-production purposes and many were displeased with the Baldur’s Gate 3 developer. The conversation on whether it’s ethical or not has been a huge debate, so it only went bigger when The Indie Game Awards revoked Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 of its wins for Best Independent Game and Best Debut Indie Game. The winner of the Best Independent Game then became Blue Prince, a puzzle rogue-like and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-highest-rated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of 2025’s best-reviewed titles</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, allegations of Dogubomb, the creator, using Generative AI in Blue Prince appeared out of nowhere. It went big when The Escapist called out the company in <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/news-indie-game-awards-clair-obscur/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a since-edited article</a>. Now, the publisher and developer have spoken up about the allegations.</p>







<h2 id="h-blue-prince-did-not-use-generative-ai-during-development-says-publisher">Blue Prince Did Not Use Generative AI During Development, Says Publisher</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For people that need confirmation:&nbsp;<br>There is no AI used in Blue Prince. The game was built and crafted with full human instinct by Tonda Ros <a href="https://twitter.com/dogubomb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dogubomb</a> &amp; his team.

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/RawFury/status/2002748999388844330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement from publisher Raw Fury</a>, the studio defends Blue Prince and its developer, Dogubomb. In particular, it responds to the claims that the game used Generative AI during development. The studio posted on social media the following:</p>



<p>“<strong>For people that need confirmation:&nbsp;There is no AI used in Blue Prince</strong>,” says the statement. “<strong>The game was built and crafted with full human instinct by Tonda Ros (Dogubomb) &amp; his team. It is the result of eight years of development, fuelled by imagination and creativity, and we are extremely proud of what Tonda has achieved.</strong>“</p>



<p>With The Indie Game Awards, the criteria was that no game would use AI, and developers had to verify it in order to be considered. The allegations of Blue Prince using it were baseless, as the article had no evidence to back it up. The crackdown on AI usage in games will likely be ever-present come 2026. Whatever the case, it’s a shame one of 2025’s best titles had to deal with the allegations, especially after a big win.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PIONER Roadmap Reveals Ambitious Few Months Ahead]]></title>

            <guid>1389892</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>GFA Games recently unveiled a new roadmap for PIONER following the game’s entering early access on December 16. The post-apocalyptic MMO has started to slowly turn heads on account of how much potential it has wrapped up in a package that’s already evolving.</p>



<p>It’s GFA Games’ first project as a collective, and if the new roadmap is anything to go by, it has a bright immediate future; the long-term prospects are yet to be estimated.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-to-pioner-in-2026">What’s Coming to PIONER in 2026?</h2>



<p>In a roadmap published on social media, the team at GFA Games unveiled what’s coming next for PIONER.</p>



<p>Launched into early access on December 16, PIONER presents players with a gritty, STALKER-inspired rendition of a Soviet-era island, torn apart by cataclysms, anomalies, and bloodthirsty factions. It’s an open-ended, open-world title that has scores of content to uncover and explore, and despite being in early access, it’s pretty well optimized.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We’re excited to present the PIONER Early Access roadmap for Q1 2026.</p><p>What’s coming:</p><p>– A New Year event featuring a wide variety of themed items;<br>– New story quests, raids, PvP maps, and more <a href="https://t.co/VBP5GOBZ0q">pic.twitter.com/VBP5GOBZ0q</a></p></div>— PIONER (@PionerGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/PionerGame/status/2002061384939618385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Here’s what’s coming in Q1 2026 for PIONER, and in the final days of 2025:</p>



<p><strong>December</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New Year Event at Wandering Pass</li>



<li>New World Event</li>



<li>New Themed Items</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>January</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New Main Story Quest</li>



<li>New World Events</li>



<li>New Raid Mission</li>



<li>New PvP Map</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>February</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New Main Story Quest</li>



<li>New World Events</li>



<li>TBC</li>



<li>TBC</li>
</ul>



<p>In <strong>March</strong>, the game will get a ‘big update’, the team has teased.</p>



<p>PIONER is ambitious, especially for the size of the studio behind it and the nature of its launch. It obviously takes a lot from other titles, but the delivery feels unique and populated enough to be very enjoyable.</p>



<p>Feedback on Steam is mixed at present, and the stock so far has been collated from just 1,000 reviews. Many of the positive reviews have stressed the fact that this is an early access title and ‘shouldn’t be expected to be perfect’, which is what most of the negative reviews are focusing on.</p>

<p>Riot Games has announced that the teams participating in the 2025 VALORANT Champions Tour collectively received over $105 million, marking one of the most financially significant seasons in the game’s relatively short history. VALORANT debuted in the esports space in 2020 and has been steadily growing ever since.</p>



<p>Riot shared the information in an annual competitive recap that revealed a whopping $86 million had been generated through in-game item sales during this year’s tournaments.</p>







<h2 id="h-valorant-hit-milestones-in-2025">VALORANT Hit Milestones in 2025</h2>



<p>The recent recap published by Riot Games revealed stunning revenue that directly lined the pockets of VALORANT teams in 2025, but it went further than that. For instance, VALORANT Masters Bangkok, a tournament that ran from February to March this year, hit a viewership record in the game’s vertical.</p>



<p>From September to October, VALORANT Champs played out in Paris, and one of the most dramatic grand final showdowns in recent memory took place. These events helped boost those coffers immeasurably.</p>



<p>As stated, $86 million of that $105 million cap came from in-game cosmetics, including the yearly Champions Collection. This supersized bundle nearly <strong>doubled </strong>the revenue produced by similar bundles released in 2024. </p>



<p>Fan participation across the broader ecosystem also reached new heights. The Game Changers Pick’Em feature surpassed two million entries. That record is indicative of the growing popularity of the progressive space in VALORANT, which fans <strong>love</strong>.</p>



<p>Those eager to explore their individual performance through 2025 can do so by checking the <a href="https://flashback.playvalorant.com/en-GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VALORANT Flashback platform</a>. It’s a neat feature created by Riot Games that allows users a visual glimpse at their stats this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fnatic, one of the oldest esports organizations in Europe, is reportedly evaluating a sale that would come with a whopping $100 million price tag. In a report shared late last week, it was suggested that multiple parties are interested in securing the brand, and Fnatic has brought in a consultancy firm to engage investors.</p>



<p>Potential buyers are said to include companies across a broad array of verticals, including traditional sports, media, and entertainment.</p>







<h2 id="h-fnatic-wants-a-full-acquisition">Fnatic Wants a Full Acquisition</h2>



<p>In early reports, it has been suggested that some serious investors are eyeing up Fnatic, one of the most iconic brands in the modern esports space. Fnatic boasts a legacy that few organizations can attest to, and despite having recent drops in revenue, the company is still bursting with potential.</p>



<p>Historically, the organization has been one of the first labels in esports to innovate and expand beyond mere competition. In 2016, the company launched Fnatic Gear, a high-end peripherals division, which went on to sell <strong>one million units </strong>before the brand was sold to Sony’s INZONE label.</p>



<p>It should be stressed that $100 million is one hell of a target. In recent years, esports organizations have been bought and sold for far less, despite being valued internally with much higher price points.</p>



<p>For instance, Luminosity was sold in 2025 for just over $3 million, and FaZe Clan was valued at just $18 million in 2023. The latter organization once peaked with a valuation of $725 million, but the tumultuousness of the company proved too volatile in too short a time.</p>



<p>Analysts have argued that if any organization can command that tag, it’s Fnatic.</p>

<p>A major game update for the free-to-play Switch and mobile title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_unite">Pokémon Unite</a> was released earlier this month.</p>
<p>Now, before we get to the end of the year, the development team has added Mega Charizard Y. This follows Mega Gyarados, which joined the fray earlier this month. Before this, trainers got Mega Charizard X and Mega Lucario.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Aeos coins have also been discontinued in Pokémon Unite. This took place earlier this month, alongside the introduction of License Journeys – giving trainers a new way to obtain Licenses in Unite.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-unite-is-discontinuing-aeos-coins-in-its-december-game-update">our previous story</a>, and below is the trailer for Mega Charizard X and Mega Lucario:</p>

<p>Now, following this, it has provided an update about the lifetime sales of the series – revealing it has now sold over six million copies worldwide. This follows a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/the-hd-2d-series-octopath-traveler-hits-another-sales-milestone">sales update in December last year</a>, when it hit the five million mark.</p>
<p>This latest sales update includes physical copies shipped and each game's digital sales. As part of this, it's also shared some special artwork, and the series will be on sale for a limited time.</p>

<p>Octopath Traveler originally began life as a Switch exclusive in 2018 and now has multiple entries <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/06/octopath-traveler-champions-of-the-continent-pre-registrations-go-live-in-the-west">including a mobile prequel</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't tried out the new game yet, it allows you to be the hero (thanks to the custom character creator) and you're also tasked with restoring your hometown, which requires you to make use of the new townbuilding mechanic.</p>
<p>There is a demo available for this title as well and save data carries over to the full game. This follows an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/octopath-traveler-0-receives-a-small-update-on-switch-and-switch-2">update for Octopath Traveler 0 last week</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo has released a new update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> on the Switch 2, bumping it up to Version 3.0.0.</p>
<p>This is the first update since October. This one adds Thai as a supported language and you now also have the ability to set the camera's automatic tracking to 'on' or 'off' in the options menu. Last of all are "several other changes" to improve the overall experience.</p>
<p>Here are the full patch notes, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page. And if we find out about anything else going on with this latest update, we'll let you know.</p>
<h2>Donkey Kong Bananza: Ver. 3.0.0 (Released December 21, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added Thai as a supported language. If you set the language to “Thai/English” in the Nintendo Switch 2 system, the text will become Thai.
<ul>
<li>The audio is English.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added “Camera's automatic tracking” to “Options” in the Pause Menu, and made it so that you can set it ON/OFF.</li>
<li>Several other changes have been made and issues addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>If you haven't tried out Donkey Kong Bananza on the Switch 2 yet, there's a demo you can download from the eShop. You can also find out more in our review here on Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo released some paid DLC for this title in September. It's officially titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</a> and is currently hosting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/dig-into-donkey-kong-bananzas-third-dlc-in-game-event-next-week">special in-game event</a> between now and 23rd December.</p>
<p>This follows Nintendo releasing a patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> last week, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/mario-kart-world-has-been-updated-to-version-1-4-1-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">bumping the Switch 2 launch title up to Version 1.4.1</a>.</p>

<p>Following a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1998845172046606767">reminder from Nintendo</a> earlier this month that it's still only available in "limited quantities", a GameStop memo has supposedly been issued that notes how this deal has now reached the end of its "lifecycle". Since then, GameStop has also <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/2002874071525228771">shared a social media message</a>, mentioning once again that the bundle will "no longer be produced".</p>
<p>Here's what the internal memo says (<a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/2002812731108581597">via Nintendeal</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This bundle SKU has now reached end of lifecycle, and additional units will no longer be produced. Future replenishment of Nintendo Switch 2 will be the base console."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nintendo has previously mentioned how this bundle would be a "limited time production through Fall 2025" and was "available while supplies last". It was priced at $499.99 USD ($50 more than the standalone Switch 2 system), and was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/switch-2s-mario-kart-world-bundle-gets-a-surprise-sale-us">recently on sale in the US</a> (<a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/2002814078834892816">Best Buy appears to still be offering this sale price</a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield fans are up in arms again about a suspected AI design used in the new ‘Windchill’ cosmetics bundle. In recent hours, eagle-eyed gamers discovered telling signs tied to a sticker in this bundle, and all indications point to it being a faulty generative AI creation.</p>



<p>Fans on social media platforms were running rampant, trying to burn the game to the ground. For some, it’s a minor issue, but for others, it’s indicative of that much bigger problem creeping across the games industry.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-ai-sticker-scandal-runs-wild">Battlefield 6 AI Sticker Scandal Runs Wild</h2>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1prq9x9/remove_this_ai_shit_from_the_store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield subreddit</a>, a user shared an image of the new Windchill bundle, revealing a <strong>player card sticker </strong>that stinks of flawed generative AI design. The image showcases a soldier within a snowflake, wielding an M4A1, but there are clear indications that it’s <strong>most likely </strong>created by AI.</p>



<p>The M4A1 in question has two obvious barrels, one above the other. It also seems to have two handguards, which is hardly the most common feature in the world of firearms.</p>



<p>Here’s a zoomed-in shot of the player card sticker:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Users were quick to flock to social posts, stating that this isn’t the only example of something that <strong>looks like </strong>generative AI in Battlefield 6. In social circles, the comments were damning. One user wrote, ‘Just the fact they didn’t catch that before releasing shows how little they are trying.’</p>



<p>Another said, ‘They got your money, so they don’t care about which hill you choose to die on.’</p>



<p>One user condemned the wider use of AI, ‘AI art is generated based on stolen artwork and takes jobs away from real artists.’ Another echoed that sentiment: ‘I didn’t pay for AI garbage. EA pay your f***ing artists!’</p>



<p>In similar news, the world’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ai-game-playable-demo-codex-mortis/">first game created 100% with AI</a> recently launched a playable demo, and it went as well as you could expect.</p>







<p>Do you think there’s an issue with Electronic Arts using AI for small elements like this? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Resident Evil Requiem – Everything We Know About the New Game in CAPCOM’s Beloved Horror Franchise]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/</link>
            <guid>1389700</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="overview">
			
<p>Even though Monster Hunter has taken over as the best-selling series made by CAPCOM, the Japanese developer is still betting heavily on the success of <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong>, the ninth mainline game in the globally acclaimed horror series that has sold <strong>more than 178 million units</strong> throughout its thirty-year history.</p>



<p>With Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and Resident Evil Village, CAPCOM managed to reinvent the saga with a new protagonist, Ethan Winters, and a new perspective, first-person view, in both cases moving away from series staples such as military proficient playable characters and third-person perspective. In many ways, Requiem marks a new chapter that aims to connect elements from both the recent and the older games in the series.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-and-pricing">Release Date, Platforms, and Pricing</h2>



<p>The first rumors about Resident Evil 9 <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-monster-hunter-wilds-rumored-to-be-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started circulating in March 2024</a>, although it wasn't until June 2025 that CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the final title. On this occasion, the studio also communicated the planned release date: <strong>February 27, 2026</strong>. Initially, the game was confirmed for a simultaneous release on Sony's <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, Microsoft's <strong>Xbox Series S|X</strong>, and <strong>PC</strong> (via Steam and the Epic Games Store). A <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> version was <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially added a bit later</a>, during a Nintendo Direct presentation held in September 2025.</p>



<p>Pre-orders are now open. The Standard Edition is priced at <strong>$69.99</strong>, while a Deluxe Edition is available at <strong>$79.99</strong>. This provides access to the Deluxe Kit, composed of the following items:</p>



<ul>
<li>Grace's Costume: Dimitrescu</li>



<li>Grace's Costume: Film Noir</li>



<li>Leon's Costume: RE4</li>



<li>Leon's Costume: Apocalypse</li>



<li>Leon's Costume: Film Noir</li>



<li>Screen Filter: Apocalypse</li>



<li>Screen Filter: Film Noir</li>



<li>Four weapon skins, including S&amp;S M232 Weapon Skin: Apocalypse</li>



<li>Mr. Raccoon Charm</li>



<li>DSO Emblem Charm</li>



<li>Audio Pack: Raccoon City Classic</li>



<li>Files: Letters from 1998</li>
</ul>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/d193827c8fc26985d3e10075de5f81c6-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>Any pre-order of the game includes the bonus cosmetic item Grace's Costume: Apocalypse. Pre-ordering through the Epic Games Store also grants players access to the Grace Ashcroft Outfit exclusive cosmetics item in Fortnite. Additionally, CAPCOM is releasing a <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</strong> themed after the game (<a href="https://fave.co/3Y7tNKD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">priced at <strong>$99.99</strong></a>) and an <strong>amiibo of protagonist Grace Ashcroft</strong> in 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>In Resident Evil Requiem, CAPCOM seeks to offer fans of both <strong>action-horror</strong> and <strong>survival horror</strong> their slice of entertainment, thanks to the dual-protagonist structure.</p>



<p>The setting marks the long-awaited return to <strong>Raccoon City's iconic locations</strong>, including the police station featured in Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3. However, Requiem presents the city in a never-before-seen state of ruin, being set thirty years after Raccoon City's nuclear bombing in RE3.</p>



<p>The narrative premise centers on <strong>Grace Ashcroft</strong>, an FBI agent with a sharp analytical mind, as the brand new playable character. Grace is assigned to investigate a series of strange deaths. The case ultimately leads her to Raccoon City, more specifically to the Wrenwood Hotel, where her mother Alyssa died eight years before the game's events. The developers have described Grace as a bit of a bookworm who doesn't much trust her own capability to handle dangerous combat scenarios. This choice was made to emphasize survival horror mechanics reminiscent of games like RE2 and RE7, where Grace will be forced to evade detection from various enemies while navigating horrifying environments. </p>



<p>For a long time, CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem maintained that the game would also feature another playable character, fan-favorite DSO agent <strong>Leon S. Kennedy</strong>, previously seen in Resident Evil 2, 4, and 6. The developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally confirmed the rumor at The Game Awards 2025</a> with a new trailer, although the cat was already out of the bag since two days earlier <a href="https://wccftech.com/hes-really-here-leon-finally-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-with-a-playstation-store-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to a PlayStation Store leak</a>. The developers later revealed that there is a roughly even split between the two protagonists, with Leon's segments usually being <strong>combat-driven and action-focused</strong>, more akin to Resident Evil 4.</p>



<p>CAPCOM has stressed that this seamless interweaving of high-stakes cinematic action with survival elements represents their bold reinvention of the series, as they attempt to balance atmospheric horror with visceral combat scenarios. </p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>Notably, the project initially began development as a multiplayer-focused title with open world design (confirming earlier rumors), before being redesigned as a single-player, more linear experience. CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-started-as-an-open-world-game-before-capcom-realized-it-wasnt-what-fans-wanted-to-see-or-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> realizing that this wasn't what core fans of the horror franchise would have wanted.</p>



<p>Even so, Resident Evil Requiem does introduce at least one major innovation: the <strong>hybrid first-person and third-person perspective system</strong>, which allows players to dynamically switch between viewpoints for the first time in the series so that they'd be able to suit their playstyle. Those who prefer a more scary and immersive experience are likely to gravitate toward first-person, whereas action gamers and traditional fans will probably opt for third-person.</p>



<p>The core gameplay loop integrates classic Resident Evil mechanics with modern refinements: <strong>combat, investigations, puzzles, and resource management</strong>. The dual-character structure also aims to create <strong>distinct gameplay identities</strong> that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-complete-rollercoaster-ride-never-before/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the words of Game Director Koshi Nakanishi</a>, will make players feel like they are <strong>on a rollercoaster ride</strong> like never before in Resident Evil. Nakanishi noted that it wouldn't do to keep the horror tension to the max throughout the whole game, because that would be quite exhausting for the player. As such, there will be a dynamic pacing curve that alternates between tense, horrific sequences and some release, exciting combat, and peaceful exploration, before gradually picking up again on the horror part of the curve. To further highlight the differences between Grace and Leon, Nakanishi recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-grace-ashcroft-series-most-fearful-character-leon-kennedy-series-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that Grace is the series' most fearful character yet, while the experienced Leon is the strongest.</p>



<p>A taste of playing as Grace was made available to press and fans alike in the Gamescom 2025 demo that Wccftech's Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">praised in the <strong>hands-on preview article</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Furthermore, CAPCOM has deliberately designed Requiem to be <strong>accessible to series newcomers</strong> while rewarding veterans through familiar features, such as legacy enemy types and narrative callbacks. Thus, no need to worry if you haven't played all, or any, of the predecessors.</p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem employs CAPCOM's <strong>proprietary RE Engine</strong>, which was named after the series and was first used in RE7. Nowadays, the RE Engine powers every game developed by the Japanese studio. In most cases, it delivered excellent visuals and solid performance, with the notable exceptions of Dragon's Dogma 2 and Monster Hunter Wilds, both of which were open world games.</p>



<p>Luckily, Resident Evil Requiem's final incarnation is not an open world game and is therefore unlikely to suffer major optimization problems. The developers themselves <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-wont-have-same-performance-issues-monster-hunter-wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told fans</a> there wouldn't be a repeat of the disappointing launch performance of Monster Hunter Wilds. </p>



<p>CAPCOM already shared the minimum and recommended system requirements for the PC version.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Requirement</th><th>Minimum</th><th>Recommended</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OS</td><td>Windows 11</td><td>Windows 11</td></tr><tr><td>Processor</td><td>Intel Core i5-8500 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</td><td>Intel Core i7-8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 5500</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>16 GB RAM</td><td>16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td>Graphics</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 6 GB / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT 8 GB</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super 8 GB / AMD Radeon RX 6600 8 GB</td></tr><tr><td>DirectX</td><td>Version 12</td><td>Version 12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>We also know that the PC version of Resident Evil Requiem <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will support</a> <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</strong> and <strong>path tracing</strong>. Official performance specifications for the console versions have not been publicly disclosed yet. However, the developers briefly discussed the Nintendo Switch 2 version, the least powerful platform among those supported, to reveal that <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-devs-surprised-how-well-it-runs-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even they were surprised at how well it ran on the hybrid console</a>. If the Switch 2 doesn't have a problem, the other consoles should run Requiem even better.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-december-22-925/</link>
            <guid>1389694</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re kicking off the <strong>official </strong>festive week with the NYT Connections solutions and hints that you need to get the job done! Today’s puzzle is the first in a few that will lead you up to the big day and beyond, so be sure to scroll down as soon as needed to uncover today’s answers.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-22">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 22)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #925:</p>



<ul>
<li>RUSH</li>



<li>PIN</li>



<li>PLAYING</li>



<li>LATER</li>



<li>GREETING</li>



<li>CYA</li>



<li>RASH</li>



<li>COMING</li>



<li>WAVE</li>



<li>BUSINESS</li>



<li>FUTURE</li>



<li>BROW</li>



<li>WHIT</li>



<li>FOLLOWING</li>



<li>MEMBERSHIP</li>



<li>SURGE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>They’re all about a sudden <strong>increase in amount or intensity</strong></em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em><strong>All imply ‘not yet’ — something ahead in time</strong></em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Which of these words show up <strong>in your wallet, on your desk, or at a game table</strong>?</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These are colors that feel like they’re <strong>missing something</strong></em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 22:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-22-925">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 22 (#925)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– RASH, RUSH, SURGE, WAVE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – COMING, FOLLOWING, FUTURE, LATER</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BUSINESS, GREETING, MEMBERSHIP, PLAYING</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BROW, CYA, PIN, WHIT</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

		<p>Moon Studios has revealed what’s in store for their ambitious action RPG <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/no-rest-for-the-wicked">No Rest for the Wicked</a> and the addition of co-op multiplayer. The studio is forging a rather unique path compared to other top-down action RPGs and Soulslikes, with persistent realms you can share with other players.</p>
<p>The No Rest for the Wicked co-op update will arrive on 22nd January in full, but is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1371980/view/496089445472142295">currently in an open beta on Steam</a>. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1371980/view/496089445472142770">That beta has now been extended to conclude on 5th January</a>, so you can play all through the holiday.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Rest for the Wicked Together | Co-op update | Wicked Inside Showcase 4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ayIqY6Sszcw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So what’s the benefits and reason to Moon Studios’ approach? Well, as outlined in the latest dev diary, there’s a distinct lack of permanence to a multiplayer session in many Soulslikes, and shared online spaces in games like Diablo 4 and Destiny have little meaning to them, just other people running around. But there’s something special about having clanmates to hang out with in an MMO, and so No Rest for the Wicked is blending all of this together.</p>
<p>No Rest for the Wicked will let you convert any single player realm into a multiplayer one, making it a fully online and persistent instance of the game world. Within this you can have up to four players, and you can share this space fully with characters tied to the realm, or bring characters in from other realms. Being persistent, you don’t need a host player to be online, and so anyone can hop in, harvest materials, level up their character, buy property, and go to complete main quests.</p>

<p>That obviously means that you do need to have a trusting relationship with the other players in your realm. The video showcases some of the shenanigans you can get up to, as studio director Thomas Mahler buys up a ton of property through farming progress and then trying to flip the property to the others, and then those others getting a little bit of revenge.</p>
<p>For the more moment-to-moment action, Moon Studio also outline how you can really work together in play, having front line character, ranged builds and healers that can be great for tackling an imposing boss together. At the same time, enemy AI has been adapted to understand more about player positioning, able to react to flanking moves, or exhibiting some new attacks that you won’t see in single player.</p>
<p>For the game as a whole, vendors will now have fresh gear to sell cycling in and out of their shops. Enchantments have been overhauled and higher level items get better rolls – but you now have limited rerolls – while weapons can now deal crit damage, and have random Facets to provide different stats. Socketing gems will now give fixed improvements, but there’s now higher tier gems. Exhalting (a bit like prestiging an item) needs you to have completely maxed out your item first, boosting a random item in a particular category multiple times.</p>
<p>All enemies are now back-stabbable in combat (if you’re good enough), and bows have been enhanced with a new off-hand Quiver to introduce different arrow types (like blasting, explosive arrows).</p>
<p>Oh, and for the high difficulty sickos out there, the highest difficulty now has more enemies than before.</p>
<p>The game has come through a difficult year, with Moon Studios having to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/11/moon-studios-is-now-self-publishing-no-rest-for-the-wicked-after-split-with-take-two/">split off from publisher Private Division and go it solo</a>, and with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/moon-studios-no-rest-for-the-wicked-review-bomb-studio-closure/">Mahler having a weird moment on social media</a>. Since entering Early Access in early 2024, progress has also been steady as opposed to blistering, but with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/the-breach-update-is-out-today-for-no-rest-for-the-wicked/">a big update earlier this year</a>, and now the imminent addition of multiplayer (which will certainly have been a mountain to overcome), the future for this game is rather encouraging.</p>
<p>No Rest for the Wicked is out now in Steam Early Access, with PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions planned for when it’s good and ready.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game of the Year 2025 – Best Original Soundtrack]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/21/game-of-the-year-2025-best-original-soundtrack/</link>

		<p>Music really has become a huge part of modern gaming, the best examples not just elevating the game as you play it, but sticking with you as the original compositions lodge themselves in your mind to emerge while you’re doing the dishes, waiting in line at the supermarket or other incongruous moments.</p>
<p>The difficulty with game music is just how varied it is. There’s sweeping orchestral scores, there’s jazzy chip tunes, there’s songs, there’s ambient music, regional influence and soundtracks that look to encompass hundreds of years of history.</p>
<p>For us, as we tried to consume as many soundtracks as we could this year, there were some clear standouts, but we had to pick one.</p>



<p>Of all the great video game music created this year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/ghost-of-yotei-review/">Ghost of Yotei’s</a> really hits the high notes – this lacklustre pun absolutely intended. Composed by Toma Otowa, a multi-award-winning film and video game composer, the sweeping and beautiful compositions that accompany the player bring to life the world of Ghost of Yotei through a rich and culturally textured score.</p>

<p>What sets Tomo’s work apart for Ghost of Yotei is the attention to detail, seamlessly blending traditional Japanese instruments (like shamisen, shakuhachi, biwa, and Ainu instruments such as tonkori and mukkuri) with Western influences. There’s even a delightful smattering of spaghetti western-style elements to the score, a perfect fit for the revenge story of protagonist Atsu. Overall, a unique cultural fusion is blended, managing to complement the bombastic gore-soaked action whilst also providing the quiet melancholy that underpins the sorrow-tinged beats of Atsu’s emotional journey.</p>

<h3>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Runner Up</h3>
<p>It’s rare that I listen to a game’s soundtrack when I’m not actively playing the game, but then again <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is a rare game. If you were to listen to the somber, melancholly of “Gustave” or the beautiful violins of “Firecamp – Sciel,” you might be surprised later when you hear “In Lumiere’s Name,” a tango for a battle with a mime, or “Is it a Gestral or a Volleyball?” which is at least as silly as it sounds. They could be from completely different games – though both French, obviously. Or perhaps the epic distorted guitars of “Une vie à peindre” would be more of a surprise?</p>
<p>Much like the rest it, the soundtrack of Expedition 33 is emotional, whimsical, silly, heavy, and French all at once. The soundtrack is as varied as it could possibly be, from slow, morosely beautiful, smaller tracks perfect for the dramatic brooding over the most recent unbelievable revelations, all the way up to the huge heavy hitting boss battles that really get your heart pounding when you need to try and keep focused on parrying and dodging. Frankly, it’s a delight all the way through. It’s clear that composer Lorien Testard poured a lot of love into this soundtrack and it shows as, truly, one of the best I’ve experienced ever.</p>
<p><em>– Gamoc</em></p>
<h3>Skate Story –&nbsp;Runner Up</h3>
<p>How do you soundtrack a game about a glass skateboarding demon on their way to eat the moon? If you’re Sam Eng and you’re making <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/08/skate-story-review-the-grind-of-a-lifetime/">Skate Story</a>, you draft in an entire indie band and let them loose on your gorgeous, existential exploration of the underworld. There’s a lot of leeway in what that might sound like, but with the neon, crystal-infused, ephemeral visuals, it made sense to bring electronica, synth, and a retro-modern outlook that speaks to the 1980s as much as it does the 2020s.</p>
<p>This is a true album too. Skate Story Vol.1 is an auditory journey that’s as essential as the game it soundtracks, and you’ll find yourself travelling back to the half-places and looming edifices of the demon’s journey as you sink ever further into Blood Cultures’ retro-pop.</p>
