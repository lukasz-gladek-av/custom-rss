Today the company revealed that its alarm clock, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24266272/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock-hands-on">Alarmo</a>, will be available at select retailers starting this March.

          <p>Nintendo may be getting ready to make its Switch 2 console official. According to "industry whispers" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest">collected by Eurogamer</a>, as well as <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1878827836741673217">reporting</a> from The Verge's Tom Warren, the Switch 2 could be formally announced sometime this week. Eurogamer suggests the reveal is scheduled for this Thursday, January 16.</p>
<p>The reporting also suggests that the reveal will focus mostly on the console's hardware design, with another game-centered announcement coming later. Eurogamer reports that the console won't be ready to launch until April; this would be similar to Nintendo's strategy for the original Switch, which was announced in mid-January 2017 but not launched until March.</p>
<p>Many things about the Switch 2's physical hardware design have been thoroughly leaked at this point, thanks mostly to accessory makers who have been showing off their upcoming cases. Accessory maker Genki was at CES last week with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/our-best-look-yet-at-the-switch-2s-expanded-size-and-snap-on-joy-cons/">a 3D-printed replica of the console</a> based on the real thing, suggesting a much larger but still familiar-looking console with a design and button layout similar to the current Switch.</p>
<p>On the inside, the console is said to sport a new Nvidia-designed Arm processor with a much more powerful GPU and more RAM than the current Switch. Dubbed "T239," Eurogamer reports that the chip includes 1,536 CUDA cores based on the Ampere architecture, the same used in 2020's GeForce RTX 30-series graphics cards on the PC.</p>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> could be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-coming-this-week-launch-expected-may-or-june-report/1100-6528763/" data-ref-id="1100-6528763">unveiled as soon as this week</a>, according to some reports. But once the system arrives, the real question is what's going to be on it beyond AAA Nintendo titles? According to a new report, Nintendo may have already secured some AAA support from Konami, Square Enix, and Ubisoft.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWifbMkXe_4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nate the Hate</a> is reporting that Konami's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-stays-loyal-to-the-mission/1100-6526099/" data-ref-id="1100-6526099">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> will be among the titles available on Switch 2, as will Square Enix's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-intermission-review-half-measure/1900-6417689/" data-ref-id="1900-6417689">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> and its sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/" data-ref-id="1900-6418187">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>. But it sounds like Ubisoft will be going even deeper by bringing a port of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-back-to-basics/1900-6418126/" data-ref-id="1900-6418126">Assassin’s Creed Mirage</a> for the Switch 2 launch window. The upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, is also said to be in the works for Switch 2, but not in time for the system's launch. That title was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20/1100-6528717/" data-ref-id="1100-6528717">recently pushed back to March</a>.</p><p>The report goes to mention that Ubisoft is "doing more than half a dozen games for the Switch 2," including a game from The Division series, Rainbow Six Siege, and a potential compilation of the two Mario + Rabbids games. Earlier this month, a separate report from Nate the Hate suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744">Microsoft will bring Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to both Switch 2 and PS5 in 2025.</p><p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-many-units-the-switch-2-could-sell-in-2025-in-the-us/1100-6528704/" data-ref-id="1100-6528704">Switch 2 could sell 4.3 million consoles</a> this year alone in the US, according to at least one video game analyst. Despite Nintendo's veil of secrecy, potentially leaked details about the Switch 2 have been running rampant. At CES, Genki showed off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">a Switch 2 mockup</a> that may have earned the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reportedly-sent-lawyers-to-genki-about-switch-2-mockup-at-ces/1100-6528776/" data-ref-id="1100-6528776">a visit by Nintendo's lawyers</a>. Once Nintendo officially announces Switch 2, the level of interest it attracts may only get bigger as it gets closer to launch.</p>

The 256GB version is currently available for $349 (was $400), and it includes a copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow so you can start gaming on the VR headset right away. As an added bonus, you’ll get a free 3-month trial of Meta Quest+, which gives you access to a deep catalog of other VR games along with a rotating monthly selection.</p><div title="6528767 - Meta Quest 3S Discount" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3057" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6528767 - Meta Quest 3S Discount" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Meta Quest 3S (256GB)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$349 (was $400)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Quest 3S is the more affordable sibling of the Quest 3, though it offers many of the same specs. This includes the same Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chipset, 8GB RAM, and support for the Touch Pro controllers. The main difference is in the lenses, as the Quest 3S uses 1832 x 1920 Fresnel lenses (found in the Quest 2) while the Quest 3 uses 2064 x 2208 pancake lenses. However, the lower resolution should result in longer battery life.

It’s a fan-favorite due to its highly viable minion builds that sprint through zones, clearing mobs with reckless abandon. But for a new player, making it to the end-game with the Witch means picking the right starting skills—a strong foundation.

Let’s focus on Tiers 1, 3, and 5, which will provide you with an early-game foundation toward success.</p><h3 id="h688268"><a id=""></a><strong>Tier I: Skeletal Sniper</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="f2348af7cf3439e730225ec41f75ea04" data-recommend-id="image://f2348af7cf3439e730225ec41f75ea04" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Skeletal Sniper skill in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Skeletal Sniper skill in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2348af7cf3439e730225ec41f75ea04" data-recommend-id="image://f2348af7cf3439e730225ec41f75ea04" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Skeletal Sniper skill in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Unearth </strong>is a relatively basic-yet-functional AoE (area-of-effect) skill that is completely free during the prologue section on the beach. But if you want to enhance your area damage, choose <strong>Skeletal Sniper</strong> as your Tier I skill. This is a powerful minion spell that summons a skeleton archer wielding a poison gas bow and arrow.</p><h3 id="h688269"><a id=""></a><strong>Tier III: Skeletal Arsonist</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="a935b6192025191c7db79f6cbd362f21" data-recommend-id="image://a935b6192025191c7db79f6cbd362f21" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu shows the Skeletal Arsonist skill in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu shows the Skeletal Arsonist skill in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a935b6192025191c7db79f6cbd362f21" data-recommend-id="image://a935b6192025191c7db79f6cbd362f21" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu shows the Skeletal Arsonist skill in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Keeping up with the AoE theme, your second ability (this one for Tier 3), should be <strong>Skeletal Arsonist</strong>. This is another minion summon spell that spawns a group of bomb-throwing skeletons to wreak havoc on a given area. It’s exceptional for controlling an arena, like during one of the game’s many optional boss fights.</p><h3 id="h688270"><a id=""></a><strong>Tier V: Raise Zombie</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="caf93c203e684679d1b956ad6f328c4c" data-recommend-id="image://caf93c203e684679d1b956ad6f328c4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Raise Zombie skill." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Raise Zombie skill." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="caf93c203e684679d1b956ad6f328c4c" data-recommend-id="image://caf93c203e684679d1b956ad6f328c4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Raise Zombie skill." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lastly, for Tier 5, consider<strong> Raise Zombie</strong>. It is, as expected, another minion summon spell, just one that’s on a short timer. You can raise up to 10 zombies, creating a horde of minions that lash out at enemies who come too close. With Raise Zombie and your Skeletal spawning skills, you’ll have a small, undead force to rampage through a map.</p><h2 id="h688271"><a id="passive"></a>Best passive skills for the Witch<br></h2><figure id="" data-id="ae307356176271e58c922cdf51c3f050" data-recommend-id="image://ae307356176271e58c922cdf51c3f050" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the passive skill tree for the witch.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As should be obvious by now, the foundation we just discussed will lead you on to a heavy summons build in <em>Path of Exile 2</em>. As a new player, you may quickly feel overwhelmed by the passive skill tree, but it’s less intimidating than it appears. This is the passive skill tree for all classes, so you don’t have to worry about most of the tree, just your section where the game starts.</p><p>With that said, first, focus on the left-hand path, which<strong> increases</strong> <strong>Spell and Minion Damage</strong>. While it may change during Early Access, the first node provides a noticeable boost in your damage output,<strong> increasing Spell Damage by 8 percent and Minion Damage by 8 percent</strong>.</p><p>You should follow this path of the tree for a short while, then refocus your efforts on the right-hand node path, which will increase survivability. You’ll be a glass cannon initially, but it’s worthwhile to increase the power of your summons, which will handle the brunt of the work.</p><p>Of course, if you prefer a more tactical approach, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/path-of-exile-2-mercenary-class-guide-beginners-best-1851721613&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/path-of-exile-2-mercenary-class-guide-beginners-best-1851721613">new Mercenary class is considered one of the best in <em>Path of Exile 2</em> Early Access</a></span>!

<p>Xbox is set to get a new game from a “legendary Japanese IP” in 2025. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-2025-predictions-and-overview-microsofts-most-promising-games-line-up-in-history-meets-a-platform-under-duress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jez Corden</a> of Windows Central, the mystery game during Xbox’s upcoming Developer Direct will be from a classic Japanese franchise.</p>



<p>Corden didn’t spoil anything regarding what the game may be, but did say it has “decades of history”.</p>



<p>“[Our] sources indicate that it is a new entry in a legendary Japanese IP which has decades of history, and should make a lot of fans happy,” he said.</p>



<p>He continued: “Indeed, Microsoft has won some strong support from the region lately from studios like Square Enix for Final Fantasy, HoYoverse for Genshin Impact, and Sega/ATLUS for Persona, and we suspect this new game will help further that trend.”</p>



<p>Aside from the unknown Japanese title, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developer Direct</a> on January 23 will feature looks at games like South of Midnight, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>







<p>“Presented by the game creators themselves, Developer_Direct offers an in-depth look at upcoming titles, how they’re being created, and who’s creating them,” Xbox says. </p>



<p>In addition to the four games expected to be shown during the event, Xbox is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-biggest-xbox-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gearing up for a strong</a> 2025. The company also has Avowed scheduled to release in February as well as the reboot of Fable expected to launch sometime this year.</p>

                <p>The first major professional tennis tournament of the year, the Australian Open, is underway now in Melbourne. New for the 2025 event is an alternate broadcast that makes players look like something out of Wii Sports. The Australian Open organizers rolled out what they are calling "AO Animated" versions of tennis matches this year, featuring animated, video game-looking versions of the real players.</p><p>As you can see in the video game, from the Jacob Fearnley vs. Nick Kyrgios match, the animation is far from perfect--at times, the player's racket and the tennis ball vanish out of thin air. The audio doesn't sync up perfectly, either. But it's pretty solid, all things considered. You can watch more of these matches on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@australianopen/streams" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australian Open YouTube page under the "Live" tab.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fla1j5t4-Ws" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fla1j5t4-Ws" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Broadcasts of this nature are becoming more and more popular these days. Before this, the NFL and Disney+ partnered to air a very <a href="https://www.nfl.com/schedules/simpsons-funday-football" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bizarre-looking Simpsons-themed broadcast</a> of the Cincinnati Bengals vs. Dallas Cowboys game on December 9. This broadcast had the likes of Homer, Bart, Moe, Carl, Barney, and Lenny suiting up and making plays on the field.</p><p>Before that, the NHL and Disney teamed up for a video game-style broadcast of a professional hockey game, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/an-nhl-broadcast-will-look-like-a-video-game-tonight-and-a-chicken-will-drop-the-puck/1100-6512314/" data-ref-id="1100-6512314">characters from the show Big City Greens lacing up their skates.</a> And <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nfl-playoff-game-is-on-nickelodeon-this-sunday-with-spongebob-graphics-and-slime/1100-6499505/" data-ref-id="1100-6499505">who could forget the NFL's slime game featuring SpongeBob</a>?</p>

			<p>We first learned of Bethesda's plans for a The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake thanks to an inadvertent <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leak</a> during the Microsoft vs. FTC lawsuit in Summer 2023. A document that included Bethesda's internal release schedule before the pandemic was uploaded to the public documentation shared for the lawsuit. Here's what it looked like, as a reminder.</p>

<p>The dates are all wrong because of the pandemic, of course, and some things will never be, like the Ghostwire: Tokyo sequel (unless the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-lives-again-thanks-to-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly reborn Tango Gameworks</a> acquires or licenses the IP from Microsoft), but DOOM: Year Zero could very well be the development codename for the upcoming game Dark Ages, which is indeed going to be a prequel to the DOOM franchise.</p>
<p>As for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake (or remaster, as it was listed in that leak), we haven't heard much of it for a long while. Just last week, Internet sleuth Timur222 <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed</a> to a Technical Artist Director from Virtuos possibly having worked on the project.</p>
<p>Today's rumor follows that thread. MP1st <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/the-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-real-gameplay-improvement-details" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that Virtuos (which worked on <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-spacers-choice-edition-is-free-on-the-epic-games-store-this-christmas-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outer Worlds: The Spacer's Choice Edition</a> and is helping Konami with <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-opens-pre-orders-confirms-battle-scars-will-remain-on-snake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>) is indeed working on a remake with Epic's Unreal Engine 5. They mention having read the personal website of a former studio employee who even provided actual details on some of the gameplay improvements to six key areas: Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, Hit Reaction, and HUD.</p>
<p>Blocking was reportedly inspired by Soulslike and other modern action games. Sneak has been improved, too, and its damage formula has been overhauled. The stamina system was also tweaked to make it less frustrating for players; for example, the knockdown that used to happen upon full stamina depletion should happen less often.</p>
<p>The HUD (heads-up display) was modified to be more accessible as well as visually interesting. Hit reactions during combat were introduced to improve the response to damage inflicted on both the player character and non-player characters (NPCs). Last but not least, Virtuos improved Archery in a way that it would feel smoother regardless of whether the user plays in third or first-person.</p>
<p>The report does not provide any further information on the game or when it will be announced. In case you were holding up hope for the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-might-be-bigger-than-microsoft-suggested-according-to-jez-corden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Developer Direct's mystery game</a>, it's worth reminding Microsoft explained it would be a brand new game, so it can't be a remake. Besides, the latest rumor from Windows Central <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-2025-predictions-and-overview-microsofts-most-promising-games-line-up-in-history-meets-a-platform-under-duress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">points</a> to a new installment in an established Japanese franchise with 'decades of history.'</p>
<p>Still, there's too much smoke surrounding this The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake to be false. It is likely coming, and possibly even relatively soon. It's certainly peculiar that it might be announced on the release year of <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skyblivion</a>, the total conversion mod that aims to port Oblivion to the newer engine of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. When I last spoke to Skyblivion project lead Rebelzize, he didn't seem too worried about it.</p>
<p>Would you be more excited about an UE5-powered official remake or for Skyblivion? Let us know in the poll and the comments below.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is one of 2025’s most anticipated games. It’s a direct continuation of the 2018 title that introduced Warhorse Studios’ open-world RPG universe to the wider gaming community. Like many games these days, many players are asking one question about this impending release: ‘Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 coming to Game Pass?’</p>



<p>Let’s dive into that topic and find out if this game will be released on Xbox or PC Game Pass – or both.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-will-kingdom-come-be-on-game-pass">Will Kingdom Come Be On Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will not be on Game Pass at launch</strong>, but it could be added to the service further down the line. In 2019, the first Kingdom Come title was added to Game Pass – but it has since been removed.</p>



<p>Those seeking to enjoy Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on Xbox and PC will need to do so after paying full price for the game.</p>



<p>When Kingdom Come Deliverance was added to Game Pass all those years ago, it was still a relatively unknown, assuming title – little more than an indie release at that point. This time around, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a highly anticipated, epic title backed by a big publisher and years of development. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-kingdom-come-being-added-to-ps-plus">Is Kingdom Come Being Added to PS Plus?</h2>



<p><strong>There’s no indication that Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be added to PS Plus</strong> – it’s the same situation as the Game Pass question.</p>



<p>Towards the end of 2022, Kingdom Come Deliverance appeared on PS Plus. It was removed a few months later at the start of 2023, just a short while before the follow-up title was announced.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be released on February 4, 2025. Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> if you intend to buy the game when it’s out.</p>

                <p>Path of Exile 2 Patch 0.1.1 launches later this week and developer Grinding Gear has now previewed what to expect from it.. According to game director Jonathan Rogers, this patch primarily addresses issues developer Grinding Gear can address "relatively quickly," such as endgame maps and enemy balance.</p><p>You can see some of the details in a new video on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNJSDxwC9bY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Path of Exile YouTube</a> channel. Endgame mapping (i.e. the autogeneration of levels) have received a balance overhaul, altering the number of chests, number of monsters, and lots of other variables. Four new "Tower" maps have been added, and the first Tower map, Lost Towers, has been redesigned to be "less boring." More endgame maps will include bosses, correcting a glitch that causes fewer bosses to spawn than intended.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNJSDxwC9bY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XNJSDxwC9bY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Pinnacle content has gotten some tweaks too. You'll be able to see citadels from further away in the fog of war making them easier to find. You'll also get up to six respawns for the pinnacle boss The Arbiter of Ash. The respawns can only be activated by the player who put in the keys at the Burning Monolith and they affect every player in your party at once. Respawns will be added to other Pinnacle content soon.</p><p>In other changes, lower-level unique items have gotten buffs to make them more fun to use. The patch makes effects more visible, both by removing clutter from some maps and by redesigning existing effects. Many monsters and bosses have gotten significant balance changes, such as some attacks not being triggerable when the enemy is off-screen.</p><p>Rogers noted that if a specific issue isn't discussed in this patch that does not mean that Grinding Gear is not aware of it or that it will not get addressed. You can look for the full patch notes when the patch launches. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-into-path-of-exile-2-early-access/1100-6527842/" data-ref-id="1100-6527842">Path of Exile 2 will eventually be free-to-play,</a> but if you want to get early access, you'll have to shell out some cash.

		<p>Futurlab’s CEO Kirsty Rigden has announced that the studio will be stopping support of PowerWash Simulator VR, noting that it is costing more to continue supporting the game than it brings in. As a result the team behind PowerWash Simulator VR will be moved to other projects within the studio, to fill gaps that were being advertised. The full statement can from Kirsty can be read below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Powerwash Simulator | VR Official Launch Trailer | Meta Quest Platform" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_eu5HLdouYU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Dear VR Washers,&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I am sorry to let you know that we won’t be continuing support of PowerWash Simulator VR. We absolutely love and believe in VR, so this doesn’t mean we won’t support it in the future but we aren’t able to continue with support right now. We have been faced with a cross roads: we have a truly excellent and kind VR team who were working on a platform which costs us more than it makes, while also having a list of job openings that were looking to be filled on other projects. We took the decision to redeploy our VR team into those projects/roles. Whilst I would love to live in a world where we could support PowerWash Simulator VR on every platform going, I will always choose job security for my team. Every time. While I know that you must be so disappointed, I also know that if you were in my position you would have made the same decision.</em></p>
<p><em>Kirsty Rigden, CEO, Futurlab</em></p>

<p>FuturLab has made a proper go of supporting PowerWash Simulator VR, with having regularly released new content for it including the SpongeBob Squarepants and Back to the Future packs. The decision to protect jobs in an industry that has seen thousands lose their jobs, with studios shutting down at a high rate, is one that is understandable.</p>

<p>In our PowerWash Simulator VR review, Dom said, <em>“Powerwash Simulator VR is the ultimate evolution of Futurlab’s astoundingly satisfying smash hit, effortlessly translating the calming clean ’em up to virtual reality.”</em></p>

Well, years ago Valve implemented cool stuff like Steam achievements, game cards, and badges. These are great features that incentivize people to play and buy more games. However, not long after these features were added to Steam, some shady devs started creating very basic “games” that were just designed to pad achievements, give players cheap cards to trade, and increase their collection stats. So Valve came up with a solution to stop that stuff. </p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As explained by Valve via its Steam documentation website,</a></span> games arrive on Steam “limited” and missing features like trading cards. Only games that meet a certain (undisclosed) popularity and sales threshold are able to escape this limited status. The idea is that this is a quality check against shovelware and scams. And if you’re curious how many games released on Steam in 2024 are limited, well, the answer is <em>a lot</em>. </p><p>Over on LinkedIn, Twitch’s head of games Bill Young <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/youngbill_19k-games-were-published-on-steam-in-2024-activity-7283203637084876801-IMZx/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/youngbill_19k-games-were-published-on-steam-in-2024-activity-7283203637084876801-IMZx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted an interesting breakdown</a></span> of how the majority of video game releasing on Steam these days are limited. According to SteamDB, in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2024 18,992 games were released on Steam</a></span>. But only <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/?tagid=1003823&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/?tagid=1003823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4,041 of those games</a></span> racked up enough sales and attracted enough players to escape limited status. That means 14,951 games launched last year on Valve’s digital PC storefront were barely played or purchased. </p><p> That 14,951 works out to 79% of all games released on Steam in 2024. And this isn’t a new trend, as pointed out by Young. In 2020, 66 percent of all games launched on Steam were limited. In 2022, that number reached 72 percent. And now, it’s up to nearly 80 percent. If you’re curious about how 2025 is going to shake out, well, we’re only 13 days into the year and 444 games have already released on Steam. 389 of them are limited.</p><p>Some might argue that Valve shouldn’t throttle or limit any of these games. But the reality is that we would likely see an increase in shovelware, scams, and asset flips if Valve completely took down the barriers it currently has in place. And I don’t think the world needs 200,000 random games suddenly flooding Steam. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty is a series that boasts one of the most diverse multiplayer-based gaming ecosystems in the industry. From a popular battle royale game to a thriving mobile platform, Call of Duty is known and loved by hundreds of millions of gamers around the world. However, the game almost <strong>requiring </strong>an internet connection to work means that players will often run into issues. </p>



<p>In this guide, I’m going to help answer one core question: ‘Is Call of Duty down?’ If it <strong>is</strong>, we’ll let you know how to get back online as soon as possible.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cod-server-status-guide">COD Server Status Guide</h2>



<p>It’s relatively simple to find out if Call of Duty is offline, whether that’s Black Ops 6, Warzone, or Call of Duty Mobile. If you’re finding that Call of Duty is down for you, you can access the following link and check out COD’s server status:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://support.activision.com/onlineservices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision Support Server Status Page</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>It’s typically updated in real-time, but what if Call of Duty is down for you even if that status page reflects that everything is fine from a technical standpoint?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-call-of-duty-down-here-s-what-you-can-do">Is Call of Duty Down? Here’s What You Can Do</h2>



<p>Let’s say you’re enjoying a Call of Duty session and suddenly you find that Black Ops 6 is offline for no real reason. What do you do in that situation?</p>



<p>Firstly, you can check the status page as referenced above. It’s also a good idea to check out Down Detector, a service that allows users to report issues with games, applications, and websites. Failing that, consider jumping onto social media and running a search with a term like this:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘Is Black Ops 6 down’</li>



<li>‘Is Call of Duty down’</li>



<li>‘Is Warzone down’</li>



<li>And so on…</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re racking your brain for an answer, consider reaching out to <a href="https://twitter.com/ATVIAssist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Activision Support team</a> on Twitter (X). </p>



<p>There are a few generic networking tips you can take advantage of if you’re still not finding an answer. For instance, you can try rebooting your device (a hard reset if possible), using a wired or alternate connection, rebooting your router, or taking the last-ditch action to simply wait, play something else, and come back later.</p>



<p>If Call of Duty is down at that moment, it might not be in an hour or two.</p>
