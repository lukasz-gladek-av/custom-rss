            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>The first time I played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/red_dead_redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> was, of course, the day it launched. 2010 really doesn't seem all that long ago at all, but there was a level of expectation and excitement to those opening moments in Rockstar's utterly wild West that I <em>do</em> feel I haven't experienced in a very long time indeed.</p>
<p>It was an excitement that had me on my phone to an equally exuberant friend (we'd been to buy our copies together earlier that day, like something out of a Dickens novel), as we both gawped in amazement at this incredible recreation of a lost world. Do games still drop jaws in the same way that a big Rockstar joint used to back in the day?</p>
<p>As the camera settled on John Marston aboard the game's opening train ride, as we started to get a gauge on just how no-holds-barred and authentic this particular cowboy adventure was gonna be, there was an air of something special, of a game that might just be everything we'd wanted and more besides. And it was!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/red-dead-redemption">I reviewed Red Dead Redemption on Switch</a> for its 2023 release, so check that out for a full run-through of the finer details of the game itself. However, I <em>'only'</em> gave it an 8/10, which may seem odd given all the gilding of its lily I've just done above this very paragraph. But a lack of multiplayer, alongside a lack of polish overall, meant it had to go down as a barebones port. Still amazing in its narrative and gameplay, but in need of TLC. It was eminently playable, and already looked nice, though, so you were in safe (if unspectacular) hands on Switch.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:154041 @ 1764705604 -->
<p>This Switch 2 update, on paper, gives us the basics and no more, too. Oh, you've given it more resolution, have you? Increased the frame rate? Well done. But wait. We've now got mouse controls for fine-aiming, and they feel really good. Also, and as expected as resolution or frame rate increases are nowadays, my goodness, it really does look and feel very nice indeed. Have I ever played this game at 60fps before? I'm beginning to wonder, because I'm sure it's never played this nicely.</p>
<p>Remember the journey into Mexico, that magical bit with the music, the showstopping part? It's all the more magical when you can see the very dust in the air, the shimmering heat haze in the distance now as clear as day thanks to pristine visuals. HDR is really helping to make things pop in comparison to the older port, that's for sure.</p>
<p>Yes, there's still no multiplayer, but it now feels as though the game is being presented on a Nintendo console in a manner befitting such an epic slice of gaming history. With slick controls, DLSS, HDR, volumetric effects, options to personalise mouse mode, 60fps that felt flawless, and a resolution bump that's got it looking super sharp, this is a gem that <em>still</em> feels modern, immediate, and relentlessly replayable on Switch 2. Now that's rootin' tootin', partners!</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1370899</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Santa Ragione's horror game, Horses, <a href="https://wccftech.com/santa-ragione-new-horror-game-horses-might-be-its-last-steam-ban/">getting banned on Steam with only vague reasons to back up its ban</a> was an additional tally on the year for Valve getting mixed up in controversy <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-accused-of-removing-games-from-steam-at-russia-request-flick-solitaire/">regarding what it allows and what it doesn't allow on Steam</a>. Epic Games Store, seemingly, felt out of the loop, so it decided to join the fray by also disallowing Horses to release on its digital storefront, even though it was previously slated to arrive alongside launches at <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses?hmb_source=search_bar">Humble</a>, and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/">Itch.io</a> today, December 2, 2025.</p>



<p>The difference, however, is typical of the difference between Epic Games Store and Steam. Whatever Steam does, the Epic Games Store does worse. When Steam banned Horses, it did so based on an early, unfinished version of the game, and kept its exact reasoning and policies around why it was banned vague enough, preventing Santa Ragione from refuting direct issues Valve seemingly had with the game.</p>



<p>Epic Games, however, banned Horses approximately 24 hours before it was set to launch on the EGS. Per <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html#Q17">Santa Ragione's website for Horses</a>, Epic told the Italian indie developer that it is "<em>Unable to distribute Horses on the Epic Games Store because our review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies.</em>"</p>







<p>The email continued, "<em></em><em>The ‘Inappropriate Content’ policy prohibits content which 'contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated.' The ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policy prohibits content that promotes abuse and animal abuse.</em> <em>This content is prohibited by our Guidelines and cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store. Additionally, when we [Epic] filled out the IARC Questionnaire based on the content that we reviewed, it received an Adult Only (AO) rating. Products with AO ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store (the only exception is for products in cases where an AO rating was applied solely due to the usage of blockchain or NFT technology).</em>"</p>



<p>But prior to this email, Horses was set to be available on the EGS and had been approved for release on the store. So what changed? That's the million-dollar question, it would seem, especially because elements that Epic is claiming are in the game simply aren't there, according to Santa Ragione.</p>



<p>"<em>The game does NOT contain explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior," </em>the studio claims in a statement<em>. "All nudity in the game is completely censored via pixelation. There is never any visible sexual act involving genitalia and all animations are stylized and unrealistic. Additionally, in the three hours of gameplay contained in the game, there are only four brief and censored sexual sequences, with two of them happening mainly off camera</em>...<em>the content presented does not in any way promote abuse (including animal abuse). The game is a strong critique of violence and abuse in general.</em>"</p>



<p>Santa Ragione also pointed out that when it filled out the IARC Questionnaire as part of the process to get approved for release on the EGS in the first place, it received a PEGI 18 and M for Mature rating, not an AO rating.</p>



<p>Even with these reminders, and Santa Ragione begging its contact at Epic Games Store to consider the fact that builds of this game had been approved multiple times, with a final achievement build getting approved well over two weeks ahead of launch. Santa Ragione received no reply from its contact, instead getting an automated message that its appeal had been denied. Epic also failed to point to a specific instance of content within Horses it took issue with, so even if Santa Ragione wanted to make changes to release on EGS, it doesn't know where Epic believes the problem lies.</p>



<p>The whole way this story has evolved is extremely unfortunate, because here is an indie developer whose work revolves around trying to elevate the kinds of stories we can tell in video games, the subject matter tackled, and how more serious issues are tackled, that will likely now be shuttered because it won't be able to recoup development costs for its latest, and now potentially last, release. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, earlier this year, Steam allowed a game <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-game-promoting-sexual-assault-removed-from-sale-in-uk-australia-and-canada/">that directly promoted sexual abuse to appear on its store, and had to be told to remove it</a>, only doing so in select regions. It was the developers themselves who eventually took it down entirely.</p>



<p>One of these games is a commentary and critique on abuse, the other contained explicit abuse and sexual violence for entertainment. It's frankly disturbing that the latter was able to make it onto Steam, while the former isn't given a place on the store at all.</p>

                <p>Obsidian has announced that the planned fall update for Avowed is not going to make it on time. The features planned for the update are still coming, but they are now going to be wrapped into a "larger update" instead in February 2026 to celebrate the game's first anniversary.</p><p>"This update will include everything originally planned for fall, plus additional features that will make it our biggest update yet. Stay tuned as we head into the new year for more details on what’s planned for the Living Lands," the developer <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1995917924708876634" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>Avowed previously got spring and summer updates that added things like a no-spiders mode and custom map markers.

"Avowed's impactful and satisfying combat is undone by a widely unbalanced upgrade system and an uninteresting story that wastes its potential," reviewer Alessandro Barbosa said.</p><p>Like all of Microsoft's other games, Avowed is available with Xbox Game Pass. The game's director, Carrie Patel, said she was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-want-more-avowed-so-does-the-games-director/1100-6529664/" data-ref-id="1100-6529664">interested in making more Avowed</a>, but no sequel has been announced as of yet and Patel has since left Obsidian.</p><p>Avowed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-was-originally-pitched-with-multiplayer-like-destiny-mixed-with-skyrim/1100-6529651/">was originally pitched as a multiplayer-centric game that married Destiny with Skyrim</a>.

                <p>Veteran games executive and former Nexon CEO, Owen Mahoney, believes the video game industry is on the cusp of a massive transformation--and that AI is at the center of it. He argues that AI is already integrated into many aspects of game development, from asset production to testing tools, and that its impact will only intensify.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/the-man-who-signed-arc-raiders-the" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Mahoney explains that the AAA sector is facing what he bluntly calls an "end-of-days" moment. Costs are skyrocketing, development cycles are slowing, and publishers are becoming increasingly risk-averse, adding that the industry often misunderstands where value truly comes from.</p><p>Responding to examples of failed studios with prestigious founders, Mahoney says, "The examples that you just gave were, 'We bought this company because five years ago they made some game. So, therefore they're good.' It doesn’t work that way at all," and insists that the "game companies are really just collections of people." He believes that success depends on understanding their motivation and creative drive, not past hits.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_KdS6TNHL8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W_KdS6TNHL8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Mahoney contrasts Embark's success with the broader structural problems holding AAA development back. He describes the impossible situation faced by public-company CEOs.</p><p>"You're running a $23 billion company. And you have to make a decision, in a very short period of time, to greenlight a project ... if that new project doesn't do well, you're going to be explaining to your board why you burnt $300 million in company cash," he said.</p><p>He continues that one failure is survivable, but "if you do it again, they're going to be calling openly for your head, and by the third time you'll have an activist investor." Mahoney thinks this kind of pressure makes executives fund only familiar ideas, worsening the cycle. "The AAA industry is structurally at its end," he adds.</p><p>Despite this bleak diagnosis, Mahoney is optimistic about what AI could unlock. He acknowledges that AI has "an unbelievable ability to create a lot of slop, but so does Photoshop." He even argues that audiences will continue "rejecting slop and bad product and only demanding good product."</p><p>More importantly, he sees AI as a force that will empower smaller teams, shorten development timelines, and introduce entirely new forms of play, just as the internet once did. "I continue to believe that the industry will probably triple in the next five to seven years. Just like every major wave [of technology] has had a major positive impact on the video games industry. The nature of the medium itself is changing, and that’s very, very good for us."</p>

<p>This is the fourth game Styx has appeared in, making his debut in Of Orcs and Men which has led to a now trilogy of games starring the goblin assassin. In this new adventure, Styx is after the new mystical powers provided by quartz, which give him abilities like mind control. These abilities will be used alongside Styx’s shadowy skills and various gadgets to help in his mission to get the quartz.</p>

<p>In our preview of Styx: Blades of Greed, Stefan said, <em>“It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun, and I’m looking forward to the game’s release later this year.”</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-agrees-to-pause-light-of-motiram-promotion-while-horizon-clone-lawsuit-continues/</link>
            <guid>1370842</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Tencent and Sony have agreed to a later hearing date for the Horizon clone lawsuit if Light of Motiram pauses its promotion and public testing. </p>



<p>Sony has been fighting Tencent in court for allegedly ripping off elements from PlayStation’s Horizon series for their upcoming title, Light of Motiram. Tencent has filed a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-claps-back-at-sony-playstations-horizon-clone-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">motion to dismiss</a> this case, whereas Sony has filed for an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-files-injunction-to-bar-tencent-from-using-any-resemblance-to-horizons-aloy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">injunction</a>. Both entities have now agreed on delaying these hearings, however, with some conditions. </p>











<p>According to a new order filed yesterday by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-promote-light-of-motiram-run-public-tests-sony-horizon-lawsuit-2026-hearing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, there are some new developments in Sony and Tencent’s Horizon clone lawsuit. It seems that both entities have &nbsp;“engaged in discussions in order to resolve the current dispute.” These discussions have led to Sony Interactive Entertainment and Tencent Entities agreeing to extend the briefing schedule and to a later requested hearing date; however, these come with some conditions. </p>



<p>Sony and Tencent have agreed on four conditions to extend the hearing: </p>



<ul>
<li>Firstly, the extension “will not be used to argue that SIE delayed in seeking a preliminary injunction.” </li>



<li>Secondly, there can be “no new promotion or public testing of Light of Motiram during the pendency of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction.” </li>



<li>Thirdly, the release date of Light of Motiram cannot be “moved up to before Q4 2027.”</li>



<li>Lastly, Tencent Entities “will not seek expedited discovery in connection with the Motion for Preliminary Injunction.”</li>
</ul>







<p>Due to the new extension, Tencent’s deadline to file its response to Sony’s preliminary injunction is now December 17, 2025, instead of December 3. Sony must file its Reply in Support by January 2, 2026. Both entities will also request that Judge Jacqueline Corley hear the injunction and the motion to dismiss simultaneously on January 29, 2026, rather than on January 15. </p>



<p>In other news, Tencent’s last response to the lawsuit was “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-responds-to-sony-horizon-clone-lawsuit-fame-does-not-create-a-trademark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fame does not create a trademark</a>.” What are your thoughts on Tencent pausing Light of Motiram’s promotion?

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too</link>
            <guid>1370839</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, we reported that disturbing horror game Horses had been banned from Steam, with developer Santa Ragione claiming that Valve refused to provide a clear reason for the ban or discuss it further with the studio. Now, at the last possible minute before the game was set to release widely across other PC store fronts, Epic Games Store has also banned Horses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This news was shared with us by Santa Ragione, who passed on a press release stating that Epic informed them 24 hours before the game's release that it would not be distributing Horses, despite the studio's build being approved for release weeks earlier. Per the developer, no specifics on what content was at issue were provided, "only broad and demonstrably incorrect claims that it violated their content guidelines." The studio has shared the text of the email sent to them from Epic banning the game, which an Epic Games Store representative has confirmed is accurate. It is as follows:</p><blockquote>We are unable to distribute Horses on the Epic Games Store because our review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies. The ‘Inappropriate Content’ policy prohibits content which “contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated.” The ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policy prohibits content that promotes abuse and animal abuse. This content is prohibited by our Guidelines and cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store. Additionally, when we [Epic] filled out the IARC Questionnaire based on the content that we reviewed, it received an Adult Only (AO) rating. Products with AO ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store (the only exception is for products in cases where an AO rating was applied solely due to the usage of blockchain or NFT technology). You have some options on how to move forward: 1. You can make updates to your product to ensure compliance and resubmit it for review. 2. If you believe we made a mistake, you also have the ability to appeal this decision. You can appeal by replying to this email or creating a private discussion on our Developer Support site. Select "Epic Games Store" as the topic. 3. You cannot change the title or content to repurpose it for another game. If you choose not to move forward, we'll refund your submission fee for this product.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">When Santa Ragione appealed, the studio says it was denied 12 hours later "without further explanation." Notably, the studio has also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3m6zktxf4q222" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated on social media</a> that its own IARC Questionnaire submission came back with an "M" for "Mature" rating rather than "AO". It is unclear what caused the discrepancy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Santa Ragione explains the situation:</p><blockquote>Epic's decision comes after the overwhelming support Santa Ragione received last week upon the disclosure of Steam's ban, including the public announcement by Epic's and Steam's competitor GOG that they would promote and support the game. We do not know what triggered Epic's sudden decision. Following the announcement of Steam's ban, Horses became highly visible online, with strong support and a small but vocal opposition. It is difficult not to wonder whether this visibility played a greater role in Epic's choice than any newly discovered issue with the game itself.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN asked Epic Games for comment, and received the following statement from an Epic Games spokesperson: "We set clear <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/content-guidelines" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guidelines</a> for the content that can be distributed on the Epic Games Store and found violations of those guidelines during our extensive review."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of this article's publication, Horses is <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">still listed as "Coming Soon"</a> on the Epic Games Store.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Horses Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Horses was previously revealed several years ago, and has made appearances in showcases like The Indie Horror Showcase and Day of the Devs. It's gained some attention for its deeply unsettling premise: a young man travels to a remote horse farm to work for several weeks over the summer, only to find the farmer's "horses" are actually enslaved, naked humans with horse masks affixed to their heads. Horses, says Santa Ragione, is meant to be upsetting: it's at least partly a commentary on what sorts of morally horrifying things people will accept or even participate in without pushback, a subject we found was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review">executed artfully, if upsettingly, in our 7/10 review of the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet, the game has been banned from now both Steam and Epic. Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">we reported</a> that developer Santa Ragione said it was rejected from Steam after the team submitted an unfinished but playable build of the game in order to create a store page, an unusual request that Valve said was necessary. Valve then rejected Horses, generally citing its Steam Onboarding Documentation, as well as the sentence, "Regardless of a developer’s intentions with their product, we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Santa Ragione has since guessed this was in relation to a scene in the game at the time that depicted a fully clothed child "riding" one of the horses on their shoulders. However, the studio says it has since changed that scene to involve an adult instead of a child, and that all characters in the game are clearly adults in their 20s and up, a fact that has remained true in the final version of the game that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review">IGN reviewed</a>, ironically, on the Epic Games Store. Santa Ragione says it was not given the opportunity to resubmit a build to be reconsidered by Valve, and remains unsure if this scene was even what triggered the ban in the first place. The studio claims that without being able to reach Steam's much larger audience, it is likely it will have to shut down following the launch of Horses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Valve issued a statement claiming it "gave the developer feedback about why we couldn’t ship the game on Steam, consistent with our onboarding rules and guidelines" and that its internal content review team discussed a re-review "extensively" but decided against it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horses is now available on itch.io, GOG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekts-pc-game-storefront-gog-gets-behind-horses-after-valve-steam-ban-players-should-be-able-to-choose-the-experiences-that-speak-to-them">(which publicly expressed support for the game last week</a>), and Humble (which Santa Ragione says confirmed to the studio it would be available).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review</link>
            <guid>1370830</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it be games, films, paintings, or any other form of creative endeavor, art has long been a vehicle for transgression and subversion, providing curious observers an avenue to ruminate on uncomfortable, often taboo aspects of society. Take David Lynch’s surreal horror epic Lost Highway, or Half Mermaid’s mesmerising puzzle mystery <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/immortality-review"><u>Immortality</u></a> – their uncompromising and dark ambience leaves you changed, and often with more questions than answers. Horses, the latest game from developer Santa Ragione, uses the medium to tell its own morally challenging story, asking you to complete increasingly distressing tasks as a naive farmhand. Guaranteed to make you uncomfortable, Horses is an affecting first-person horror game that, despite a few pacing and signposting issues, tells a story that is sure to stick with you, whether you want it to or not. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get too deep, it’s worth mentioning that Santa Ragione does provide a lengthy content warning before you begin playing due to its heavy subject matter. It details the themes you’ll encounter, which include gory imagery, psychological abuse, and suicide. That warning goes on to explain that you will also likely take part in activities that are oppositional to your own moral beliefs. How you feel about what Horses asks of you is ultimately very personal. Still, I was pleased to see the developers clearly outline what’s ahead for those who may struggle with certain moments, as I did — you should take this warning seriously.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You step into the boots of Anselmo, a troubled 20-year-old who's been shipped away from college to work on a rural farm for two weeks at the behest of his parents. It becomes immediately apparent that something is wrong here, though, as you meet the titular horses, who are in fact naked humans with horse masks permanently affixed on their heads. From this point forward, almost every action you complete, from simple farming tasks to tormenting veterinarian work, is intentionally intended to make you feel conflicted as Horses forces you to participate in the farmer’s sick power fantasy. Over approximately three hours, I was compelled and constantly curious, but still found myself struggling to push through the haunting world Santa Ragione has conjured, with its grey moral code and disturbing paraphernalia. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horses is, in effect, an interactive silent film, with unsettling lines of dialogue delivered through old-timey title cards amongst a smattering of live-action and 3D animated sequences with limited first-person interactions between them. Every scene plays out in black and white, and you’ll be held captive staring at the farmer’s mouth as it enunciates monologues through vile grins, spliced with real-world footage of vegetables being watered (as well as other, far more troubling visuals I wouldn’t want to spoil here). A minimal soundscape adds to the off-putting atmosphere, buffeted by the constant whirring of film that taunts you at all times, ensuring you feel isolated as you endure the weeks of work. This blend of audiovisual torment is unnerving from the start, and only escalates as you catapult closer to the striking finale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the dawn of each day, you’re provided a list of tasks to complete, like feeding the dog, chopping firewood, and cleaning the stables of the horses. The jobs are seldom as simple as they seem on paper, and often lead to confronting scenes that gradually illuminate the farmer's goals, and how the horses came to be his “property.” Your inventory is limited, and you can only handle two items at a time. As such, you’ll often find yourself running back and forth across the small map, between pens, the tool shed, and the house. As much as it is an open space, the threatening elements within it are constantly shifting and smartly toying with your expectations. NPCs like the farmer’s dog, Fido – another subjugated human in a mask – can and will move around the space, complicating your jobs, and often giving you a fright. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Avoiding too many specifics, at one point I was responsible for finding horses that had gotten loose and returning them to their cramped stall unharmed. The search eventually led me out the front gates, where I witnessed a confronting interaction between a horse outside the gates and one still trapped inside. Such unusual moments ramp up in intensity over the course of Horses' runtime, effectively reinforcing the starkness of the world around their nightmarish, hay-filled isolation.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Horses Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Across the summer, you’ll meet a handful of curiously animated locals who are complicit with the farmer's actions, including a veterinarian, a wealthy businessman, his daughter, and a knowing priest. While there isn’t a ton of dialogue to cycle through in these short interactions, the unnerving writing and sinister characterisation of each citizen increased my sense of dread as it became clear that your freedom, in life or on the farm, isn’t a guarantee. As the inevitability of my new reality came into focus and the trepidation set in, I found myself questioning the farmers' treatment not just of the ‘animals’ or the outsiders, but of me. What misstep could I make that would land me in his prison? This is the central qualm you’ll ponder during and after your time with Horses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The horror doesn’t end with the working day, of course, and occasionally, when the sun sets, Anselmo slips into a dreamlike state where reality bleeds into their imagination. In these moments, the spectre of the farmer and his sexual and religious trauma manifests through dark allegories that you experience in a raw, challenging, and uncensored format. Instead of relying on text dumps, Horses’ penchant for sharp dialogue and symbolic iconography gives the player room to unpack its singular, heavy story.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sarah's favourite indie horror games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a shame, then, that with such a strong concept, there are a handful of comparatively mundane signposting issues throughout that can muddle the pacing, leaving you to pixel hunt for the right piece of equipment or overthink simple puzzles when you could have been contemplating one of Horses’ many jarring visual metaphors. For example, one day I simply needed to feed the horses – but despite meeting the basic requirements, nothing changed, and I was unable to prompt the farmer to provide further information. With no clear next step, I searched the area until I happened to find a specific item I didn’t know I needed to progress. In a game that feels so intentional and curated, such moments kill the ambience, and it feels awkward to wander around aimlessly in this psychologically punishing environment, especially when you’ve been imbued with the impetus to solve its mysteries. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like a pile of sugar cubes, Horses often has you in the palm of its hand, but unlike other, more cohesively arresting horror games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mouthwashing-review"><u>Mouthwashing</u></a> or No, I’m Not A Human, Santa Ragione’s attempt struggles to keep you there. The low-stakes gameplay feels like the culprit here, as there’s not much to chew on if you’re not gripped by the unfolding story and its characters. A short runtime only magnifies these limitations, messing with the cadence of an otherwise well-orchestrated experience. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Horses is a chilling, nerve-shredding short story that propels you through a series of increasingly heinous farm tasks. Sharp writing of morally repugnant characters creates a harrowing atmosphere, which is frustratingly diminished by repetitive activities and unclear signposting that sometimes pull you out of its silent film-like world. Even so, developer Santa Ragione’s admirably bracing vision does well to harness what can make the interactivity of video games so affecting, ensuring you’ll have plenty to think about as the credits roll.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the hallmarks of Cyberpunk 2077, particularly after its Phantom Liberty update, is its dynamic police chases. In these, a player <em>committing crimes</em> might find themselves quick surrounded by cops and, a few crimes later, the extra spicy MaxTac. But what you might not have caught onto is that when trying to avoid this massive swarm of cops, you're essentially playing a really, really sophisticated version of a very, very old arcade game: Pac-Man.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the Game Industry Conference in Poznań, Wielkopolska, I attended a talk by CD Projekt senior AI programmer Maciej Celmer entitled "Heat, MaxTac, and Blockades: Police System, in Cyberpunk 2077 and more." In the talk, Celmer went into a lot of interesting detail about how exactly Cyberpunk 2077's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-details-cyberpunk-2077s-revamped-police-system-coming-alongside-phantom-liberty">police chase system was revamped</a> following criticism from players that at launch, the system was way too forgiving and unengaging.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new system, implemented in 2023, was far more dynamic and popular with players. And according to Celmer, it had an unusual inspiration: Pac-Man.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Remember the game of Pac-Man, and the fact that every ghost had a different approach on how to catch the player?" Celmer said during his talk. "We did a similar thing in our car chases. For instance, one of them can try to reach the player on the shortest possible path, while the other can try to flank him or intercept on the intersection. There are seven different strategies that we applied to our cars with that part of the chase."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We reached out to CD Projekt following the talk to get a little more detail on what Celmer meant. Over email, he confirmed that Pac-Man was one of "many" inspirations for the police chase update, "especially for the designers who came up with the idea. We wanted to surround the player with chasing vehicles but, at the same time, always try to leave at least one 'road to freedom' — basically, a way to escape. However, the situation in Night City, especially during a chase, can be very dynamic, so 'try' is definitely the right word here."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Celmer broke down the aforementioned seven "strategies" that police cars would take in a chase for us too. Each strategy combined a mix of logic for where the vehicle would spawn with its behavior after spawning, and which strategy was used was dependent on the heat level, the state of the police system (relaxed, alerted, or combat) and other factors. From there, cars could also perform different maneuvers depending on the situation, such as ramming, shooting, blocking, overtaking, or aligning with the chased car. The seven strategies were, in Celmer's words:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Drive towards the player — Move directly toward the player in a straight line. Used in the Alerted state.</li><li>Drive away from the player — Move directly away from the player. Used in the Alerted state.</li><li>Patrol the quadrant — Patrol the area around the player.</li><li>Intersection trap — Try to flank the player at the next intersection.</li><li>Get to the player from anywhere — The aggressive one.</li><li>Search for the player — Perform an initial search around the crime scene. Used in the Alerted state.</li><li>Search from anywhere — A fallback strategy used when we can’t find a suitable spawn point for strategy 6, so the car simply spawns anywhere and begins searching for the player.</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The result was, if you look at Cyberpunk 2077's roads from the top down, something like a game of Pac-Man where the ghosts are the police cars chasing the player. In Pac-Man, each ghost has its own strategy it will typically perform, such as Pinky trying to ambush the player or Blinky chasing him directly. "We simply wanted to do something a bit different from other games with similar systems," Celmer said.

      AMD's Radeon RX 7600 GPU is pretty similar to the graphics hardware Valve will ship in the Steam Machine—and its 8GB of dedicated GDDR6 RAM can be a problem.

<p>By Valve’s admission, its upcoming Steam Machine desktop isn’t swinging for the fences with its graphical performance. The specs promise decent 1080p-to-1440p performance in most games, with 4K occasionally reachable with assistance from FSR upscaling—about what you’d expect from a box with a modern midrange graphics card in it.</p>
<p>But there’s one spec that has caused some concern among Ars staffers and others with their eyes on the Steam Machine: The GPU comes with just 8GB of dedicated graphics RAM, an amount that is steadily becoming more of a bottleneck for midrange GPUs like AMD’s Radeon RX 7060 and 9060, or Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4060 or 5060.</p>
<p>In our reviews of these GPUs, we’ve already run into some games where the RAM ceiling limits performance in Windows, especially at 1440p. But we’ve been doing more extensive testing of various GPUs with SteamOS, and we can confirm that in current betas, 8GB GPUs struggle even more on SteamOS than they do running the same games at the same settings in Windows 11.</p>
<p>The good news is that Valve is working on solutions, and having a stable platform like the Steam Machine to aim for should help improve things for other hardware with similar configurations. The bad news is there’s plenty of work left to do.</p>
<h2>The numbers</h2>

<p>We’ve tested an array of dedicated and integrated Radeon GPUs under SteamOS and Windows, and we’ll share more extensive results in another article soon (along with broader SteamOS-vs-Windows observations). But for our purposes here, the two GPUs that highlight the issues most effectively are the 8GB Radeon RX 7600 and the 16GB Radeon RX 7600 XT.</p>
<p>These dedicated GPUs have the benefit of being nearly identical to what Valve plans to ship in the Steam Machine—32 compute units (CUs) instead of Valve’s 28, but the same RDNA3 architecture. They’re also, most importantly for our purposes, pretty similar to each other—the same physical GPU die, just with slightly higher clock speeds and more RAM for the 7600 XT than for the regular 7600.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>This makes it especially easy to identify the performance issues caused by RAM limits—any time the 7600 XT is more than 5 or 10 percent faster than the regular 7600, it means that the game is probably hitting that 8GB ceiling.</p>





<p>Some of the games in our suite, like&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 3</em> and&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> with the ray-tracing effects turned off, perform similarly on both GPUs. But the gap widens for&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em> at 1440p with ray-tracing on, and for other ray-traced games like <em>Returnal</em> and&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, the problems even extend to 1080p. Even&nbsp;<em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em>, hardly the newest entry in the franchise, shows signs of a larger gap between the 7600 and 7600 XT under SteamOS than exists in Windows 11.</p>
<p>If you look at the game-by-game results, you’ll see that SteamOS often trails behind Windows 11 running on the same dedicated GPU hardware, something we’ve also observed on the other dedicated GPUs we’ve tested. This is basically the inverse of what we (and others) have found <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/games-run-faster-on-steamos-than-windows-11-ars-testing-finds/">when testing SteamOS and Windows on handhelds</a>. Add to that the additional problems that SteamOS has with GPUs that have 8GB of VRAM, and it’s clear that Valve has some work to do on the software side before the Steam Machine launches.</p>
<h2>Valve is working on it</h2>
<p>We spoke with Valve software developer Pierre-Loup Griffais, who leads much of the company’s work on SteamOS and the Proton translation layer, about our findings and what they meant for the Steam Machine.</p>
<p>“VRAM management is a topic we have been focusing on, and some of that work is still being done, so the general idea around what you’re describing doesn’t surprise me too much,” Griffais told Ars. “There were some shortcomings there that we’re making progress on. The typical symptom that we’d expect is that once you run out of VRAM, subsequent allocations from the game will spill over to system memory, at which point a drastic performance drop would be observed since the game would partially be rendering to/from system memory across the PCIe bus.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>That description definitely squares with some of what we saw, particularly in&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em> and&nbsp;<em>Returnal</em> under some settings—not just a subtle reduction in performance as in&nbsp;<em>Forza</em> or&nbsp;<em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, but flipbook-y performance that makes games that are playable in Windows unplayable on SteamOS at the same settings.</p>
<p>Griffais wasn’t specific about the fixes planned to address these problems, or about the timeline for rolling them out. But this performance gap is something the company is actively working to address.</p>
<p>“We have some work around improving video memory management that’s about to get merged into SteamOS main [a testing branch of SteamOS, separate from the Steam Deck’s stable channel] that should improve things there,” Griffais told Ars.</p>
<p>Up until now, memory management simply hasn’t been an issue for SteamOS, at least not for hardware like the Steam Deck and the Legion Go S that Valve is officially supporting. That’s partly because these systems’ slower integrated GPUs will usually bottleneck performance way before a lack of video RAM will. But one benefit of integrated GPUs is that, because they use your system’s main RAM rather than their own dedicated pool of high-speed memory, they can use essentially as much of your system RAM as they need to. Framework uses it as a selling point for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/review-framework-desktop-is-a-mash-up-of-a-regular-desktop-pc-and-the-mac-studio/">its Framework Desktop</a>—its Radeon RX 8050S and 8060S GPUs are in the same general performance class as the RX 7600, but can access <a href="https://frame.work/desktop?tab=machine-learning">between 24GB and 96GB</a> of the PC’s pool of system RAM.</p>
<p>In short, the Steam Machine will be Valve’s first officially supported hardware that actually needs to <em>care</em> about a fixed allotment of video memory. The Steam Machine’s 8GB of VRAM is still going to be a performance limiter for some games, but hopefully Valve’s SteamOS and Proton patches can at least help 8GB GPUs work as well in SteamOS as they do in Windows.</p>

			<p>Destiny 2: Renegades <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-destiny-2-renegades-expansion-ahead-of-launch-next-week/">is out now,</a> and as part of that launch, Bungie has debuted a new cinematic trailer for players to check out, but what players are also likely checking out is the game's concurrent player count on Steam. Now, it needs to be said that concurrent player counts on Steam are not everything; they are not the full picture for any multiplatform game, they are not an indication of sales, and they are not the best measuring stick for the health of multiplatform multiplayer games.</p>



<p>All that said, Steam is, almost undoubtedly, the largest digital storefront and platform for PC players, and the concurrent player counts for multiplayer games on Steam are not exactly a data point that should be easily cast aside.</p>



<p>So, how are Destiny 2's concurrent player numbers now that Renegades is live for all players? Better than they have been since August 2025, and slowly growing to be even better.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>At the time of this writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1085660/charts/#6m">per SteamDB</a>, there are 66,207 players currently playing Destiny 2 on Steam. That's miles better than the <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-player-count-steam-record-low-ahead-of-star-wars-expansion-bungie/">all-time lows recorded in October</a>, and the recent lows of a little more than 1k players recorded just days before the launch. But it is still not better than the launch day for Edge of Fate, Destiny 2's last major expansion release.</p>



<p>When Edge of Fate released, Destiny 2 peaked at 108,535 players on launch day. Of course, the day isn't done yet, and Renegades could prove to beat Edge of Fate's record, though falling short would be the latest sign pointing towards how Destiny 2 has fallen off in the eyes of players. And even if Renegades is able to beat the concurrent player count for Edge of Fate, that doesn't make the expansion an all-out success, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-selling-worse-than-expected-sony-records-impairment-loss/">since even Edge of Fate was a commercial miss for Bungie</a>.</p>



<p>Bungie is fully aware of the fact that players don't hold Destiny 2 in the same regard as they used to. <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-went-beyond-usual-boundaries-for-destiny-2-renegades/">According to a recent interview</a>, it hopes that Renegades will be the start of a better future for the game, while acknowledging where it stumbled following <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-gets-launch-trailer-ahead-of-next-weeks-debut/">the release of The Final Shape</a>. Still, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-3-in-extremely-early-development-according-to-bungie-leakers/">rumors persist that Bungie is working on Destiny 3</a>, which would potentially give the studio the blank slate it needs to try to get players back into the decade-spanning shooter.</p>



<p>But since Destiny 3, if it happens, won't arrive for a while, in the meantime, we'll see how Bungie does when it tries to brute force a commercial success <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-star-wars-expansion-renegades-bungie/">with the backing of Star Wars</a> for its latest major expansion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Nearly ten years ago, I <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-ps4k-ace-will-be-hdr-support-more-than-any-resolution-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote an opinion piece about HDR gaming being the most groundbreaking feature of the upcoming PlayStation 4 console refresh</a>, then known as 'PS4K' and later released on November 10, 2016, as the PlayStation 4 Pro. Initial information suggested that it would deliver HDR support, unlike the base PS4 model; however, Sony later <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps4-400-update-tomorrow-bringing-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rolled it out for regular PlayStation 4 consoles</a> as well.</p>



<p>These specifics aside, the article's core foundation was the belief that HDR gaming was poised to be the next big thing in computer graphics, even more so than 4K (Ultra HD) resolution. There was plenty of evidence to support that being true. Microsoft and AMD had already proclaimed that initial user surveys suggested HDR would be revolutionary and even more impactful than higher resolution. Additionally, unlike rendering a game at a higher resolution, HDR would not negatively impact performance.</p>



<p>Those first few years were indeed highly promising. Leading game developers like <a href="https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-ps4-pro-realize-full-potential-image-hdr-enormous-benefit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Naughty Dog</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-3-dev-see-hdr-cant-unsee-game-connected-weve-ever-made/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Playground Games</a> publicly stated that HDR support would be 'an enormous benefit' and something that 'could not be unseen'. At CES 2017, NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/g-sync-hdr-monitors-available-q2-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its G-SYNC HDR monitors, allowing gamers to enjoy both G-SYNC and HDR support in their games. In July 2018, console manufacturers like Microsoft and Sony, display manufacturers like ASUSTek, HP, LG, Panasonic, Samsung, Toshiba, and Vizio, and game developers like Activision, CAPCOM, EA, Epic Games, Electronic Arts, SIE, Square Enix, Ubisoft, Vicarious Visions, and WB Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdr-gaming-interest-group-formed-optimize/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founded the HDR Gaming Interest Group</a>, or HGiG, to optimize content for viewers.</p>



<p>Everything appeared ready for the HDR revolution, and yet, fast-forwarding to the sad state of the present day forces us to analyze what went wrong. At the end of 2025, now that practically every display you can buy supports HDR in some capacity, some high-profile games still ship without supporting the feature. This year, that was the case with Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, Hades 2, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, ARC Raiders, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (which later received an HDR patch).</p>



<p>It is a literal slap in the face to all those consumers who bought cutting-edge HDR displays capable of achieving peaks of over 2K nits, or candela per square metre, the unit of luminance, whereas Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) displays are stuck at 100 nits. That's not to mention the vastly inferior Rec. 709/sRGB color formats compared to Rec. 2020, which is capable of displaying a much wider color gamut.</p>



<p>Despite this massive technical difference, the overall perception is that nowadays, most developers don't care at all for it. Even those games that technically support the feature often deliver subpar implementations that only serve to tarnish HDR's reputation. One recent example is Silent Hill f, where HDR apparently lacks the color grading the developers had prepared for SDR (which was the internal development reference), resulting in a wildly different look.</p>



<p>I have been in contact with fellow graphics programmer Filippo Tarpini, an industry veteran who has worked at FireSprite and Remedy. At the latter studio, he worked on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-mod-developed-by-remedy-programmer-adds-native-hdr-full-ultrawide-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Control HDR mod</a> (on his own time, and his work was later implemented <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-arch-2025-update-ultra-ray-tracing-dlss-3-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with an official patch</a>), as well as on Alan Wake II's HDR implementation. He also created the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-luma-native-hdr-mod-released-by-all-star-modding-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luma HDR mod for Starfield</a> and other games, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/prey-remastered-luma-mod-adds-hdr-gtao-dlss-and-improves-a-boatload-of-other-things/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prey</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-breaks-players-peak-gets-luma-hdr-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Recently, he founded <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gamma-games-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamma Studios</a>, a (currently) one-man company to help game studios 'improve their post-processing pipelines, implement HDR output, and do modern color grading'.</p>



<p>While he cannot discuss some of the game projects he has worked on lately, he is also working with NVIDIA to integrate HDR into the RTX Remix game remastering platform. Given that Tarpini is one of the foremost experts on the topic, I asked him to chat openly about what's wrong with HDR gaming and what needs to be done to make it shine as bright (literally and figuratively) as it can.</p>

<p><strong>Hello, Filippo. Tell us a bit about yourself.</strong></p>



<p>After years in game development, my focus shifted towards a widely overlooked part of games: tonemapping and grading. Besides having a passion for good looking games, there's literally a whole in this industry where the knowledge for the final parts of "rendering" is scarce and full of misinformation. So I'm trying to come to the rescue of HDR gaming, given that it really deserves to be given more attention.</p>



<p><strong>What is the state of HDR gaming at the end of 2025, in your opinion? Is there a gaming platform that fares slightly better, or are they all at the same level?</strong></p>



<p>I'm sorry to start on a negative note… Let’s just say that out of 25 of the biggest and best games of 2025, half of them don't support HDR and with just a few exceptions, the other half have major defects, like crushed or raised blacks, distorted color hues, clipped or limited highlights, lack of proper calibration settings, bad UI, etc.</p>



<p>In almost all cases, it's clear the game was made on and for SDR, with HDR being an afterthought that only occasionally represents the artistic direction, as it’s easy to tell when SDR was the visual reference, based on its visual consistency. Regarding platforms, there’s usually no difference; almost all games have the same exact HDR implementation. </p>



<p>I personally prefer Sony’s approach over the Microsoft one, but there’s no clear winner. Windows is fine too when it comes to displaying HDR content. The Switch 2’s HDR implementation <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hdr-calibration-settings-are-slammed-even-further-by-expert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn’t seem to be up to standard</a>; however, I haven’t analyzed it myself, so I can’t really judge it.</p>



<p><strong>Why do game developers neglect HDR even when most displays and monitors nowadays ship with HDR capabilities? Is it that troublesome to implement?</strong></p>



<p>I’m not too sure about the state of HDR in monitors as of 2025, as there have been a fair amount of “fake” HDR ones that kinda ruined its reputation in the past; however, most non-entry-level TVs now ship with good to decent HDR! I’ve been trying to get hold of this data, but nobody seems to be tracking it. It’s at least clear that OLED is becoming the new golden standard for mid to high-end displays.</p>



<p>I believe that somehow gamers aren’t aware of the value HDR adds to the gaming experience. Marketing pushes you to care about having the hottest GPU, but nobody is advertising HDR, given there's no single producer behind it. GPU manufacturing companies often approach game studios with proposals to implement Ray Tracing or features exclusive to their GPUs, but none of that happens for HDR. For the reasons above, developers are under the impression that HDR is a niche technology and isn’t worth the effort. As of late 2025, that stance is very outdated! </p>



<p>That said, if you know what you are doing, no, adding HDR is not hard, but it depends on how flexible your game engine is. I’ve seen engines that were very friendly towards adding HDR, and some that weren’t. In Unreal and Unity, which power most current games, enabling HDR is as easy as toggling a checkbox; however, both have major faults in their implementations. Ultimately, it comes down to whether a studio has anybody passionate about post-processing and encoding (‘gamma’); that doesn’t seem to be very common, though development time constraints also play a role.</p>



<p><strong>As a professional game developer, what was your experience when trying to push for more attention in this specific area?</strong></p>



<p>It varies a lot. On average, I would say the care for it is still very low, while the misconceptions are high. A big obstacle with implementing HDR in games is that… they work even without it! All games are essentially starved of budget and development time, so if anything isn’t essential, it doesn’t get added until as late as possible. It’s unclear how much HDR influences sales, but certainly not by a huge margin, so most devs leave it to the last minute, sometimes even adding it post-launch.</p>



<p>Now, why HDR isn’t considered “essential” is a different story. I’ve certainly been confused by the care studios' focus on Ray Tracing and other graphical features that arguably have less impact and are harder to implement, while completely ignoring HDR. When I talk to fellow devs, I feel there’s often a bad feeling towards HDR, as if they were scared of adopting this new technology, away from something they are used to. They often have the misconception that SDR was perfectly standardized while HDR is a hot mess.</p>



<p>Nothing could be further from the truth. SDR, as we know it, was never standardized in either brightness or transfer function, so each TV/Monitor will look very different. Ironically, most common problems with HDR implementations stem from issues with SDR that were carried over due to misinterpretations of its standards. There’s a big disconnect between color standards on paper and what display manufacturers have actually been following for years. These issues went unnoticed for 20 years due to devs being unable to analyze the results from outside of the SDR ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>Is there one triple-A game (that you didn't work on) that does HDR really well by default?</strong></p>



<p>I quite enjoyed the HDR in Dead Space and Red Dead Redemption II. When examining them technically, with a 2025 eye, they both have defects here and there, but they still manage to achieve a good result, partially due to the strong artistry behind them. I believe that with a bit more work, they could have gone down in history for their impressive HDR and even improved the reputation of the technology.</p>



<p>I think some of Sony's AAA games and Call of Duty games also have good HDR, though I haven't played any recently. What I can say, at least, is that these games will look as intended in HDR, because the teams behind them test and carefully balance it.</p>



<p><strong>Now that you run a company to aid developers with HDR, do you think the HDR Den and <a href="https://github.com/Filoppi/Luma-Framework" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luma</a> helped in getting others to know your work?</strong></p>



<p>Yes. The HDR Den is still expanding a lot. We recently opened our Reddit (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HDR_Den/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">r/HDR_Den</a>), with the intent of helping both gamers and developers find information on this "obscure" technology. We got quite a few game developers in the Discord, and there are often interesting technical discussions. We've all been sharing information, and that basically means we can learn much faster than any actual AAA studio could, given we have 5-10 dedicated modders researching this topic night and day, testing things left and right, and sharing the conclusions from their research. </p>



<p>You can't really find this information elsewhere unless you spend months on it yourself. It needs to grow on you organically over time; hence, unless companies have a passionate employee dedicated to post-processing (color grading, tonemapping, etc.) full-time, there’s very little chance they will pull it off successfully. So much can go wrong, and so easily! And that’s what Gamma Studios is all about: I aid developers in implementing or improving HDR in their games, or anything else that has to do with post-processing.</p>



<p>I was indeed contacted by some developers for my work at Remedy and on Luma; however, much of it is also due to me sharing my work on social networks, Reddit, etc. Because of its popularity, my most requested product is my Unreal Engine HDR improvement package. A few games also used the “Luma” open license code and shipped with it! Even Luma is stronger than ever. Recently, a few amazing devs joined the project and pulled off new amazing mods, like a unified mod that turns the TAA implementation of all UE4 games into DLSS/FSR. We recently designed a new way of patching game shaders directly in memory, opening the door for more advanced modding than was ever possible before.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AutoHDR-Windows-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>'When it comes to computers, it's pretty much a disaster: we have half of the monitors with “fake” HDR panels, looking worse than SDR; we have Windows showing SDR content in HDR in a “broken” way (all colors are off); we have Windows upgrading SDR content to HDR (AutoHDR) using an improper formula; we have the two major game engines not doing HDR properly out of the box'.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>What else can be done to increase awareness of the potential benefits of well-crafted HDR in gaming?</strong></p>



<p>Besides Dolby or Samsung pushing their exclusive HDR technologies (<a href="https://wccftech.com/dolby-vision-gaming-is-now-available-on-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dolby Vision</a>/<a href="https://wccftech.com/hdr10-gaming-debuts-with-the-first-descendant-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR10+</a>), or me posting pro-HDR content left and right, there’s not much happening at the moment.</p>



<p>Let’s start from the current situation. Smartphones have fantastic HDR, iPhone videos and photos are now in HDR, and many of the shorts uploaded on Instagram and YouTube are also in HDR. But when it comes to computers, it’s pretty much a disaster:</p>



<ul>
<li>We have half of the monitors with “fake” HDR panels, looking worse than SDR.</li>



<li>We have Windows showing SDR content in HDR in a “broken” way (all colors are off).</li>



<li>We have Windows upgrading SDR content to HDR (<a href="https://wccftech.com/auto-hdr-preview-available-today-on-pc-adds-hdr-support-to-1000-games-that-lacked-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AutoHDR</a>) using an improper formula.</li>



<li>We have the two major game engines not doing HDR properly out of the box.</li>



<li>We have YouTube taking a week to publish a video that was uploaded in HDR.</li>



<li>We need mods like RenoDX or Luma to fix the HDR in most games.</li>
</ul>



<p>Similarly, movies are not doing much better either; in fact, they might even be doing worse. HDR in movies is often literally SDR in an HDR container, or barely 10% brighter than SDR. All of the above damage the reputation and awareness of HDR. So what could be done?</p>



<p>Sony and Microsoft could push developers to use proper encoding and calibration techniques, making these practices part of their quality assurance for games released on their platforms. Stop spreading sRGB, given it’s an abandoned standard. TV manufacturers should more often contact developers for collaborations. A consortium needs to be started to define how games should implement HDR and standardize a set of features.</p>



<p>For example, if the brightness calibration were standardized at the OS level, games wouldn’t need to implement individual calibration menus. Game reviewers could start discussing the HDR implementation and criticizing it when it falls short or is not satisfactory. Spreading the word to the next person on how amazing HDR is.</p>



<p>I strongly believe that in 5 years, people will struggle to play SDR games, as they will look so bad (flat) in comparison to the new ones. There’s no going back! Essentially, every game that comes out with broken HDR will be stuck playing in an inferior way in the future, which makes me quite sad.</p>



<p><strong>The HGiG format was established to promote and standardize HDR gaming. However, calibration settings in games are often very different, and it can be confusing for users to navigate this stuff. Should HGIG (or some other subject) do more in this regard?</strong></p>



<p>HGiG is a passive standard: it’s simply making the TV reproduce an image as it came from the source (e.g., PC/PS5), without altering its average or peak brightness, etc. The alternative to HGiG is dynamic tonemapping, which I think has mostly been surpassed by now.</p>



<p>So, calibrating HDR gaming would actually be an extremely simple thing. I think that most devs are scared of that and often overthink it, causing more confusion than anything. All you need is a game scene and UI brightness sliders. The peak brightness of the display can (and should) be retrieved from the OS. The Alan Wake 2 calibration menu does exactly that, and so do my mods.</p>



<p>We have some games that expose 5 or 6 sliders to users (exposure, HDR average brightness, HDR shadow, HDR highlights, contrast, saturation), allowing users to completely change the look of the game, without a clear indication of how the game is meant to look. I believe these “extended” calibration menus are a consequence of devs being under the misconception that HDR is not properly standardized and that all HDR displays are so different that they need to give users a way to produce a good-looking image.</p>



<p>However, that is not the case! On average, HDR displays are more accurate to the source image than SDR ever was. These menus also often present SDR images in the background that do not represent how the game would actually react to each setting. Ultimately, all this does is cause extra confusion among gamers, scaring them off this new tech, while also making them more likely to mess up the settings and play the game in a way that doesn’t look like the developers intended.</p>



<p>We’ve seen all kinds of questionable behaviors in calibration menus, but the funniest is definitely one (unnamed) game that defaults to 900 nits as paper white! That is blinding and ~4.5 times brighter than the suggested default brightness.</p>



<p>For cases where the user has a display with what essentially is “fake” HDR, we should simply give up on them and use SDR instead. For marketing purposes, these displays take advantage of the loose certification requirements HDR has: many LCDs that don’t have local dimming present a very raised black floor (low contrast) with a low peak brightness (below 400 nits) in HDR mode. The solution for these isn’t to tweak HDR calibration settings until they look good, as often nothing can redeem them; SDR will likely offer a more balanced image.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Dolby-Vision-HDR10-Gaming-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>'Dolby and Samsung have clearly put a lot of effort into improving the situation, and there are real benefits there. However, despite these streamlining efforts, I believe they both ended up with something that is more complicated for devs to implement, with modest returns and limited compatibility.

The upcoming HDR10+ Advanced and Dolby Vision 2 could move the needle further.'</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You mentioned Dolby Vision and HDR10+ earlier in our chat. Do they make any sense in games? Could they be helpful at all for HDR gaming?</strong></p>



<p>I would love for these technologies to play a bigger role in games; right now, though, they still feel more like marketing features than truly transformative tools.</p>



<p>That said, I don’t think the work behind them is wasted. Both Dolby and Samsung have clearly put a lot of effort into improving the situation, and there are real benefits there. However, despite these streamlining efforts, I believe they both ended up with something that is more complicated for devs to implement, with modest returns and limited compatibility.</p>



<p>Since the industry is only just getting comfortable with HDR10, it’s natural that it will take a few more years before we see broader adoption of more advanced formats. The upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/samsung-announces-hdr10-advanced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR10+ Advanced</a> and Dolby Vision 2 could move the needle further, so I’m genuinely curious to see where things go.</p>



<p><strong>Recently, you also criticized developers for making color grading mistakes. How does that happen nowadays? Aren't there tools to help with such processes?</strong></p>



<p>In short, it’s a pity that the artistic intent of the game is so often compromised in HDR. Behind every studio, there are many artists who work hard to craft an image with a specific mood to it. These artists, for the vast majority of the time, work in SDR and do grading and lighting in it. Games’ HDR implementations are still almost always an afterthought done by the tech/engine teams and aren’t artist-driven, so they drift away from the artistic intent that was tightly controlled in SDR.</p>



<p>In these cases, artists themselves won’t be happy with it, and that usually goes one of two ways:</p>



<ul>
<li>They block the game from shipping with HDR (it often happens with Unreal Engine games when they can’t get the look right).</li>



<li>They swallow their pride in favour of marketing and accept the HDR looking different from what they envisioned.</li>
</ul>



<p>Unreal Engine has massively lowered the technical skill floor for developing games. Entire UE AAA games are made with few engine coders and often none on graphics. So, these “color grading” mistakes come down to the devs either not knowing how to do it technically or simply not caring about it.</p>



<p>As mentioned before, finding information on this stuff is nightmarish (don’t even try AI!). Almost all of the art/graphics/images tools out there are stuck in SDR, and entire work pipelines revolve around them. Beyond the HDR Den, there are no public/standardized methods to upgrade SDR pipelines to HDR, so devs try to invent local ways of adapting them, but as mentioned above, color correction is an extremely delicate thing, and one slight change in a math formula can make or break the look of a game, so the results often leave something to be desired.</p>



<p><strong>Is there anything developers could do in terms of graphics rendering that could show off HDR gaming more than it already does? With lighting, for instance?</strong></p>



<p>Yes! Most game engines are doing fine regarding PBR and brightness dynamic range in the scene. However, with one exception (Gran Turismo?), all games are stuck in the Rec. 709/sRGB color space, only occasionally generating colors beyond it during post-processing. We need to move to wider color spaces like Rec. 2020 for albedo (color) textures and light colors as soon as possible. Only then will we have mind-blowing HDR in games. TVs are improving every year, and we are approaching 2500 nits with 90% Rec. 2020 coverage.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time. For the sake of HDR gaming, let's hope enough of your colleagues in game development finally take note.</strong></p>

              <p>Earlier this year, Bungie found itself in the center of <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-alpha-gameplay-posters-antireal-1851780911">an unexpectedplagiarism scandal</a>. The studio’s upcoming extraction shooter, <i>Marathon</i>, was found to have included work lifted from online artist Antireal without her knowledge or consent. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/taucetigg.bsky.social/post/3lpcw5x7qlc26">Bungie fessed up and apologized</a>, claiming it was an accident.</p>   <p>Now, five months after the controversy, the artist, <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1995907613004018047?s=20">Antireal, has posted on X stating</a> that the “<i>Marathon</i> art issue has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Marathon art issue has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction.</p> <p>— N² (@4nt1r34l) <a href="https://twitter.com/4nt1r34l/status/1995907613004018047?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This comes after a few months of silence from both parties. Bungie placed blame on a former employee and stated it would conduct a review of all of its assets to make sure it wouldn’t happen again.</p>

 <p>Antireal hasn’t shared the details of what was involved in the resolution, but as her post indicates, she appears to be happy with how it all shaked out.</p> <p><i>Marathon</i>’s early previews, meanwhile, haven’t been entirely positive. The hero-based extraction shooter has failed to impress fans of the studio and the genre broadly speaking. Still, the gorgeous aesthetic at work in the game’s art was one of the shooter’s highlights. That was all thrown into chaos after the plagiarism revelations.</p> <p>The developer recently conducted some private tests for the shooter, but a release date is still nowhere to be found following the game’s delay earlier this year. Sony has claimed Marathon will launch before April 2026.</p>

              <p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>‘s European concert is selling out in record time. <em>Megabonk</em> is back in the running for The Game Awards. Also RIP to the fish that did what many players couldn’t. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Rockstar Games cofounder Dan Houser likened AI hype to “<a href="https://youtu.be/d4RTTcvFxJU?si=3rw5DLWLXvhGrG7D">Mad Cow disease</a>.” Every game store should add that as a disclaimer: this game was made using generative AI tools. It might slop-ify your brain as a result. Play at your own peril.</p> <h2>The goldfish beat Malenia but couldn’t overcome a systemic bacterial infection</h2> <p>Tortellini, the viral goldfish that <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-malenia-boss-goldfish-twitch-stream-1850610071">played<em> Elden Ring</em></a> and other games using a motion censor in its fish tank, has died at the age of three (via <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/viral-goldfish-that-beat-elden-rings-hardest-bosses-dies-aged-3-3289242/"><em>Dexerto</em></a>). The pet’s owner, YouTuber Pointcrow, said the goldfish had spent weeks battling an infection, and things took a turn for the worse over Thanksgiving week.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unfortunately, my goldfish Tortellini has passed away.</p> <p>He's been unwell for the past couple weeks fighting a systemic bacterial infection, and took a turn for the worse last night.

He was a big spender, notably buying an Oil Cooler Inlet Pipe for a Nissan Altima and TWO designer bags,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/PointCrow/status/1994132270530335040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1994132270530335040%7Ctwgr%5Ed298b2c1cbf436e9124962999c8b297578559dc1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fgaming%2Fviral-goldfish-that-beat-elden-rings-hardest-bosses-dies-aged-3-3289242%2F">wrote</a> in a tribute posted last week. “He was there to make us all laugh and bewilder us on how a small fish could do so much. He’s lived a god damn good life. I miss him so much. I’m sure he’s swimming in the great tank in the sky right now as happy as he can be.”</p>

 <h2>Someone finally escaped from <em>Escape from Tarkov</em></h2> <p>A streamer who goes by Tigz has spent years playing the extraction shooter in Early Access, but was finally able to complete its last mission now that the game recently went 1.0 (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a>). Unlocking the ending required a harrowing playthrough of the new map Terminal, but Tigz reportedly only got the second-worst ending out of four. While he’s the first player to officially “<a href="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/1995598764103663793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1995598764103663793%7Ctwgr%5Ebebcf1413e76f5906a67c6d4b11fc0f6b352f720%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsider-gaming.com%2Fsomeone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov%2F">beat</a>” the game, someone else out there still has the chance to be the first to unlock<em> Tarkov</em>‘s best ending.</p>

 <h2><em>Megabonk</em> still has a shot at winning The Game Awards</h2> <p>While the game’s creator took the <a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-dev-officially-withdraws-it-from-the-game-awards-2000645270">unprecedented step</a> of removing <em>Megabonk</em>‘s nomination for best debut indie game since he said he’d shipped other things in the past, it’s back in the player’s choice category. It’ll have to pass successive rounds of voting to make it into the finals. “I withdrew my other nomination due to <em>Megabonk</em> not fitting the category, but with this new nomination, we’re more back than ever. go vote pls,” Vedinad <a href="https://twitter.com/MegabonkGame/status/1995560069413655012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1995560069413655012%7Ctwgr%5Eacb23534c17e27b9e548b9286fa2df33607769d8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2Fmegabonk-game-awards-fan-vote-players-choice-category-ballot-vedinad%2F">wrote on X</a> this week.</p>

 <h2><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> concert tickets are gaming’s hottest new collectibles</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Within a minute they’re all gone for London!

Only a few locations, Bordeaux, Strasbourg, and Strasbourg, still have tickets available. Fans said seats for the concert in the biggest cities like London evaporated immediately. I guess players are into video game concerts after all, <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-concert-cancelled-dates-delay-us-tour-2000632085">but only ones with great music</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Ball X Pit</em> is getting a bunch of free DLC</h2> <p>2025’s hit indie dopamine machine will be giving fans more balls and more pits in early 2026. Publisher Devolver Digital revealed the game has now sold over 1 million copies and has a post-release roadmap. An update titled Regal arrives in January, one called Shadow arrives in April, and one called Natrulaist arrives in July. They’ll all be free and add new balls, evolutions, buildings, characters, “AND MORE.” I guess the arcade roguelike is going to <a href="https://kotaku.com/ball-x-pit-vampire-survivors-balatro-roguelike-2000642155">steal a good portion of my game time</a> next year as well.</p> <h2>The architect of the PS5 is in love with <em>Pikmi</em>n</h2> <p>Mark Cerny revealed the Nintendo exclusive was one of his favorite games in a recent interview on Simon Parkin’s <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console">My Perfect Console</a> (via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/im-a-sucker-when-it-comes-to-story-ps45-architect-recalls-transformative-experience-with-a-gamecube-classic"><em>NintendoLife</em></a>). “I had this thing where I tended to play smaller, lighter games for about 10 years, so I don’t know, <em>Portal</em> or<em> Plants vs Zombies</em> or<em> Flower</em> or <em>Katamari Damacy</em>,” the <em>Marble Madness</em> creator said. “<em>Pikmin</em> I just pick out of that list because I thought it was such an emotionally involving story. Poor Captain Olimar, he crash lands and he’s got 30 days to reassemble his ship or he’ll run out of oxygen and die and he’s sending letters home every day.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/geoff-keighley-desert-statue-tga-diablo-4-2000649133">Geoff Keighley is hyping a big demonic statue in the desert that’s not for the Game Awards reveal of <em>Diablo</em> or <em>God of War</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-kabuto-first-edition-viral-card-2000649100">Someone is on a mission to collect every first-run Kabuto Pokémon card</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-review-characters-length-2000649131"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is a nostalgia trap worth falling into</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

		<p>Paradox Tinto has remained busy after the release of Europa Universalis V last month, pushing out a clutch of patches and with a testing regime for upcoming changes. The tail end of November was all about the 1.0.8 beta patches, and now those improvements have gone live for the main development path, bringing hundreds of bug fixes, and some nice new tweaks and features.</p>
<p>On a high level, the patch brings eight new advances for the Aztec formable country, six new advances for the Two Sicilies formables, one more Tenochtitlan advance, and two more Sicilian and Neapolitan advances that can also be unlocked.</p>

                <p>A handful of new Mega-Evolved Pokemon are making their debut in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/" data-ref-id="5000-619901">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>'s upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-dlc-is-coming-really-soon-brings-new-mega-evolutions-and-donuts/1100-6535993/" data-ref-id="1100-6535993">Mega Dimension DLC</a>, and ahead of the expansion's launch, The Pokemon Company has revealed another new one: a second Mega Evolution for Lucario.</p><p>Mega Lucario Z marks the game's first Z Mega Evolution--a new kind of Mega-Evolved form that has a shorter cooldown period, but depletes Mega Energy much more quickly. According to the official <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/mega-lucario-z-debuts-in-pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pokemon website</a>, "Pokemon that undergo Z Mega Evolution require less time to fire off moves after receiving the orders from their Trainer, but they also burn through their Mega Power very quickly, making them less suited for long battles."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UkrLROjkA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V_UkrLROjkA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Like the original Mega Lucario, Mega Lucario Z is a steel and fighting type. Where this form differs, however, is in its defense and speed stats. As the official Pokemon website explains, "While Mega Lucario concentrates its aura into a destructive force, Mega Lucario Z uses it to surround its entire body, cloaking itself to increase its defense, flexibility, and agility."</p><p>It's unclear how many other Pokemon will be able to undergo Z Mega Evolution, but we've already gotten a look at several new Mega-Evolved forms coming in the Mega Dimension DLC. In addition to Mega Raichu X and Mega Raichu Y, the DLC will introduce Mega Evolutions for Baxcalibur, Chimecho, and the mythical Pokemon Zeraora.</p><p>Pokemon Legends: Z-A's Mega Dimension DLC launches on December 10 and costs $30. The expansion takes players to an alternate dimension known as Hyperspace Lumiose, where they'll encounter Pokemon not normally available in the base game, including wild Pokemon that are over level 100.</p><p>In the meantime, Pokemon Legends: Z-A's third Ranked Battle season is underway until December 17. Players who hit Rank S before the season ends will receive a Mega Stone for Chestnaught. A new Mystery Gift is also now available. All players can claim a free Mewtwonite X and Mewtwonite Y, which will unlock a new side quest that leads to an encounter with the legendary Pokemon Mewtwo.</p>

                <p>A new report has shed more light on the CEO succession plans at Disney, with a story from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/disney-bob-iger-next-ceo-f571257c?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcAnvO9HkSwOq6dtHvI9PgJs3zhb49bj_LauaFJs14tv8lhB61GX4WPPBJja20%3D&amp;gaa_ts=692f2221&amp;gaa_sig=5rTkrqo_jsKcEoMTYLBST2cadphurZq06o0aS9vWQa9F-lFkDGUUH5KOtfmQmf5ojqy4aIYuQjsxv9Dmruz0-g%3D%3D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Wall Street Journal</a> saying leading candidate Josh D'Amaro wants to focus more on gaming. The same report also suggested that Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson is not going to get the job.</p><p>It was previously reported that Disney's board considered external candidates to take over for Bob Iger, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-reportedly-in-the-mix-to-be-the-next-disney-boss/1100-6527707/" data-ref-id="1100-6527707">including Wilson</a>. But the new report said Disney is likely to choose an internal candidate. Wilson, for his part, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">staying on with EA amidst the company's $55 billion sale. </a></p><p>The new Disney CEO could be D'Amaro, who is currently the current head of Disney Experiences--a sprawling unit that covers theme parks, consumer products, cruise ships, and video games. The WSJ report said D'Amaro--who is "widely considered" to be named the next CEO--wants to give video games "a bigger role at the company." The report said D'Amaro is also looking to integrate "gaming technology" into Disney's creative processes. No further details were divulged, however.</p><p>Disney already uses Epic's Unreal technology for filmmaking, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-how-star-wars-the-mandalorian-used-fortnite-en/1100-6473958/" data-ref-id="1100-6473958">The Mandalorian employing the Fortnite tech</a> to project scenes onto LED screens surrounding the physical set.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUnxzVOs3rk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gUnxzVOs3rk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>D'Amaro is already making moves at Disney in regards to gaming. He spearheaded Disney's $1.5 billion investment into Epic Games for a future Fortnite collaboration and has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-explains-why-its-fortnite-deal-is-so-important-we-have-to-adapt/1100-6526831/" data-ref-id="1100-6526831">previously discussed why gaming is so important to Disney.</a></p><p>D'Amaro said Walt Disney himself was an "adventurer" and a "risk-taker," going on to say what Disney is now trying to achieve through Fortnite is an extension of that spirit.</p><p>"We should never rest on past success. We should always look for the next big idea, the next big challenge," he said. "If we'd always relied on what worked in the past, the Walt Disney Company might not exist today. As consumer preferences continue to shift, we have to adapt, or we are going to be left behind."</p><p>Characters and content from Disney's Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and Avatar brands, among others, will be represented in Fortnite. Disney and Epic have yet to officially unveil any specific projects in Fortnite tied to Disney, but many are hoping to see some kind of "virtual Disney World."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf2bRcSIUsE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Yf2bRcSIUsE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For more, be sure read GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-fortnite-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6534455/" data-ref-id="1100-6534455">everything we know about the Disney x Fortnite project.</a></p><p>Disney was at one time a bigger player in the world of video games, as the company had its own dedicated internal gaming division with Disney Interactive Studios. Disney also operated the once-popular Disney Infinity "toys-to-life" brand, but it also shuttered. Today, Disney's efforts in gaming mainly involve licensing its brands to other companies. In 2019, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/bob-iger-disney-isnt-particularly-good-at-publishing-games-1183088/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Iger spoke candidly about Disney's struggles</a> making and publishing games internally, admitting, "We haven't been particularly good..."</p><p>Disney does, however, do some internal game production and development within the Disney Experiences team. Right now, the company has <a href="https://www.disneycareers.com/en/category/gaming-and-interactive-jobs/391/8221696/1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">four open positions for video games</a>, including multiple producer roles and a pair of engineering jobs.</p><p>As for Iger, he has said he plans to leave Disney at the end of 2026, and many are speculating his replacement could be named early next year. As many may recall, Iger retired at the end of 2021, but came back in November 2022 after his replacement, Bob Chapek, was dismissed amid multiple controversies.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2</a> on PC just got a whole lot smaller, with developer Arrowhead Studios announcing a new, "slim" version of the game that reduces the game's install size by 131GB.</p><p dir="ltr">Fans on PC have long complained about the PC version's huge install size (and other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-prioritizing-patches-every-two-weeks-to-reduce-critical-bug-count/1100-6535835/" data-ref-id="1100-6535835">technichal issues</a>), which since the game's launch in 2024 has ballooned to 154GB. That's much larger than the close-to-22GB size of the console versions.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQPp9ZCgrP8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QQPp9ZCgrP8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Arrowhead stated in a new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/553850/announcements/detail/491583942944621372" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> its long-term goal has always been to reduce the PC install size, but that now, with help from Nixxes Software, that goal has become a reality "much sooner than expected." Helldivers 2 on PC now only takes up 23GB--an 85% size reduction.</p><p dir="ltr">Users on PC who play Helldivers 2 on an HDD may experience slightly increased load times of a few seconds with this change, according to Arrowhead. The studio previously said it believed removing duplicate data on PC (which contributed to the game's huge install size) could potentially greatly increase load times for HDD players. Arrowhead said it now has data to prove that's not the case, as the majority of Helldivers 2's load times are due to level generation rather than asset loading.</p><p dir="ltr">There is, however, one catch to Helldivers 2's new, much smaller size. Players who want to free up space on their drive will need to opt in to a new "beta" version of Helldivers 2 on Steam, after which the game will update and its file size will be reduced. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to enable it.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Find Helldivers 2 in your Steam library and right click</li><li dir="ltr">Select Properties from the drop down menu</li><li dir="ltr">Select the Betas tab</li><li dir="ltr">In the Beta Participation drop down list, select "prod_slim"</li><li dir="ltr">Close the dialog box and Helldivers 2 will update to the new version</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Arrowhead stated that once players using the beta version confirm there are no issues present, the slim version will become the default. For a limited time after that, players will be able to opt in to the legacy version if need be. However, given that there are only "very minor differences in loading times" between each version, Arrowhead will not continue to support the legacy version long term, as it would add "extra burden" to the development team.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside the file-size reduction on PC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-python-commandos-warbond-all-skins-guns-and-rewards/2900-7282/" data-ref-id="2900-7282">Helldivers 2's new Python Commando Warbond is also live</a>, adding a flame-spewing drone, minigun, chainsword, and more for Super Earth's defenders to add to their arsenal. The Warbond was delayed in order for Arrowhead to better start addressing various bugs and technical concerns players have had with Helldivers 2, including the game's file size.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Helldivers news, Sony's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-movie-lands-fast-furious-director/1100-6536624/" data-ref-id="1100-6536624">Helldivers film just found a director in Justin Lin</a>, known for his work on the Fast and Furious film franchise.</p>

The studio recently underwent layoffs and put a second in-the-works project on hold until Mina the Hollower releases.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's make-or-break for sure," Velasco said. "If we sold 500,000 copies, then we would be golden. If we sold even 200,000, that would be really, really great. If we sold, like, 100,000, that's not so good."</p><p dir="ltr">Originally slated to release in October, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shovel-knight-devs-next-game-mina-the-hollower-delayed-but-not-for-long/1100-6535260/" data-ref-id="1100-6535260">Mina the Hollower underwent an indefinite last-minute delay</a> just a few weeks prior to launch and currently does not have a new release date.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ns7FkgskFGw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ns7FkgskFGw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Velasco told Bloomberg the delay happened in order for Yacht Club to improve on various elements within the game that were only recently identified. At the time of the delay, the studio said it "wasn't a major delay" and was to done in order to "apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine." The studio said it didn't want to announce a new release date until the game was submitted to platform holders.</p><p dir="ltr">It was only in 2024 that the entire studio shifted to work on Mina the Hollower, a top-down Zelda-like with Game Boy-era visuals, with the studio having previously been split into two teams. One team worked on Mina while the other worked on an unannounced 3D Shovel Knight sequel, according to Bloomberg.</p><p dir="ltr">Yacht Club released its debut Shovel Knight, a throwback platformer starring a knight that wielded a shovel, to great success in 2014. The character struck a chord with players, and Shovel Knight even received an official Amiibo from Nintendo and was included in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as an assist trophy.</p><p dir="ltr">The studio spent the years after Shovel Knight's release crafting various expansions and spin-offs. Yacht Club's most recent release was 2022's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/shovel-knight-dig/" data-ref-id="5000-501664">Shovel Knight Dig</a>, developed in collaboration with Nitrome.</p>
