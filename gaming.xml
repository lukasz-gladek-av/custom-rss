            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The Roblox Corporation just revealed its new “real-time, action conditioned world model,” a generative AI tool for producing interactable videos that seems to work </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/google-ai-genai-nintendo-zelda-breath-wild-mario-64-project-genie-2000664227"><span>exactly like Google’s Project Genie</span></a><span>, which launched last week. While that one was able to rip off <em>Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em>, the Roblox version is plagiarizing 2025’s Game of the Year.</span></p> <p><span>“We see several immediate uses for our Roblox world model,” the company announced on February 5. “We will use it side-by-side text, image and video prompts as a way to launch auto-generation of immersive worlds. In Roblox Studio, a creator could walk around and use prompts to ‘paint’ a world and then convert it into a 3D representation or direct to Roblox native as a way for many people to play simultaneously.”&nbsp;</span><span>It then proceeded to show a really ugly-looking version of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> as proof.</p>

 <p><span>The strangest part of the entire reveal is that the world model tech that the Roblox Corporation decided to show off was actually an addendum to a completely separate reveal. The real announcement here is the impending release of their “</span><a href="https://about.roblox.com/newsroom/2026/02/accelerating-creation-powered-roblox-cube-foundation-model"><span>4D generation</span></a><span>” tech, a feature for the Cube Foundation Model that allows “creators and players to generate fully functional objects” that can be ported into </span><span>Roblox</span><span>, the platform its billions of users actually play on and spend money in.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Are we supposed to pretend that isnt expedition 33 or are we selling that ai generation is theft on purpose?</p> <p>— Mjl8 (@xMJL8x) <a href="https://twitter.com/xMJL8x/status/2019496403471311281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The genAI world model addendum was featured </span><a href="https://x.com/Roblox/status/2019221626387312810?s=20"><span>in a reply</span></a><span> made by the official Roblox X account to its 4D generation announcement, which explained that the “real-time, action conditioned world model” has been “trained on a combination of data, including proprietary Roblox 3D avatar/world interaction data.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The “including” part of the message here is clearly attempting to do a lot of heavy lifting, because everyone immediately noticed that the “woman in a glowing cave” prompt had unmistakably used footage of Sandfall Interactive’s </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </span></i><span>to generate its “real-time dreaming” world.</span></p>

 <p><span>As one user very handily </span><a href="https://x.com/josephioanna/status/2019449659337458057?s=20"><span>pointed out</span></a><span> in their reply, it seems to have specifically used the Flying Waters location as inspiration, as well as Maelle’s model (including her outfit). “What do @SandfallGames think about this? I wonder what you trained your model on?”</span></p> <p><span>Sandfall Interactive has yet to make an official statement regarding Roblox Corporation’s world generation showcase. However, Nintendo hasn’t weighed in on Project Genie’s use of its assets and IPs either. That’s despite </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-stocks-down-take-two-gta-nintendo-roblox-unity-google-ai-game-maker-2000664594"><span>a drop in Nintendo’s share value</span></a><span> on January 30 that some analysts have directly attributed to Project Genie’s release.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-switch-2-port-might-never-release-its-claimed/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new claim, Starfield’s Switch 2 port appears to be delayed and might never see the light of day. </p>



<p>A Starfield PlayStation 5 and Switch 2 port has been rumoured for a long time, but we have yet to hear any official details about it. This week, we have already heard a claim about Bethesda <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-playstatiion-5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planning an April 2026 release</a> for Starfield on PlayStation 5. We have now received claims about the Switch 2 Port as well. </p>







<h2 id="h-starfield-switch-2-port-reportedly-pushed-out">Starfield Switch 2 Port Reportedly ‘Pushed Out’ </h2>



<p>The claim that Starfield’s Switch 2 has a chance of never releasing comes from Shinobi602’s recent comments on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ppe-pl-starfield-is-coming-to-ps5-on-april-7th.1426351/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a>. When asked whether the Switch 2 port will release at the same time as the PS5, Shinobi602 stated, “That’s been pushed out. And might not even come out at all.” When asked whether the delay was to target holiday sales, the insider replied, “They’re having problems with it, nothing to do with holidays or anything.” </p>



<p>The Starfield Switch 2 and PS5 ports are expected to release with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2-0-could-be-real-after-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2.0 update</a> for the title, which will bring significant changes to some mechanics, help reduce load times, and be optimised for lower-power devices like handhelds. However, if the Switch 2 version is experiencing issues, the latter half of the 2.0 update might take longer than expected. Readers should take all the information with a grain of salt. </p>







<p>In other news, Starfield co-lead designer recently reflected on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-co-lead-designer-reflects-on-games-shortcomings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s shortcomings</a>.&nbsp;Additionally, the words ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terran Armada</a>‘ were teased in an anniversary post.

    <p><span>The Phantasmoon Games begin, Planarcadia descends, and a journey of Elation departs.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 4.0 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [45 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “No Aha At Full Moon,” will launch on February 13, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [220 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-1024691"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>In this update, players will arrive at Planarcadia, Aha’s very own playground, and be presented with a brand-new world where clout reigns supreme and society amuses itself to death. At the same time, by participating in the “Phantasmoon Games,” Trailblazers will have the chance to compete for the honor of becoming an “Aeon for a Minute.” This Trailblazing journey surrounding The Elation will unfold here and continue throughout the entire coming year. Beyond Planarcadia, the Express Crew will subsequently head to the Interastral Peace Entertainment headquarters, “Astropolis,” to embark on new explorations. Get ready to set off on this fresh interstellar journey with your new companions Yao Guang and Sparxie.</p><p>Legend has it that “Planarcadia” was once a flat “World in Canvas,” but after the IPC took over management, it awoke from the canvas, revived, and gradually transformed into the bustling hub it is today. Upon the Express Crew’s arrival, Madam Pearl, one of the Strategic Investment Department’s “Ten Stonehearts,” will be there to play host. Yet beyond the glitz, Planarcadia carries a deeper meaning: it is both Navigator Himeko’s homeland and the very place where the Astral Express reignited its journey fifteen years ago. Now, as the Express enters this paradise once again, another kind of “star treatment” awaits them: a hit comic based on the Express Crew is currently being serialized, thrusting everyone into the spotlight.</p><p>After wrapping up pleasantries with the IPC, the Trailblazer will arrive in “Duomension City” and encounter the unique “imagenae” of this world. These creatures live in symbiosis with the locals, having long been integrated into the city’s daily life. Whether it’s the station master “Meowton,” the train-like “Bullet Wyrm,” the “thundercoil” looming over the city, or the “mechatron” beloved by Mr. Yang, they have all become indispensable parts of Duomension City. However, the existence of the imagenae isn’t guaranteed. They rely on people’s “Wishpower” to sustain their lives—they only persist if they continue to attract attention; once forgotten, they gradually fade away. It is for this reason that entertainment facilities line every street and alley of Duomension City, and laughter never ceases. The city also hides mysterious entrances. Stepping through them allows the Trailblazer to enter a marvelous Duomension world, peeking into another facet of this arcadia or being led to unexpected destinations—be it the brightly lit commercial district of Dovebrook, Himeko’s alma mater and world-renowned art school “Graphia Academy,” or even the secret gathering place of the Masked Fools: the Tavern of Elation. Rumor has it that this place is quietly tucked away in some corner of the Dovebrook District…</p><p>In this boisterous amusement park, the vast majority of residents are followers of the Elation. Even conflicts and disputes are packaged as games to be solved. Among all the entertainments, the most eye-catching—and most insane—is undoubtedly the “Phantasmoon Games,” which is also one of the Express Crew’s key objectives for this trip. Legend has it that this game was personally designed by The Laughter. The victor not only earns the right to an audience with THEM, but also receives the prize of “becoming an Aeon for one minute.” The Phantasmoon Games has no fixed rules. The only criterion for judgment is who can attract the most attention. Any method goes, as long as it’s dazzling enough. All participants rely on a single mask as their ticket, and there are only eight such masks in existence. As the games approach, various factions have quietly gathered. The Astral Express, the Masked Fools, the IPC, and the Xianzhou Alliance have intervened one after another. Even the Stellaron Hunters have made an appearance, Silver Wolf and Blade seem to have already begun their operations. Are they, too, here for the Phantasmoon Games? All suspense will be revealed one by one in future stories.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In Planarcadia, even Combat is placed under the gaze of The Laughter. When characters on the Path of “Elation” are added to the team, or when fighting special enemies, you will obtain “Punchlines.” As Punchlines accumulate and Aha’s interest peaks, THEY will personally take the stage to initiate an “Aha Instant.” During this phase, Aha will lead the “Elation” characters in the team to unleash Elation Skills in turn. The more Punchlines gathered, the stronger the ability effects. After the “Aha Instant” concludes, all characters on the Path of Elation will gain their own unique “Certified Banger” buffs, adding further layers to combat strategy.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1024692"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>In the new version, Trailblazers will welcome two powerful new 5-star characters to their roster. First up is the Seer Strategist from the Xianzhou Alliance’s Yuque: General Yao Guang. Previously only a voice heard during the storyline, she is finally making her official debut. As the senior soror to the familiar face Fu Xuan, Yao Guang serves as the Alliance’s vital divination advisor when facing difficult predicaments. To the people of the Xianzhou, she is “Madam Yao,” a goddess of fortune who resolves crises and brings good omens through her divination. As a Physical character on the Path of Elation, Yao Guang specializes in using “Weal and Woe Lots” to control the flow of battle. Weal Lots increase ally Elation and grant the team “Punchline” stacks when Yao Guang uses her Skill. During an “Aha Instant,” Yao Guang casts Woe Lots, causing enemies to take increased DMG while regenerating Skill Points for the team. Yao Guang’s “Certified Banger” buff allows teammates’ attacks to deal 1 instance of Additional Elation DMG; if that attack consumes a Skill Point, the DMG is further increased. Furthermore, her Ultimate not only provides “Punchline” for the team but also immediately triggers an extra “Aha Instant,” increasing All-Type RES PEN for all allies.</p><p>Another mysterious 5-star Fire-Type character on the Path of Elation is Sparxie. Bearing a striking resemblance to the familiar Masked Fool Sparkle, she is the hottest streamer in Planarcadia. In the storyline, Sparxie will debut alongside Sparkle, bringing a unique surprise to the Trailblazer. In combat, acting as a streamer, Sparxie opens a livestream room to engage in a live upvote showdown with enemies. Players can continuously consume Skill Points to send random “Gifts” to Sparxie, regenerating varying amounts of Skill Points or “Punchlines” for the team. The more Skill Points consumed, the more Punchlines the team gains, and the higher the DMG dealt at the final settlement. During “Aha Instant,” Sparxie kicks off a boisterous lucky draw, dealing massive DMG to all enemies with multiple bounces. While in the “Certified Banger” state, every Gift triggered during the live showdown will deal additional Elation DMG to a random enemy target upon settlement. Furthermore, Sparxie’s Ultimate also deals extra Elation DMG.</p><p>Limited 5-star characters Black Swan, Evernight, and Hysilens, along with Sparkle, Cerydra, and Rappa, will be featured in Warp events during the first and second halves of the version respectively. At the same time, Black Swan and Sparkle will also receive enhancements. Black Swan can further elevate the overall DMG output of DOT teams, while Sparkle’s support effects will now apply to Elation DMG, boosting the overall damage output of Elation teams and providing players with more stable and powerful combat support in their journey ahead. Additionally, players who log in after the version launches will receive a 20-pull reward and can claim Ruan Mei’s new Outfit for free. Meanwhile, the Yao Guang fortune event will also bring players 1,600 Stellar Jades in rewards. During this period, multiple benefits will be gradually released, including new Trailblaze Outfits and new headwear, as well as a free 5-star character selector, bringing even more surprises to your adventure.</p><p>Finally, version 4.0 will also bring a host of brand-new events and gameplay updates. For example, in “Cosmicon Collective,” you’ll challenge formidable foes via card battles and strive for the pinnacle of cosmic might. In “Furbobo Weekly,” Trailblazers will become magazine editors, experiencing a different kind of fun through management and critical decisions. As for permanent gameplay modes, “Currency Wars” will see its first expansion, while the “Divergent Universe” is also getting an update, injecting more variety into long-term challenges.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,348 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [25,443 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer and special program below.

Those seas have plenty to discover and point your cannons at too, especially the "high risk, high reward, and intentionally unforgiving" deep sea region.</p>

<p>As shown off in the <a href="https://rust.facepunch.com/news/naval">update rundown</a> from devs Facepunch, the ships you can build as part of this naval update are as bowling shoe ugly as your average early game scrap for resources. Think of the sort of square hunks of metal, wood, and sail that might come out of an episode of Scrapheap Challenge about floating tanks, and you've got the picture.</p>
<p>These tugs are slapped together at deployable boat building stations, fitted out with boaty accoutrements like engines, cannons, and anchors, then cast off in search of plunder. Engine and sail placement factors into your vessel's handling and speed, so maybe don't stick them all at the very back of the deck because you're trying to build the barge version of a Porsche 911. Naturally, you can also install a plank just in case any bickering over loot breaks out among your crew.</p><p>Then, it's heave ho and off you go to the edge of the map, where a new region dubbed the deep sea awaits. "This is not a place to live: you cannot build, and nothing respawns," Facepunch warn. "First come, first served. The deep sea will open and close intermittently, like a world event." Within the bounds of these dangerous waters, you'll find ghost ships protected by hostile scientists and their new turret-equipped PT boats and tropical islands boasting mystery loot. In between battles over goodies, you can drop anchor at ramshackle floating cities "built from abandoned barges and the framework of an unfinished oil rig", where you can restock and hang out at the Deep Deck casino.</p>
<p>It all sounds ripe for piratey antics that build on Rust's well-established scramble for survival among base-building hoarders. The good news is that it's out now and Facepunch have included five new naval missions to get you started.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/how-rockstar-hyped-people-up-for-gta-v-over-a-decade-ago-2000665773</link>
            <guid>1427971</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-v-the-kotaku-review-1324730770"><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> launched over a decade ago on Xbox 360 and PS3 in September 2013.</a> And its sequel, the highly anticipated <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, is seemingly, finally, actually, for real, launching this November. Take-Two’s CEO is even promising that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-still-confirmed-for-november-with-summer-marketing-blitz-planned-2000665452">game’s marketing will kick off this summer</a>.</p> <p>So, as we wait for that and hope the game doesn’t get delayed again, let’s look back at the complete timeline for<em> GTA V</em>‘s marketing and promotion, from announcement to release.</p> <h2>2011</h2> <p><em>GTA V</em> was officially announced on October 25, 2011, <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/128788090969001984">via a simple little tweet</a> that just said “#GTAV.” People went wild at the time as the last main installment in the series, <em>GTA IV</em>, had been released in 2008. Can you imagine waiting possibly four years for a <em>GTA</em> sequel?!?!</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666176" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666176"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666176">©Twitter / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>One week later, on November 2, Rockstar released the <a href="https://youtu.be/QkkoHAzjnUs">first trailer for <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>.</a> It featured narration by one of the game’s main characters, Michael, and showed beauty shots of Los Santos and the surrounding area. Young Zack watched this trailer way too many times. It ended without a release date. Then…nothing. Radio silence from Rockstar. The more things change…</p> <h2>2012</h2> <p>In July 2012, as part of a Rockstar Newswire post answering fan questions, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/4k4128838a3a4a/asked-answered-max-payne-3-and-grand-theft-auto-v.html#:~:text=however%2C%20manage%20to-,sneak%20a%20quick,-screenshot%20out%20for">Rockstar released two new screenshots of </a><em><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/4k4128838a3a4a/asked-answered-max-payne-3-and-grand-theft-auto-v.html#:~:text=however%2C%20manage%20to-,sneak%20a%20quick,-screenshot%20out%20for">GTA V</a>.</em> They didn’t feature any main characters, but offered two new looks at the then-upcoming open-world game. Once again, a lot of <em>GTA</em> fans went wild over these crumbs.</p>

 <p>In August 2012, <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V/Screenshots#:~:text=In%20August%202012,%5B5%5D">Rockstar teased fans with 10 more screenshots</a> released across three different posts throughout the month. The company also promised that more was coming in the near future. But fans would have to wait a little bit longer than planned.</p>

 <p>Rockstar planned to release a second trailer for <em>GTA V</em> on November 2. However, these plans were derailed when <a href="https://kotaku.com/hurricane-sandy-delays-second-gta-v-trailer-5957385">Hurricane Sandy slammed into New York City</a>, where Rockstar’s main HQ is located, and knocked out the power. The trailer would eventually be released 12 days later on November 14. It featured the excellent song “Skeletons” by Stevie Wonder, a song I can’t hear without thinking about this trailer.</p>  <p>In October, a year after the game was announced, Rockstar confirmed a leaked release date of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/27/gta-v-coming-spring-2013">“Spring 2013” for the game</a>. In November, it started taking pre-orders for <em>GTA V</em>. Before 2012 ended, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gtav"><em>Game Informer</em> ran a large cover story about </a><em><a href="https://gameinformer.com/gtav">Grand Theft Auto V</a>,</em> detailing a hands-off demo they were shown and revealing some other details about the game.</p>

 <h2>Early 2013</h2> <p>Rockstar kicked off the new year with bad news. On January 31, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/31/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-a-september-release-date">Rockstar Games announced that <em>GTA V</em> had been delayed</a> from Spring 2013 to September 17, 2013.</p> <p>“To all <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> fans, please accept our apologies for the delay, and our promise that the entire team here is working very hard to make the game all it can be. We are doing all we can to help ensure it will meet, if not exceed, your expectations come September – we thank you for your support and patience,” posted Rockstar at the time.</p> <p>A few months later, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130406024311/http://www.kotaku.com.au/2013/04/new-mural-could-reveal-grand-theft-auto-v-box-art/">in April, Rockstar revealed the game’s official cover</a> via a mural painted on the side of a building in New York City. Later that same month, Rockstar Games released not one, not two, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/04/27/ign-live-presents-gta-5-character-trailers">three different trailers</a>. Each trailer focused on one of the three playable protagonists in the game. Younger Zack lost his shit that day, let me tell you. Rockstar would once more enter radio silence mode, but this would be the last time before an onslaught of marketing and promotion kicked off.</p>

 <h2>Summer 2013</h2> <p>On July 9, Rockstar finally shared actual gameplay of <em>GTA V</em> as part of a gameplay overview trailer. This was the first time most people had ever seen the game running on actual hardware, and it was wild to witness. I remember being shocked at how good it looked. Even today, all these years later, I still think the original version of<em> GTA</em> <em>V </em>and <em>GTA Online</em> look pretty dang good.</p>  <p><a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/519075-new-epsilon-program-twitter-found/">Also in July, a viral marketing campaign began using an old <em>GTA San Andreas-</em>era website</a> mocking Scientology and cults. This would end up leading players to a fake Twitter account for the Epsilon Cult and would end with a way to audition to be in the game. <a href="https://screenrant.com/gta-5-6-casting-fans-epsilon-program/#:~:text=In%20the%20lead,the%20Epsilon%20Program.">Five people were picked and digitally added to <em>GTA V.</em></a></p>

 <p>Between August 13 and September 13, Rockstar began posting blogs on its website sharing even more details about <em>GTA V’</em>s world and characters, as well as new screenshots. The floodgates were truly open at this point.</p> <p>On August 15, <a href="https://youtu.be/olEGtoYs_8A">Rockstar released a gameplay overview showing off our first look at</a><em><a href="https://youtu.be/olEGtoYs_8A"> GTA Online</a>.</em> Looking back at it now, it is clear that Rockstar had no idea what this game would evolve into over the next decade. It looks so quaint now.</p>  <p>And finally, on August 29, 2013, just over two weeks before the launch of <em>GTA V</em> on Xbox and PlayStation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep5QfWMba-s">Rockstar released the final pre-release trailer for the game</a>. This was a shorter trailer and would end up being played on TV as <em>GTA V’</em>s launch commercial. If you were watching cable back around 2013, you likely saw this ad a few dozen times or more.</p>

 <p>That ends the marketing timeline for<em> GTA V.</em> Of course, the game would go on to be ported to many more platforms, get many more trailers, and spawn <em>GTA Online,</em> one of the most successful live-service games ever made. And it all started with a tweet in 2011.</p>

<p>The Pokémon commercial that was supposed to play at Super Bowl LX on Sunday has already leaked online, featuring a star-studded cast. </p>



<p>Pokémon is one of the franchises that gets leaked on all fronts. <span>We have seen the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-pokemon-company-coo-calls-for-pokemon-leaks-to-be-removed/" target="_blank">mainline games leaking</a></span>&nbsp;ahead of announcement, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-a4a-set-secluded-springs-leaks-ahead-of-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TCG Pocket cards</a>, packs, and so much more. Now, something really unexpected has happened: even their Super Bowl commercial leaked a few days earlier than planned. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-super-bowl-commercial-features-lady-gaga-charles-leclerc-and-young-miko">Pokémon Super Bowl Commercial Features Lady Gaga, Charles Leclerc, and Young Miko</h2>



<p>Only a small clip of the Pokémon Super Bowl Commercial, posted by CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/2019650640088297854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), has surfaced online, but it provides plenty of new information. The video features American singer, songwriter, and actress Lady Gaga, Puerto Rican rapper, singer, and songwriter Young Miko, and Formula 1 driver Charles Leclerc. All 3 personalities seem to be talking about their favourite Pokémon and what they like about it, but it could be something else. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Young Miko is first shown with a Gengar, with the words “He’s mischievous, that’s sort of his love language”. Then we see Charles Leclerc with a Growlithe, uttering the phrase “his loyalty, his speed.” We also see Lady Gaga with a Jigglypuff, but as this is just a clip, her statement wasn’t revealed. When asked whether the commercial was about a “specific game”, CentroLeaks responded, “It doesn’t promote a specific game…”</p>

            <p>The Highguard team has released another patch for its live-service hero shooter.</p>
<p>This update includes a new Warden, known as Ekon. Ekon is described as a "legendary Wildwalker" who is able to shapeshift into a direwolf. This means he doesn't need a mount, as he is the mount.</p>
<p>"When his mentor, and closest thing to family, goes missing in the lost land of Highguard, there is no monster or Warden this great predator will allow to stand in his way," developer Wildlight teases.</p>

<p>As well as this new Warden, the update - which welcomes in Highguard episode two - also adds a new map known as Skydrift which, as the name suggests, takes place above the clouds. From a quick glance at the artwork for this map (see further below), I get flashbacks to the sky islands in Legend of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, but with more structures dotted about.</p>
<p>Other quality of life improvements include the likes of being able to leave the party by clicking on party member's social card, Dead players no longer show up on the minimap and more.</p>

<p>Highguard was announced back in December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out Geoff Keighley's trailer-filled The Game Awards extravaganza</a> (which did also feature some awards). Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this week</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format.</p>
<p>Since this slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry have voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one."</p>

            <p>PC game-download store GOG has come under scrutiny for using generative-AI in marketing artwork, then for seeming to sit on the fence in an answer about whether it will keep using the tech in the future.</p>
<p>The piece of artwork was a banner advertising a 2026 sale, <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner/post69?cjdata=MXxZfDB8WXww&amp;utm_campaign=cj&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=cj">which a GOG forum user, presumed to be a GOG artist, spoke out about</a> and confirmed was created with AI. This caused a stink and so gen-AI use was one of the topics GOG was immediately questioned about during <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gog/comments/1qu09vg/ask_the_gog_team_and_micha%C5%82_kici%C5%84ski_anything/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">an Ask Me Anything on Reddit</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>Managing director Maciej Gołębiewski - when asked about the negative reaction and whether GOG would move away from gen-AI use in the future - replied: "We're not planning on making absolute statements in either direction. AI tools are one of many technologies we test and try out, and in some contexts it genuinely helps us push the company (and the mission) forward.</p>
<p>"What we will change, though, is how and where those tools are used; we understand that using new technology doesn't mean skipping human judgment." His answer did nothing to cool or calm the crowd.</p>

<p>I followed this response up with GOG and Gołębiewski this morning but was told GOG wouldn't elaborate on what had been said. However, I did speak to Gołębiewski at length in January, in an interview about GOG's private acquisition, and gen-AI was one of the topics we broached.</p>
<blockquote><em>"Every technology at some point finds its way to be put to good use"</em></blockquote>
<p>Gołębiewski told me at the time: "We are not using it [gen-AI] as of right now, but we've seen instances where communities have used the AI or neural network to analyse all of the code that is available for a game - all of the repositories or the documentation that's available for a game - with an aim of making it run better or maybe making it run on a different operating system or different hardware. AI is pretty good at absorbing the context and then guessing some action points based on that context.</p>
<p>"We haven't done this in this form," he added, "but I'm sure that at some point the application of AI - not necessarily generative AI in terms of artworks or code or whatever - will be found for how this can be used to advance game preservation. Every technology at some point finds its way to be put to good use. It's just the road to that is usually windy, shaky, however you might call it. So we haven't yet, but I'm not saying we won't do it in the future. If this can be used to advance our mission, then we will do it."</p>

<p>GOG's founding mission - and continuing mission - is restoring and preserving classic games, whether they be old classics or more modern classics, and ensuring they can be played in their best form into the future without being locked behind DRM. This often requires a lot of work on GOG's end, hence the attraction of AI in helping alleviate some of that.</p><p>But GOG is a store that also sells newer games, both indie and bigger games, and that prides itself on a selective approach, and on being close to its audience and receptive to them. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-says-selling-horses-when-steam-wouldnt-was-matter-of-freedom">GOG earned plenty of respect by stocking provocative indie horror game Horses</a> last year, when other stores, like Epic and Steam, wouldn't. "We as a company are always ready to take a stand on the right values," Maciej Gołębiewski said to me about making that decision. It's a statement that seems to grate against what it's saying now about gen-AI.</p>
<p>GOG recently became a private company after having spent its entire existence as part of CD Projekt - the house of The Witcher games and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. And one of the positive potential ramifications of this is not being burdened by that huge game-making business, and therefore being more agile and able to take risks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-eyes-indie-game-publishing-something-it-couldnt-do-under-cd-projekt-red">new owner Michał Kiciński explained to me recently</a>. I wonder if this moment will be a telling one in the company's new era.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Late last year, it seemed like<em> Half-Life 3</em>, the third entry in the Valve series, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-rumors-intensify-on-27th-anniversary-original-game/"><strong>about to be announced</strong></a>. <span>Every&nbsp;<strong>available indication</strong>, whether </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/should-you-give-up-on-half-life-3-no-not-while-work-continues-on-hlx/"><strong><span>updates to the So</span>urce 2 engine</strong></a> or rumors from reliable insiders about <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization-trailer-prepared/"><strong>a trailer in preparation</strong></a>, seemed to point to an <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/">imminent reveal before the end of 2025</a></strong>. </p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">However,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2025 has ended</strong>&nbsp;without any confirmation of what the HLX project is, and the complete lack of information from the usual sources plunged the community into&nbsp;<strong>doom and gloom</strong>, with </span>many starting to doubt the game really exists, or believing it was ultimately cancelled.</p>



<p>While we still don't know if <strong>HLX is indeed the long-awaited Half-Life 3</strong>, we now know that development of the project is <strong>proceeding</strong>, at least in some capacity.</p>



<p><span>A few hours ago,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/2019536782279557428" target="_blank"><strong>Gabefollower</strong></a>, one of the most&nbsp;<strong>reliable sources</strong>&nbsp;of rumors about Valve's projects, confirmed on X that the latest&nbsp;<em>Deadlock</em>&nbsp;update<strong>&nbsp;includes some new mentions of the HLX project</strong>.</span> By itself, the new mentions don't <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">mean much</strong>, but at least they have confirmed that <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"HLX survived Valve's winter break,"</em> as Gabefollower put.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">community reaction</strong> to the news that development of what is supposedly <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Half-Life 3</em> did not disappoint, divided between those<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"> inhaling generous doses of hopium</strong> like <a href="https://x.com/Marcegonz19/status/2019542841836597746"><strong>X user Marcelo</strong></a> and those who believe <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Nothing Ever Happens,"</strong></em> like <a href="https://x.com/souvlaki420/status/2019544321591009472"><strong>X user tzatziki</strong></a>. Others, however, are <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">giving up hope</strong>, now believing <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">HLX is not the third entry in the series</strong>, but something else entirely.</p>



<p><em>'Gabe, I think that it's getting to a point that HLX isnt half life X or 3. I think it's just a new addition to games that could be for moderation, making the games better, or something else completely. Stop giving us hopium that eventually turns into dispairium,'</em> said <a href="https://x.com/d116223reb/status/2019602979784126694"><strong>X user dude3reborn</strong></a>. Was this <strong>a plea</strong> to Gabefollower or to Gabe Newell, CEO of Valve? Who knows, but this statement summarizes well the <strong>wild state</strong> the <em>Half-Life</em> community has been since it started to seem like <em>Half-Life 3</em> wasn't a fever dream, but a <strong>concrete possibility.</strong></p>



<p>Although there's no <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">concrete indication</strong> that HLX could indeed be <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Half-Life 3</em>, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-reportedly-getting-announced-soon-but-how-will-it-play/">datamined discoveries</a></strong> made over the years suggest this project could be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a very interesting game</strong> coming with a lot of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">unique mechanics</strong>, such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fire and heat conductivity</strong>, a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">gravity gun</strong> with complex physics mechanics likely used for puzzles, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">advanced NPC AI with superior hearing</strong> that, on paper, could make for <strong>a very immersive experience</strong>. As for when it will be <strong>revealed</strong>, it's really difficult to say at the moment. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reliable insider has stated that Rockstar Games still plans to release the Red Dead Redemption 2 Enhanced Edition in 2026. </p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2’s enhanced edition is one of the most sought-after remasters, and we have been hearing rumours about it for a long time. A current-gen version of the original Red Dead Redemption was released recently, which made fans worry that RDR2 would never receive the same treatment. An insider confirmed it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-enhanced-version-is-still-coming-insider-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was still in the works</a>, and they have now provided a bit more information. </p>







<h2 id="h-red-dead-redemption-2-current-gen-update-could-release-in-2026">Red Dead Redemption 2 Current-Gen Update Could Release in 2026</h2>



<p>Insider NatetheHate was recently asked on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2019452498805752008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) whether they knew about Red Dead Redemption 2 Enhanced Edition’s release plans and whether it had been pushed to 2027. Nate replied that, as far as he knows, the release plans are for “this year”. </p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One back in 2018. It has been close to 8 years since the game was released, and we have yet to receive a current-gen update. Fans have been yearning for a 4K 60 FPS update for a game that already looks so good, but Rockstar hasn’t provided any form of official confirmation on whether a current-gen update is in the works. </p>



<p>The original Red Dead Redemption recently received that treatment, getting a 4K 60FPS update for current-gen consoles. What’s more, the update brought iOS and Android versions of the game. What’s more, the title is free to claim through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> and includes the Undead Nightmare expansion. </p>







<p>In other news, an interesting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-is-getting-a-pokemon-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon mod</a> was revealed for Red Dead Redemption 2 recently. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jeffrey-dean-morgan-arthur-morgan-red-dead-redemption-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeffery Dean Morgan wishes to play Arthur Morgan</a> in a RDR show.

            <p>The Exit 8 is one of the many video game series currently getting a film or TV adaptation, and ahead of its international cinematic debut in April, the team has released a new trailer for the subway-bound horror flick.</p>
<p>If it wasn't already on your radar, The Exit 8 became quite a cult hit on its initial release back in 2023. It's a walking simulator inspired by Japanese underground passageways, and while I admit that doesn't sound great at first, here's the thing: you are trapped in this seemingly endless passageway, and have to pay careful attention to your surroundings in order to find your way out. And, things get weird.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>This is the exact premise Exit 8's film adaptation will also lean on. "A man trapped in an endless sterile subway passageway sets out to find Exit 8. The rules of his quest are simple: do not overlook anything out of the ordinary. If you discover an anomaly, turn back immediately. If you don't, carry on. Then leave from Exit 8. But even a single oversight will send him back to the beginning. Will he ever reach his goal and escape this infinite corridor?" reads the film's official blurb.</p>
<p>We had a little look at what this film would be like last year, but now we have a new extended trailer, showing just how claustrophobic and nightmarish this looping plight will be for the poor chap - played by singer and actor Kazunari Ninomiya - who is doomed to wander the subway alone (well, kind of alone, if you catch my drift...).</p>
<p>You can check it out for yourself below.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Genre soupy shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a>'s second big update arrives today, February 6th. It'll deliver a new hero to guard those pesky highs in the form of Ekon, a bloke who can transform into a wolf. Developers Wildlight have also aimed to ensure the game's gang of established heroes don't feel left out by adding a free wolf mount, alongside a new map called Skydrift and a 3v3 ranked mode.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Ekon doesn’t ride an animal into battle, he becomes one—transforming into a powerful direwolf that tracks, hunts, and runs down mounted enemies," Wildlight wrote of the new hero in the notes for whjat they've dubbed the episode 2 patch. "While in this form, Ekon’s speed is unmatched by other mounts. Through a full third-person point of view, the direwolf can see around cover. When moving in for an attack, weapons are laid down in favor of Ekon’s deadly bite attack, which will dash forward and bite a prey before immediately transforming back to human form to finish off the job. Attacking without a target will allow Ekon to perform a small air dash to traverse maps more athletically. In addition, while in Wolf Form, Ekon can track an enemy’s scent that they leave in their path."</p>
<p>Naturally, his ultimate attack's a big howl that makes opponents scared, with other abilities including a keen sense for foes' heartbeats and the option to send a wolf spirit to track them down. Those all sound like they'll come in handy during 3v3 or 5v5 battles on the Skydrift map, which is comprised of a floating lost city you battle your way up via plenty of bouncing around, zip-lining, and bridge crossing.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Or, you can paw your way into the new ranked mode, which sees you compete to climb a tree of seven titles in 3v3 battles. Wildlight wrote that they've opted to limit this mode to trios because that setup is "the more tactical structure of the game and fits best", but are open to feedback as to whether they've gotten that right.</p><p>Naturally, the higher up the ranking tree you get by the end of each ranked "split" - of which there'll be two per "episode", which looks to be the silly name Wildlight are stick with for periods between major updates - the better rewards you get. On the topic of loot, this patch sees the devs roll out four improvements designed to augment the lootage. These are adding masterwork weapons to the red weapon chests at points of interest, making the barrels that contain ultimate chargers glow, adding waypoint markers to guide you towards location with gear, and ensuring speed gates are permanently powered on.</p>
<p>If you've yet to give Highguard a go despite Geoff Keighley advocating for it more vocally than I do for that Fallout game about the guy from Friends leaving you for dead, make sure to check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-impressions">James' impressions of it</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-charger-falls-to-deep-clearance-on-amazon-works-with-original-switch-and-steam-deck-2000666168</link>
            <guid>1427932</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is, by design, made to be taken on the go. But there’s a risk to bringing it along on road trips, flights, hotel stays, or any other form of travel — and not the one you think. That 60W Nintendo charger that comes with the Switch 2 and powers both the console and its TV dock can be&nbsp;<em>really</em> hard to replace if you break or lose it. Amazon’s offering a great deal on a rare find — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7072/">a third-party 60W fast charger that works with the Switch 2 and its dock, along with other handheld gaming consoles, for just $20</a>.</p>
<p>KOVA’s fast charger comes with a detachable 5-foot cable, with options also available for 3.3-foot, 6.6-foot, and 10-foot versions. The wall box is identical in size to the original Nintendo version, and it matches the original in speedy charging time. Many of the other third-party chargers on the market are either not compatible with the Switch 2, or are copies of the original 39W charger for the Switch 1, which charges at a far slower rate and is incompatible with the Switch 2 Dock.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7072/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast, Stable, and Safe</h2>
<p>The KOVA Switch 2 charger has a built-in AI chip that protects your handheld console from overheating, over-currents and short-circuits, and other potential electrical mayhem that could otherwise fry your device. With the 60W fast charger in place, the Switch 2 can go from a completely dead battery to full charge in just 2.5 hours, and you can play while it’s plugged in.</p>
<p>One of the truly hard-to-find features of a third-party Switch 2 charger is full compatibility with the Dock. Some of those chargers don’t provide enough juice for the Dock to connect with your TV, and some work only with lower-res screens. When the KOVA Switch 2 charger is connected to the Switch 2 Dock, it creates a strong and stable power source that allows for a seamless connection between the console and your TV — 4K screens included.</p>



<h2>Power Sharing</h2>
<p>This charger’s bona fides for charging the Switch 2 and Switch 2 Dock are well established, but the KOVA Switch 2 charger is also retro-compatible with the original Nintendo Switch and its Dock. It’s also compatible with the Steam Deck, and with the reinforced cable rated for over 350,000 bends in its lifetime, it might outlast your console itself.</p>
<p>Finding yourself with a dead Switch 2 because you’ve lost or broken its charger stinks. Avoiding that fate for <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7072/">just $20 at Amazon when you buy the KOVA Switch 2 charger</a> is a small and exceptionally worthy investment.</p>

A new rarity tier "with power levels superior to even Legendary gear," this new rarity will be available to all players regardless of what edition of Borderlands 4 they own, although some pieces of Pearlescent gear will be exclusive to Bounty Pack 2.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We were also treated to a little update on what's still to come, too. The first Story Pack for Borderlands 4, entitled Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, will arrive next month and introduces multiple main and side missions set in a new zone of Kairos, as well as new gear and cosmetics, of course. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story will center on the "return of the indomitable fan-favorite Ellie," and "focuses on a cosmic horror theme with a bloodier, darker tone." It'll also include the first new playable Vault Hunter, C4SH, a former casino dealer bot. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Borderlands 4 gives the series the massive kick in the pants it has needed, with a fantastic open world and greatly improved combat, even if bugs and invisible walls can sometimes throw off that groove," we said in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-review"><u>IGN's Borderlands 4 review</u></a>, which returned a 8/10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, we reported that Borderlands 4 publisher Take-Two announced the game's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-development-paused-as-gta-publisher-says-its-incredibly-excited-about-bringing-other-games-to-nintendos-console-instead">Switch 2 version is now on "pause" following its last-minute delay</a>. A Switch 2 port for the Gearbox looter shooter was initially announced during Nintendo's big April 2025 Direct and then pegged to arrive on October 3, 2025, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/while-battling-performance-problems-on-pc-xbox-and-playstation-gearbox-delays-borderlands-4-on-nintendo-switch-2-just-a-week-before-launch-and-cancels-all-digital-pre-orders"><u>before its release was scrubbed just a week prior to launch</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">As well as lessons learned since the game's launched. </h2></p><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Riot has released its first <a href="https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/announcements/state-of-the-game-feb-2026/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">State of the Game</a> update on Riftbound, a biannual blog-style post designed to keep the community informed. In it, we got a more detailed look at upcoming organized play events, teases for upcoming expansions and cards, solidified dates for sets beyond Spiritforged, and interviews with Game Director Dave Guskin and Executive Producer Changran Chai, which offer insight into what the team has learned since the game launched in October of last year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Riot previously announced the first half of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riot-games-reveals-new-riftbound-spiritforged-cards-and-details-at-pax-unplugged">organized play roadmap for 2026 during PAX Unplugged</a>, but we now have the full picture. After the Las Vegas Regional Qualifier on February 27, fans can expect more Regional Qualifiers all around the US and Europe, culminating in the final Regional Qualifier in Riot's hometown of Los Angeles in September. See the full, finalized tournament schedule below.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/04/roadma-1770234072170.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Riftbound 2026 Organized Play Roadmap</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The update also provided a more detailed breakdown of when to expect previews for the rest of the year's expansions starts; Unleashed previews start March 16, Vendetta on June 22, and Radiance kicks off on September 21. We have a full breakdown of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riftbound-tcg-full-release-schedule-2026">Riftbound's 2026 release schedule</a> with full dates and details. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most important updates come from the interviews with Guskin and Chai. State of the Game updates are intended to be transparent updates on the lessons the Riftbound team has learned throughout its lifecycle, and it's apparent they've learned many hard lessons already. To start, mechanically unique cards from separate products like Proving Grounds will not be present moving forward; "we’ve learned our lesson and do not plan to include mechanically unique cards in future iterations of this product", says Chai. Proving Grounds offered powerful cards not available open in the main <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/top-10-riftbound-origins-cards-to-pick-up-before-spiritforged-comes-out">Origins</a> set, and with Spiritforged, we'll see reprints of those cards as a way to get those unique cards in the hands of players who may have missed out due to supply issues. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest issue plaguing competitive play in China currently is the dominance of Draven, Glorious Executioner and the purple cards that make up most of the deck. Guskin states that the team's philosophy behind banning and/ or restricting cards is "that we want to intervene at a minimal level needed to correct an emergency state", with no current plans to take action at this time, opting instead to see how the meta will evolve once Spiritforged launches in the US similar to how it did with Origins. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked if Riot will be supporting Riftbound digitally, Chai responded that while they are aware of the interest in a digital client, their main focus is "the in-person social interaction, and we do not want that to be lost". </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a competitive player looking to attend a Regional Qualifier for a chance at a Best-Of metal Legend card, they've outlined how limited these highly sought-after prizes will be moving forward. Best-of metal cards will be rotated out events after every three set releases. So the Origins/ Proving Grounds Best-of cards will no longer be eligible for prizing following the release of Vendetta on July 31. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Chai confirmed that we will finally see the printing of new Legends in the three currently unused color combinations with Vendetta. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/04/new-color-combos-1770235730362.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">New Riftbound Legends with previously unused color combinations are coming with the third set, Vendetta. </figcaption></figure></output><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Riftbound: Spiritforged Releases February 13</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance writer for IGN.

			<p><a href="https://www.origami.ng/ubisoft-vantage-cancel-league-assassins-creed-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the French website Origami</a>, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> has canceled a <strong>secret Assassin's Creed co-op game</strong> codenamed <strong>AC League</strong>. Origami, which has a solid track record, claims to have verified the information with six current Ubisoft employees before publishing the story.</p>



<p>First and foremost, it should be clarified that <strong>this is not <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-invictus-an-arcade-multiplayer-game-rumored-to-launch-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin's Creed Invictus</a></strong>, the arcade Fall Guys-inspired PvP multiplayer game that was previously leaked to be in development. AC League was originally meant to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-reportedly-getting-a-co-op-mode-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>rumored Assassin's Creed Shadows co-op mode</strong></a>, which later morphed into a standalone title. It was in development at <strong>Ubisoft Annecy</strong>, the studio that led development on <strong><a href="http://wccftech.com/review/steep-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steep</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/riders-republic-beautiful-rocky-road/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riders Republic</a>,</strong> and also contributed to several Assassin's Creed games, including the multiplayer modes featured in Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood, Revelations, AC III, AC IV: Black Flag, and AC Unity.</p>



<p>According to the report, over the last year, the developer <strong>began questioning whether to keep League as a Shadows expansion: the DLC was seen as too long and costly to produce for the quality bar they wanted</strong>. They had two options on the table: either attach the co‑op framework onto another, more traditional Assassin's Creed game already in development elsewhere in the group, or shrink AC League's narrative and scope and pitch it as a small, standalone co‑op Assassin's Creed game built from the base of Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>Ubisoft Annecy pursued the second option, <strong>aiming to kick off invite‑only alpha sessions around May</strong> to test the game, refine it, and then get a formal greenlight. In the game, parties of up to four assassins would tackle missions together, presumably in a similar fashion to <strong>Assassin's Creed Unity</strong>, the last title to support online cooperative multiplayer.</p>



<p>As to the circumstances of the game's cancellation, Origami reports that <strong>executives from the newly created <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vantage Studios</a> subsidiary have been carefully reviewing each and every internal project</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and canceling plenty of them</a>). Just last week, after an internal play session, <strong>the project leads behind AC League were informed that the decision had been made to shut down the project</strong>. Annecy had put around 85 of its roughly 270 employees on this project.</p>



<p>While AC League is effectively dead, <strong>the co-op tech base developed by Ubisoft Annecy is reportedly being salvaged</strong> for potential new pitches to be attached to future Assassin's Creed games. Those co-op modes will have to be much cheaper to make than AC League was shaping up to be, though, which led to its cancellation.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Expedition 2—Release Date, Requirements, & Rewards, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-expedition-2-release-date-requirements-rewards-explained/</link>
            <guid>1427911</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s almost time for another progression wipe in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, as the next Expedition Project deadline is fast-approaching. This mechanic allows you to reset your account, go back to square one, whilst earning some exclusive rewards, bonuses, and temporary buffs.</p>



<p>Of course, you don’t have to reset, but Embark Studios has updated the rewards and requirements, and it seems much more worthwhile when compared to the first one. It’s a big decision to make, so you’ll want to be well-informed.</p>







<p>Luckily for you, Insider Gaming has all the information you’ll need for ARC Raiders’ Expedition <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project</a>, including the requirements, rewards, and when you’ll need to complete it.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-arc-raiders-second-expedition">When Is ARC Raiders’ Second Expedition?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to get packing. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Expedition window opens on February 25, and departures take place on March 1, meaning you’ve got until the end of February to complete the Expedition Project.</strong></p>



<p>It might seem like you still have a good amount of time to complete the Project, but be warned, you’ll need a lot of different resources if you want to finish it. It’s best to start sooner rather than later, as you might wind up missing the wipe and regretting it.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-requirements-for-the-second-expedition">What Are The Requirements For The Second Expedition?</h2>



<p><strong>There are six stages to the Expedition Project in ARC Raiders, with each one having four requirements each.</strong></p>



<p>The items vary from materials to ARC parts, but the toughest stage is bound to be the fifth one, which requires you to sell 800,000 Coins’ worth of supplies! The Expedition won’t come cheap, but if you want to complete it, here are all of the Project’s stages:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Expedition Project Stage</th><th data-align="center">Expedition Project Requirements</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 1: Foundation</td><td data-align="center">– 150 Metal Parts<br>– 200 Plastic Parts<br>– 80 ARC Alloy<br>– 15 Steel Springs</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 2: Core Systems</td><td data-align="center">– 35 Durable Cloth<br>– 25 Wires<br>– 20 Electrical Components<br>– 4 Cooling Coils</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 3: Framework</td><td data-align="center">– 4 Light Bulbs<br>– 30 Batteries<br>– 10 Shredder Gyros<br>– 1 Exodus Modules</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 4: Outfitting</td><td data-align="center">– 5 Frequency Modulation Boxes<br>– 5 Advanced Electrical Components<br>– 3 Ion Sputters<br>– 3 Leaper Pulse Units</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 5: Load Stage</td><td data-align="center">– 250,000 Coins worth of Combat Items<br>– 100,000 Coins worth of Survival Items<br>– 150,000 Coins worth of Provisions<br>– 300,000 Coins worth of Materials</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 6: Departure</td><td data-align="center">No donations needed, you’re ready for the Expedition</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-rewards-for-the-second-expedition">What Are The Rewards For The Second Expedition?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Is it worth it? Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You don’t get direct rewards from the Expedition Project like you would from other Projects, as you’ll instead be rewarded with permanent and consecutive bonuses for your character.</strong></p>



<p>However, your rewards will vary depending on whether you completed the first expedition or not, as well as how many Coins you have when you depart, which can all seem a bit confusing. Luckily for you, Insider Gaming has broken it down in the table below, splitting the rewards into two tiers:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Rewards If It’s Your First Expedition</th><th data-align="center">Rewards If It’s Your Second Expedition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">The Patchwork Outfit (Permanent)</td><td data-align="center">The Patchwork Outfit—Evolved (Permanent)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Scrappy Cosmetics (Permanent)</td><td data-align="center">Scrappy Cosmetics (Permanent)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">The Expedition Indicator Icon (Permanent)</td><td data-align="center">The Expedition Indicator Icon (Permanent)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">+ 12 Stash Spaces (Permanent)</td><td data-align="center">+ 24 Stash Spaces (Permanent)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">+ 0-5 Skill Points (Permanent, dependent on player wealth)</td><td data-align="center">+ 0-5 Skill Points (Permanent, dependent on player wealth)<br>+ Catch up on missed Skill Points (Permanent, dependent on player wealth)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">+ 5% XP Boost (Consecutive Buff)</td><td data-align="center">+ 10% XP Boost (Consecutive Buff)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">+ 6% Scrappy Materials Boost (Consecutive Buff)</td><td data-align="center">+ 12% Scrappy Materials Boost (Consecutive Buff)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">+ 60% Repair Value Increase (Consecutive Buff)</td><td data-align="center">+ 70% Repair Value Increase (Consecutive Buff)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The key thing to note regarding the Expedition rewards is the extra Skill Points, as they’re dependent on your Coin total when you depart on the Expedition. Each extra Skill Point is worth <strong>600,000 Coins</strong>, meaning you’ll need to have <strong>3,000,000 Coins</strong> to your name if you want all five Skill Points on offer. </p>







<p>If it’s your second Expedition, and you didn’t manage to claim all of the Skill Points from the first one, then you’re in luck, as there’s a way to make up for lost time. Those now have a value, too, as they’re worth <strong>300,000 Coins</strong> per Skill Point. If you want to claim all five of them, you’ll need an extra <strong>1,500,000 Coins</strong>; add that onto the original five Skill Points, and that totals a whopping <strong>4,500,000 Coins</strong>!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Larian Isn’t Involved in the Baldur’s Gate TV Show, and They’re Not Happy]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/larian-not-involved-baldurs-gate-tv-show-not-happy/</link>
            <guid>1427908</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It was recently revealed that HBO plans to produce a Baldur’s Gate live-action adaptation, helmed by Craig Mazin, one of the leads who has brought The Last of Us to life over the last few years. It has been confirmed that the show will continue after the events of Baldur’s Gate 3 and will feature the characters from the smash-hit 2023 game.</p>



<p>However, shortly after the news dropped regarding the show, it was confirmed that Larian Studios, the <strong>developer </strong>behind Baldur’s Gate 3, will have <strong>no involvement in the series</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-bucking-the-trend-and-not-involving-the-developer">Bucking the Trend and Not Involving the Developer</h2>



<p>Larian having zero involvement in a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hbo-developing-baldurs-gate-series-from-the-last-of-us-showrunner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur’s Gate 3 television series</a> is a bold move. From what we’ve seen already, developers of these popular games have had a direct input in the production of their live-action adaptations. For instance, Neil Druckmann is a writer and executive producer on The Last of Us, which surfaced in 2013 from Naughty Dog.</p>



<p>Similarly, the likes of Todd Howard (Bethesda Game Studios) have executive producer credits and deep involvement in the creation of Fallout, another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-more-than-a-decade/">award-winning adaptation</a> that just wrapped its second season this week.</p>



<p>In recent years, one of the only examples of a developer <strong>not </strong>being involved in a live-action adaptation would be the Borderlands movie. Randy Pitchford, of Gearbox, revealed to Insider Gaming at Gamescom 2025 that he didn’t have any input in the movie and would have felt uncomfortable if he had.</p>



<p>On social media, the Director of Publishing at Larian Studios, Michael Douse, <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2019571113345396945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Except that we made it popular enough for it to be referred to as Baldur’s Gate 3.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When prompted in the comments to confirm if Larian would ‘sue or something’, he simply said, ‘Not really.’</p>



<p>He then wrote a lengthy series of posts talking about Larian having some of the best video game writers in the world, explaining, ‘I genuinely don’t think anyone can trump our writers.’ He wrapped by saying, ‘Don’t abandon hope, but do expect the world. That’s the job.’</p>



<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Later, Swen Vincke, the CEO of Larian, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The endings of BG3 were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventures. There’s plenty of directions they could go. I’m eager to find out which ones Craig and his team will pick. He’s reached out for a chat so we’ll have the opportunity to tell him our thoughts.</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Do you think it’s a huge concern that Larian won’t be invested in the creation of a Baldur’s Gate 3 television show? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

		<p>Wishfully and Thunderful Games has announced the release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/planet-of-lana-2">Planet of Lana II: Children of the Leaf</a>, launching on 5th March 2026. There’s further surprises, though, as the game is also coming to Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, in addition to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and PC (and with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a> on day one), and there’s also a demo coming out next week!</p>
<p><iframe title="Planet of Lana II: Children of the Leaf - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NksRtFjpYGI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The playable demo will be going live on 11th February for all platforms, giving a first hands-on opportunity for Lana and Mui’s continuing adventure.</p>
<p>This next chapter in their tale will look to build on the strengths of the original. The story promises to be more ambitious, there’s new puzzles, and evolved companion mechanics for Lana to work with Mui. Lana is older, bigger and stronger, able to get around the world more readily, and there’s screenshots that show off swimming, which I believe is new for this game as well. Planet of Lana 2 still retains the delightful hand-painted visuals and the orchestral score.</p>
<p>Here’s Wishfully’s synopsis:</p>

<p>As greed and power divide the tribes of their home planet, Lana and her loyal companion Mui must stand together against the forces reshaping their world – struggling not just for survival, but for the very soul of their home. Embark on an unforgettable cinematic puzzle journey across Novo, where ancient mysteries and new threats will test your wits, challenge Lana’s unbreakable bond with Mui, and guide her toward her destiny.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the original game, saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/22/planet-of-lana-review/">our review</a>, “Planet of Lana looks and sounds as wonderful as its original reveal promised. While it doesn’t redefine the adventure platformer, the adorable partnership between Lana and Mui, the gorgeous art direction and sweeping soundtrack make this well worth experiencing.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/65215">Famitsu</a>'s latest numbers paint another picture of sleepy sales numbers this week, with nothing exceeding 15,000 copies sold. Bandai Namco's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/code_vein_2">Code Vein II</a> on PS5 emerged at the top of the pile with 14,452 debut sales to its name, narrowly beating <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, which still hangs around in second.</p>
<p>Much like we saw in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/uk-charts-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-plummets-as-familiar-faces-retake-the-podium">UK charts</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> has taken a bit of a tumble since grabbing the gold medal last week, and now finds itself in ninth. Meanwhile, three titles take up a whopping six spots in the top ten, with both their Switch 1 and Switch 2 editions making it into the upper reaches of the charts.</p>
<p>Here's the latest top ten physical sales in Japan:</p>

<p>Things were similarly sluggish on the hardware side of things. Switch 2 continued to put up some solid numbers, with an additional ~69,000 units to its name, but it was ghostly quiet from everything else across the board.</p>
<p>Combining the three SKUs for Switch and PS5 leans things in Sony's favour this week, with the Switch 1 models totalling in at 10,678, and the PS5 trio reaching 10,949.</p>

            <p>MachineGames' most recent release may be the brilliant Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, but the studio is of course also known for its Wolfenstein games. And, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-doesnt-sound-like-weve-heard-the-last-from-machinegames-wolfenstein-series">following an earlier hint that the studio wasn't finished with its nazi-busting series</a>, we now have more concrete word on the fate of MachineGames' Wolfenstein trilogy.</p>

<p>This word comes from studio director Jerk Gustafsson, who was chatting with Eurogamer's sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/machinegames-on-being-part-of-microsoft-going-back-to-the-office-and-wolfenstein-3">GamesIndustry</a> about MachineGames' 15 year legacy. During this conversation, Gustafsson admitted that because of the time it takes to make a video game in this day and age, he may only have a few more projects left in him before the end of his career.</p>
<p>"There's so many things that I would like to do, but I'm also getting a bit older, so I don't have that many games left in me," he said. "It takes a long time to make a game now, and let's say that we release one every four years, then maybe two more, maybe three if I'm lucky."</p>
<p>So, could one of these hypothetical projects be Wolfenstein 3? While Gustafsson was careful with his answer, he did say this:</p>
<p>"Our intention has always been to go back to Wolfenstein. We wanted to finish the trilogy. And when we do that, that is something that I don't want to comment on. It can be now, it can be later, but we're not done with it. That's what I can say."</p>

<p>As for the more immediate future, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-switch-2-release-dates-leak-ahead-of-nintendo-direct">MachineGames is set to release Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on Switch 2 later this year</a>. Like I have said, this game is brilliant, and I loved being able to whip crack my way across the globe with Indy.</p>
<p>"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones, The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">original five star Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review from 2024</a>.</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wolfenstein-is-the-next-game-series-to-get-an-adaptation-for-tv">Wolfenstein TV series in the works</a>, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">Bethesda's Todd Howard is staying tight-lipped on how things are progressing</a>.</p>

		<p>What is your favourite piece of video game music? If we started humming the opening theme to Halo, how many of you would join in? What about if it was Tifa’s Theme or the theme to Assassin’s Creed? All of these live rent-free in our heads, and no doubt yours too.</p>
<p>This is something that the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, or BAFTA as we all know it, is keenly aware of, and it is to their immense credit that they realised this more than 20 years ago when they held the inaugural British Academy Games Award for Music in 2002, celebrating “excellence in composition for a game music score, through original music and/or creative use of licensed track”.</p>
<p>To put that in perspective, composer Jeremy Soule won for his work on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, beating the other nominees: Command &amp; Conquer: Generals, Primal, Republic: The Revolution, TimeSplitters 2 and Return to Castle Wolfenstein. If, like us, you remember playing these games at launch, we can recommend good deals on walking sticks.</p>

<p>It’s with this rich catalogue of exceptional music in mind that BAFTA Games in Concert was produced. Its world premiere at the Royal Festival Hall on Saturday 31 January certainly felt celebratory. Conducted by BAFTA-winning composer Austin Wintory, and backed up by the 65-piece BBC Concert Orchestra and London Voices, attendees were met with iconic video game soundtracks from over the past two decades.</p>

<p>As the ensemble did what they do best, starting with Baldur’s Gate 3, a screen behind them played excerpts from the games they were celebrating. The thing that differentiates this from your average performance, however, is the game footage being cut with real-life singers, placed into a setting that reflects the game — in this case, a red-head in a green dress with Celtic jewellery singing opera.</p>

<p>What followed was a night of fantastic music. Wintory introduced Jessica Curry’s Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture before ploughing straight into Inon Zur’s Fallout 4, followed by Jesper Kyd’s Assassin’s Creed.</p>

<p>As excellent as these pieces are — and they are truly excellent, the choir singing the theme to Assassin’s Creed gave me goosebumps — this is where the issues with this performance came to the fore. It could be opening night tech issues, but the human performer intercut with the footage on the screen was playing a wooden flute-like instrument. However, despite seeing his fingers moving, I couldn’t hear him playing over what was in the room. Perhaps the AV team knocked the slider by mistake, but it felt a little off.</p>
<p>The other thing that was obviously missing after Wintory introduced Curry’s phenomenal score was any sort of intro or anecdote about what was to come. This is where real value could have been given to the paying audience — small insights into what each composer thought, liked or was inspired by as they crafted the melodies that have stayed with us for decades. They were in the room, it wouldn’t have been hard to pick their brains.</p>

<p>The best video game music concerts I’ve seen all have insights and trivia from the composer or lead musician to hang the performances on. It’s never for every piece, and it doesn’t have to be, but it provides not only a structure for the performance, but also a frame of reference for those who haven’t played every game that’s being showcased that evening.</p>
<p>Absent such a narrative, the BAFTA Games in Concert felt a lot more like a greatest hits compilation than a celebration, especially in the second half. Hopefully this was just the opening-night settling into a format and future audiences will get to hear why Disco Elysium has the tone they’re hearing, which instrument you see played on the screens during Far Cry 4 and what inspired the music behind Returnal.</p>
<p>Still, it was a night of phenomenal music, played beautifully by some truly expert musicians. You really can’t beat live music, especially when a full orchestra is on stage.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> has been through a sizeable array of changes since launch in February next year, amid some very uncivilised reactions to boat-rocking features like the new age format. The next update, Test Of Time, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7s-big-test-of-time-update-thatll-bring-back-playing-as-one-civ-for-the-whole-game-is-set-to-drop-this-spring">will restore the ability to play as one civilization through the whole game</a>, while making changes to how victories are earned in the hope of creating some lategame variety.</p>
<p>All these tweaks and rejigs invite a more fundamental question. “Why didn’t they just launch it as an early access game?” I remember moaning to another journalist last year. I should have directed my moaning at executive producer Dennis Shirk, who says that Firaxis are tentatively open to the idea and, indeed, “jealous” of developers taking this approach.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
That’s a snippet from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/interview-civilization-viis-devs-on-the-big-update-meant-to-win-critics-back/">an Ars Technica interview</a> this week in which Shirk and franchise creative director Ed Beach look back on the transition from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization VI</a> to Civilization VII, and what they might try with the hypothetical Civilization 8.</p>
<p>One of the major changes with Civilization VI was that Firaxis had access to lot more player telemetry, compared to Civilisation V, rather than monitoring the feedback on Reddit and fansites like CivFanatics. Amongst other things, they discovered that most players don’t finish a single game, which is part of the reason for Civ 7’s more broken-up, modular historical progression.
</p><p>
Based on the reaction to Civ 7, the devs are trying to get hold of that feedback earlier in development of new mechanics or systems. “It’s the worst-kept secret in the world that we’ve had this external test team for quite a few years called our Frankenstein Group,” Beach told the site.</p>
<p>With publisher 2K’s input, the Frankenstein Group is being expanded into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-will-bring-back-the-ability-to-play-as-one-civ-for-the-whole-game-bypassing-the-divisive-age-system">a larger and more structured playtesting program, the Firaxis Feature Workshop</a>. (I enjoy the implication that a bunch of mad scientists have gone mainstream – I’m picturing Doc Brown, Doctor Octopus and Doctor Eggman at an investor fare, explaining the nutritional benefits of formaldehyde to passing soccer moms.)
</p>
<p>
Officially embracing full early access development (not just preorder-baiting ‘advanced access’) would surely make a lot of sense for Civ, even discounting the ire aimed at Civ 7. After all, even the best 4X strategy games tend to evolve a lot throughout their shelf lives. Ars Technica popped the question, and Shirk had this to say: “It’s one of those things that you can never say never. As developers, we’re always looking at that jealously because we see that it’s a great opportunity.” 
</p>
<p>
Even so, I doubt it’ll ever happen, because when you present yourself as selling an unfinished game, it’s harder to charge $70 or more for it upfront. Still, perhaps the wilting fortunes of Civ 7 will persuade 2K and Take-Two Interactive to be more calculating with the game's development process.</p><p>Civ 7 set a series record for preorders, but has struggled to match its predecessors in terms of Steam concurrent users. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-insists-projections-for-the-lifetime-value-of-civilization-7-are-very-consistent-with-our-initial-expectations-for-the-title-despite-slow-start">Speaking in August last year</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick confessed that the game had gotten off to a “slow start” with the caveat that “Civ has always been a slow burn” and “right now our projections for the lifetime value of the title are very consistent with our initial expectations for the title.” The publishers have yet to share any total sales figures.
</p>
<p>
The broader question around Civ going early access is whether “early access” really means anything, any more, inasmuch as “early access” has sort of bled into “live service". Most games of a certain scale receive a number of updates post-launch, and players have come to expect them, with a vocal minority pillorying games as “dead” if too many months go past without substantial changes. I think there’s probably a longer feature to write there – do you have any thoughts?

<p>Regular new content drops continue to take place in Fortnite, and February 2026 is stacked, with Epic Games dropping a big teaser roadmap of what to expect.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/battle-royale/">Battle Royale</a> behemoth is in the latter stages of the current season, but a new Fortnite Festival season has only just begun. Additionally, updates are also coming to other modes, including Reload and Fortnite OG.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for all of the dates and new content coming in the Fortnite Roadmap for February 2026, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-complete-fortnite-february-2026-roadmap">Complete Fortnite February 2026 Roadmap</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to come. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite has plenty to add in February with the month-long Love Legends event, featuring new collabs, free rewards, and more.</strong></p>



<p>The Love Legends event kicked off immediately after the update on February 5, with the first major content coming the following day with the second wave of KPop Demon Hunter Skins. </p>



<p>Later in the month, players can expect new weapons and items in Battle Royale, along with the long-awaited return of The Seven.</p>



<p>The table below shows all of the major additions coming to Fortnite in February 2026, as revealed by Epic Games. New announcements will be added regularly.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Fortnite Addition</th><th data-align="center">Date</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">February 6</td><td data-align="center">– KPop Demon Hunters Wave 2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 7</td><td data-align="center">– Battle Royale Power Hour<br>– Pink Storm Shield</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 13</td><td data-align="center">– Nitemare Island Returns<br>– Cupid’s Crossbow</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 14</td><td data-align="center">– Battle Royale Power Hour</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 15</td><td data-align="center">– Fortnite OG Ice Storm Live Event</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 19</td><td data-align="center">– DeLorean Return<br>– Lantern Fest Reload Map</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 21</td><td data-align="center">– Battle Royale Power Hour</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">February 23</td><td data-align="center">– Return of The Seven<br>– New Item</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-there-more-coming-in-february-2026">Is There More Coming in February 2026?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Fortnite will definitely have plenty more to add in February 2026, including content added beyond February 23.</strong></p>



<p>Epic Games’ reveal teaser only covered up until February 23 and the additions beyond that date will likely center around the long-awaited return of The Seven.</p>



<p>There will also be a significant build-up to the first seasonal change of 2026, with Chapter 7, Season 2 kicking off in early March.</p>



<p>Players should also expect further collab skins to drop in the Item Shop, as Epic Games is on a roll of major additions so far this year.</p>
