            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/14/24320757/infinity-nikki-review-gacha-dress-up-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>You know that flavor of internet conversation where one familiar item is identified as another, wholly different item in a way that shouldn’t make sense but weirdly does? Like how <a href="https://www.eater.com/2017/7/24/16019500/hot-dog-sandwich-controversy-lol">a hot dog could be classified as a sandwich</a>, or because it has a filling enclosed by dough, a Pop-Tart is ravioli. Despite <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home"><em>Infinity Nikki</em></a>’s looks of a high-quality dress-up gacha game, it is actually <em>Breath of the Wild</em> reborn in some fancy-ass clothes.</p><p>In the game, you play as Nikki, an ordinary girl who gets whisked away to the fantasy world of Miraland along with her talking, bipedal, pantsless cat Momo. In Miraland, fashion is magic and a guild of stylists use it to combat the world’s evils and one another.</p><div><p>I had issues with its clunky, unintuitive, and at times unresponsive control scheme.</p></div><p><em>Infinity Nikki </em>having so much in common with <em>Breath of the Wild</em> was not immediately obvious. I started out disliking the game immensely. I had issues with its clunky, unintuitive, and at times unresponsive control scheme. The menu icon is in the top-right corner of the screen but is opened by holding the <em>left </em>shoulder button. But when you open the radial menu, you can only highlight icons with the right thumbstick. The direction pad is straight-up not functional, and while you use the X button to confirm selections, circle is used to click through dialogue. It’s a mess and a platform switch between mobile and PS5 didn’t address this at all.&nbsp;</p><div><p>There is an issue with linking accounts on PlayStation that could result in being unable to use cross-progression. This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-link-accounts-infinity-nikki"><em>Eurogamer</em></a> article explains the confusing details. To avoid any issues, before your first<em> Infinity Nikki</em> session on any platform, make an Infold Games account on their <a href="https://account.infoldgames.com/login">website</a> and use that to sign in where you like.</p></div><div><p>Control issues aside, <em>Nikki</em> then rubbed up against my antipathy for gacha games. I don’t hate them outright despite their reputation for having the same kind of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18226852/loot-boxes-gaming-regulation-gambling-free-to-play">predatory design elements</a> that led to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/19/16783136/loot-boxes-video-games-gambling-legal">crackdowns on lootboxes</a>. Rather, I’ve found them to be either <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24195175/zenless-zone-zero-impressions-genshin-impact-mihoyo">completely impenetrable</a> with their thousand million progression systems and currencies layered over utterly banal gameplay, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/1/23150381/diablo-immortal-preview-mobile-activision-blizzard">so naked in their core purpose to extract my time and money</a> that they turn me off. At first blush,<em> Infinity Nikki</em> felt like that.</p></div><p><small>In addition to exploration and fashion battles, Infinity Nikki is filled with all kinds of mini-games that provide an entertaining break from gameplay like this take on <em>Flappy Bird. </em></small></p><p>But as I was running through a pastoral countryside, gentle piano music playing at a default volume a few notches below a whisper, I spied a golden twinkle in the distance. I found a plant I could collect. Then another. Then Momo, who is basically the mobile game version of <em>Persona 5</em>’s Morgana, told me something called a “whimstar” was nearby. I found it at the top of a rocky cliff, requiring some light platforming to reach. From the elevation, I saw a treasure chest, so I used my bubble outfit to gently glide toward it before changing into my purification outfit to dispatch the monsters guarding it. Once they were gone, I saw a bug I could collect with the new bug catcher’s outfit I had just made. Then I…&nbsp;</p><p>It’s easy to read this and think that all <em>Infinity Nikki</em> has done is take <em>BOTW</em> and stuff it with microtransactions (which I’ll get to later). But by the time I had my, “Oh shit. This is <em>Zelda</em>,” revelation, it didn’t feel like a cheap clone. The same pleasing jolt I got solving a Korok puzzle, I felt from getting a whimstar. And the dress-up mechanics added a layer of novelty that further enhanced the game and my enjoyment.</p><div><figcaption>Infinity Nikki has a seriously robust photo mode.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Infold Games</cite></p></div><p>Everything in <em>Nikki </em>is powered by fashion. There are special outfits, like my monster purification dress or bug catcher uniform, that impart abilities that let you traverse the map, collect materials, and fight monsters. You then use materials you’ve gathered from those activities to upgrade your ability outfits or obtain the clothing you want to customize your avatar. There are so many pieces of clothing and accessories, each one rendered in intricately beautiful detail, that you use to exude your own style and win fashion battles against other stylists.</p><p>After exploration, I had the most fun crafting outfits in fashion duels against NPC stylists. Each piece of clothing is assigned points in five categories: sweet, fresh, elegant, sexy, or cool. Whoever has the highest points in the designated categories wins. Since these battles are based on score, you can easily win wearing an ugly mishmash of high-value clothes – kinda like how I won my first battle. The experience was so rewarding that it made me want to try winning future battles with looks that are both high-scoring and high-fashion.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption>The absolute atrocity with which I won my first stylist duel.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Infold Games</cite></p></div><p>To borrow a phrase from <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/feature/in-final-fantasy-xiv-glamour-is-the-true-endgame/">“Glamour is the endgame.”</a> It means that you’re not playing to become powerful or beat the game, you’re playing solely to fund your fashion habit. And it’s surprisingly not expensive.</p><p>Despite<em> Nikki </em>being a gacha game that is, at its core, designed to get you to spend money, its monetization systems feel more vestigial than critical. Most gacha games never require players to spend money, but are usually designed such that you can’t help it. Core game activities are arbitrarily limited and if you want to keep playing, you have to pay up. From what I’ve seen after 15 hours,<em> Nikki</em> doesn’t have that.&nbsp;</p><p>Dressing up is the core feature and there’s a cash shop where you can spend money on consumables that give you the chance (known as “pulling” in the gacha community) of winning high-value, tantalizingly pretty clothes. But there are so many other, cash-free ways to get outfits that are just as pleasing as anything for sale.&nbsp;</p><p>You can make a look out of mixing and matching pieces from your ability outfits, earn clothing or the blueprints to make them from quest rewards, or simply buy stuff from in-game vendors with in-game cash. I was not a fan of all the lace, sparkles, and pastels I made for my first outfit that I considered tossing a few bucks into the fashion slot machine. But as I continued my magpie-like adventures I made a punk rock look I’d actually wear in real life without spending a dime. It felt like the shop is only there for the folks who just have to have the exclusives it offers.</p><div><figcaption>An example of the kinds of clothing you can “pull” for with Infinity Nikki’s gacha mechanic.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Infold Games</cite></p></div><p>I enjoyed how <em>Infinity Nikki </em>subverted my expectations. A gacha game managed to recreate <em>Breath of the Wild</em> in function and spirit while the depth and detail of the fashions spoke directly to my love of individual expression in games. It wasn’t simply an Unreal Engine 5 version of the dress-up games of the early internet but a spiritual, sartorial successor of one of the best games of the last decade.</p><p><small><em>Infinity Nikki </em>is available now on Android, iOS, PlayStation, and PC.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Game Awards 2024 <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> with a stunning six-minute pre-rendered cinematic trailer (powered by NVIDIA's GPU about to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-gaming-ces-2025-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at CES 2025) of The Witcher IV, the first installment in the new saga.</p>
<p>The trailer confirmed what most fans had surmised following the ending of Wild Hunt: Cirilla will be the protagonist of the new saga rather than Geralt. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-the-witcher-4-cd-projekt-reds-plans-for-its-next-big-rpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to IGN</a>, CD Projekt RED developers commented on this choice, starting with Cian Maher (franchise and lore designer), who said:</p>
<p><em>‘The Witcher’ as a title refers to both Geralt and Ciri and always has. I think she's arguably more important to the plot than Geralt himself is.</em></p>
<p>They wouldn't say anything more about Geralt, although it seems unlikely he wouldn't appear in some capacity in The Witcher IV. Anyway, Game Director Sebastian Kalemba added in the interview that Cirilla's relatively new enrollment as a professional Witcher also means she still has to develop her own code for dealing with the various situations. This, in turn, will increase the player's agency in the game.</p>
<p><em>Since I can remember, we've been talking about Ciri and how much she deserves her own journey. I love this grit in her. She's almost obsessed with the way she lives. There are some moments where you have to go with your heart instead of always going with the calculated calls. And this is what I love in Ciri. She's less calculating, following her heart, her passion, her gut feel.</em></p>
<p><em>We want to let players try to define her. She's about to form her own codex on her own terms. The way she actually deals with the monsters, the way she deals with quests, the adventures, it's her own unique way. We want to put player agency at the center. We’re giving more tools for players' disposal, to be able to not only play and go with the consequences narratively but also gameplay-wise. We want to give players more opportunities to be able to feel that they define their experience.</em></p>
<p>Kalemba then admitted that Cyberpunk 2077 had more varied gameplay than The Witcher 3, and it's an area where the studio wants to improve in this upcoming title.</p>
<p><em>I believe the gameplay in Cyberpunk 2077 was more varied than in The Witcher 3, and it allowed more freedom when it comes to creating character builds and being able to experience encounters in your own way. This is something we definitely want to bring as a lesson to The Witcher IV. We want to improve on The Witcher 3's gameplay, but also we want to improve the alignment of the way you will be able to explore the world.</em></p>
<p>CD Projekt RED also told IGN that the TGA 2024 trailer underwent many revisions as the studio sought to ensure that every frame had its own meaning for fans to discover.</p>
<p>The Witcher IV has no release window. If we had to guesstimate, we'd put it between late 2026 and early 2027, so prepare for a long wait.</p>

<p><em>G-STAR was our first event in Korea. It was incredibly opening to just how prevalent gaming culture is there. Not only did we get to enjoy the convention that was stacked with game devs, but we also had the opportunity to talk to some of our biggest names like Jang Wonyoung and Kim Yeji.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-six-invitational-brazil">Six Invitational (Brazil)</h3>



<p><em>This event likely had one of the best esports environments we will ever witness. The arena in Sao Paolo was full of energy with fans bringing in flags and drums, and the final matchup included two twin brothers, both from Brazil, on opposing teams.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia">Esports World Cup (Saudi Arabia)</h3>



<p><em>The Esports World Cup was one of the events we were able to get the most up close and personal with, meeting competitors from both Warzone and League of Legends. For Warzone, we were able to organise interviews with competitors like JoeWo, Breadman, and Jukeyz, as well as getting to see the Falcons dominate and entertain with some trash talk.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-evo-united-states">EVO (United States)</h3>



<p><em>This was the first EVO we attended, and it didn’t disappoint. EVO is run in a really interesting way that encourages a bit more of the ‘roots’ of esports, where you have people crowding around random tables on the floor to watch as people compete, and it eventually builds up to a massive crowd watching the main stage. We were able to see Punk, Nitro, and SonicFox take home big, passionate wins.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-thunderpick-world-championship-germany">Thunderpick World Championship (Germany)</h3>



<p><em>The Thunderpick World Championship was hosted on an incredibly small scale, boiler room-esque venue. We witnessed The MongolZ take home the win alongside a crowd that absolutely favoured them and wasn’t afraid to show it.</em></p>



<p>What was your favourite esports or gaming event of 2024? For me, it was Gamescom in Cologne. This year marked my first attendance of the event and it was mind-blowing in every respect.</p>

<p>Following a stunning run in Shanghai that saw Team Spirit eliminate both Liquid and MOUZ, the squad has secured a prestigious place in the tournament’s grand final. The team will be joined by either FaZe Clan or G2 Esports once the remaining semi-final fixture wraps up in just a couple of hours.</p>



<p>It has been a stellar run thus far for Team Spirit, and the squad has contributed to some of the most-viewed matches in the tournament until now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-everything-to-play-for">Everything To Play For</h2>



<p>The Perfect World Shanghai Major has a $500,000 grand prize waiting for the victor, and at this point, it could be Team Spirit, FaZe Clan, or G2 Esports that lifts the trophy. It has been a relatively close-matched event thus far, and some players are appreciative of the challenge.</p>



<p>For instance, FaZe Clan’s <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40552/karrigan-i-want-vitality-g2-and-spirit-why-not-make-it-the-hardest-major-playoff-run-ever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Karrigan</a> – one of the most storied competitors in CS history – set out a path ahead of him and his team that many would fear:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I want Vitality. I want G2 in the semis, and I want Spirit in the final. That’s three teams we normally haven’t beaten the whole year, why not make it the hardest Major playoff run ever? I’m down for that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Team Spirit’s qualification into the grand final wasn’t easy going for the squad. MOUZ put up a solid fight, particularly in the opening round on Nuke. This map saw Spirit’s prodigy, donk, secure his second-worst performance of the year, emerging with a rating of just 0.36 and a KD of 6 – 17.</p>



<p>The team regained, of course – and now they sit poised to secure the biggest single prize they’ve ever nabbed in Counter-Strike esports.</p>



<p>How do you think the grand final will unfold? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/huke-optic-kenny-pickup-cdl/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98the-perfect-player-for-us%E2%80%99-optic-kenny-talks-about-huke%E2%80%99s-sudden-cdl-pickup.1061601/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/huke-optic-kenny-pickup-cdl/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In recent days, the Call of Duty League scene has been up in arms about the widely debated sudden ‘dismissal’ of Pred from OpTic Texas. The rumours circulated like wildfire after the Australian pro player was removed from OpTic Texas’ starting roster and Cuyler ‘Huke’ Garland was picked up.</p>



<p>Last night, Huke debuted (again) with OpTic, going face-to-face with Vancouver Surge, his old team, and promptly impressing fans everywhere with how quickly he gelled with the team. In some ways, it was a homecoming for Huke – but some OpTic Texas fans are still displeased with how Pred is being treated in the wake of his removal.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-can-do-whatever-we-want">‘We Can Do Whatever We Want’</h2>



<p>In a post-match interview, OpTic’s Kenny, a two-time world champion, explained why Huke was such a solid pickup following the team’s win over Vancouver Surge:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think Cuyler (Huke) was the perfect player for us.</p>



<p>We can do whatever we want because our pacing is just so fast.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Huke’s dominance was displayed perfectly during the fixture against Vancouver Surge. It wasn’t a close match-up by any means, with OpTic Texas losing the opening Hardpoint and then proceeding to wipe the floor with Surge at every given opportunity, starting with a 6 – 1 scoreline in Search.</p>



<p>Like Shotzzy, Huke has insane movement capabilities, and Black Ops 6’s Omnimovement mechanics have only served to heighten those in-game talents.</p>



<p>Of course, if Vancouver Surge had beaten OpTic Texas following the Huke pickup, fans in the Green Wall would have been singing a very different tune. Regardless of the circumstances, it would have been nothing but slander and accusations against the squad for dropping Pred.</p>



<p>Do you think grabbing Huke was a good move for OpTic Texas? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/game-awards-2024-future-class-game-changer-geoff-keighley<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During Thursday’s Game Awards, Geoff Keighley took the stage with one of his rare but practiced airs of sobriety. “Now the sad reality is, the past few years the gaming industry has suffered significant and unprecedented industry-wide layoffs,” he said. “Honestly as a show, we kind of struggle with how to address these topics in a constructive way.” Then he introduced a new award: “Game Changer,” which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QMXa97WzWM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went to Amir Satvat</a>, a biz dev director at Tencent, for his efforts to help laid-off game workers. The audience ate this up, giving Satvat a standing ovation. But online, a few observers <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/carlivelocci.com/post/3ld5o7bkfd72z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">couldn’t help but ask</a> “What happened to the Future Class?”</p><p>The Future Class is an official Game Awards program that bills itself as honoring 50 "individuals around the world who represent the bright, bold, and inclusive future for video games” per year. Or at least, it was. This year, Keighley and company put the program on pause following a 2023 in which, among other things, Future Class members <a href="https://aftermath.site/one-week-and-2600-signatures-later-game-awards-havent-acknowledged-future-class-palestine-letter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published an open letter</a> urging Keighley to acknowledge Israel’s genocide of Palestinians in Gaza, which was signed by over 3,000 people. Keighley <a href="https://aftermath.site/at-this-years-game-awards-nobody-won" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did not say anything</a> about the letter before or during last year's show.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Amir Satvat Wins TGA Game Changer at The Game Awards 2024" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4QMXa97WzWM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>According to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-hasn-t-the-game-awards-announced-a-future-class-for-2024-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Developer</a>, Keighley and Future Class organizer Emily Bouchac met with Future Class members in December 2023, with many expressing that they felt the program had underserved them in terms of travel, resources, funding, and networking opportunities. It seems like the Game Awards took the feedback to heart, building out a new networking program that connects members with industry peers and offering 2023 inductees free tickets and hotel rooms at this year’s show. But amid this apparent retooling, Keighley and Bouchac were conspicuously quiet about the prospect of a 2024 Future Class cohort. Ultimately, there wasn’t one.&nbsp;</p><p>"Leading up to the Game Awards we knew that the program had been put on pause following feedback from the last year after we had the big group call to discuss what with Geoff and the organizers what they could do to make it better,” presenter, writer, video producer, and Future Class member Mourad El-Dine Abdou told Aftermath. “I do genuinely believe Emily wants to make The Future Class something everyone can be proud of, and it is a huge task now that there's over 150 members in it around the world, so personally I'm glad that they're not trying to rush anything out just for the sake of ticking boxes and want to take their time making sure that they do this properly."</p><p>"I think for the program to work in a way that feels satisfying to the recipients and TGA itself, it would require a lot more resources than they’d be willing to commit," narrative designer and Future Class member Chris Kindred told Aftermath. "I’d say [not inducting new members for now] is better than having a growing stable of workers asking what we’re here for exactly."</p><p>It is unclear whether there will be a new Future Class cohort in 2025. “I don't believe [Keighley and Bouchac have announced anything],” said Abdou. “Truth be told, Geoff isn't very vocal or active in the Future Class Discord, but I'm hoping with the awards wrapped up that there might be some new information moving forward.”&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>"I think for the program to work in a way that feels satisfying to the recipients and TGA itself, it would require a lot more resources than they’d be willing to commit.</p></blockquote></figure><p>In the meantime, some in and around the industry worry that the Game Changer award could function as a sort of replacement – a means by which The Game Awards can continue to bolster its reputation while avoiding long, sometimes unflattering stares into a mirror of its own making.&nbsp;</p><p>"Winner [Satvat] seems like a nice dude," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewillarowe.bsky.social/post/3ld5ojyidxc2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> former Kotaku staffer and current freelance writer Willa Rowe, "but it’s hard not to see how Geoff could think it’s easier to control one person’s message than the message of multiple years Future Class members."</p><p>Others have raised an eyebrow at this year’s choice of honoree, whose efforts do not strike them as entirely altruistic.&nbsp;</p><p>"Amir is <a href="https://amirsatvat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">positioning himself</a> as some sort of expert, some sort of #1 Google search result for 'games jobs resources' that provides 'exclusive perks' and funnels viewers to other people's blogs – most of whom charge for paid speaking gigs, coaching, and 'career optimization,'" <a href="https://x.com/MRIXRT/status/1867620333001359600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> YouTube video essayist Moriarty.&nbsp;</p><p>"TGA also positioned Amir as some guy who just felt really bad for everyone, some fan of games who saw this tragedy and felt a need to do something to address it, and while yeah he's being paraded in front of the people who fired everyone, he's at least doing something,” Moriarty continued, “except Amir is (surprise) part of the same crowd. Amir finds game companies for Tencent to acquire, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amirsatvat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after coming from Amazon Games</a>. ... He's not some random guy, he's part of a [multibillion dollar] multinational supercorporation."</p><p>In that sense, Satvat is just about the most appropriate first pick for this distinction imaginable. He did a good thing, but in a corporate-friendly, non-boat-rocking way – while working for some of the industry’s largest, most powerful companies. This is (and probably always will be) the conflict at the heart of The Game Awards: Keighley badly wants to be recognized for doing good, but he is keenly aware of which masters he serves. He has to be; otherwise the access and sponsorships dry up. You cannot act as an agent of change when your very existence is a product of the status quo.</p><p>"I really hope that the Game Changer isn't a replacement for Future Class, because Future Class has built an amazing community the last few years of under-represented people who can connect, network, and have a direct link to The Game Awards to try and make the industry a better place,” said Abdou. “I'll be extremely disappointed if Future Class is discontinued as I think both these programs are extremely special and can work to really make an impact in the games industry."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Swen Vincke being MVP of gamedev during TGA2024" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hjcy-VZiQ0w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This is not to say that the show hasn’t <a href="https://x.com/spaceghost/status/1867392275351056614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made progress</a>. Larian’s Swen Vincke – admittedly the CEO of what has become a large and influential company – strode into the Game Awards spotlight <a href="https://x.com/N9FCC12322/status/1867566017750458548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wearing a ceasefire pin</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hjcy-VZiQ0w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delivered a speech</a> critical of his peers. Beginning with the conceit that “an oracle” told him which games will take home GOTY in the future, he said:</p><p>“Game of the year 2025 is going to be made by a studio who found the formula to make it up here on stage. It's stupidly simple, but somehow it keeps on getting lost. A studio makes a game because they want to make a game they want to play themselves. They created it because it hadn't been created before. They didn't make it to increase market share. They didn't make it to serve the brand. They didn't have to meet arbitrary sales targets, or fear being laid off if they didn't meet those targets. … They understood the value of respect, that if they treated their developers and players well, the same developers and players would forgive them when things didn't go as planned. But above all they cared about their games, because they love games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/australian-video-game-list<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are so many good video games you could be playing at any given moment, games made from teams of all sizes from all over the world, but for just this moment I'd like to focus our gaze on one country in particular: my country.</p><p>Australia is a nation whose video game influence has waxed and waned over the years, ranging from<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit_(1982_video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> early pioneer</a> to<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2K_Australia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> AAA outpost</a> to<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-17/australian-game-dev-studios-shutting-down/3575196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Great Recession-affected wasteland</a> to<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/28/how-the-australian-gaming-app-fruit-ninja-reached-one-billion-downloads#:~:text=Interview-,Fruit%20Ninja%3A%20how%20the%20slice%2Dand%2D,dice%20game%20reached%201bn%20downloads&amp;text=Fruit%20Ninja%20has%20just,Halfbrick%20Studios%2C%20celebrated%20with%20cake." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> mobile gaming powerhouse</a> to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/insulation-vs-isolation-the-question-defining-the-future-of-australia-s-game-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">indie specialists</a>. I've been alive for most of that time (and blogging on the internet for nearly half of it!), and one thing that's always struck me is that while loads of Australian games have been huge international successes, there's been surprisingly little international recognition that they were <em>Australian</em>.</p><p>That's probably down to many of the games themselves--few of the big successes have been distinctly Australian in their setting or design the way, say, <em>The Witcher 3</em> is distinctly Polish--but it's still struck me as a weird oversight! So it's lovely to see that website/podcast Sifter<a href="https://www.sifter.com.au/post/2024-the-definitive-list-of-australian-made-video-games-playstation-xbox-switch-pc-steam-vr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> have once again compiled their big annual list of video games that were made in Australia</a>, so you can either learn all about new stuff, or gasp in wonder that one of your favourite games of 2024 was made somewhere you didn't realise.</p><p>The list contains a bunch of excellent indie games, many of which we've written about here on Aftermath! Including:</p><p>And, just yesterday:</p><p>But it's also a handy reminder that the AAA video game industry's web of contractors reaches all corners of the globe, with everything from <em>Black Ops 6</em> to <em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</em> being worked on by Australian teams.</p><p>If you'd like to scroll through the list yourself and check out some very good indie video games--<a href="https://aftermath.site/game-awards-trailer-ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">something I'd recommend on a weekend like this</a>--<a href="https://www.sifter.com.au/post/2024-the-definitive-list-of-australian-made-video-games-playstation-xbox-switch-pc-steam-vr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can find it here</a>, along with links to most of their Steam pages as well.</p><p>(<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-bluey-video-game-sucks-for-australians-and-everyone-else" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you're wondering where the <em>Bluey </em>game is, well firstly it wasn't made by an Australian studio, secondly it came out in 2023, and thirdly it sucked</a>).&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/game-awards-2024-future-class-game-changer-geoff-keighley"><h3>With The Future Class On Hold, The Game Awards’ Attempts At Doing Good Produce Mixed Results</h3></a><p>Geoff Keighley wants to be perceived as an agent of change for the better, but he's propped up by the status quo</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mouthwashing-review.1061454/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mouthwashing-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">My wife and I are expecting our first child soon, so I’ve spent the better part of a year reflecting on big concepts like leadership, responsibility, accountability, and trust. I’m considering who I am and how exactly I’m supposed to raise another human and not pass on all of my worst traits. It was in this emotionally raw state that Mouthwashing came along and punched me in the face.<strong> </strong>While mechanically simple – there’s not much to do besides talk to other characters, pick things up, and search the spaceship you are confined to – it tells its story in a way that couldn’t be done without the burden of interactivity, taking full advantage of what sets games apart from the likes of movies or TV. And I don’t use the word burden lightly, as that’s precisely how it felt to keep playing at times (in a good way). “<em>Please don’t make me do this,” </em>was often my prevailing thought, but uncovering the mysteries of how things got quite so bad on this ship always compelled me to continue.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mouthwashing Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The premise is straightforward: A group of people in a long-haul space freighter, the Tulpar, contend with the aftermath of a disaster, with your perspective bouncing around between several different times over the span of about a year. To go into more specifics about the story would spoil more about Mouthwashing than I am willing, as the surprise of picking apart what happened here and why is a driving force. But suffice to say, it wrings out as much dread, character exploration, and body horror as one conceivably could over the two-to-three-hour runtime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The surreal tone all that takes is heightened by Mouthwashing’s PS1-esque visual style. Characters are recognizably human, but also just <em>off </em>enough to be dismissed as something else entirely. It’s a funhouse mirror, a twisted depiction used to express how we see people as tools in real life, and how easy it is to deny the humanity in someone staring straight at you. It’s a great choice, as hyper-realistic or more stylized graphics would have robbed it of the uncanny valley feeling it’s going for. The similarly distorted sound and limited, muffled voice acting make it feel like you have cotton in your ears, doubling down on the impression that you’re driving through fog, trying to see what may be happening just out of sight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The same goes for the structure. Leaping back and forth between times both before and after the disaster is disorienting, but I never lost the story’s thread. Dreamlike sequences are similarly spliced in, giving you simple tasks like opening doors or mixing drinks that always carry an undercurrent of menace, making the mundane unsettling. You’re always waiting for evil around the corner, but it often appears in realistic and boring ways that seem totally normal out of context: small interactions, slightly off-color questions, and statements that tickle the part of your brain responsible for recognizing danger. And that’s how real-life evil often presents itself, through a mask of seeming sincerity until you recognize it for what it is, hopefully before it’s too late.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes, the evil is more explicit, especially as Mouthwashing reaches its conclusion and more hands-on mechanics are used to drive home the detestable actions and worldviews of the Tulpar’s crew members. Still avoiding spoilers, one character in particular was so loathsome I had to step back and consider why I was having such a visceral reaction to them – I could only concede that people like this really exist, and in my worst moments, I can almost understand where they’re coming from, even as they are painted in extremes here. It’s a deeply uncomfortable feeling, resonating with characters you hate so much, and seeing the damage someone can cause when they refuse to look at themselves in a meaningful way (or simply through inaction).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And while these characters might be extreme in their behavior, they’re not over-written. Plenty is left to be inferred, and the crew speaks plainly. There are moments when screen flashes, loud noises, or accompanying messages can tend toward the excessive, but they also never feel like jump scares, just ways to accentuate story beats. One in particular came with a realization that both gave me context for the name “Mouthwashing” and set up just how dark this story was about to get.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, when it does venture outside of its compelling conversations and into a couple of slightly more action-focused sections, it isn't always the smoothest transition. Brief forays into survival horror or even first-person shooting, while initially novel, grew a bit frustrating as the imprecise controls require more patience than the rest of the story. These sections seem to be frustrating by design, but they were still frustrating. Thankfully, they’re also short lived, so they didn’t hamper my enjoyment much.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Games That Made Me Feel Bad (Complimentary)</h3><p>These are all games that made me feel intensely negative emotions, and I love them for that.

Whether it be rage, sadness, emptiness, or fear, these all affected me deeply in some way.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And while it might go without saying at this point, if you’re squeamish or easily disturbed (especially when it comes to a loss of bodily autonomy), Mouthwashing will not be easy to play, nor was it intended to be. It’s an uncomfortably close look at deeply flawed people, and it’s not stingy about holding up a magnifying glass – or, in this case, a literal ultrasound – to gaze even deeper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So as I await the birth of my daughter, an occasion that fills me with incredible excitement, that anxious part of my brain is still yelling at me, and Mouthwashing has given words to those worries: “Who are you in your worst moments? Is that person good enough to be trusted with a child?” Few games have hit me as hard at such a specific time in my life, but that’s what good art does – it holds up a mirror. And hopefully you like what’s looking back.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Mouthwashing is grimy, uncomfortable, and incredibly compelling. The genuinely unpleasant actions you’re forced to perform may be deeply unsettling (and at times a little frustrating), but they aren't gratuitous, used to make powerful points in a way games are uniquely suited to. Combine that with a smart lo-fi visual style, eerily muffled sound design, and simple but direct writing and Mouthwashing paints a picture of who we can be in our worst moments – and it doesn’t let us get away with it.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And like every year before, the show ended with the reveal of 2024's Game of the Year. </p><p>Maybe after watching all that (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032">or reading our wonderful summary of the event</a></span>) you wondered: “Hey, who won in 2016?” Well, I’m here to help! I’ve put together a list that looks back at the last 10 years of The Game Awards to see which games have won the top honor over the last decade. </p></div></div><div><p>A decade ago, BioWare’s open-world fantasy RPG <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>was the first game to win Game of the Year at the inaugural Game Awards in 2014. It might have been cool in a poetic kind of way to see 2024's<em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>win again a decade later, but alas, the universe doesn’t work like that.</p></div><div><p>In 2015, CD Projekt Red’s RPG <em>The Witcher 3 </em>was the big winner of the show. The game not only walked away with the top award of the night, but it was also the most nominated game at the awards, being in the running in six categories and winning three of them. And nine years later, CDPR officially unveiled <em>The Witcher 4</em> at the 2024 Game Awards. </p></div><div><p>In 2016, Blizzard’s super-popular multiplayer hero shooter <em>Overwatch</em> made history and became the first non-RPG and the first multiplayer game to win GOTY at The Game Awards. Spoilers, but another mulitplayer-only game wouldn’t win Game of the Year again until 2021. </p></div><div><p>In 2017, another open-world, third-person RPG won the top award of the night. This time the beloved<em> Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>took the top honors at The Game Awards. This was also the first and, as of 2024, the only Nintendo-published game to walk away with the GOTY trophy. It also means that a Wii U game has won Game of the Year. Weird! </p></div><div><p>In 2018, Sony’s big-budget open-world reboot of<em> God of War</em> won Game of the Year at The Game Awards. This will not be the last time a PlayStation-published title ends the night with the biggest award of the event. I remember some controversy over <em>God of War</em> beating out <em>Red Dead Redemption II</em> that year, but hey, both games received 8 nominations, so that’s something. </p></div><div><p>Oh look, another third-person pseudo-open-world action game wins the top prize at The Game Awards. This time it’s the Activision-published FromSoftware samurai action game, <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>. </p><p>Meanwhile, <em>Death Stranding</em> set a record for most nominations in Game Award history, with Hideo Kojima’s walking simulator earning ten. I wonder how long that record will last...</p></div><div><p>Oh, that record didn’t last last long! In 2020, the very next year, Naughty Dog’s <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>received an incredible (and still unbeaten) 11 nominations and won seven of them, including Game of the Year. It was also PlayStation’s second GOTY win at the event. </p></div><div><p>For only the second time in Game Awards history, a multilplayer-only game won the top award in 2021. However, it wasn’t a big online shooter or MMO, but instead EA and Hazelight’s <em>It Takes Two</em>, a split-screen co-op action-puzzle game. And this year, the studio behind <em>It Takes Two</em> announced its next co-op game, <em>Split Fiction</em>, which looks great and is out in early 2025. </p></div><div><p>In 2022, FromSoftware became the first (and so far only) development studio to win Game of the Year at the Game Awards twice. This time the studio won for <em>Elden Ring,</em> a game which took over 2022. </p><p>The big fight in 2022 was between<em> God of War Ragnarök</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em>. And while the <em>God of War </em>sequel tied <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> for most nominations with 11  and picked up six wins, <em>Elden Ring </em>ultimately earned the GOTY honors. </p></div><div><p>Last year, <em>Baldur’s Gate III </em>from Larian Studios was the <em>Elden Ring </em>of the year, taking over my social media feeds for months and quickly becoming many people’s anticipated GOTY winner at the 2023 Game Awards. </p><p>However, 2023 was an incredible year for games and the Game of the Year noms at the Game Awards proved that, with releases such as <em>Alan Wake 2, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, </em>and <em>Spider-Man 2</em> all competing in a stacked line-up. Yet <em>Baldur’s Gate III</em> beat them all, and won five other awards that night, too. </p></div><div><p>And that brings us to 2024. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-tgas-geoff-keighley-reviews-trailers-1851720812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-tgas-geoff-keighley-reviews-trailers-1851720812">The 10th Game Awards was probably the best show</a></span> Geoff Keighley has ever hosted, and the nominees for the top spot were a diverse bunch. There was <em>Balatro</em>, a card game made by one guy, DLC for<em> Elden Ring</em>, and a turn-based RPG, <em>Metaphor Refantazio</em>. </p><p>But the winner of the night was the delightfully fun <em>Astro Bot,</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-rebirth-astro-bot-winners-goty-list-1851720291&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-rebirth-astro-bot-winners-goty-list-1851720291">which also picked up three other awards and received seven noms</a></span>. This was also the third PlayStation-published game to win GOTY at The Game Awards. Will Microsoft’s <em>Avowed </em>be able to win next year in 2025, giving Xbox its first GOTY win? I don’t know, but we’ll find out in December 2025. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sunderfolk/" data-ref-id="5000-646962">Sunderfolk</a>, a four-player co-op turn-based RPG, is looking like the next game to encourage folks to experience the joy of tabletop games. It sees players fight together through a story where every NPC and player choice is narrated by a game master, allowing a group of friends to party up for weekly game nights to play through a campaign together. Sunderfolk doesn't offer the same level of narrative freedom as a game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> (or playing an actual tabletop game with a real person as the game master); instead, it honors binary choices in a curated narrative. Even if that means Sunderfolk's game master is technically always railroading the players (a major faux pas in the tabletop community), I still think this feature sounds incredibly cool, potentially doing enough to still emulate what it's like to play in a story-driven tabletop campaign with your friends.</p><p dir="ltr">In Sunderfolk, each player can pick from six different classes: the spell-slinging Arcanist, support-focused Bard, frontline fighter Berserker, area-of-effect specialist Pyromancer, sharpshooter Ranger, and slippery Rogue. You play as the titular Sunderfolk, anthropomorphic animals who reside in the Sunderlands, which have come under attack by the corrupting influence of shadowstones. You can play Sunderfolk with everyone in person or virtually with some or all players in different locations. While the action happens on one TV or computer screen (meaning someone will have to stream the game if you're playing virtually), each player interacts with their phone (sort of like a Jackbox Party game), allowing you to dictate what your character does next from anywhere.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4415553-ss_68bf152aa51c88325453cccc619cace831494745.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415553" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4415553-ss_68bf152aa51c88325453cccc619cace831494745.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415553"></a><figcaption>Sunderfolk allows you to play through a tabletop campaign with friends.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4415553-ss_68bf152aa51c88325453cccc619cace831494745.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Sunderfolk uses its own system, but it's built on the backbone of existing tabletop games. "The game that had the biggest inspiration on us, gameplay-wise--I think even some of the audience has kind of seen it in the way that the game plays out--is Gloomhaven, which is a board game. Gloomhaven and Frosthaven are kind of our biggest inspirations," game director Erin Marek told me.</p><p dir="ltr">"We at the studio love tabletop RPGs, but we also love board gaming and especially tactics-turn-based board games, and we know they're not super accessible for a lot of folks. There are some challenges that board games can have around long setup times, lots of reading to understand what the rules are, but there's also something really magical about getting together in person and playing in-person that is kind of that synergy, like can we make something that's like this but is more accessible to either folks who aren't familiar or maybe have opted out in the past from that experience for whatever reason and create it as that entry point. So that was our early inspiration. We've diverged from it over time, but I still think you can see it in some of the design."</p><p dir="ltr">One of those diversions is a relationship tracker, which allows each of the players to befriend and/or romance NPCs. "[We've made] some of the NPCs romanceable, and I think that that's a particularly exciting feature if you're somebody who loves dating sims and stuff," Marek said. "We have this cast of NPCs in town that you can engage with, learn about them, and then choose to either go down a more platonic path or choose to go down a more romantic path. And you get some really awesome rewards too if you get all the way to the end of their path."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4415554-ss_3105947887f9a737cf307eb43cb79348c72767f0.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415554" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4415554-ss_3105947887f9a737cf307eb43cb79348c72767f0.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415554"></a><figcaption>Between combat missions, you'll befriend (and possibly romance) NPCs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4415554-ss_3105947887f9a737cf307eb43cb79348c72767f0.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Like Gloomhaven, Sunderfolk is divided into two repeating phases. "You have the mission phase, which is high intensity, everybody's working together, taking turns, trying to beat monsters, etc.," Marek said. "That's where you might see things like cinematics or the game master voiceover. Kind of at the tail ends and beginning of those missions, you'll get the story content that Anjali [Bhimani] helped voice. And then once you're in town, it's a little bit more of a breathing moment. It's the opportunity where it's like, 'Oh, I've got [a chance to] take a break. I'm going to go grab a snack.' And you're not hindered by other people not being there to continue your experience. So in that [phase], you can go on your phone, you can talk to different characters, have your own stories happening. And one of the things that is my favorite feature of the game is--we call it Mad Libs--you can name things. [You name things] in the plot, in the game, and it'll pop up in other places. ...And so it provides this opportunity for each group to leave little surprises and gifts for the other players, create inside jokes or feel like they have some sense of agency over some of the pieces of the world."</p><p dir="ltr">There is some semblance of choice beyond these Mad Libs, but Sunderfolk isn't a huge branching RPG, so the degree of agency that players have is curated by the game master's narration. "There are main story missions, which hit at certain points in the progression that you will always play," Marek said. "But in between those, you're provided with three to four different mission options and you'll get to pick which ones you want to play or don't want to play. So there's a little bit of agency [there]. ...And then once [a mission] is selected, the [game master] helps bridge the gap, [going] 'Okay, so you chose to go there and here's why you're choosing to go there.' So a little bit is reactive, a little bit is more railroad-y. There's a little bit on both of those sides, and I think it's a decent balance. We've also tried really hard on the writing side not to have the game master put actions into the players, not to enforce an action upon a player."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4415555-ss_9f955ab78a4309820e48d5c33d80b71374e4ba1a.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415555" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4415555-ss_9f955ab78a4309820e48d5c33d80b71374e4ba1a.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415555"></a><figcaption>Combat is tactical and encourages players to work together.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4415555-ss_9f955ab78a4309820e48d5c33d80b71374e4ba1a.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To enforce how hands-off the game master is in dictating the player characters' motivations, those characters do not speak. The game essentially leaves it up to the players to roleplay their characters as they see fit. However, every other character is voiced by the same person, and that person is also the sole narrator of the action and the player characters' choices: the game master. Actor Anjali Bhimani (a game master in her own right, and the voice behind roles like Overwatch's Symmetra and Apex Legends' Rampart) is the narrator and game master in Sunderfolk.</p><p dir="ltr">"What appealed to me the most about this job was the actual make of the game," Bhimani told me. "When Chris [Sigaty] from Dreamhaven hit me up, and we sat and talked about it, and he explained to me exactly what they were trying to do with the game, how they were trying to reinvent game night, essentially, for families, for people all over the globe, and bring the simplicity of turning on a video game to the collaborative nature of tabletop, combining those two parts, those really, really wonderful parts of gaming to each other, just made so much sense to me. And I, like them, have had a similarly difficult time getting some of my friends to play a TTRPG, because there's a lot of setup and there's a lot of learning. And convincing friends that you don't have to worry about all the rules, it's an open-book test--even sometimes that doesn't get them over the finish line."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4415556-ss_fa087879b02f7a10d89eb7f4054ddc08b0ce0416.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415556" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4415556-ss_fa087879b02f7a10d89eb7f4054ddc08b0ce0416.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415556"></a><figcaption>You'll often return to the hub area to buy items, talk to NPCs, and pick your next mission.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4415556-ss_fa087879b02f7a10d89eb7f4054ddc08b0ce0416.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We knew we wanted somebody who had experience in the tabletop RPG space," Marek said. "It's so hard to describe, but there's this nuance between when you're narrating something versus when you're talking to your friends at a table. And I feel like anybody who plays a tabletop RPG kind of intuitively knows that difference. They experience it enough to get it. And so when we were looking at our own script, there are these moments where the narrator is a narrator, but there are also moments where they're a game master at the table talking to their party, and that is so hard to parse through without really knowing the space."</p><p dir="ltr">"Before we even started, I asked to sit down with them and see all of the characters that I was going to be voicing this whole time, so that we could plot out [voices], and I could plot out in my head, which voices I was going to use," Bhimani said. "And not even for each one of them, but just in a sense of where in my range certain ones would live, and make sure that I really was being distinct with each one's voice. You don't know if all five of them are going to be in the same scene at any given time, right? We want to make sure that they sound a little bit different. So, we can go through and take a look at all of those and see which ones we're going to be around a lot more, and which ones we're going to be doing scenes with each other more often, and stuff like that."</p><p dir="ltr">If you can't bring a group of people together to play even over a Discord call, you can play Sunderfolk solo. "It's not really our intended experience. I wouldn't say it's the best experience [to play solo], but yeah, absolutely you can," Marek said. "So we know some folks also might struggle to get their groups together or maybe they don't have groups that they want to play with, and so we didn't want to prevent them from being able to experience this game as well. So the only caveat is they have to control at least two heroes. You can't play it as a solo hero. You have to play at least two heroes. And you can always, if you start solo, somebody else can join you, they can leave, you can pick up their character. So there's a lot of flexibility too in just making sure if something happens to you partway through the campaign or to your group partway through the campaign, there are lots of options to continue to play without that hindering."</p><p dir="ltr">Sunderfolk is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo is inching ever closer to its promised deadline to reveal the Switch’s successor <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">before April 2025</a>. But new leaks from case manufacturers appear to reveal exactly what the Nintendo’s next console could look like, and a few notable upgrades it might have over the original Switch.</p><p>We were inspired to write this article in the first place because of Dbrand’s just-announced “Killswitch 2” case. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fgrip%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases">The website for the product</a> features an in-motion render of the case and, inside, a mockup of hardware that has some key differences from the Switch and Switch OLED: the new console appears to be larger, and it has a mysterious new second button on the right Joy-Con under the Home button. Accessory leaks over the past several days have shown a similar <a href="https://www.theshortcut.com/p/new-nintendo-switch-2-leak-all-but-confirms-how-the-console-will-look">potential</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">design</a> for the hardware.</p><p>It seems Dbrand is reasonably confident in its case, but we asked CEO Adam Ijaz&nbsp;to be sure. He says Dbrand has “actual dimensions” — not an educated guess — based on a “3D scan of the real hardware.” (When we asked how he knows that, Ijaz only said “Nice try, Nintendo<em>.</em>”)</p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s a GIF we cut of the new case from Dbrand’s video.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Video: Dbrand</cite></p></div><p>Based on Dbrand’s measurements, the next Switch (which we’ll call the Switch 2) will both be larger and taller than Nintendo’s Switch OLED, but roughly the same thickness. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fmy%2Fhardware%2Fswitch%2Fmodal%2Fspecs%2Fbody_oled.html">Nintendo’s spec sheet</a> shows its previous handheld is 242mm wide, 102mm tall and 13.9mm thick, where Ijaz says the Switch 2 should measure 270mm wide, 116mm tall, and 14mm thick, with the console portion taking up 200mm worth of that width. </p><p>Ijaz also says the kickstand will still measure around half the console’s height at around 55mm; a diagonal measurement of the cover glass supports previous rumors that it’ll have an 8-inch screen. </p><p>Ijaz says it’s his “understanding” that Joy-Cons are “magnetically attached” with an “an ejection button” that’s on the back of the Joy-Cons near the top, and his new case takes advantage of the detachable controllers — he says the controller portions of Dbrand’s case can detach with them inside.</p><p>He doesn’t know what the second square button is under the Home button, which he says has a “C” printed on it. The left Joy-Con in Dbrand’s mockup still has a button on the left Joy-Con, which is where you’ll find the capture button on the original Switch, so it’s unclear if this “C” button now means capture or if both buttons work differently. (Nintendo originally introduced C-buttons on the Nintendo 64 controller in 1996 as a way to control a game’s camera, before gamepads introduced a second stick to let you shift perspective.) </p><p>Ijaz says the joysticks stand 6.27mm tall, and the D-pad and ABXY buttons protrude by 1.57mm, with a 180mm wide kickstand, and back triggers that extend 9.1mm.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</p><div><figcaption><em>Since the controller parts of the Killswitch 2 are detachable, this version uses a teal bungee cord, rather than a form-fitting design, to secure its protective travel cover.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Dbrand</cite></p></div></div><p>While Dbrand does seem to know a lot about the console, Ijaz is “genuinely unsure” about its potential release date. He says that Dbrand is working toward a late March or early April release for its case, though. Ijaz also doesn’t know about Nintendo’s possible TV dock for the Switch 2, but says that Dbrand’s assumption is that “the form factor will be similar to the previous gen.” He doesn’t know if the screen will be LCD or OLED.</p><p>While it’s highly unusual for an accessory maker to publicly reveal this much about a product from a powerful, litigious company like Nintendo, it’s not surprising that Dbrand’s the one stepping up to the plate. Having beef with console makers is an intentional (and often fun!) part of its marketing strategy, and Nintendo is a frequent target — like that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23713293/dbrand-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-skin">Zelda skin that was a middle finger to Nintendo’s lawyers</a>, or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21231434/animal-crossing-switch-skin-nintendo-dbrand-copyright-price-design">“(not) Animal Crossing”</a> one. </p><p>Much of what Dbrand is showing and what Ijaz is saying lines up with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nacn4yqUY1s">a video from SwitchUp</a> showing what it calls a Switch 2 mockup sent to them by a case manufacturer. That mockup is clearly larger than today’s existing Switch OLED, and the new Joy-Cons are clearly bigger than the old Joy-Cons. You can also see the second square button under the home button there, the larger button under the triggers that presumably ejects them from the console, and a wide kickstand similar to the one on the Switch OLED.</p><p>One other nice addition? A second USB-C port on the top of the mockup, which theoretically means you’ll be able to plug in a charging cable while you’re using it in tabletop mode; with the current Switch, the charging port on the bottom is blocked when you’re standing it up on a table.</p><p>While we’re still waiting for Nintendo to actually announce concrete details about the Switch 2, the company has shared that the console will be able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">play current Switch games</a> and it will have Nintendo Switch Online as well.</p><p><em><strong>Correction, December 13th: </strong>Ijaz says he measured the Switch 2 triggers wrong; they extend 9.1mm, not 14.1mm. </em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
