		<p>An internal memo from Sony has revealed they are to shut down Bluepoint Games, the developer responsible for the remasters of Shadow of the Colossus. Uncharted, and Gravity Rush on PS4, and the Demon Souls remake for PS5.</p>
<p>Bluepoint had been working on a live service game, but this was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-confirms-cancellation-of-live-service-projects-from-bend-studio-and-bluepoint-games">cancelled</a> in January 2025. Sony bought Bluepoint in 2021, and they have never released a game as a PlayStation studio, although they did work on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok/">God of War Ragnarok</a>.</p>


<p>Here is the email in full:</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I wanted to share an important update from the Studio Business.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the December Town Hall, 2025 had some strong highlights within&nbsp;PlayStation&nbsp;Studios.&nbsp;<em><a title="Games > Ghost of Yotei [13 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghos</a>t<a title="Games > Ghost of Yotei [13 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ghost-of-yotei"> of Yotei</a></em>&nbsp;launched to critical and commercial success,&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>&nbsp;further showcased our commitment to narrative excellence, and&nbsp;<em><a title="Games > Helldivers II [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers II</a></em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>MLB The Show</em>&nbsp;continue to drive on-going player engagement and revenue.</p>
<p>At the same time, we’re operating in an increasingly challenging industry environment. Rising development costs, slowed industry growth, changing player behavior, and broader economic headwinds are making it harder to build games sustainably.</p>
<p>To navigate this reality, we need to continue adapting and evolving. We’ve taken a close look at our business to ensure we’re delivering today while still well-positioned for the future. As a result, we will be closing Bluepoint Games in March.</p>
<p>This decision was not made lightly. Bluepoint is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community. I want to thank everyone at Bluepoint for their creativity, craftsmanship, and commitment to quality. Where possible, we will work to find opportunities for some impacted employees within our global network of studios.</p>
<p>While I know this is hard news to hear, I’m confident in the direction we’re headed. Creativity, innovation, and building unforgettable experiences for players remain at the heart of PlayStation Studios. We have a robust roadmap for fiscal year 26, with much to look forward to in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Thank you for your hard work and continued support.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Hermen Hulst<br>
CEO, Studio Business Group</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="7f75bf19ff7c9"><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7f75bf19ff7c9/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sometimes, I don't realise how much I'm missing out of something until it's right in front of me.</p>
<p>That's not to say I never wanted or expected a 60fps upgrade for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> — it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/a-hidden-60fps-mode-in-xenoblade-chronicles-x-gives-us-hope-for-a-switch-2-upgrade">apparently right there in the code</a>, after all — but I've already put the time in. 120 hours of wondrous exploration, sci-fi storytelling, and mech flying, all wrapped up and put to one side. It's easy to forgive Xenoblade Chronicles X being <em>just</em> 30fps and 720p (handheld, which is how I played almost the entire game) on Switch 1 when it's so huge in scope and so easy to get lost in its lush environments and dangerous wilds.</p><div><figure data-videoid="h10LJgMQyAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yth10LJgMQyAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed562d82yrwnhi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>But then I sat down with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> and the difference was staggering. No more blips when it's raining, no more stuttering when the camera pans as Elma shows your character the world of Mira for the first time. This is the Mira we deserve to see and explore.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this is the smallest paid Switch 2 Edition yet from Nintendo, providing <em>only</em> a resolution bump (1080p handheld, 4K docked) and performance boost (a steady 60fps both handheld and docked). But it's hard not to be impressed when you see Monolith Soft's vision be fully realised on-screen. It's amazing we've never had a <strong>Xenoblade</strong> game at 60fps before this, and it's a real showcase of just how much more beautiful and smooth these worlds can look.</p>

<p>Mira is already incredible, quite possibly the best video game environment to explore ever, so I did what any self-respecting Xenoblade fan would do when first booting up the Switch 2 Edition — get myself murdered, and my Skells destroyed, by some oversized creature in Noctilum. Death and explosions in 60fps are much better than at 30fps, let me tell you.</p>
<p>Besides engaging with things way beyond my skill set, I spent most of my time zipping in and out of combat, scrambling around the flatlands of Oblivia, and diving off of cliffs in Primordia into the ocean. The Switch version already gave me a whole new appreciation for Mira, but seeing these glorious, alien creatures wander around the Rising Energy Mist phenomenon of Sylvalum, or gigantic dinosaur-esque monsters stomping around amidst the Oblivia thunderstorms.</p>
<p>I also spent way too much time flying around each of the maps in my Skell this time around, impressed with just how stable things were as I glided between biomes and swarmed through groups of flying enemies. It didn't matter whether I was in combat, swamped by six or seven enemies in mid-air, falling from great heights, or in cutscenes, I didn't notice a single dip.</p>

<p>I was actually surprised at how snappy the combat felt now, too. In some classes, especially on foot, I always felt there was a slight input delay when trying to combo skills together. That <em>feels</em> like it's been lessened a bit, because I can connect Side Slash and Stream Edge almost-instantaneously. I don't feel like I'm waiting an extra half a second for the animations to play out anymore.</p>
<p>The near-perfect frame rate boost does most of the heavy lifting in both handheld and docked, here, but the performance boost is nothing to sneeze at, either, especially handheld. The jump from 720p (on Switch 1) to 1080p (on Switch 2) is a real boon, with landscapes less blurry and draw-distances a little clearer. There are still plenty of fuzzy textures and noticeably flat, dull surfaces on some cliffs and creatures, but it's a significantly better experience now.</p>
<figure data-uuid="c6d820f982758"><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c6d820f982758/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of docked, the 4K bump actually felt a lot less significant to my untrained eye. The boost is most-noticeable around characters' faces and eyes, and the lighting appears to be improved — the difference in the character creator between backdrops was more apparent this time around, for example — but again, some of those flat tree leaves and blades of grass are a little hard to ignore.</p>
<p>These are nitpicks, however, when Xenoblade Chronicles X is <em>such</em> a huge game. Are you really going to be quibbling over a single blade of grass when you can fly sky-high and glide across the starry sky, moon shining in the background? Or when you can see the flames of Cauldros in the distance as you stand high in the trees of Noctilum?</p>
<p>I think there's a separate conversation to be had over what a Switch 2 Edition is, especially when plenty of other games are getting free performance boosts on the console. Many were having the same conversations about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>' upgrade last month, but at least that added Mouse Mode and additional multiplayer capabilities on top of a resolution bump.</p>
<figure data-uuid="63c00bf925bf6"><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/63c00bf925bf6/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But I do know a lot of people who were holding off on Xenoblade Chronicles X until it got a boost on Switch 2, so if that applies to you, this release is a no brainer in my eyes. If you stopped playing on Switch 1, too, now is the time to dive in. Just don't come for the story — stay instead for the incredible landscapes and sense of discovery, now looking the best it ever will.</p>
<p>And, at the very least, this Nintendo Switch 2 Edition gets me excited about the potential of future upgrades for the rest of the Xenoblade series. I'm itching to replay <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a>, and a performance and resolution boost would be more than enough to get me to return to Alrest.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-suspend-arc-raiders-players-severe-cases-coins-duplication-exploit/">Embark Studios</a></strong> has just revealed the next update and <strong>map condition</strong> coming to <strong>ARC Raiders</strong>, with <strong>hurricanes</strong> arriving next week on <strong>February 24, 2026,</strong> in the game's new <strong>Shrouded Sky </strong>update.</p>



<p>The short teaser doesn't show any gameplay, but it does make it clear how disruptive and dangerous the hurricanes will be for raiders who choose to brave the weather while the condition is in effect. A <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition">blog post</a> on the ARC Raiders' official website digs further into what raiders will have to deal with, and it's a little more than some high-speed winds.</p>



<p>"<em>The climate is damaged and unpredictable, causing violent weather events across the surface,</em>" the post reads. "<em>You've already experienced some of them, but southern Italy is about to kick up another challenge to Raiders who dare to brave the surface</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Shrouded Sky - Teaser | ARC Raiders" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9lGpwVvdyJQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Trying to run against the winds, as you might imagine, will slow you down and quickly drain your stamina. You'll also have to be aware of the wind when trying to toss grenades or other throwables, since they can be swept away into the wind if you don't properly plan your throw. You also won't be able to rely on gas grenades and smoke grenades in the same way, as a turn of the wind will impact them as well.</p>



<p>You'll also have to be aware of flying debris, whether that's flying bits of dirt or something much larger that could do some huge damage if you're not careful. Whatever it is, though, your shield will take damage from flying debris and make you more visible to other raiders. That said, if you choose to risk going Topside without a shield, that'll provide another layer of camouflage, since you won't be spotted by the constant flash of your shield. </p>



<p>Speaking of visibility, that's also going to be far more limited during the hurricanes, meaning you'll have to be even more vigilant to make sure you're not caught off guard by other raiders or ARC. With all of this downside and struggles involved in heading Topside while hurricanes are raging the surface, you're probably wondering why it's worth the risk.</p>



<p>That upside comes in the form of valuable Raider caches that aren't just your average caches, but caches from the <strong>First Wave</strong>, which ARC Raiders lore-heads will recognize as caches from a bygone era, surely to be filled with valuable loot. We'll see what that loot looks like when the new map condition arrives this coming <strong>Tuesday, February 24, 2026.</strong></p>

			<p>We've been surprised by video game studio closures before, like when <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/"><strong>Xbox </strong>shut down <strong>Arkane Austin</strong> and <strong>Tango Gameworks</strong>,</a> but this latest studio closure is arguably the most shocking one we've seen in a long time. <strong>Bluepoint Games</strong>, the studio responsible for the <strong>Demon's Souls Remake</strong> and decades of remakes and remasters across several iconic franchises, is being <strong>shut down by</strong> <strong>PlayStation</strong>.</p>



<p>It was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTUyNzAyNiwiZXhwIjoxNzcyMTMxODI2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQVBZWlBLR0lGUFkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.utABYnI4m_K6kqNqybZarBQ9T5WW_aWCH6NI3kt8Q64">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> who broke the news that just <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-studios-acquire-bluepoint-games/">five years after</a></strong> the studio officially joined the <strong>PlayStation Studios</strong> family, its remaining <strong>70 developers</strong> are losing their jobs in what is yet another baffling decision by PlayStation leadership.</p>



<p>"<em>Bluepoint Games is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community,</em>" a PlayStation spokesperson said in a statement, per Bloomberg's report. "<em>We thank them for their passion, creativity and craftsmanship</em>."</p>







<p>After the Demon's Souls Remake was one of the day-one launch titles for the release of the <strong>PS5</strong>, and the studio was officially brought under the PlayStation Studios banner, there was never an official confirmation as to what the studio was working on next. We knew it had done some co-development work on <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>, and beyond that, there were plenty of rumours and hopes. Bluepoint was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-playstation-5-remaster-sequel/">popular choice for players to do a <strong>Bloodborne Remaster</strong></a> if that project were to ever actually happen.</p>



<p>The most reliable answer we have as to what the studio has been working on also came from a previous Bloomberg report, which was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/"><strong>God of War live-service</strong> game that was cancelled at the start of 2025</a>. According to today's report from Bloomberg, following that project's cancellation, Bluepoint did its best to pitch future projects to <strong>Herman Hulst</strong> and the rest of PlayStation's top brass, none of which were accepted, it would seem.</p>



<p>As if this couldn't be any more tragic than it already was, the studio was celebrating its <strong>20th anniversary</strong> this year, after being founded all the way back in <strong>2006</strong>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has uncovered what’s coming next with Shrouded Sky, the update hitting ARC Raiders next week. Alongside a teaser trailer that revealed the new map condition as ‘Hurricane’, we received a graphic that contained a <strong>stark revelation</strong> that has fans excited.</p>



<p>After months of asking for them, it looks like Embark Studios is finally adding beards to the customization menu in ARC Raiders. The post-apocalyptic Speranza residents who have all gone rather baby-faced up until now might finally be able to wear a little face fur after Shrouded Sky drops.</p>







<h2 id="h-beards-are-coming-to-arc-raiders">Beards Are Coming to ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>If you’ve been holding out hope that Embark Studios would add beards to ARC Raiders, it looks like you’re finally in luck. In the new teaser trailer for Shrouded Sky, we’re treated to a graphic that shows a raider very clearly sporting a relatively large beard.</p>



<p>That’s important for one major reason, and it’s that up until now, every shot of in-game characters has had them wearing clothing sets that can be equipped <strong>in-game</strong>. It also has them exclusively showing off hairstyles, tattoos, and face decorations that you can buy or unlock in ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>This is the first time we’ve seen a raider with a full beard.</p>



<p>Therefore, we’re led to believe, very patently, that beards are coming to ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>It could be in anticipation of the new Shrouded Sky update, which drops on February 24th. It brings <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-hurricane-new-map-condition/">the ‘Hurricane’ map condition</a>, which will batter players with vicious winds, flying debris, and harsh rain. Perhaps wearing a beard is some extra layer of protection against the detritus flying around, slamming you in the face.</p>



<p>That’s probably not the reason.</p>



<p>Beards were always on the cards, in reality. This is a slow-feed, live-service title with plenty of meat, and Embark Studios plans to support it for years to come. We were always going to get beards; it’s just a matter of when.</p>



<p>Now, all that matters is for us to find out how deep the facial hair runs. Will we get moustaches and goatees, too? It’s anyone’s guess.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re excited about facial hair coming to ARC Raiders.</p>

<p>"Bluepoint Games is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community," a PlayStation spokesperson said in a statement received by <em>Bloomberg</em>. “We thank them for their passion, creativity and craftmanship."</p><p><em>Bloomberg </em>writes that the spokesperson also said the closure was due to "a recent business review." The most recent news out of the studio was that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects">it was working on a live-service game in the God of War universe</a>, but that it was canceled before ever being revealed publicly.</p><p>The news is shocking, largely due to Bluepoint's high-quality track record.

              <p>Bluepoint Games, the PlayStation first-party team involved in the remakes of console exclusives like <a href="https://kotaku.com/demons-souls-on-ps5-has-still-got-it-1845648877"><em>Demon’s Souls</em></a> and<a href="https://kotaku.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-the-kotaku-review-1822531522"><em> Shadow of the</em> <em>Colossus</em>,</a> is closing in March, a source tells <em>Kotaku</em>.</p> <p>As first reported by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mfaauf5pek2b"><em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Jason Schreier</a>, the move comes five years after Bluepoint Games released its last project, a launch exclusive for the PlayStation 5. It was also a support studio on 2022’s <i>God of War Ragnarök</i>.</p> <p>“Following a recent business review, the decision was made to close Bluepoint Games in March,” a spokesperson for Sony wrote in an emailed statement. “Bluepoint Games is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community. We thank them for their passion, creativity, and craftmanship.”</p> <p>The Texas-based studio was acquired by Sony only a few years ago in 2021 and was most recently working on a live-service project. That game, which was reportedly <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-multiplayer-bluepoint-days-gone-2-concord-1851742012">a multiplayer <em>God of War</em> spin-off</a>, was canceled early in 2025.</p> <p>Fans had been hoping for years that Sony would use Bluepoint Games to revive other PlayStation classics, including the PS4 exclusive <em>Bloodborne</em>. Throwing it onto a live service project was baffling to many, but of a piece with the PS5 maker’s disastrous campaign to create online multiplayer hits internally.</p>

 <p>Bluepoint Games was founded back in 2006 and its first game was a PSN downloadable shooter about fighting biological infections called <em>Blast Factor</em>. While that game never made the studio a household name, it quickly became a key player in helping Sony ship remasters of its back catalog. Bluepoint was responsible for the original <i>The Ico &amp; Shadow of the Colossus Collection</i> on PS3 and getting <em>Gravity Rush</em> off of PS Vita and onto PS4.</p> <p>By last count, the studio employed roughly 70 people. It’s unclear if they are all getting laid off or if some of those developers will be shifted to other parts of PlayStation Studios.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Embar</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161">k Studios</a> has confirmed what’s making ‘Shrouded Sky’ so <strong>shrouded </strong>when the next major ARC Raiders update comes around in just a few days. The next update hits <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> on February 24th, introducing a new small-scale ARC enemy, a map overhaul, some new quests, an Expedition Project, and a <strong>new map condition</strong>.</p>



<p>Fans have been racking their brains trying to think of what the new map condition could be, but Embark Studios has finally confirmed it. The world outside Speranza is about to be rocked by a hurricane.</p>







<h2 id="h-hurricanes-are-coming-to-arc-raiders">Hurricanes Are Coming to ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new blog post</a>, Embark Studios has confirmed what’s coming on February 24th with Shrouded Sky, focusing on the new map condition. Based on the data available, we always thought it would be a ‘Toxic Swamp’ map condition, but that might be lined up for a later update.</p>



<p>For now, we’re getting <strong>Hurricane</strong>.</p>



<p>This will change the game’s weather and physics, introducing powerful winds that heavily impact players as they explore the maps:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The wind will change how you navigate topside. When you have a tailwind, you’ll feel fast and nimble, but fighting against the gales will inhibit your speed and quickly drain your stamina. Throwables will also behave differently in these conditions, and it may take a while to master the trajectory of thrown items like grenades. Other aspects of gameplay like smoke, gas, and even jumping will be affected by the power of the Hurricane.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Debris will fly around at breakneck speed, striking the player and causing their shields to glitch. Embark has advised that you might prefer to remove your shield entirely, as the bits and pieces flying around will make your shield degrade and spark, making you <strong>very </strong>visible.</p>



<p>Further, visibility will take a huge hit in Shrouded Sky under the Hurricane map condition. Players will find themselves enveloped by thick mists that make spotting ARC and other Raiders almost impossible. That, combined with the ‘howling winds’, means that navigating the maps will be much tougher than usual.</p>



<p>The gem of the Hurricane map condition is a new stack of First Waves Caches, buried boxes containing rare relics that have been unearthed by the violent winds and harrowing rain.</p>

<p>A new report reveals that PlayStation has decided to shut down Bluepoint Games. </p>



<p>Bluepoint Games has been instrumental in enhancing past titles for the current-gen consoles, including Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection and Shadow of the Colossus.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I have a nice little NAS that I got before the pandemic. NAS stands for “Network Attached Storage;” it’s basically a baby server you shove hard drives into and connect to your router. A NAS is a wonderful thing to have, as it makes the process of storing your files and having them accessible much easier without involving a cloud storage company. You can run a streaming service like <a href="https://jellyfin.org/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Jellyfin</a> or Plex for all your friends, or a music streaming service like <a href="https://www.navidrome.org/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Navidrome.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve been meaning to replace my NAS for a while; she’s a loyal soldier but is at capacity and struggles on 4k videos. I was planning on doing this as an Aftermath piece, but then I looked at the prices of spinning disk drives, which are now twice what I paid for them–just like SSDs, and just like RAM, just like GPUs before them. Despite the world I live in, I love the computer, and I am tired of these useless AI dipshits making the computers expensive.</p><p>It has been a historically bad time to buy any computer that is not a Mac mini since about mid September. Sure, the pandemic was bad, but there was a rational enough reason for shortages (untold sickness on a global scale). Price hikes in RAM are entirely thanks to the Y Combinator-brained jackasses <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/memory/ram-and-storage-is-ridiculously-expensive-right-now-because-of-drumroll-ai-of-course-and-theres-little-reason-to-think-prices-will-drop-any-time-soon/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>pushing AI into everything</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Quick question: is that good? Credit: </span><a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/trends/price/memory/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>PC Part Picker</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>There is a historic <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/12/18/data-center-growth-map-states?ref=aftermath.site"><u>data center buildup</u></a> going on to fuel this bubble, and what used to be reliable, cheap and boring parts have <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/memory/ram-and-storage-is-ridiculously-expensive-right-now-because-of-drumroll-ai-of-course-and-theres-little-reason-to-think-prices-will-drop-any-time-soon/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>shot through the roof price wise</u></a>. If you bought a stick of RAM in September and flipped it you could make more than most stocks.&nbsp;</p><p>The other component of this is that there are functionally three companies that produce this stuff at scale and which dominate the market–SK Hynix, Micron, and Samsung–and they kind of don’t give a shit if they sell to Sam Altman or you. But before you get mad, they want you to know that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/memory/micron-says-its-not-to-blame-for-its-high-memory-prices-theres-just-not-enough-supply-to-go-around/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>it isn’t their fault</u></a> and that this was <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/memory/samsung-estimates-record-breaking-usd13-billion-profits-and-says-memory-apocalypse-tainted-prices-are-inevitable/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>inevitable</u></a> as their stock shot straight up. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837594/crucial-ram-ssd-micron-ai?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Micron shuttered Crucial</u></a>, their consumer-facing RAM brand, in December to focus on AI. Factories are being built, but <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/memory/the-three-big-players-in-computer-memory-are-all-building-new-factories-but-it-probably-wont-help-dram-prices-until-2028-if-then/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>scaling up takes years</u></a>, although there’s some hope that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzfhhAfxK-A&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Chinese manufacturers could scale up</u></a>. What’s worse, this has also come for flash memory as well, and as a guy who had to go to Microcenter and pay twice as much as he would have in August for an M.2 SSD, it’s rough out there. Guess what else uses RAM? Graphics cards! And while prices <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zVc4Ke6yDo&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>did briefly crash</u></a>, they are now shooting back up just in time for, to quote Steve Burke of Gamer’s Nexus, an “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueEc_YBXmeY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>inevitable opportunity to screw consumers</u></a>”.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ueEc_YBXmeY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Presenting: Inevitable Opportunity to Screw Consumers | GPU Pricing Update"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>Thanks Steve.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Simplifying the impact of this to video games is a bit like explaining geopolitics to Americans in terms of burgers, but unfortunately it is dire for gaming hardware. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/879845/valve-steam-deck-oled-out-of-stock-memory-storage-ram-crisis?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Steam Decks</u></a> are currently out of stock, with Valve citing the AI crunch. As we previously reported, <a href="https://aftermath.site/steam-machine-frame-delayed-ai-data/"><u>the Steam Machine has been delayed because stupid little babies can’t stop using AI to write their emails</u></a>. The Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/879668/sony-playstation-nintendo-switch-2-console-memory-shortage?ref=aftermath.site"><u>might go up in price,</u></a> and Sony’s plans for the next iteration of the PlayStation might get <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis?ref=aftermath.site"><u>pushed back</u></a>, but don’t worry because the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increases-monetizing-install-base/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>PS5 could also get expensive</u></a>. The Raspberry Pi, the teensy little computer nerds put in their house to do dork tasks like block ads, has gone up in price <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/836221/raspberry-pi-price-increases-ram-costs?ref=aftermath.site"><u>not once</u></a> but now <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/872393/raspberry-pi-price-increase-ram-shortage-costs?ref=aftermath.site"><u>twice.</u></a>&nbsp; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/850376/framework-ram-memory-ddr5-price-hikes?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Framework</u></a> has announced multiple hikes on its laptops. Apple claims it’s trying to avoid raising prices “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869272/apple-iphone-18-price-increase-kuo-report?ref=aftermath.site"><u>as much as possible</u></a>”, whatever that means, but it’s gotten to the point where the <a href="https://aftermath.site/m4-mac-mini-upgrade-memory-storage-nand-flash/"><u>obscene premium Apple charges for upgrades</u></a> is starting to look reasonable, which says as much about the situation as it does Apple. And the CEO of Phison is out here speculating that many consumer electronics businesses will <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/memory/many-consumer-electronics-manufacturers-will-go-bankrupt-or-exit-product-lines-by-the-end-of-2026-due-to-the-ai-memory-crisis-phison-ceo-reportedly-says/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>straight up go out of business due to this</u></a>. Even outside of what we consider consumer electronics, RAM is in so many things that aren’t just phones and laptops that this could get very nasty quite quickly.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jtp.bsky.social/post/3mdki23tso22v?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Jenny Tightpants </span></a></figcaption></figure><p>And for what? For a speculative bubble that is so clearly unsustainable that you would have to have psychosis to believe it could ever pay out? So that the<a href="https://youtu.be/9A-eeJP0J7c?si=koS0YKiJEYZdGm6T&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u> notoriously corrupt memory industry</u></a> can get in on this boom before everything craters? Proponents of AI only want to talk about the utility of these things because Claude got slightly better at making the code that they are paid to write. But none of these people want to talk about the externalities attached to making mildly better agentic AI that still fucks up an unacceptable amount, and when they do they sound either profoundly gullible, disingenuous, uninterested or like they’re logged into their Vanguard profile while they’re talking to you.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ramiismail.com/post/3mez224lpkc2x?ref=aftermath.site"><u><span>Rami Ismail (رامي)</span></u></a></figcaption></figure><p>I would be blissfully happy if I never had to talk about AI ever again. Unfortunately I am compelled to think about this because it’s fucking up computers, and I deeply love computers. I grew up making computers. I went to summer camp for computers (like twice, I’m not kidding). I love writing about computers and telling people why I find them special with all my heart. I enjoy jailbreaking closed hardware that would otherwise become e-waste, like robot vacuums and Amazon devices, and giving them a second life as something ethical. I love solder and burning rosin, and getting a fresh stack of PCBs sent to me from a factory. I love to create a machine from parts, and my heart overflows with joy when that machine does exactly what I want it to do, despite every multinational company stuffing it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/821948/microsoft-windows-11-ai-agents-taskbar-integration?ref=aftermath.site"><u>with shit I never asked for</u></a>.</p><p>The rabid adherents of AI – not those who feel compelled to use it for work, but the ones who won’t shut the fuck up about it – are too blinkered, greedy, or ignorant to see the writing on the wall. They do not love computers; maybe they never did. They love money and having a mistake-prone LLM do their work for them. They love <a href="https://fortune.com/article/why-does-jensen-huang-nvidia-wear-black-leather-jackets-revenge-of-the-nerds/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>increasingly ugly leather jackets</u></a>. They fear falling behind their peers, and would do anything to keep up no matter the impact on the world. They love the insular fascist tech culture that radiates like a cancer from the Bay Area, a once vibrant and interesting place made foul by their presence. They love offloading their tasks to something mimicking a human voice, and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2026/02/16/what-is-claude-anthropic-doesnt-know-either?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">scaring themselves into thinking it has personhood</a> despite <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/827820/large-language-models-ai-intelligence-neuroscience-problems?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the entire premise being flawed from the jump.</u></a> They love deskilling themselves in real time and fooling themselves into thinking they’re Albert Einstein 2.&nbsp;</p><p>And that would be bad enough if they kept it in a nasty little Discord server, but like libertarianism, crypto, and NFTs before it, they just refuse to shut the fuck up about it. It’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/anthropic-claude-ai-leftist-technology/" rel="noreferrer">an endless torrent of tortured blogs</a> delivered in an inhuman chorus of the same mockery of a voice. Who are they trying to convince, me or themselves? Why do they need <a href="https://aftermath.site/humane-ai-marques-brownlee/"><u>my validation</u></a>? To quote the great ethicist Carl Brutananadilewski, “Go away, go away. So tired of this. Friggen go away you freak.” and “What do you need? What do you want? Can I not just live here without occasionally having to deal with you animals?”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gR3bx0HlTMU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="So Tired Of This"></iframe></figure><p>I just want to build my computers in peace. <a href="https://aftermath.site/xteink-x4-cheap-hackable-ereader-crosspoint-review/"><u>Simpler</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/digita-audio-player-snowsky-echo-mini-fiio-hyby/"><u>tech</u></a> is <a href="https://www.hilli.tech/nerds-are-fighting-to-bring-back-gadgets-even-as-iphone-wants-them-dead/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">nice</a>, but it’s not a total solution to this. I want to build a new NAS, to tend to it, to manage its Docker Compose file like a garden. I want to make more <a href="https://aftermath.site/opnsense-proxmox-diy-router-topton-cwwk-ap-mikrotik/"><u>Proxmox nodes</u></a> and have them do my little tasks in unison. I want to pull my hair out for hours trying to get a machine to do something like I’m training an unruly dog, only to find a simple solution that a living, breathing person wrote. I want more decommissioned 22TB Exos X22 hard drives that I can shove into a box I’ve frankensteined together, <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-person-saving-the-media-you-love-is-you-vhs-decode-domesday-duplicator-ld-decode-laserdisc/"><u>so I can save the media that I love</u></a>.

			<p><strong>Eternal Darkness</strong> and <strong>Legacy of Kain</strong> creator <strong>Denis Dyack</strong> shared a lot of interesting thoughts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYlGJiZeT5Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a two-hour-long interview with KiwiTalkz</a>, in which he addressed <strong>the lack of optimization of many Unreal Engine 5 games</strong>. You might remember that his upcoming game, <strong>Deadhaus Sonata</strong>, was powered by the <strong>Amazon Lumberyard</strong> engine <a href="https://wccftech.com/deadhaus-sonata-qa-denis-dyacks-quest-to-bring-narrative-to-the-online-space-through-genvids-interactive-streaming-and-the-power-of-the-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when we last talked to him a few years ago</a>. Well, Dyack's studio went through several engine changes before eventually landing on Epic's technology after <strong>patching things up with the company following their previous dispute over Too Human</strong>.</p>



<p>Now a user of the leading game-making tool, Dyack <strong>pointed the finger at the current state of the industry</strong>, largely absolving the engine itself and adding that <strong>most game companies do not really even have time to optimize games anymore</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Most people who use Unreal Engine 5 have very large teams and those very large teams have a lot of people who know one specific part of what they do. <strong>There is an artist that all they do are blades of grass. They optimize for the blades of grass, but they have no idea what's happening in the other systems.</strong> And when you have two, 300, maybe a thousand people working on these systems, they're all going in their own directions and they're all doing whatever they can to make the game the best. And to have technological oversight of all of these things is very difficult. </em></p>



<p><em>A lot of these teams have some very experienced people, but a lot of them are not that experienced. They're coming in with two to five years. And I've been in the industry now for 35 years, built my own engines. <strong>At the end of the day, optimization is really hard</strong>. When you have an all-around engine like Unreal Engine 5, it's going to be good at everything. But if you're going to make a racing game versus an open world RPG versus a 2D game, <strong>the optimizations are extremely different, and you have to know your game to get in there and optimize it</strong>.</em></p>



<p><em>The sad reality of the video game industry right now is <strong>it's in such poor shape that most companies don't even have time to optimize</strong>. The game's working, they ship it, it gets out there, and they haven't spent any time optimizing it, and it runs like hell. It's not the engine's fault. It's actually the state of the industry. Since we talked last, t<strong>here have been a few Black Swan events and also what I would call an extinction-level event as well</strong>. The ramifications of the extinction-level event are still happening. A lot of my colleagues are gone and a lot of the money that used to be in the industry is gone. We're going to continue to see over the next 2 to 3 years, maybe 4, a lot of the relics of the mistakes that were made before continue to happen until a lot of that gets fixed up. </em></p>



<p><em>But what it means is if you're going to optimize a game, you're not putting in any content, and all you're doing is trying to make it run faster and be better. <strong>There are a lot of people who think that's not worth it. Just put more content in, get people excited about all the new stuff in the game, and, you know, forget optimization</strong>. So, my opinion is it's definitely not the engine's fault. It's more of the state of the industry.</em></p>



<p>Later in the interview, Dyack clarified what he meant by "extinction-level event". He was referring to the infamous "<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-stock-crashes-following-cancellation-of-transformative-2-billion-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transformative $2 billion deal</a></strong>" that the <strong>Embracer Group</strong> was negotiating with the <strong>Savvy Group</strong> before <strong>it fell through at the last minute</strong> in May 2023. Embracer Group's stock crashed, but that was just the beginning. Over the following months and years, Embracer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-sells-cryptic-studios-arc-games-retains-right-to-remnant-fellowship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was forced to sell off</a> most of its many studios</strong>, recouping what capital it could while keeping only a small number in its portfolio. </p>



<p>This, in turn, meant that when Embracer started liquidating its studios and shelving its projects, <strong>all those prototypes, built with tens of millions of dollars of Embracer's substantial capital, suddenly flooded the market as publishers scrambled to pick up new titles</strong>. These were demos built with budgets that independent developers could never match. They looked exceptional precisely because enormous amounts of money had already been poured into them.</p>



<p>Every publisher and platform holder looked at this sudden influx of polished, well-funded prototypes and naturally gravitated toward them. <strong>The pipeline of publishing slots filled up fast</strong>, while<strong> independent developers who had been going through the normal process of pitching their own, often far more modestly produced prototypes, got pushed further and further back in the queue</strong>. In many cases, these small studios <strong>simply ran out of money before they ever reached the front</strong>. </p>



<p>According to Dyack, <strong>50 to 70% of independent and mid-sized developers are now gone entirely</strong>, and in most instances, they were studios that had been running for several years, if not decades. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Dyack expressed gratitude that his team, Apocalypse Studios, is still up and running amid this widespread catastrophe. On that note, he provided some news about Deadhaus Sonata: <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142050/Deadhaus_Sonata/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a demo is available for download now via Steam</a></strong>, and the goal is to <strong>launch an early access version of the game later this year</strong> at $19.99. This initial version will only feature the vampire class, but more content will be added over the course of the 18-month-long early access, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>7 Total Playable Classes</li>



<li>New Areas, Dungeons, Towers, and other locations.</li>



<li>Hundreds of Tarot Cards and Inscriptions</li>



<li>Additional challenges and achievements that will grant the most powerful Inscriptions</li>



<li>Community-generated Content tools that integrate directly into the game, allowing Gamers to Create Content within the Deadhaus Sonata world. The community will be able to create Dungeons, Campaigns, Cities, Specific Items, Stories Lines</li>



<li>Character Customization Options</li>



<li>Enemy Types and Bosses</li>



<li>Additional Stories and Quest lines</li>



<li>Voice acting, dialogue, in-game cinematics</li>



<li>Social Features like text chat and voice chat</li>
</ul>



<p>The full version of Deadhaus Sonata <strong>will be free-to-play with cosmetic microtransactions for monetization</strong>.</p>
