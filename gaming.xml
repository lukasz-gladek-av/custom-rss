            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/08/how-romance-and-relationships-work-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a BioWare RPG, which means a lot of things, including the fact that the game will feature romance. Based on what I learned during a recent trip to BioWare's Edmonton office for the current <em>Game Informer</em> cover story, Veilguard will be the team's most romantic game yet.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Relationship Level</h2>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b1bd3189-2248-412f-9626-b67426ecbf13" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Every companion in the game has a Relationship Level related to Rook, and the choices you make (and not even specifically about the companion, but in the world in general), what you say to companions, how you help or don't help them, and more all play into it. Every time you rank up a companion's Relationship Level, you unlock a skill point to spend specifically on that companion. Though companion skill trees pale in comparison to Rook's expansive tree, which features passive abilities, combat abilities, and more, as well as paths to three unique class specializations, there's still some customization here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each companion has access to five abilities, but you can only take three into combat. Thus, it's important to strategize which abilities to spend a skill point on and how those abilities can synergize with your current build on the battlefield. Though I couldn't confirm, Dragon Age series art director Matt Rhodes hints that companion issues, problems, and personal quests will play into this Relationship Level and how a companion interacts with Rook.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"[Bellara Lutara, for example] has her own story arc that runs parallel to and informs the story path you're on," Rhodes tells me while I watch game director Corinne Busche play through a linear, story-driven mission in Arlathan Forest where Rook is searching for Bellara. Busche adds that "relationships are key, not only romance but friendships. We wanted to lean into not just the relationships the characters have with you but the relationships they have with each other. It's a found family, and at the end of the day, they need to trust they all have each other's back."&nbsp;</p>














<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="d9b523b2-4d7b-4eeb-9d32-a3ede2420061" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>However, fret not, BioWare fans – romance is a key part of relationships in the game, Busche says, noting some of the romances will get quite spicy. However, not all of them will, as "each romance has a very different flavor," according to Busche. Some characters are straight to the point, while others are more awkward, having never been in a relationship before. "You learn who these characters are in how their romances unfold," she says. She likens romantic and platonic relationships to another way to "level up" your companions. It's not just experience and skill points that determine Rook's standing with companions, but diegetic conversations, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>BioWare has already revealed that every companion in Veilguard is pansexual, notably different from the community-dubbed "playersexual" approach in some games, which sees NPCs adjust romantic and sexual interests based on the player rather than their own sense of sexuality. As pansexual companions, they are attracted to people of any gender (or regardless of gender). That's a critical distinction because, in Veilguard, your companions aren't just going to vie for your affection – they might take attraction to other companions in the titular Veilguard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Giving one companion the cold shoulder might nudge them into the warm shoulder of someone else on the team. Busche says companions can form romances with each other, although I'm unable to confirm if that means locking Rook out of forming a romance with them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I saw nothing resembling romance in my very early hours with the game. However, I did see the romantically inclined "emotional" response in Rook's dialogue choices at times, which led to my Rook flirting with ice mage and private detective companion Neve Gallus. Busche says this is the option to flirt and push platonic relationships into romantic territory, though Rook's flirtatious efforts aren't always reciprocated. But that's not to say you should ignore the other options – I saw dialogue choices resembling friendly, snarky, and direct, too, and I can see how these different flavors of dialogue likely mix and mingle into Rook's relationships with companions. It's still a mostly mysterious system to me, but as Veilguard is due out this fall, I don't have to wait too long to learn more and neither do you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/quests-from-infinite-staircase-dd-review-perfect-for-more-than-one-shot-but-not<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, there's a lot of published content that can be completed in one or two sessions, while the rest will take you over a year of continuous play to complete. Their latest book, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-quests-from-infinite-staircase-dd-adventure"><em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em></a>, is an anthology book of remastered adventures that instead fills the space of "What if I only had a summer to run an adventure?"</p>
<h2>Information Hands To Players Or Potential Infinite Staircase DMs</h2>
<p>Some top-level information about this book for potential players before getting too into the weeds for DMs is that <em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em> features six adventures, there adventures range from level 1 up to level 13.</p>
<p>The adventures are all pulled from earlier versions of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons,</em> each published between the years of 1980-1984. The adventures included consist of <em>The Lost City, When a Star Falls, Beyond the Crystal Cave, Pharaoh, The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth, </em>and<em> <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3f193438-c569-4842-9887-3f37e300a96e" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/dungeons-dragons-expedition-to-barrier-peaks-preview-stepping-directly-into">Expeditions to the Barrier Peaks</a></em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3f193438-c569-4842-9887-3f37e300a96e" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/dungeons-dragons-expedition-to-barrier-peaks-preview-stepping-directly-into">.</a></p>

<p>Each adventure has been remade not only for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e</em> but also with an eye on balancing encounters better, adding more tools for the DM to guide the narrative, and a sensitivity pass (at least for Pharaoh)</p>
<p>Unlike <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fd0050cc-2541-4de8-858f-46e54f556d11" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/keys-from-golden-vault">previous anthologies</a> where a book might come with 10 adventures, most only covering a single level of play each of the adventures found within <em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em> spans at least three levels of play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seems like the right amount of time for any new DM who is interested in running something with a bit more depth than a one-shot, but isn't ready to commit the time to a full campaign (or for a group of friends whose schedules only allow for two or three sessions before things fall apart).</p>
<h2>Nafas and the Infinite Staircase</h2>
<p>Much like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c69efd7c-c5a7-4b44-a82c-59be6e59f819" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-and-dragons-candlekeep-mysteries-review"><em>Candlekeep Mysteries</em></a> had the idea of books as a running theme through adventures, or Van Richten's Guide To Ravenloft was centered on Domains of Dread this book has the Infinite Staircase and the Noble Genie, Nafas, as its central theme.</p>

<p>Introducing the Infinite Staircase the book describes it as "an impossible staircase [that] winds in a surreal demiplane, ascending to every world, every plane of existence, and the adventure found among them."</p>
<p>The book does a good job of introducing who Nafas is and how he can be used to create a narrative tie between each of these adventures. His inclusion is wholly optional to a DM who can just as easily drop any of these adventures into their world, or start with a plot hook that puts the party right at the start of the action.</p>
<p>While Nafas is an optional tool for this book one thing I did enjoy seeing was the way that the book prompted Nafas' use in any other scenario. Being a Genie who hears the wishes of others through the many doors of the Infinite Staircase the book prompts that you might want to use Nafas if your party is looking to learn the true name of a powerful enemy, need to destroy a magic item, or to restore life to a creature.</p>

<h2>Adventures Across Realms And Playstyles</h2>
<p>The adventures that can be found in this book are predominantly dungeon crawls, which makes sense when you remember each adventure is from the 80s. <em>The Lost City</em> has you moving through floors of a Ziggaurat, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3f193438-c569-4842-9887-3f37e300a96e" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/dungeons-dragons-expedition-to-barrier-peaks-preview-stepping-directly-into"><em>Expedition To The Barrier Peaks</em> consists of exploring a buried spaceship</a>, and <em>The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth</em> is self-explanatory.</p>
<p>While players will be moving from room to room hearing descriptions of caves, pieces of furniture, and getting ambushed by various creatures there is also plenty of story to uncover. Hosting each of these adventures within a contained space helps for a beginner DM to let the party lead the adventure following up to provide them with information where necessary.</p>
<p>From the books first adventure, <em>The Lost City</em>, I enjoyed that while it was a contained Level 1-4 Adventure with a narrative start, middle, and end that there were elements left hanging.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The party is able to work with (or against) the different factions and escape the ziggurat, the book then provides two further options for players. Another, far deadlier, floor of the ziggaurat that might have the party return at level 10+, or an Underground City setting that can be used as a launching-off point for further adventures.</p>
<p>The most impressive adventure in terms of sheer scale is that of <em>Expedition To The Barrier Peaks</em>. This four-level spaceship launches level 11 players into the middle of a science fiction adventure. Adding to the regular roster of Magic Weapons there are Technology Weapons and Items including but not limited to the Antigravity Belt, Needler Pistol, Paralysis Pistol and Powered Armor.</p>
<p>Across the 60+ rooms found in this mega-dungeon players will be collaborating with the onboard AI, meeting different factions that reside among the ship, dealing with renegade androids, and trying to minimize threats onboard. There has been upgrading done to this adventure in the form of making less empty rooms, as well as reordering some of the more interesting encounters to be more directly in the player's paths.</p>

<p>Some other key features of the other adventures include the more narrative-heavy When A Star Falls, and Beyond The Crystal Cave, the latter of which can be completed without needing to resort to combat at all.</p>
<h2><em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em> is a fun collection of 'best of' hits from the early age of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. As always it's good to see these kinds of adventures get the reverence they're owed while also being updated to better fit the game in it's current state.</p>
<p>Overall the most exciting aspect of this book for me is that it fills that space for short and medium adventures that aren't a 'one and done' situation. This is a good gateway for new DMs and new Players to get a taste of what it's like coming back to the table a few times over with the same party configuration.</p>
<p>While the Infinite Staircase and Nafas are only briefly delved into what info is provided does a better job of setting up Nafas as a force to use in a larger game than as the throwaway quest giver within the pages of this book.</p>
<p>If you're interested in playing <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and find 4-6 session adventures are up your alley then this book is a must have.</p>

		<p>No, nothing is wrong with your email filter. These weekly newsletters are one of the things that fell through the cracks while we were doing our in-person stream in New York City, and then upon our return. I'm sorry. I should've just sent a short email saying "hey, this isn't happening" but there was so little time in-between going to and from New York, recovering from New York, and then preparing to be largely offline during the week after. A huge additional pain involved the monumental effort of getting an above ground pool setup in my backyard, the difficulties of which you'll hear in greater detail on an episode of HOA I'm going to record tomorrow with Rob. My back is still a little sore, and I still have mud that I'm finding under my fingernails, I think. It'll all make more sense soon enough.</p><p>-pk, who wishes he was enjoying this season of <em>The Bear </em>a little more</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>Monday: </strong>Planning! I did my best to keep up with email even when I was off last week, but it still left a million follow-up emails to be sent, not to mention the fact that a vacation I've had planned for a year now happens to coincide with our July 4th break, which means I'm stressed all over again preparing for that family event. My stress strategy is to not think about how much is left to do, and simply do what is in front of me, check it off the list, and then move onto the next. Otherwise, I can feel the anxiety creeping up my neck. It's not helping that the video game I'm mostly playing right now is the stressful <em>Nine Sols</em>, but weirdly, I find my time with that game to mostly un-stress me.</li><li><strong>Tuesday:</strong> We'll record an episode of HOA where Rob talks me through a bunch of apartment stuff happening as he considers whether it's time to sell and move on, and I walk you through what it's like to build and fill a pool, only to realize that you did not account for a few things, and now you have to drain the pool, dismantle the pool, buy a bunch of stone pavers, and spend an afternoon digging holes in the rain. It was a thing, but hey, I've got a pool now.</li><li><strong>Wednesday: </strong>HOA will publish, and we'll return to pushing a boulder up a hill, while chit chatting about how our holiday went. And no, I am not picking up from where I left off from the in-person stream. Instead, I have to start from scratch, because the game does not have cloud saves, and philosophically, it feels right my ass is forced to push that entire boulder up the hill all over again.</li><li><strong>Thursday: </strong>Remap Radio gets recorded—with Janet, of course—and with any luck, we won't have to spend much of that time talking about Dr. Disrespect. Rob and I will hopefully publish a letter series about the summer by then, too.</li><li><strong>Friday: </strong>Remap Radio goes live, and then Rob and Cado return to the world of motorsports with <em>Motorsports Manager</em>. I assume everything is going well?</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to&nbsp;</em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em>support@remapradio.com</em></a><em>.</em></p>

When he ordered two mojitos and proceeded to suck them down while hungrily staring at the bartender, I worried the look on my face betrayed my most impure thoughts.<br></p><p><em>Miami Vice</em> is a hot movie, but it’s so much more than that. Mann is uniquely capable of making a film that feels like it has both a huge dick and a huge heart. The fast cars, the preoccupation with tactile tech, and the long, lingering sex scenes could all push this movie into flatly masculine territory, but Mann’s deft hand steadies it. The <em>plot</em> of <em>Miami Vice</em> follows two almost superhuman cops going undercover in a global drug-smuggling operation, but that’s not what this movie is about.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="46ce21edd05095fc7dfdd47de16f6d03" data-recommend-id="image://46ce21edd05095fc7dfdd47de16f6d03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gong Li and Colin Farrell look at each other while on a speedboat during sunset.

It’s about the illogical nature of love, about falling for someone so immediately and intensely that it intoxicates you, your head swimming like you had too many mojitos, the two of you incapable of keeping your hands to yourselves because touching each other is like taking another shot of liquor.<br></p><p>It happens so fast: Farrell’s Sonny Crockett asks to take Gong Li’s Isabella (the financial advisor for the global drug-smuggling ring) for a drink and before you know it, the two are racing across the open ocean on a speedboat, headed to Havana, where they disappear for a few days, falling into each other and out of everything else. They salsa dance, they fuck in the shower, they trade deeply personal stories, they entwine—all while Sonny is undercover, all while the sting is still ongoing. Periodic shots of darkening clouds, bolts of lightning, and rough ocean waters warn us of how dangerous their dalliance is—but the viewer, like Sonny and Isabella, doesn’t care. You&nbsp;don’t have time to.<br></p><p><em>Miami Vice</em> moves at breakneck speed (so much so I was often confused about what was happening and almost delirious from it), recreating the feeling of falling hard for someone you’ve just met. It sweeps you up in that love, so you yourself feel just as crazy as Sonny, just as willing to put yourself in danger for something that moves you so intensely. How can a movie that manages that not be considered an all-timer?</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Overwatch 2 X Transformers will introduce skins based on three Autobot heroes: Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and Arcee. While we haven't seen the new skins in action yet, the new Overwatch 2 x Transformers trailer reveals which Overwatch heroes are getting a Cybertronian upgrade.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3K-Avl7yFY" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x3K-Avl7yFY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Blizzard's official site features an <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/media/stories/transmission/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Overwatch 2 X Transformers comic</a> that explains how these new alliances were formed. Megatron discovered the alternate world where Overwatch 2 takes place and reached out to Rammatra with an offer to provide him with Cybertronian technology far beyond his own. Essentially, Rammatra is now Megatron's avatar in this world. And once Optimus Prime, Arcee, and Bumblebee discover what Megatron has done, they searched for avatars of their own.</p><p>The Overwatch 2 X Transformers event will begin on July 9.</p>

In case you were living under a rock in 2021, toward the end of the show (spoilers) it was revealed that Kathryn Hahn’s Agatha Harkness was the evil witch causing much of Wanda’s pain and suffering inside a giant magical hex. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/P8u8md-NiHM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/P8u8md-NiHM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This big reveal happened via an extremely catchy song</a></span> that ended up going mega-viral on social media. That song,<em> Agatha All Along</em>, is also the name of the new upcoming spin-off which just got its first teaser. </p><p>On July 8, after the series underwent numerous name changes, Disney released a teaser trailer for <em>Agatha All Along,</em> which is set to premiere on Disney+ with two episodes on September 18. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/agatha-all-along-trailer-marvel-wandavision-kathryn-hahn-1235320185/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/agatha-all-along-trailer-marvel-wandavision-kathryn-hahn-1235320185/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s the official show description</a></span> courtesy of Marvel and <em>Variety</em>: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“The infamous Agatha Harkness finds herself down and out of power after a suspicious goth teen helps break her free from a distorted spell. Her interest is piqued when he begs her to take him on the legendary Witches’ Road, a magical gauntlet of trials that, if survived, rewards a witch with what they’re missing. Together, Agatha and this mysterious teen pull together a desperate coven, and set off down, down, down The Road.”</p></blockquote><p>In the trailer, we see direct nods to the television-themed <em>WandaVision</em> as well as a bigger focus on creepy witch shenanigans and new stars and characters, like Aubrey Plaza as the witch Rio Vidal. It seems Vidal has a history with Harkness and I’m curious to see how these two are connected. I’m also just really excited for a witchy, creepy, spooky show like this to be arriving right around Halloween season, aka the best time of the year. </p><p>Oh and come on, Kathryn Hahn is great, and giving her a full TV show is wonderful. Hopefully,<em> Agatha All Along </em>lives up to the hype and can match or even exceed <em>WandaVision</em> when it lands on September 18 exclusively on Disney+. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a recent report published by the BBC, the history of the .gg domain extension was explored by the tag’s creator. In 1996, Dr Nigel Roberts, from the island of Guernsey, co-created the .gg domain extension with a friend, but it was never intended to become associated with many of the world’s top gaming brands and platforms.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-good-game">Good Game</h2>



<p>If you’re a gamer, you’ve probably heard or seen the term ‘gg’. It’s a simple thing – it means ‘good game’, and it’s typically said when a match has ended. The more aggravating term is ‘gg ez’, which is known to have an unparalleled level of power over salty gamers worldwide.</p>



<p>When Dr. Roberts created the .gg domain extension in 1996, he did so because ‘all the other good two-letter codes were already taken’. He also created .je, but that hasn’t reached the lofty heights of the iconic ‘.gg’ extension. In <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx726l23dlpo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the article by the BBC</a>, Dr. Roberts explained that the popularity of the extension is great because it brings attention to Guerney, the island in the English Channel where the domain extension is registered.</p>



<p>Officially, it’s the top-level domain for the Bailiwick of Guernsey, so it’s used by sites operating within that region. However, as a result of the popularity of the term in the gaming world, it has become synonymous with gaming brands and platforms. It’s a similar story with .tv, which is best recognised for being the domain extension for Twitch. It’s tied to the Polynesian country of Tuvalu, which has a population of just 11,000, and it’s responsible for almost 9% of the government’s revenue.</p>



<p>Could you think of a better domain extension for the world of gaming? I couldn’t.</p>

<p>This one has been a long time coming. </p>



<p>Fallout 76 has enjoyed a few months of rampant popularity thanks to the wildfire success of the Fallout TV series. From April onwards, Fallout 76’s player count skyrocketed on all platforms, and the community blew up overnight. It also helps that Bethesda Game Studios has pumped the post-apocalyptic MMORPG full of content updates, which has helped to keep things fresh and keep players engaged.</p>



<p>In a recent effort by a dataminer, it was found that a future update could bring about a major update that Fallout 76 fans have been holding out for since 2021.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-never-go-alone">Never Go Alone</h2>



<p>In 2021, Bethesda Game Studios laid out a bunch of plans regarding Fallout 76, and one of the items on that list was a companion mechanic that would allow players to run around with <strong>pets</strong>. It’s a common enough feature for MMORPGs, and even Fallout 76’s ‘sister MMO’, The Elder Scrolls Online, has a pet system – but they’re ‘non-combat’ pets.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/it-looks-like-fallout-76-is-finally-getting-one-of-its-most-requested-features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central reported</a> on a datamining claim from a user named SugarBombsRADS. In a Discord server dedicated to uncovering unreleased content in Fallout 76’s files, this user found an image related to pets. It was one of the iconic ‘tutorial’ style images from Fallout 76, the three-image banner that explains how <strong>something </strong>works in the game. </p>



<p>Here’s the shot:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>While ‘Allies’ have existed in Fallout 76 for quite some time, they’re unable to leave a player’s C.A.M.P., which often leaves Vault Dwellers feeling lonesome in the harsh and unwelcoming wasteland. The introduction of companions that can roam alongside users will be a game-changer, and the images suggest that it could go beyond just cats and dogs, with Vault Boy cuddling up to a Deathclaw.</p>



<p>It also seems that there will be interactions that the player can perform with their pet, treating them like Dogmeat in Fallout 4, for example. Can you imagine if you could assume control of a Scorchbeast or something and walk around with it by your side?</p>



<p>As with anything datamined, this content is unconfirmed and may never see the light of day, but it’s nice to know that after all this time, it’s potentially on the horizon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Create Your Own Witcher 3 Character With a New Mod]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-3-character-creator-mod/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/create-your-own-witcher-3-character-with-a-new-mod.921822/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-3-character-creator-mod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It was around two months ago that CDPR opened up the REDkit for modders focused on The Witcher 3. This invaluable resource serves as a free add-on to The Wild Hunt, giving modders unprecedented control over the game, and we’ve already seen some stunning creations emerge. Now, a new mod has surfaced called Custom Player Characters, and as the title suggests, it allows players to create their custom character with which they’ll enjoy 2015’s The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-change-everything">Change Everything</h2>



<p>I don’t know why you’d want to, but if you’ve ever imagined stripping Geralt of Rivia from his role in The Witcher 3 and playing as a fresh character, this is the mod for you. The Custom Player Characters mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/5940" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by nikich340 on Nexus Mods</a> recently, allows users to build their player character from the ground up.</p>



<p>It’s pretty boundless – you can be a sorceress, a different Witcher, or something else entirely. With the character creation elements unlocked by the REDkit-backed mod, you can assume a completely different identity, and when combined with other mods (voice-based ones), you can even change how Geralt sounds, adopting a female voice if you’d like.</p>



<p>The Custom Player Characters mod even utilises new, ‘retargeted’ animations that make female bodies move more accurately. Also, if you choose to be a Sorceress, you’ll pick up a fresh magic-based combat system, assuming control of a set of spells that improve the more you use them.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most ambitious mods I’ve ever seen for The Witcher 3 – who will you play as?</p>

It's currently unclear if the Dr Disrepect map, which heavily features his likeness, will also be removed, but it seems likely.</p><p dir="ltr">The streamer, whose real name is Guy Beahm, was banned from Twitch in 2020. His exclusive streaming contract with the streaming platform was also terminated, prompting Beahm to sue Twitch and later receive a settlement from the Amazon-owned company. At the time, the reasons for his ban were unknown, and Beahm himself claimed he was unaware of why he was banned from the platform.</p><p dir="ltr">However, following a number of recent reports from former Twitch employees who alleged Beahm had been involved in sending messages to a minor and attempting to meet up with them at TwitchCon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dr-disrespect-addresses-misconduct-allegations-after-turtle-beach-ends-partnership/1100-6524501/" data-ref-id="1100-6524501">Beahm himself admitted to some of allegations</a>. He confirmed he did send what he called "inappropriate messages" to a minor, but said he never did anything "illegal" and did not meet the minor in question.</p><p dir="ltr">Since the allegations surfaced, a number of partners and brands have parted ways with Dr Disrespect, including Turtle Beach and the game studio he co-founded, The Midnight Society, which is working on an extraction shooter called Deadrop that was heavily promoted by the streamer. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dr-disrespects-twitch-ban-was-reportedly-due-to-messaging-a-minor/1100-6524455/" data-ref-id="1100-6524455">The Midnight Society in a statement said it was terminating its relationship with Dr Disrespect</a> immediately after investigating the allegations, and that "while these facts are difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept, it is our duty to act with dignity on behalf of all individuals involved, especially the 55 developers and families we have employed alongside our community of players."</p>

Every season there’s been a new pass with 110 ranks’ worth of rewards spread across three months. Players can grind the free track for the free rewards or pay 950 AC (roughly $10) to access the premium rewards as well. They can also go ahead and buy the Premium Battle Pass Bundle for 2800 AC (roughly $30) which includes the first 10 levels of the battle pass auto-completed and a bunch of additional rewards that aren’t included in it.</p><p>Here’s how it will work beginning with season 22 in August, as outlined in a new blog post <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/battle-pass-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/battle-pass-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over on the<em> Apex Legends</em> website</a></span>. There will be two separate battle passes per season that have 60 ranks each. They will still cost $10 but can only be purchased for IRL money instead of AC. The Premium Battle Pass Bundle has been replaced by the Premium+ option which is $20 per battle pass and comes with 10 unlocked ranks plus 2 Legendary skin variants that are exclusive for a year, 10 Exotic Shards, and all Legends playable for the duration of the Battle Pass. The change comes alongside revamped battle pass rewards more generally to make the best rewards quicker to earn and more plentiful. </p><figure id="" data-id="fed6117e4fd69e7984645e668d00488e" data-recommend-id="image://fed6117e4fd69e7984645e668d00488e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1456" data-height="819" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A chart shows how Apex Legends seasons are changing.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>These and other changes have been summarized in a chart that looks as convoluted as you’d expect from an EA-published game. “We’ve seen the numbers, and things need to be more approachable and realistic for our global player community,” the blog post reads. “Each of these updated aspects allows us to make the Battle Pass more attainable and valuable for your time and money.” </p><p>But that value has come at a price. “To up the value going forward, each Premium Track Battle Pass will cost $9.99 USD and will come with the rewards expanded on above,” the post continues. “The decision to move from AC to real world currency is not one that we made lightly, but it does allow us to decrease the price of Premium+ for our community.” Despite the use of “decrease” there, players who want to stay current on their battle passes will actually be spending $40 per season rather than $30. Respawn did not immediately respond to a request for further clarification. </p><p>The move away from letting people purchase battle passes with AC is also likely to go over with the community like a lead balloon. Previously, dedicated players were able to take AC earned from previous seasons and invest it in new battle passes, essentially paying the grind forward and earning rewards with time and dedication instead of new spending. It’s not surprising that a company trying to make money would shut that down, but it’s hard to see how it nets out to a big win for players. Fans who play daily and want the full package will essentially now be paying the price of an<em> Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree </em>DLC every three months. </p><p><em>Apex Legends</em> is far from the first game to effectively raise the price of its seasonal content. <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Destiny 2</em>, and other games have increased the price of in-game currencies and season passes in the last year following a historic spike in inflation, or at least that’s what some of the companies behind those increases <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-v-bucks-price-increase-season-1-map-1850966590&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-v-bucks-price-increase-season-1-map-1850966590">said at the time</a></span>.

These special people—the Descendants—are the key to saving humanity and use their abilities (as well as guns and explosives) to fight back an invading alien force and giant inter-dimensional monsters. I’d tell you more but there’s not much more to explain. If this setup sounds a lot like other sci-fi movies or games, well you’ve picked up on what<em> The First Descendant</em> really is: a mish-mash of what came before combined into a package that is fun to play but hard to recommend.<br></p><p>Every part of <em>The First Descendant </em>feels like it was ripped out of other pre-existing live-service shooters, like <em>Destiny, Warframe, The Division, </em>and <em>Anthem</em>. You zip around levels like the space ninjas in <em>Warframe</em>, the combat is tight and snappy like <em>The Division</em>’s third-person gunplay, and many powers and abilities feel directly inspired by <em>Destiny</em>. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/first-descendant-destiny-2-warframe-plagiarism-copy-1851580751&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/first-descendant-destiny-2-warframe-plagiarism-copy-1851580751">And some of the game looks to be literally ripped from Bungie’s FPS</a></span>…)<br></p><p><em>First Descendant </em>also lacks a consistent art style, beyond “just do what other games did.” The post-apocalyptic worlds you explore across the game’s main campaign don’t really gel with the anime heroes and their various cosmetic items. Similarly, <em>First Descendant</em> has a strange collection of enemy designs made up of baddies who appear to have fallen out of games like <em>Anthem, Destiny, </em>and <em>Outriders</em>. Some enemies look and act like creatures, others are more mechanical and robotic, a few look like weird space zombies, and then some are just dudes in hazmat suits. I was never really sure what I was fighting or how they all connected to each other beyond apparently being part of some big evil alien empire. And most stuff dies so fast that I didn’t really <em>need</em> to know what I was shooting.<br></p><p>As with all the games I’ve mentioned so far, <em>First Descendant </em>can be played solo or online with other players. Like <em>Destiny</em>, the open worlds you visit will contain other players who you can play with or ignore. These open worlds feature three to four missions that ask you to protect something, kill some stuff, collect a few things, or destroy a target. Repeat until you reach a larger, more involved mission aka an “Operation” aka a Strike from <em>Destiny. </em>And once you’ve done all that, the story moves forward a bit and you do it all again in a new location.<br></p><p>It’s mind-numbingly dull and if you’ve played any of these live-service looter shooters you’ll have done this song and dance a thousand times before. As with its story, art, enemies, and gameplay, <em>First Descendant </em>breaks no new ground or tries to do anything unique. It checks all the boxes it needs to check to be considered an online RPG shooter and doesn’t do much more.<br></p><p>And yet I keep playing. Not just because it’s my job and I have to play <em>First Descendant</em>. No, I keep playing even though there are other games I want to play instead. It’s not just because the game’s grappling hook feels nice and makes traversing its boring worlds a bit more enjoyable, though that helps. It’s not solely down to wanting to see numbers go up, though there’s plenty of that in Nexon’s shooter for those who love that kind of thing. <em>First Descendent </em>is like a bowl of mac and cheese at a crappy restaurant. Yes, I’m finally going to explain the metaphor.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="7995ad857b389c38f2f2287eaee606fd" data-recommend-id="image://7995ad857b389c38f2f2287eaee606fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image shows a character running as seen in The First Descendant.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I have a theory that as long as the noodles are cooked and there’s some cheese in the bowl, you can’t really be too mad at some warm macaroni and cheese. Sure, you can do more with mac and cheese. You can add bacon, bread crumbs, multiple cheeses, experiment with noodles, spices, sauces, etc. But in its most basic, by-the-book, no-thrills form, a bowl of mac is good and I’ll eat without complaint every time.<br></p><p>That’s how I feel playing <em>First Descendant.</em> It’s like eating a bowl of totally fine mac and cheese. In the moment, I enjoy it. I’m happy that I’m eating/playing. Yay, mac and cheese! Yay, snappy combat and loot! But the moment I pull myself away from<em> The First Descendant, </em>I quickly forget about it. It provides some comfort, sure, but ultimately, it offers nothing memorable or exciting. It does what it’s meant to do, it checks those boxes, and that’s it. Like a boring bowl of mac at some fast food joint or a friend’s house. Just enough to make you happy, but quickly forgotten.<br></p><p>So do I recommend you play <em>First Descendant</em>? Not really. If you’ve played <em>Destiny </em>or <em>Warframe </em>or other similar games it offers nothing new and does little to stand out. I guess if you’ve burned yourself out on other live-service shooters, it might be nice to take a break from those grinds and check out this new shiny grind instead. Still, I don’t think <em>First Descendant </em>will keep these kinds of players around for long, especially as its endgame treadmill to unlock new characters seems like a horrible slog and one which Nexon will gladly let you pay your way around.<br></p><p>But<em> The First Descendant </em>is also free and you might be thinking “Why not? I’ll give it a shot.” And I can’t blame you. If I was offered a free bowl of mac and cheese, all gooey and warm, I’d probably say yes, too. Just don’t expect any breadcrumbs or gouda. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/rey-double-red-lightsaber-star-wars-blade-pike-whip-switch-strangest<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em><strong>Warning:</strong></em><em> This article contains spoilers for Star Wars: The Acolyte Episode 5!</em></p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/star-wars-school-the-history-of-the-lightsaber">The lightsaber</a> is undoubtedly one of the coolest (albeit sadly nonexistent) weapons in all of pop culture. What's not to love about a laser sword that can cut through anything yet easily stow away in your pocket when not in use? Though as we've seen many times in the Star Wars universe, some Jedi and Sith aren't content to stick to the traditional lightsaber design. The Acolyte is just the latest Star Wars project to continue that proud tradition.</p><p>From double-bladed lightsabers to lightsaber pikes to a lightsaber rifle (?), here are the strangest and most noteworthy lightsaber designs in the Star Wars franchise, including a few from the classic Legends continuity.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Strangest Lightsabers in the Star Wars Universe</h3></div></output><h2>Lumiya's Light-Whip</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/08/01-Lumiya-720x404.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>You have to give Marvel Comics credit for thinking outside the box on this one. Long before the days of villains like Darth Maul and Kylo Ren, 1985's Star Wars #95 featured one of the most unusual lightsaber designs ever conceived. Lumiya, former protege of Darth Vader himself, constructed a whip based on ancient Sith designs. Built from a combination of unbreakable Mandalorian iron and lightsaber crystals, this weapon is the only lightsaber that creates a flexible beam. Lumiya nearly overwhelmed Luke with this deadly weapon, forcing him to wield two sabers at once to stand a chance in battle.</p><h2>The Double-Bladed Lightsaber</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/08/02-Darth-Maul-720x404.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The concept of a double-bladed lightsaber was introduced prior to The Phantom Menace, but this movie brought that weapon into the mainstream thanks to Darth Maul. Maul showed how deadly this weapon can be in the right hands, dominating two powerful Jedi at once. Similar doubled-bladed sabers have been used by characters like Savage Opress and Satele Shan.</p><h2>The Lightsaber Pike</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/08/Jedi-Temple-Guards-720x405.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One of the more interesting variations of the double-bladed lightsaber is the lightsaber pike, a weapon used by the guards at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. With a longer hilt and shorter blades, these sabers are designed to be used more like a staff than a traditional sword. The hilts also fold in half in a switchblade-style design, one that's started becoming more popular in the Star Wars universe.</p><h2>Pong Krell's Sabers</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/08/Pong-Krell-720x404.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Star Wars: The Clone Wars introduced a corrupt Jedi Master named Pong Krell who puts his own spin on the double-bladed lightsaber design. Krell's saber blades are longer, like Maul's, but the hilts fold in half, like the lightsaber pike. Krell is also the rare Jedi capable of wielding two double-bladed sabers at once, a feat only possible because of his incredible strength and extra arms.</p><h2>Mace Windu's Purple Saber</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/08/03-Mace-Windu-720x405.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Canonically, there's only one Jedi cool enough to wield a purple-bladed lightsaber. Lightsaber crystals almost always come in green, blue or red varieties, making Mace's saber quite the collector's item. We can't help but wonder what became of the weapon after Anakin sliced Mace's arm off in Revenge of the Sith.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Count Dooku's Saber</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/08/04-Count-Dooku-720x405.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Count Dooku was regarded as one of the finest swordsmen in the galaxy before defecting to the Sith. His lightsaber hilt features a unique, curved design, allowing for precise motions and strikes. This enhances the fencing-inspired fighting style Dooku has perfected. His protege, Asajj Ventress, wields a pair of similar sabers, though never quite as skillfully as her master.</p><h2>Darth Sidious' Sabers</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/08/05-Darth-Sidious-720x404.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Darth Sidious's sabers stand out both for their ornamental design and the fact that the hilts are so short. That makes sense, given that Sidious has taken great pains to conceal his Sith powers and keeps his sabers concealed within the folds of his robes.</p><h2>Ahsoka Tano's Sabers</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/08/06-Ahsoka-Tano-720x405.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>When Ahsoka Tano first appeared in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, she wielded a traditional green saber. But as the series progressed and Ahsoka became more confident in her abilities, she switched to the Jar'Kai style of combat, which focuses on dual sabers. Like a samurai, Ahsoka carries a standard-length blade and a shorter blade known as a shoto. Star Wars Rebels further sets her apart by making Ahsoka one of the rare Jedi to wield white lightsaber blades, with the blades also appearing in the live-action shows The Mandalorian and Star Wars: Ahsoka.</p><h2>Maris Brood's Sabers</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/08/07-Maris-Brood-720x1154.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Star Wars: The Force Unleashed introduced Maris Brood, a Jedi Padawan who falls to the Dark Side after the death of her master, Shaak Ti. Brood's twin sabers are inspired by tonfa sticks, with a perpendicular hilt design that allow her to hold her sabers at unusual angles.</p><h2>The Darksaber</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/08/08-Darksaber-720x405.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Darksaber is one of the oldest known lightsaber weapons in the Star Wars universe. Its archaic design results in a flat, angled blade that glows black and makes a distinctive hum. This blade has a long history with the warriors of Mandalore. Its creator, Tarre Vizsla, was the first Mandalorian inducted into the Jedi Order, and it's since been used by Mandalorians like Pre Vizsla and Sabine Wren. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/12/27/the-mandalorian-darksaber-moff-gideon-bo-katan-episode-8-black-lightsaber">The Darksaber also shows up in The Mandalorian's Season 1 finale</a> and played a key role in subsequent seasons.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Darth Malgus' Saber</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/08/09-Darth-Malgus-720x405.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Ancient Sith Lord Darth Malgus has one of the few lightsabers that can probably kill a man even when it's deactivated. The top of the hilt features two blade-like protrusions that make it seem as though Malgus carries an ax on the battlefield.</p><h2>Darth Chratis' Saber</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/08/10-Darth-Chratis-720x405.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Another powerful Sith Lord of the Old Republic era, Darth Chratis is notable for carrying a metal staff than can collapse in half and emit a lightsaber blade. The unusually long hilt gives Chratis extra reach in battle.</p><h2>Darth Bane's Lightsaber Pike</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/08/Sith_warrior_lightsaber_pike_bts-720x602.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>While the weapon the Jedi Temple Guards wield is called a lightsaber pike, The Clone Wars almost introduced a weapon even more in line with a traditional pike. This concept art shows the weapon intended to be used by Darth Bane in the Season 6 episode "Sacrifice." It's basically a long staff that emits a broad, tapered blade. But while Bane himself did appear in that episode, his weapon never made the cut.</p><h2>The Grand Inquisitor's Saber</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/08/11-Inquisitor-720x405.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Star Wars Rebels introduced the Inquistorius, an order of Dark Jedi charged with helping Vader wipe out the last of the Jedi. Each of these villains is equipped with a multi-purpose lightsaber. The hilt resembles nothing if not an identity disc from Tron, though it can also fold in half so that it looks like the hilt of a cutlass. These sabers can be used in either single or double-bladed mode.

The crystal powering his saber is cracked, requiring ports on either side of the hilt to vent the excess heat and plasma. The advantage is that Kylo's saber has two extra blades (or quillons) that he often uses to his advantage in battle.</p><h2>The Lightsaber Rifle</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/08/13-Jocasta-Nu-720x405.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Jedi librarian Jocasta Nu may not seem capable of going toe-to-toe with Darth Vader and his Inquisitors, but she's a surprisingly scrappy fighter when the need arises. Jocasta leveled the playing field by attaching her ordinary blue lightsaber to a specially designed rifle. That rifle uses the lightsaber as fuel for its incredibly destructive blasts. Unfortunately, the rifle can only fire so many shots before the lightsaber burns itself out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Rey's Switchblade Saber</h2><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/08/14-Rey-720x405.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In The Rise of Skywalker, Rey has a vision of herself wielding this deadly double-bladed lightsaber. This special weapon folds in half like Pong Krell and the Jedi Temple Guards' weapons, but the twist is that it can still be used as a twin-bladed weapon even folded. Now that it's been shown in the films (albeit as a vision), it's only a matter of time before we see someone wielding a similar blade for real.</p><h2>Vernestra Rwoh's Light-Whip</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/08/vernestra-using-lightwhip-1720452874764.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>While Lumiya has yet to make the jump from the classic Legends timeline to Disney's official Star Wars universe, the lightsaber whip has been canonized thanks to the High Republic initiative.

Every character model in the game can be pulled from, with players able to mix and match body parts to create their ideal monster slayer.</p><p>The most impressive part of the mod comes in the sorceress additions, however. Not only can players, again, pull from every model in the game to create a custom character, but the mod adds its own combat system separate to how the main game plays.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Custom Player Characters Mod by nikich340</h3></div></output><p>Instead of swinging swords at baddies, players instead wield spells such as blasting lightning, summoning tornadoes, and even turning into a cat. Abilities outside of combat allow portals to be made or lights to be cast in dark areas. A custom quest line walks players through these spells and teaches them new ones too.</p><p>This mod comes after the release of REDkit: <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-3-official-mod-support-arrives-this-month">an official modding tool for The Witcher 3 released by CD Projekt in May 2024</a>. The developer announced REDkit in November 2023, saying "it will allow you to create your own experiences in the game by making something completely new or editing existing quests and content."</p><p>REDkit has so far been used to create some wild and wacky mods for The Witcher 3, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forget-roach-this-witcher-3-wild-hunt-mod-lets-you-ride-a-vicious-fiend">one that lets Geralt ride an enormous fiend instead of Roach</a> and another that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/get-a-taste-of-the-witcher-remake-with-mod-that-puts-original-games-maps-in-the-witcher-3">recreates the original game in The Witcher 3's engine</a> ahead of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-will-be-open-world-cd-projekt-red-confirms">an official remake</a>. The most exciting addition so far perhaps comes through <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-modder-restores-secret-ending-scrapped-by-cd-projekt">the discovery of a scrapped ending sequence, which was revived</a> using the toolkit.</p><p>Mods will be the only new content coming to The Witcher 3 going forward, of course, as while the game received <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/Biggest_Changes_in_the_Next-Gen_Update">a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S update in December 2022</a>, it otherwise won't get any more official content as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-cd-projekt-red-game-in-development">CD Projekt focuses on its wealth of other incoming projects</a>.</p><p>The highly anticipated next mainline Witcher game, codenamed Polaris, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-polaris-development-cd-projekt">is currently in development</a> but won't arrive until <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-polaris-is-at-least-three-years-away">2025 at the absolute earliest, and probably later</a>. There are two other Witcher games on the horizon too, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-will-be-open-world-cd-projekt-red-confirms">the aforementioned remake of the original The Witcher</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witcher-spin-off-project-sirius-has-a-new-framework-following-development-restart">a multiplayer spin-off</a>.</p><p><em>Image Credit: </em><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/5940" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>nikich340 on NexusMods</em></a></p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Players could use in-game AC currency to buy said passes, but that process will be phased out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Further complicating matters is that each Season will be split into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>two </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">battle passes. The first Premium pass will cost $10 per half season, while the Premium+ pass (which offers extra in-game rewards) will be $20.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So unless players stick with the free track, they may pay $20 or $40 for a full season. Per Respawn, the change was done to make things "more approachable and realistic for our global player community."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To show what the change to its season passes will look like, Respawn posted a graphic below showing old and future rewards for the Free, Premium, and Premium+ tracks. Under the half-season change, players seem to get more rewards for buying both passes than the original "one per season" format.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Developers are changing their season passes, but to what end?">Developers are changing their season passes, but to what end?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last year, 2K took a similar two-track season pass approach with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-nba-2k24-i-is-adding-a-second-20-season-pass-for-players-to-buy">NBA 2K24</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Like with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apex, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">that game's Pro and Hall of Fame passes were respectively $10 and $20, though it offered Pro players a chance to trade up if they forked over another $10.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before that, Bungie bumped up the price of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2's </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">season passes from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-destiny-2-i-s-season-pass-price-will-increase-says-bungie">$10 to $12</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.
