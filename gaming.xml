<p>TwitchCon is unfolding in San Diego as we speak, and as usual, the platform’s leadership team took to the stage to discuss the evolutions occurring on the site. In a segment speaking about the future of the platform, Twitch’s Dan Clancy revealed what’s coming next, including boosted broadcast resolutions, transparent enforcement, and mobile app improvements.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-everything-revealed-at-twitchcon-san-diego">Everything Revealed at TwitchCon San Diego</h2>



<p><a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2024/09/20/everything-we-announced-at-twitchcon-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Twitch team revealed</a> that violations will be made more transparent going forward, with users getting more information about strikes and enforcement action. It’ll begin with chat-based infractions, with Twitch providing snippets of comments that led to enforcement action being taken against a user.</p>



<p>Also, strikes will be made temporary going forward. Depending on the severity of the strike in question, it’ll expire after a certain period, per the latest update. This means that strikes won’t last forever against an account, as they do now.</p>



<p>In terms of broadcasting boosts, Twitch will start offering ‘Enhanced Broadcasting’ that’ll allow streamers to put out their content in a 1440p resolution. This will be deployed region-by-region over the next year. </p>



<p>Streamers will also be able to broadcast both horizontally <strong>and </strong>vertically in the coming months.</p>



<p>On the topic of streaming changes, Twitch is making things more collaborative, launching ‘Shared Chat’ as a way of fusing communities. When streamers kickstart the ‘Stream Together’ mechanic, their respective chats will be linked, working together as one.</p>



<p>As 70% of new viewers come to Twitch via the mobile app, the team is constantly working to improve the functionality of the platform.</p>



<p>With other improvements being made to the Creator Clubs and Guild features, Twitch is evolving in the right direction, but there’s still plenty of work to do if the platform wants to become profitable and consistent.</p>

<p>Ironmouse is suffering at the hands of YouTube following an untimely and unexpected channel shutdown. It was revealed just hours ago that the globally renowned VTuber had been hit by a takedown that has brought years’ worth of videos offline. Ironmouse explained on Twitter that she is embroiled in a legal battle with the video-sharing and streaming platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-out-of-nowhere">Out of Nowhere</h2>



<p>Following a string of copyright strikes, Ironmouse’s main VOD channel was taken down by YouTube. This was <strong>somewhat </strong>on the table for Ironmouse, who had referenced a potential shutdown before the channel was taken offline. She said on stream:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s going to get deleted because I don’t want to dispute it because I don’t want to submit my personal information to whoever it is.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Per the regulations of the platform, Ironmouse’s <strong>main channel </strong>was closed down because it was <strong>affiliated </strong>with the VOD channel that was previously taken offline on September 9. The rule states that users cannot circumvent a ban or a profile termination by uploading content elsewhere, hence the closure of the main channel.</p>



<p>On Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1837260536792174962">Ironmouse stressed</a> that she is working with a legal team to straighten out the situation, but YouTube’s rules are pretty cut-and-dry. By way of a response, Ironmouse’s community took to social media to slam YouTube.</p>



<p>Last year, Ironmouse became the first VTuber to win Content Creator of the Year at The Game Awards, and she has been on an upward trajectory ever since. </p>

Like Fanatical's other build-your-own bundle deals, the Diamond Collection has a sliding price scale based on how many games you add to your bundle, but the price per game decreases the more you add. The bundle starts at three games for $15 ($5 per key), then goes up to five games for $23 ($4.60 per key), and seven or more games for $31.50 ($4.50). There's no limit on how many games you can add to your bundle, so can even grab the full 22-game selection for just $100.</p><p>As for the games on offer, one of the best deals is The Action, Strategy, and RPG Triple-Pack, which includes three games in a single pack: cyberpunk action RPG The Ascent, roguelike RPG For the King, and top-down horde shooter From Space.</p><p>Another highlight on the list is Starship Troopers: Terran Command, which turns the alien-blasting premise of the movie and books into a real-time strategy game where you command soldiers against hordes of arachnid threats. Wasteland 3 is another good game, as this party- and turn-based strategy combat adventure is set in a post-apocalyptic world that dynamically reacts to your decisions. It's a good-looking game with a fascinating narrative and deep gameplay systems that you can lose yourself in for hours. Those are just a few of the many other games available in Fanatical's Diamond Collection.

Pocketpair responded the next day. “At this moment, we are unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon, and we have not been notified of such details,” it wrote. “It is truly unfortunate that we will be forced to allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development due to this lawsuit.”</p><p>It <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1837070775427420411&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1837070775427420411" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could be weeks</a></span> before the exact allegations of patent infringement are outlined by Nintendo in subsequent filings, but in the meantime, new reporting and analysis has started to shed some light on what the company’s main line of legal attack might be, and why it’s decided to go after Pocketpair in the first place. While the early online controversy around <em>Palworld</em>’s similarity to<em> Pokémon</em> had to do with its creature designs, the lawsuit that Nintendo has filed eight months later is about what players actually do in the game. </p><p>One of those things is throwing a spherical object at fantastical creatures to capture them and store them inside. Nintendo has a patent for a version of that mechanic, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/flappy-bird-foundation-dong-nguyen-trademark&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/flappy-bird-foundation-dong-nguyen-trademark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as recently reported by <em>Game File</em></a></span>. Delving into the details, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/news/453508/pokemon-palworld-lawsuit-patent-infringement&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/news/453508/pokemon-palworld-lawsuit-patent-infringement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon</em> broke out the precise language</a></span> of what that patent, which was filed in 2021 and approved just last year, specifically covers:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>In a first mode, an aiming direction in a virtual space is determined based on a second operation input, and a player character is caused to launch, in the aiming direction, an item that affects a field character disposed on a field in the virtual space, based on a third operation input. In a second mode, the aiming direction is determined, based on the second operation input, and the player character is caused to launch, in the aiming direction, a fighting character that fights based on the third operation input.</em></p></blockquote><p>As you can see, it’s not merely throwing one thing at another thing to capture it inside, but a specific sequence of events based on particular inputs. We still don’t know if this is one of the actual patents involved in Nintendo’s lawsuit, or what a court will decide if it is. (The case was filed in Japan.) But if it is, the timing could narrowly work out in the Mario maker’s favor. Why was the patent so recent given that Pokémon has been around for decades? Probably because it wasn’t until 2022's <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em> that a game actually contained players capturing Pokémon with Pokéballs in 3D spaces like this. </p><p>Japanese patent attorney Kiyoshi Kurihara recently told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.yahoo.co.jp/expert/articles/59f880c5e13b9292f0e3ab2d1d55ce8bdbfdb97f&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/expert/articles/59f880c5e13b9292f0e3ab2d1d55ce8bdbfdb97f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Yahoo Japan</em></a></span>, according to a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://automaton-media.com/en/news/whats-the-killer-patent-nintendo-is-suing-palworld-for-japanese-patent-attorney-offers-in-depth-analysis/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/whats-the-killer-patent-nintendo-is-suing-palworld-for-japanese-patent-attorney-offers-in-depth-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">translation by<em> Automaton West</em></a></span>, that Nintendo and The Pokémon Company filed subsequent “divisional” patents based on the above one earlier this year and asked for the review to be accelerated, with approval on one of them coming just last month. Kurihara suggested this may have been part of a strategy to button up its patent language ahead of pursuing legal action against Pocketpair for infringement. </p><p>This isn’t the first time Nintendo has gone after another Japanese video game company for patent infringement. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.shacknews.com/article/102763/nintendo-files-40-million-lawsuit-against-mobile-developer-colopl#:~:text=Modojo%20%40%20Shacknews-,Nintendo%20Files%20%2440%20Million%20Lawsuit%20Against%20Mobile%20Developer%20Colopl,a%20number%20of%20company%20patents.&amp;text=Those%20who%20follow%20game%20news,itself%20into%20various%20legal%20suits.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/102763/nintendo-files-40-million-lawsuit-against-mobile-developer-colopl#:~:text=Modojo%20%40%20Shacknews-,Nintendo%20Files%20%2440%20Million%20Lawsuit%20Against%20Mobile%20Developer%20Colopl,a%20number%20of%20company%20patents.&amp;text=Those%20who%20follow%20game%20news,itself%20into%20various%20legal%20suits." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Back in 2017</a></span>, it went after mobile studio Colopl for its Japanese smartphone game <em>White Cat Project </em>for alleged patent violations related to “special technology used to operate a joystick over a touch panel.” The two sides eventually<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.siliconera.com/white-cat-project-developers-to-pay-nintendo-3-3-billion-yen/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.siliconera.com/white-cat-project-developers-to-pay-nintendo-3-3-billion-yen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> reached a settlement</a></span>, with Colopl paying Nintendo roughly $20 million. Industry analyst Serkan Toto, who leads the consulting firm Kantan Games, pointed to this example in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/cold-blooded-business-nintendo-is-patent-trolling-palworld-because-it-got-too-big/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/cold-blooded-business-nintendo-is-patent-trolling-palworld-because-it-got-too-big/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview this week with <em>404 Media</em></a></span>.</p><p>  “So first of all this lawsuit is filed under Japanese law, so it has nothing to do with the U.S., nothing to do with the UK or EU law at all,” he said. “And second point is that I think that Nintendo took its time to really build the case, map everything out, including counter arguments that the other side might bring up in a lawsuit, and how to counter them and make absolutely sure that they think they will win before filing the lawsuit.”<br></p><p>Toto painted a somewhat dire picture of Pocketpair’s likely chances of prevailing against Nintendo given its track record, and suggested that the timing of the lawsuit might be connected to Tokyo Game Show. Pocketpair was expected to announce a PlayStation 5 version of <em>Palworld</em> there months after partnering with Sony on a joint venture to expand the IP and merchandize it. Sony has declined to comment on the lawsuit so far. </p><p>“You can bet your life that Nintendo hates this company, and they couldn’t find an angle with the character designs,” Toto said. “This is why they are not mentioned in their press release. So they come with these technical peculiarities.” He added that he thinks the goal is to hurt Pocketpair financially. It’s unclear exactly how much the game has made so far, but it had already reached<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1752753619429163190?lang=en&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1752753619429163190?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 19 million players</a></span> shortly after coming out, including through Game Pass as part of a deal with Microsoft. </p><div><p>We’ll see what eventually comes out once Nintendo makes its case against Pocketpair public.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-heck-has-been-going-on-at-annapurna-interactive-an-investigation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg reported</a> that 25 people comprising the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/annapurnas-entire-gaming-team-has-resigned">entire staff of Annapurna Interactive</a> walked out the door in a group resignation. But while some of the circumstances around their departure emerged in the reporting, one pressing question was left unanswered: why?</p><p>Having spoken to multiple individuals close to the situation who requested anonymity due to fear of reprisal, as well as an Annapurna spokesperson, IGN has pieced together a somewhat complex answer. Disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency at Annapurna Interactive led to a staff walk-out that has left 25 individuals jobless, Annapurna leaders scrambling, and numerous developers concerned about their contracts with the publisher.</p><h2>A Company Divided</h2><p>Though the collapse of Annapurna Interactive as we once knew it started earlier this year, its roots lie in the company's historical leadership structure. Annapurna Interactive was initially conceived as the gaming division of Annapurna Pictures, which was founded by film producer and billionaire Megan Ellison in 2011. Annapurna Interactive itself was spun up in 2016, tapping a staff of industry veterans including including former Sony creative director Nathan Gary, former Sony executive producer Deborah Mars, and former Sony producer Hector Sanchez for leadership roles. Sanchez left the company in 2019, and former Capybara Games co-founder Nathan Vella was brought on that same year.</p><p>The film side of Annapurna's business has undergone well-publicized struggles. In 2018, it was <a href="https://variety.com/2018/film/news/annapurna-larry-ellison-megan-ellison-vice-1202975648/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bleeding enough money</a> to prompt Ellison's father, multi-billionaire Larry Ellison, to step in. By 2019, Annapurna Pictures was reportedly <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2019-08-07/annapurna-pictures-explores-bankruptcy-in-a-major-potential-blow-to-indie-film" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">teetering on bankruptcy</a>, and in the ensuing years its film and TV output slowed significantly. Variety reports that Ellison <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/megan-ellison-annapurna-scott-rudin-temper-1234951651/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disappeared from public life in 2019 almost entirely</a>, leaving her business to largely run itself during the height of the pandemic. She reemerged in 2021, only to name Gary president over all of Annapurna, with Mars and Vella stepping into co-head roles at the Interactive division.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In the ensuing years, Annapurna Interactive continued to grow, releasing financial and critical successes such as Stray, Outer Wilds, What Remains of Edith Finch, and Cocoon. While the company claims the Annapurna Pictures side of the business hasn't struggled in recent years, saying that film and TV were more profitable than Annapurna Interactive in 2023, a spokesperson alleged to IGN that Gary was a less-than-ideal steward of Annapurna Pictures. Under his guidance, they claim, resources were pulled away from film and TV, key executives were pushed out, and the company was largely refocused on gaming. Annapurna tells IGN that Gary also elevated co-founder James Masi to chief administrative officer, a role the spokesperson suggested was unnnecessary at a company of Annapurna's size. Notably, Annapurna did launch an animation division under Gary's tenure that released the critically-acclaimed film Nimona just last year, though an Annapurna spokesperson reached out to IGN post-publication with the assertion that it was Ellison who brought in Nimona as the foundation for what would become the animation division. IGN has reached out to Gary, but he declined to comment.</p><p>IGN understands that opinions of Ellison within Annapurna Interactive prior to 2024 varied from indifference to latent mistrust given <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/megan-ellison-annapurna-scott-rudin-temper-1234951651/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous reports on her behavior toward employees</a>. Anonymous sources I spoke to all cited a strong fear of reprisal from Ellison in particular, given her resources, history, and reach. A few people referenced creative or compensation disagreements during their time at Annapurna that contributed to a general feeling Ellison would not keep promises. Multiple sources we spoke to described Ellison as a largely hands-off leader and rarely present in the gaming division, an attitude that for years suited many of Annapurna Interactive's employees just fine.</p><h2>Ad-Verset effects</h2><p>This was the state of things at the start of 2024 according to our sources. Prior to March of this year, work at Annapurna Interactive was business-as-usual, they say, until employees were suddenly informed mid-month that James Masi had been unexpectedly let go. An Annapurna spokesperson confirmed Masi was made redundant, saying that Ellison had <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/megan-ellison-second-coming-nimona-1235842667/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chosen to step back in</a> at the company and oversee the Annapurna Pictures side again in an effort to re-invest in the film and TV side of the business. As a part of this, Annapurna claims that Ellison reinstalled Gary as head of Interactive, and deemed Masi's role unnnecessary.</p><p>However, at this time, Gary also left the company. Annapurna claims he left of his own accord in response to Masi's firing and his change in role. But sources say employees were told in the following days by leadership within Annapurna Interactive that Gary had been fired along with Masi. The belief that two of their leaders had been fired seemingly out of the blue sparked confusion and fury, and a handful of individuals quit in protest, including at least one other Interactive leader.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The sudden resignation of multiple key individuals came as a shock to the company, and IGN understands that Ellison held a video call with Annapurna employees to discuss what had happened and find a way to move forward. On the call, Ellison allegedly expressed a desire to keep the entire group, including those who had been fired or resigned, together. In the following days, all the departed staff returned, including Gary and Masi, and discussions began for a potential spin-off of the company that would allow Gary and Ellison to achieve their respective visions with minimal disruptions to partner developers.</p><p>Roughly, the plan was for Gary and the Annapurna Interactive staff to become a new company called Verset, with ownership split between Annapurna and Verset's leaders. Verset would oversee all currently existing signed Annapurna Interactive projects, with revenue split between itself and Annapurna proper in Annapurna's favor. It would also be free to sign its own, independent deals. Developers IGN spoke to report being made aware the spin-off was happening in the following months, and were reassured their contracts would be fulfilled.</p><p>While employees understood such a venture would take time to get off the ground, in the ensuing months a number of events occurred that made some skeptical of Ellison's commitment to parting with Annapurna Interactive. In early summer, sources tell us that employees discovered Hector Sanchez had been quietly rehired back at Annapurna by Ellison and was working on gaming projects without the knowledge of the rest of the Interactive staff. The news wasn't made official until August that Sanchez had been appointed president of interactive and new media at Annapurna — a title that seemed to some as potentially at odds with Vella and Mars' roles at Interactive.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Annapurna, for its part, claims that talks between Ellison and Sanchez began as far back as February for Ellison to fund a new venture Sanchez was planning <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hectorsanchez_after-5-eventful-years-ive-reached-the-activity-7160635971250589696-MDwF/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">after departing Epic Games</a>. As talks continued, Annapurna says Sanchez began negotiating with Remedy Entertainment for a deal related to film and TV spin-offs of its properties. However, when spin-off negotiations began to crystalize at Annapurna Interactive, Ellison offered Sanchez a position at Annapurna. The intent, per the spokesperson, was for Verset to become the company's indie arm, and for Sanchez to lead efforts in the AAA and AA-gaming space, including transmedia properties.</p><p>Which is how, months later, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-movies-on-the-way-thanks-to-new-annapurna-partnership">Annapurna announced it was partnering with Remedy Entertainment</a> on film, TV, and other projects including funding support for Control 2. The press release, which IGN received, referenced both Sanchez and Ellison. But it doesn't reference Annapurna Interactive at all, and IGN understands Annapurna Interactive employees were only informed the deal was happening that morning. Employees, unaware of Ellison's plans or the status of the spin-off, were confused, concerned, and frustrated about the direction of the company and the future of its Interactive division, Verset or no Verset.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While all this was going on, sources say that discussions with Ellison regarding the spin-off appeared to have stalled out, and in August Annapurna officially terminated discussion. Annapurna claims this was due to Gary's lack of response to requests for feedback on legal drafts, and in a statement sent to IGN after publication, doubled down. "Any implication Annapurna was backtracking on the deal is false. We agreed to high-level deal terms and signed a term sheet in early April, which makes it all the more surprising that we never got a response."</p><p>Meanwhile, multiple people told IGN that in those final months, they began to see signs of Ellison exercising greater involvement over Annapurna Interactive's deals, projects, and budgets in a way that began to make them further uncomfortable with the direction the company was taking overall.</p><p>All of this came to a head at the end of August when all 25 Annapurna Interactive employees including Gary, Vella, Masi, and Mars signed a joint resignation letter. The group gave two weeks notice and departed the company together on September 6 leaving Ellison, Sanchez, and newly-hired chief strategy officer Paul Doyle working on a semblance of Annapurna's gaming efforts. Sources tell IGN that up to the letter being sent and after, the group asked Ellison to work with them on other possible solutions such as the aforementioned spin-off, but did not receive any interest.</p><p>IGN also understands that despite the two-week notice, partner developers did not learn about the sudden exodus of all their Annapurna contacts until a day or two before it occurred. Annapurna claims they didn't have enough time to collect developer contact information to alert them sooner, while Annapurna Interactive sources say they received no guidance from the company during that period as to who should tell developers, when, and how. An Annapurna spokesperson reached out post-publication to IGN to deny this, claiming it had active and open conversations with the Interactive staff on how to communicate the news.</p><h2>Annapurna Aftermath</h2><p>While IGN couldn't glean any details on the future of the 25 departed employees, there are some indications that the group is collectively working on some new venture together. A <a href="https://verset.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website for Verset</a> appears to be online at the time of publication with a PR alias, which IGN reached out to for comment. IGN was also unable to find any posts or other discussions from the departed members indicating they were looking for employment elsewhere. Whatever their future plans, IGN understands that the group did not have a ready-made venture waiting when they left, as some have speculated. If they build anything new, it will be largely from scratch.</p><p>Meanwhile, at Annapurna itself, efforts are underway to right the ship. Multiple developers I spoke to expressed a mixture of frustration and confusion at the sudden departure, but several told me they felt confident in Sanchez's ability to honor existing obligations. Several individuals with projects at different stages of development told me about meetings they'd had with Sanchez in the wake of the event that they reported had reassured them. Sanchez has previously stated his intention both to backfill roles as well as work with outside agencies to fulfill Annapurna's contractual obligations, and IGN has confirmed this process is ongoing. Earlier this week, Annapurna also posted an <a href="https://annapurnainteractive.com/en/jobs/publishing-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open role for a QA Manager</a> overseeing "multiple external QA teams."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The unusual situation appears to have impacted a few specific projects in unique ways. On August 30, iam8bit <a href="https://x.com/iam8bit/status/1829618620776734871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared an announcement</a> that an upcoming PlayStation 5 physical edition of Outer Wilds: Archaeologist Edition had suffered from a manufacturing error, and did not include the Echoes of the Eye expansion as expected. Annapurna Interactive at the time said it would "continue to investigate", while iam8bit offered either a digital DLC voucher to impacted customers, or a replacement corrected physical copy. Both Annapurna and Interactive sources have told IGN that this issue is unrelated to the resignations, and Annapurna reassured that it will not be impacted by the upheaval at the company.</p><p>Then there's Blade Runner. Last summer, Annapurna Interactive announced it would be developing its first in-house game, based on the Blade Runner franchise, titled Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth. However, game director Chelsea Hash appears to be one of the 25 individuals who resigned, per LinkedIn, and IGN understands that all other full-time members of the development team joined her. Annapurna has told IGN that development on Blade Runner 2033 will continue despite the departure of its entire team.</p><p>An Annapurna spokesperson also shared the following statement when asked for further comment:</p><p>"The whole situation is a baffler, but now we're focused on moving forward. We've had really great conversations with an overwhelming majority of our existing development teams and are grateful for their partnership. If our inbox is any indication, a ton of developers continue to want to be a part of what we're building, and we look forward to seeing their pitches. We've also had an influx of quality job applicants and are excited to build a team passionate about our mission to tell original stories that aren't being told elsewhere. P.S. We're hiring."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The whole situation is a baffler.</p></div><p>Annapurna has splintered into two groups, both of which are now working to pick up the pieces. The remains of Annapurna Interactive (or perhaps a future Verset) consist of 25 individuals who felt strongly enough about perceived mismanagement, poor communication, apparent spontaneous layoffs of leaders, and one another that they were willing to give up paychecks and stability at a time of overwhelming industry job and funding uncertainty. When IGN approached its sources close to this group about Annapurna's version of events (specifically, the conflicting information around Masi and Gary's alleged resignation/firing and the collapse of spin-off discussions), they reacted with skepticism, but did not feel they could safely provide more specific details.</p><p>Meanwhile, at Annapurna, a tiny leadership team is struggling to ensure that around 40 projects have the support they need, while the company's partners have been left at various stages of development and uncertainty as to what comes next.</p><p>Annapurna Interactive as we once knew it — a beloved publisher of critically-acclaimed, unique, beloved indie games — is no more. What, if anything, will rise to take its place?</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

The studio has previously worked on other <em>Zelda </em>remasters and ports, like <em>Four Swords</em> to DSI and <em>Ocarina of Time 3D, </em>as well as  <em>Majora’s Mask 3D,</em> to 3DS. The Japanese studio also ported <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/luigis-mansion-remake-announced-for-3ds-in-nintend/1100-6457275/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/luigis-mansion-remake-announced-for-3ds-in-nintend/1100-6457275/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> to 3DS, too</a></span>.

                <p>With the unveiling of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/" data-ref-id="1100-6526357">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> and rumors that the long-anticipated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-images-have-allegedly-leaked-suggesting-powerful-leap-forward-for-nintendo/1100-6526551/#:~:text=The%20Switch%202%20is%20claimed,a%20different%20layout%20for%20LEDs." data-ref-id="1100-6526551">Nintendo Switch successor</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reaffirms-a-next-gen-xbox-is-on-the-way/1100-6524094/" data-ref-id="1100-6524094">Xbox Series S | X follow-up</a> are just around the corner, now seems like the perfect time to take a closer look at the future of these companies and console gaming as a whole.</p><p>In this week's episode of Spot On, Tam and Lucy sit down to do precisely that, discussing not only their thoughts on the companies current trajectories, but what public opinion seems to be as well. Is the PlayStation 5's $700 price tag an indication of what consoles will soon cost? Are the ROG Ally and Steam Deck reasons for Nintendo to be concerned about the success of its next console? And which company is more likely to release a console with a new "gimmick" if the Switch 2 forgoes introducing a new feature? The pair tackle all these questions and more as they speculate what the future of console gaming looks like.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIUwcEEgVmE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SIUwcEEgVmE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spot On is a weekly news show airing Fridays in which GameSpot's managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest news in games. Given the highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle of the massive video game industry, there's always something to talk about but, unlike most other news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic as opposed to recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.</p>

                <p>Amazon's recent Fallout TV series has boosted the video game franchise's popularity, and along with that newfound interest from wider audiences has come to a bunch of new Fallout-themed merch, including a new Fallout Mega Bloks building kit. The upcoming set is based on the iconic <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fmega-fallout-red-rocket%2F-%2FA-92357170&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnew-fallout-mega-set-based-on-the-iconic-red-rocket-gas-station-up-for-preorder%2F1100-6526618%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Red Rocket truck stops</a> seen dotting the ruined landscapes of the video games and TV series, and comes with a Vault Dweller figure, T-60 Power Armor suit, and everyone's favorite wasteland companion, Dog Meat. Mega's Fallout Red Rocket set will cost $80 and launches November 10. Preorders are available now at Target.</p><h2>Preorder Mega Fallout Red Rocket set</h2><p><strong>$80</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4370433-redrocketthumb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4370433" data-ratio="0.56328125" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4370433-redrocketthumb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4370433"></a><figcaption>Mega Fallout Red Rocket Truck Stop set.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4370433-redrocketthumb.jpg"></figure><p>This 824-piece kit packs a ton of detail and numerous fun references Fallout fans will enjoy. Those include a Nuka Cola vending machine stocked with Nuka Cola bottles, a Vault-Tec bobblehead, and a laser rifle. The designs of the Vault Dweller and Dog Meat figures are also based on the appearances of the characters from various Fallout video games. The interior of the set is modular, making it easy to access, and you can deck it out with a few additional elements like wall hangings, a power armor repair station, and a work bench--just like in Fallout 4.</p><p>The Red Rocket truck stop is the second official Fallout set from Mega.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kobold-press-ceo-says-no-to-generative-ai<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A tabletop publisher has said no to generative AI. It is a highly contentious topic within the business. Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-expresses-support-of-ai-in-dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank">praising the technology</a>. Games Workshop has <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-imposes-golden-demon-ai-ban-preventing-its-use-in-miniature-painting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">banned its use</a> in Golden Demon. Kobold Press's CEO has said no AI art will appear in any of their products.</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://koboldpress.com/state-of-play-kobold-press-issues-the-no-ai-pledge/">official blog post</a> on Kobold Press' website, CEO Wolfgang Baur made a statement on the trend of generative AI content and the company's stance on its use.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-valiant-dragon-artwork.jpg?itok=QDLK5ffH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-valiant-dragon-artwork.jpg?itok=AXvVTr_T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Baur states that AI is popping up everywhere. It has been a point of controversy with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. It's being used in various institutions, such as health insurance claims in the United States. In fact it's being used as a marketing feature with the latest smartphones.</p>
<p>While Baur doesn't discount the applications of AI in various fields, he does state that there are areas where it shouldn't belong specifically, at TTRPG tables among friends telling shared stories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The staff at Kobold Press doesn’t think AI belongs in generating art, roleplaying, or storytelling. Making your game your own is the heart of the RPG hobby: creating your world, your character, and your story with friends. Frankly, we’ve seen LLM text prompts work ok for chatbots. But we play RPGs to play with our friends, not software.</p>
<p>The Kobold policy against AI has been in place since the rise of Midjourney and similar tools in 2022. We looked at them, learned that they were trained on images that ripped off working artists and violated their copyrights, and rejected them as unethical tools that require theft from creatives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Baur's statement continues to give credit to Kobold Press' team of writers and artists. Alongside this praise, he emphasizes that none of their books will include any AI-generated art, maps, or game design elements, and elects to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Kobold Press is not alone in its anti-AI stance. It is joined by other TTRPG publishers in the industry such as <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si91?Paizo-and-Artificial-Intelligence">Paizo</a> and <a href="https://www.chaosium.com/blogai-art-and-chaosium-16-dec-2022/">Chaosium</a>.</p>
<p>The post ends with a sign-up sheet. If you support Kobold Press' stance against generative AI, you can add your name to the list.</p>
<p>Kobold Press has a strong reputation within the TTRPG community. They have produced multiple <em>D&amp;D</em> 5e third-party materials such as the <em>Tome of Beasts</em> and their own fantasy TTRPG, <em>Tales of the Valiant</em>.</p>

		<p><em>The muted reaction to Sony’s PlayStation 5 Pro presentation left the impression that whatever people want, it’s not what Sony was leading with in their unveiling of their newest gaming hardware.</em></p><p><em>So what do they want? What do we want from a new piece of games hardware? That’s hard to say, and it’s not a surprise that the inherently incremental nature of a PS5 Pro felt like a misreading of the room. Rob and Patrick will probably take “the same, but better” if it’s offered, but if you ask them what would excite them, they have some very different answers along very different lines than a getting a slightly better video card.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob: </strong>So Patrick, it seems safe to say that the general reaction to the PS5 Pro was indifferent. Even in quarters where you might expect a bit more excitement around a $700 console with a better graphics card, Sony’s presentation didn’t effectively sell people on the idea that the Pro would deliver widespread, meaningful improvements and it doesn’t seem like anyone is really thirsting to buy an even more expensive video games console.</p><p>We’ve talked extensively about the fact that we are in an era of marginal gains for graphical performance in video games. It’s been a problem since the start of this generation, and was a problem with the latest generation of PC graphics cards as well (the fact that NVIDIA apparently left a chasm between its top-end 4090 card and the rest of the 40XX line did not help). Part of it is that there’s simply not a ton that really serves a dedicated showcase to the latest tech because most things are built to straddle a wide range of hardware specs, so you end up with the kinds of underwhelming examples that Sony used, where they were reduced to showing how marginal details in a game that already looked good are suddenly a bit sharper. The fact that poor old Joel and Ellie are dragged out of retirement for “one last job” every time Sony has a new hardware spec doesn’t do much to assuage that <em>Groundhog Day </em>feeling around these reveals.</p><p>I’m pretty sympathetic to the “make it look better just because you can” point-of-view, but while I can enjoy a flight of fancy where I spend $20,000 on a new setup to enjoy <em>Gran Turismo 7 </em>in 8K (but not with HDR, apparently!), there’s a difference between enjoying better graphics and actually <em>wanting </em>them.</p><p>I freely acknowledge that one reason we end up foregrounding graphics so much is because you can show screenshots and videos as part of a sales pitch, while just about any other improvement is something that has to be experienced firsthand to fully appreciate. But it seems clear that “more graphics” aren’t moving the needle anymore, and the industry is struggling to figure out what will.</p><p>Personally, I keep thinking about the wasted potential of the PS5 controller. This isn’t Sony’s fault: their first-party stuff makes good-to-great use of its adaptive triggers, if not necessarily the touchpad. But it’s one of the few things to come along in the last ten years that can make a profound difference in how it feels to play a game, and how much information the controller itself can impart to the player. There should be a slew of games making use of it, especially given how well that console sold, but outside of Sony it mostly gets treated like a clone of the Xbox controller. Think of how lively <em>Astro’s Playroom </em>feels in your hand, the way it underscored every game mechanic and let you literally feel like you had a better grasp of their controls. I tell you without a shred of exaggeration that adaptive triggers were transformative for <em>GT7</em>.&nbsp; This should have been a bigger deal, if only to Sony. When you’re talking about how game controls feel, how good their feedback is, that’s a huge part of the equation. But we’re frequently stuck playing games with frankly numb-feeling controls because neither controller nor keyboard-and-mouse support is particularly well-implemented, a lowest-common denominator situation where at best we get passable, somewhat inoffensive controls. I think you could argue we have some of the best controller tech games have ever had, and games have rarely done a worse job of making players feel connected to the games they are controlling. The general shrug that greeted the PS5 controller’s unique features hints at an underlying problem: games are a tactile medium, but that tactility is treated as a minimum target developers have to hit rather than an opportunity to make a game feel better and more engaging. Frankly, you could keep the ray-tracing and maybe even the HDR if more games gave me the immediate sense of involvement that I got from that initial slate of PS5 games.</p><p>In a word, I’m a lot less moved by level of detail than I am by attention to detail, and I think that’s the stuff I want from games a hell of a lot more than I want a GPU that’s 67% bigger delivering 45% better performance.</p><p>What about you? What’s the stuff you want from a new piece of games hardware now? Not “what do you think would be commercially successful” but what is the thing that they could do that would meaningfully enrich your experience of the hardware or address a problem that sticks in your craw?</p><figure><figcaption><span>The future Patrick still wants.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>What I want from video games these days is the ability to play them wherever, whenever at an acceptable quality. It’s the reason the Steam Deck is so central to my life, it’s the reason the Switch, before the Steam Deck, was my most played piece of gaming hardware. It’s why I’ve jumped through hoops to make my PC stream wirelessly to my TV in the family room. It’s why I wish my Apple TV had a native GeForce NOW app. Increasingly, I’m just asking for my games to meet me where I am, and allow me to play them when I have time for them.</p><p>In a way, you could argue this helps explain why things like the DualSense have been a flop, outside of a few experiments. One of Microsoft’s big pitches has been turning “every screen into an Xbox” through cloud gaming. Video game hardware has not just plateaued—it’s flattened. A game is a game is a game, and even Nintendo has ended up in a place where its central gimmick is not about a second screen, it’s about letting one screen <em>meet you where you are</em>.</p><p>In that sense, why would any developer put meaningful work into something that wasn’t portable? You can’t be sure where your game might be played, and that could be as simple as knowing you’re likely to have a PC port where you can’t guarantee what controller they’re using.&nbsp;</p><p>I suspect the PlayStation 5 Pro is more impressive than Sony’s presentation revealed. Not because Sony was holding back, but because it was a piss poor event. It wasn’t able to appeal to normies or sickos, and yet, each time a clip trickles out of Digital Foundry, it has me going “hey, that looks pretty good.” Some of this is caught up in something we’ve been talking about for a minute now, the idea that gaming hardware has entered a phone phase where upgrades are incremental and largely unnecessary, but I think it also speaks to Sony being unsure where to hang their hat on. It’s a bit like the dance EA does with its sports games every year, where they have to quietly convince you their last game was ass without actually saying it. But you’re trying to instill FOMO. The question with the PlayStation 5 Pro is who you’re instilling fomo in.&nbsp;</p>

The Steam user review score is less than stellar, however, as players use the metric to once again boycott Sony’s PSN login requirement.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-steam-pc-release-date-trailer-1851509963&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-steam-pc-release-date-trailer-1851509963"><em>God Of War Ragnarök</em></a></span> requires one despite being an offline single-player game. That means that anyone who wants to play the meaty, brooding sequel to the 2018 GOTY needs to make a PlayStation account and sign in before playing, even if they don’t own a PS5 and never plan to. That hurdle is part of Sony’s larger attempt to move its PlayStation user experience onto PC without using its own game launcher.<br></p><p>And a bunch of Steam users still really hate it. <em>God Of War Ragnarök </em>is currently sitting at a 65 percent on Steam with over 2,000 reviews in so far, giving it a rating of “mixed” in the dreaded yellowish-orange font usually reserved for games with serious bugs or gameplay shortcomings. “I really wanted to give this game a thumbs up because it IS actually a good game, but the PSN requirement is stupid as hell and Sony needs to know that gamers will not stand for this,” reads one of the reviews.</p><figure id="" data-id="bccf610d2485e5904c2b2d9771f30a0a" data-recommend-id="image://bccf610d2485e5904c2b2d9771f30a0a" data-format="png" data-width="1389" data-height="827" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows negative God of War Ragnarok reviews" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows negative God of War Ragnarok reviews" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bccf610d2485e5904c2b2d9771f30a0a" data-recommend-id="image://bccf610d2485e5904c2b2d9771f30a0a" data-format="png" data-width="1389" data-height="827" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows negative God of War Ragnarok reviews" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sony’s PSN login requirement for Steam has been controversial since it was first foisted onto <em>Helldivers 2 </em>players earlier this year. Intended for launch, its implementation was delayed among all of the game’s other online issues and server crashes. Once it was finally brought back online, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-operation-clean-up-positive-review-steam-1851461173&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-operation-clean-up-positive-review-steam-1851461173">it ignited a days-long review-bombing campaign</a></span> that eventually resulted in the PlayStation maker backing off on the requirement, but only for <em>Helldivers 2</em>.<br></p><p>When <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> arrived on Steam in May, it also had a login requirement, but only to use its online mode, Legends, and its PlayStation overlay feature. <em>God Of War Ragnarök</em>, on the other hand, requires it to play the game at all. As a result, its Steam rating is currently sitting nearly 30 points below <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>’s, which was the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1dyg2pu/ghost_of_tsushima_was_the_bestselling_game_of_may/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1dyg2pu/ghost_of_tsushima_was_the_bestselling_game_of_may/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best-selling game</a></span> the month it came out. </p><p>  <em>God Of War Ragnarök</em>’s PSN login boycott might not end up impacting its PC sales too much, but the game hasn’t gotten off to nearly the roaring start on Steam that its predecessor did. So far it’s peaked at around 25,000 concurrent players on Steam, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/god-of-war-pc-attracted-50000-concurrent-steam-players-on-its-release-day/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/god-of-war-pc-attracted-50000-concurrent-steam-players-on-its-release-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about half</a></span> of what 2018's <em>God of War </em>did on its launch day.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-optic-dynasty-show-match/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a Call of Duty showmatch like no other, the current OpTic Texas roster will face off against the OpTic Dynasty live on October 12. It was just weeks ago that OpTic Texas won the Call of Duty League Championship, securing the most coveted trophy in COD esports and nabbing a $1 million grand prize.</p>



<p>The OpTic Dynasty, however, represents the pinnacle of Call of Duty esports for many fans. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-for-the-bragging-rights">For The Bragging Rights</h2>



<p>In front of a live audience at the Esports Stadium in Texas, OpTic Texas will attempt to take down the OpTic Dynasty, cementing their status as a true power squad in the Call of Duty space. </p>



<p>This match will pit Kenny, Pred, Shotzzy, and Dashy against Crimsix, FormaL, Karma, and Scump.</p>



<p>Of the entire OpTic Dynasty roster, only one member is still actively competing in the esports scene, and that’s Matt ‘FormaL’ Piper – but he plays Halo under the OpTic Gaming banner. Crimsix is a race car driver, Scump is primarily a streamer, and Karma is a coach for the OpTic Texas team, which could give him the upper hand in this contest.</p>



<p>During the past CDL season, OpTic Texas secured the top spot at Major 3 <strong>and </strong>COD Champs, proving that the team has the talent required to win both chips and rings – a concept that the Dynasty is certainly familiar with. </p>



<p>If you’re interested in watching the action unfold – assumedly on Modern Warfare 3 – you’ll be able to check out the gameplay on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/OpTicGaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OpTic Gaming’s YouTube channel</a>.`</p>

                <p>EA Sports has released the launch trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25/" data-ref-id="5000-635887">FC 25</a>, which is out now in early access for people who buy premium edition, ahead of its rollout for everyone on September 27. The launch trailer is intense. The trailer shows legendary footballer David Beckham receiving a phone call but choosing to ignore it and instead turn up his TV's volume and lean forward to truly focus.</p><p>The trailer bounces between footage of the game and live-action scenes showing the dedication people have to the real-world sport with intense, close-up shots of gnarly blisters, a ball-bruised stomach, and x-rays depicting an injured ankle. There is even a quick shot of a player doubling over in exhaustion and throwing up their lunch. Take a look for yourself in the launch trailer below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/20/24249913/twitch-depreciating-strike-twitchcon-trust-and-safety<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Twitch is changing the way it enforces its community guidelines. In <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2024/09/20/everything-we-announced-at-twitchcon-san-diego/">an announcement posted on its website</a>, Twitch said that it will introduce a new enforcement strategy in which strikes for certain offenses will depreciate over time, users will receive more information regarding their strikes, and users will be able to take educational courses to reduce the severity of enforcement actions. In an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Rob Lewington, Twitch’s VP of safety operations, and Kristen Murdock, the director of safety risk and response, spoke about the new program and what it means for moderating communities on Twitch.</p><p>According to Lewington, safety is Twitch’s highest priority. He said Twitch hosts over 105 million users per month with 1.3 trillion minutes of content viewed. But such enormous numbers, combined with Twitch’s age and popularity as a livestream destination, have created unique challenges in how the platform punishes people who violate its rules.</p><p>Currently, when a streamer violates one of Twitch’s community guidelines, they receive some kind of enforcement action like a warning or a suspension, which then counts against them in the form of a strike. After a certain number of strikes, that streamer’s account can be suspended indefinitely. “We’ve had people on Twitch for a long time that have had enforcements in the past, but they don’t expire over time,” Lewington said. “[This current system] is punitive for folks who’ve been on Twitch for longer and that’s not what we want to do.”</p><p>In this new system, strikes for “low severity” offenses will expire after a certain amount of time. Though accidental nudity was given as one example, Twitch did not offer a comprehensive list of what the “low severity” offenses are nor how long it would take for them to expire. “That’s still a work in progress,” Lewington said. “We’re still figuring out the exact timelines.” He did, however, say that strikes for high-severity offenses — incidents relating to child safety, terrorism, or hateful conduct — will never depreciate.</p><p>In addition to expiring strikes, Twitch will now offer more information to users when a violation occurs. Starting next year, Twitch will provide the relevant chat message or clip to give context on why an enforcement action was taken. According to Lewington, providing this information will help people better understand what they did wrong while also giving them the tools they might need if they want to file an appeal.</p><p>The final part of Twitch’s new enforcement strategy involves offering users educational courses when a violation occurs. As an example, Murdock described a situation in which a person who received a hateful conduct strike was able to reduce the length of their suspension because they took a relevant educational course and quiz.</p><p>Murdock said Twitch worked with the Anti-Defamation League and other outside experts to develop these courses and quizzes around subjects like hateful conduct, sexual content, and gambling. Their goal is to create consistent messaging for both streamers and moderators on what actions will constitute a violation.</p><p>Taken together, this new strategy represents a desire at Twitch to ensure its communities remain safe while allowing members who have made mistakes to learn and grow from their experience. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Last Month, 75% of All Games Sold in the UK Were Digital]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/uk-game-sales-august-digital/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent report, it was revealed that a whopping 75% of all games sold through August in the United Kingdom were <strong>digital purchases</strong>. It was documented that 1.74 million games were sold during the four weeks, and only 25% of them were hard copies, representing a 10% <strong>drop </strong>in physical game sales year-on-year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-no-alternatives">No Alternatives</h2>



<p>The report, which was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/75-of-games-sold-in-august-were-downloaded-uk-monthly-charts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">covered by GamesIndustry.biz</a>, confirmed that in August 2023, 65% of sales in the UK were digital. Over time, consumers in the United Kingdom have given up on physical media, and there are several reasons for that.</p>



<p>Firstly, digital gaming is becoming much easier and more accessible over time, with consoles shipping with larger storage drives and price parity stabilising across the board. Also, internet speeds are getting faster all the time, which means downloading or streaming games is also improving from an experience perspective.</p>



<p>Second, it’s important to stress that physical storefronts are dying out, and only GAME in the United Kingdom represents a ‘high street presence’ for the games industry across the entire region. In recent months, the decades-old retailer has faced severe struggles that have left many doubting the long-term prospects for the company.</p>



<p>With supermarkets boasting slim-to-nil catalogues of games and online storefronts often having some of the highest price points on the market, many gamers are turning to pre-ordering their treasured titles digitally, pre-loading them so they can start playing from the second the game goes live.</p>



<p>GamesIndustry.biz’s report also mentioned that Grand Theft Auto 5 sits atop the digital sales charts in the United Kingdom, which shows how the region is eagerly anticipating the arrival of Grand Theft Auto 6. </p>

<p>In a monumental report covering the state of play for Microsoft and Xbox, Bloomberg dove deep into the impact of the Game Pass subscription service. It’s not everybody’s cup of tea and it has garnered a mixed response from developers over the years, but one staggering statistic in Bloomberg’s write-up reveals just how invested Microsoft is in the platform.</p>



<p>It was said that the tech titan spends $1 billion annually to pull third-party games onto Game Pass, often parting ways with millions of dollars just to put pen to paper and get the deals signed. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-promise-of-exposure">‘The Promise of Exposure’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-09-20/xbox-president-sarah-bond-predicts-the-future-of-microsoft-s-next-game-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the gargantuan report</a> written by Bloomberg’s Dina Bass and Cecilia D’Anastasio, everything from the recent clash between Microsoft and the CMA to the potential of a handheld Xbox device was explored. </p>



<p>At one point, the conversation, which was focused majorly on Sarah Bond’s Xbox presidency, turned to Game Pass. In a retrospective, we got a glimpse of how the subscription service surfaced with a humble library and a low price point before becoming a massive effort that weighed heavily on Microsoft’s coffers.</p>



<p>It was a paradigm shift for Microsoft, standing up something that would see value trickle in over time rather than relying on that one supersized launch to rake in a substantial payday. That’s what Sarah Bond alluded to, touching on the alteration in the operating model:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There’s a difference between managing a network effect and maximizing the value of a single game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bloomberg then mentioned that Microsoft spends a whopping $1 billion a year bringing third-party games into the Game Pass ecosystem, which has been modelled recently as a ‘Play Anywhere’ system that transcends simple home consoles.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Game Pass was also a major adjustment for publishers. To sweeten the deal, Microsoft now spends $1 billion a year getting third-party games on the subscription service. </p>



<p>The largesse has been more than enough to win over small publishers, to whom it offers flat fees of millions of dollars upfront to include their titles, along with a portion of subscription revenue and <strong>the promise of exposure they couldn’t count on getting otherwise</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Owing to inflation, Game Pass has recently increased in price, and the games that take pole position in the library chop and change, but there’s no doubting the power it has as a subscription-based product. That notion is set to improve, too – next month, the first Call of Duty game will grace the service in the form of Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>It already incorporates titles from the Ubisoft Connect and EA Play services, making it a seriously stacked offering for gamers worldwide, and it’s getting better all the time. </p>



<p>Sarah Bond and the rest of the crew at Xbox have immense faith in the product, and with a seeming desire to move away from console gaming, it’s only a matter of time before a seamlessly connected Game Pass experience is the firm’s foremost focus.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ps5-palworld-version-has-been-removed-from-tgs-exhibitor-list/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-palworld-version-has-been-removed-from-tgs-exhibitor-list/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Palworld was set to be on the exhibitors list at the Tokyo Games Show, but it seems that they have now been removed from the list entirely. This choice possibly comes after Nintendo issued a lawsuit, saying that Palworld was infringing on multiple of Nintendo's patents. On the day that the lawsuit was issued, one of the developers tweeted out an emoji while they were at TGS (as stated in their name on X). Still, an <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/news16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official statement</a> has been released on the Palworld social media and the Pocketpair website.</p>
<p>According to Pocketpair, they are unaware of what patents they are currently infringing on and are now beginning legal proceedings and investigations into <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/">Nintendo's claims</a>. In their statement, they claim, "We have not been notified of such details."</p>
<p>Pocketpair is an indie game company based in Tokyo, and Palworld had a lot of hype before and after its release. The game has over 275,000 reviews on Steam, with a Very Positive review status on the title. Although most people assumed that the lawsuit would be copyright-related, with many of the Pals looking strikingly similar to the designs of Pokemon, their patents are causing the issue.</p>
<p>CESA released the exhibitors list from Tokyo Games Show 2024 on September 11, which was way before the lawsuit was publicly issued to Pocketpair. It was said that there was going to be a PS5 showcase of Palworld, but it was removed the same day it was announced. Pocketpair may still be showcasing Palworld regardless, and the list revealed by CESA was just incorrectly updated, or they were given the wrong details.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's likely that as a result of this lawsuit, either Pocketpair has made the conscious decision to remove themselves from the exhibitor list at TGS or the officials at TGS have removed them due to fear of unwanted attention or controversy by 'supporting' them. It's possible that Pocketpair will make a statement as to why they have been removed from the exhibitor list, but for now, it remains unknown.</p>
<p>If it were true that it was just a factual error, it's possible that their appearance or lack thereof at TGS has nothing to do with Nintendo's lawsuit. They could be there as visitors and nothing more.</p>
