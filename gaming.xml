            <p>In classic me fashion, I swanned off for a few days just as another graphics card fracas has spilled out into public view. At the centre this time is the previously unassuming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidias-rtx-5060-gpus-are-launching-soon-with-price-cuts-on-the-rtx-5060-ti">RTX 5060</a>, which you may have noticed is due for launch today yet only has a handful of "hands-on previews" to tell you how big of a graphics it does. Allegedly, that’s because Nvidia have been keeping hold of the drivers needed for full reviews, only providing them at the eleventh hour to press outlets that have previously run these previews. No preview? No review, at least until the drivers release publicly later today, and what's more, the same reports say that these previews were only offered under strict testing provisos set by Nvidia themselves.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-grants-rtx-5060-drivers-access-to-media-willing-to-publish-previews">VideoCardz</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtFDz-BQLew">Hardware Unboxed</a>, the mandated test conditions supposedly range from only allowing certain games for benchmarking – judging from the <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/pc-gaming/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-first-impressions">previews</a> <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/desktop-pc/i-spent-my-first-few-hours-with-the-rtx-5060-playing-doom-the-dark-ages-and-it-feels-pretty-slick-for-under-usd300/">currently</a> <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/i-tested-the-rtx-5060-is-8gb-of-vram-really-enough-in-2025">online</a>, these were <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> – to the more egregious demand that RTX 5060 performance figures would focus on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation</a> (MFG). And, in turn, would only be compared to results from older XX60 GPUs that lack DLSS frame gen support entirely.</p>

<p>"We worked with a few chosen media on previews with a pre-release driver," an Nvidia spokesperson told me this afternoon. No comment on the review driver situation, other than a 5pm BST release time, was given.</p>

<p>RPS was not invited to take part in these previews, and I can’t imagine agreeing to such terms if we were. Although it doesn’t appear that Nvidia required previewers to give positive RTX 5060 takes, with several highlighting the shortcomings of its 8GB VRAM limit, the limited game selection and emphasis on frame-genned performance versus the much older RTX 3060 and RTX 2060 Super are clearly intended to push a particular narrative: one that at best downplays the drawbacks of frame generation and at worst misleads readers with an unhelpfully narrow view of relative performance. GameStar, a German site that took Nvidia up on the offer, <a href="https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/geforce-rtx-5060-preview-benchmarks,3433080.html">said in their preview</a> that the GPU giant even specified the in-game settings that each game should be tested with.</p>
<p>The sense that a big, green thumb is pressing down on the critical scales is deepened by the alleged trading of earlier review drivers for a compliant preview. Even if, by that point, reviewers are free to use their own, independently-set benchmarks, the initial wave of RTX 5060 reviews will come from publications that Nvidia has – accurately or otherwise – deemed more friendly than others. Those who refused the locked-down previews, and have thus demonstrated less of a willingness to go along with the desired messaging, will be forced to wait before sharing impressions.</p>
<p>I can’t claim absolute moral superiority here because again, I wasn’t invited, and thus didn’t have the chance to send a "Thanks but no thanks" email (even I <em>hadn’t</em> simultaneously been too busy recovering from gin-assisted groomsman duty). Still, yeah, not a fan.</p>
<p>I have recently noticed Nvidia PRs becoming unusually pushy about how great it would be to test such and such frame generation in such and such game, but functionally those have only ever been suggestions, and I’ve never faced even a veiled hint at retribution for ignoring them in my reviews. Nonetheless, I now find myself in the bizarre position of having had physical possession of an RTX 5060 for nearly a week (posted by Zotac, with no strings attached other than to please not lose or break it), yet don’t have the software means to test or appraise it on the day of release. Like, man, at least Bethesda didn’t send us copies of Starfield while they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-starfield-review-is-going-to-be-a-little-late">withholding the activation keys</a>.</p>

<p>More disturbing still is that this isn’t even the only accusation of editorial manhandling to be laid at Nvidia’s feet today. Big-deal tech YooToobers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamersNexus">Gamers Nexus</a> claimed in a video (above) that Nvidia have, with varying levels of subtlety, threatened to cut off their interview access to Nvidia engineering staff in response to a perceived lack of focus on DLSS and MFG performance testing in their reviews. Gamers Nexus have, in fact, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nfEkuqNX4k">produced</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh1FHR9fkJk">multiple</a> long-form vids on these topics specifically.</p>
<p>It isn’t unheard of for, nor technically outside the rights of, companies to pick and choose who gets primo access for coverage. In tech media especially, there may even be a minor, ethically unbothersome quid-pro-quo involved: attending a virtual briefing, for instance, in exchange for getting onto the review list. But there’s a honking great difference between asking journalists to sit through a thirty-minute slideshow and, essentially, demanding editorial jurisdiction over how their products are evaluated. Nvidia, one of the richest, most powerful firms on Earth, should know better – and should have at least had an idea that being caught fiddling with the independent review process might cause more damage to the RTX 5060 than a few variations of "It’s not much faster than the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-review">4060</a>, is it?"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft have finally broken their silence over reports about the use of Azure and Microsoft generative AI tech by the Israeli military during the latter’s on-going invasion and bombardment of Gaza, which has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/15/statement-technology-israel-gaza/">unsigned statement published 15th May 2025</a>, Microsoft confirm that they have supplied technology to the Israeli armed forces during the assault on Gaza, which began following the killing and abduction of Israeli civilians on October 7th 2023. They contend, however, that their own internal reporting has found "no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza." The news comes a few weeks after the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">called on people to avoid Microsoft games and gaming services in protest</a> at the company’s dealings with the Israel Defense Forces.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to several investigations earlier this year, including <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/first-winner/2025/as-israel-uses-u-s-made-ai-models-in-war-concerns-arise-about-techs-role-in-who-lives-and-who-dies/">a sizeable February report from the Associated Press</a>, the IDF have made use of Microsoft’s generative AI services extensively for combat and intelligence activities since October 2023. This includes the alleged use of genAI models to analyse and prepare data for the purpose of targeting airstrikes. The AP investigation - which is based on interviews with current and former members of Microsoft and the Israeli armed forces, together with internal company data and documents - also discusses the Israeli military's relationship with other big tech companies, including Google, Amazon, Palantir, Cisco, and Oracle.</p>
<p>These reports have intensified fears among many Microsoft staff that their work is being used as an instrument of war and oppression. Back in May 2024, Microsoft workers <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/petition/">launched a petition</a>, "No Azure for Apartheid," demanding an independent audit for potential human rights violations. Microsoft leadership have taken a hard line with certain, more visible protests about the sale of Microsoft services to the Israeli military. In April this year, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-fire-employees-who-protested-the-sale-of-genai-tech-to-the-israeli-military">fired two people</a> who spoke out at company anniversary events.</p>
<p>Now, Microsoft are trying to reassure those who remain. In the blog post, Microsoft announce the completion of an internal review of claims that Microsoft technology has been used "to target civilians or cause harm in the conflict in Gaza," with "additional fact-finding" supplied by an external firm. The blog post comments that Microsoft’s supply of tech to the Israel Ministry of Defense is "structured as a standard commercial relationship," and is therefore subject to their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/ForOnlineServices/all">acceptable use policy</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/ai-code-of-conduct">AI Code of Conduct</a>, together with their overall <a href="https://msblogs.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/5/2025/05/Microsofts-Commitment-to-Human-Rights.pdf">commitment to human rights</a>. Microsoft say that, based on "both our internal assessments and external review," they’ve found no evidence that the Israeli armed forces have failed to comply with either document.</p>
<p>The blog also notes that military organisations "typically use their own proprietary software or applications from defense-related providers for the types of surveillance and operations that have been the subject of our employees’ questions." Microsoft, it says, have not created anything like this for the IMOD.</p>
<p>The blog adds, however, that Microsoft did provide the IMOD with "special access" to their technologies in the course of "limited emergency support to the Israeli government in the weeks following October 7, 2023, to help rescue hostages". Microsoft say they retained "significant oversight" during this period, "including approval of some requests and denial of others," so as "to help save the lives of hostages while also honoring the privacy and other rights of civilians in Gaza."</p>
<p>The post also caveats that Microsoft do not have full awareness of how the Israeli military may have used any Microsoft technology that runs on their own servers. "This is typically the case for on premise software," it argues. "Nor do we have visibility to the IMOD’s government cloud operations, which are supported through contracts with cloud providers other than Microsoft. By definition, our reviews do not cover these situations."</p>
<p>It’s an extremely brief response to a lengthy and disturbing series of claims, which expects the reader to take a lot on trust. The blog post does not include the full text of Microsoft’s internal and external assessments, nor does it respond to the detail of the allegations made by the Associated Press and other publications. It doesn’t even name the firm hired to carry out "additional fact-finding" for their review.</p>
<p>The No Azure for Apartheid movement have already called on Microsoft to release a full copy of their internal review. "It's very clear that their intention with this statement is not to actually address their worker concerns, but rather to make a PR stunt to whitewash their image that their relationship with the Israeli military has tarnished," former Microsoft worker Hossam Nasr argues in a statement, circulated by Israeli newspaper <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-05-17/ty-article/microsoft-says-it-provided-ai-to-israel-for-gaza-war-but-denies-use-to-harm-palestinians/00000196-dbd0-d9a9-a99e-fbd5a6f80000">Haaretz</a>.</p>
<p>Nasr and his colleague Abdo Mohamed were themselves <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/microsoft-workers-fired-gaza-vigil">fired by Microsoft</a> last year, after they helped organise a vigil at the company's headquarters for Palestinians killed in Gaza. They’ve since joined the BDS boycott on Xbox and Microsoft gaming products, which you can read more about on <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/boycott-microsofts-xbox">the official BDS site</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has commented on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>'s recent delay, confirming the push was less than six months, while he stressed that another delay is unlikely.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBlLUo11qWg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>, Zelnick said GTA 6's delay was "pretty short," amounting to "less than six months."</p><p>GTA 6's new release date is May 26, 2026. Six months prior to that is November 26, 2025. Rockstar never confirmed a specific GTA 6 release date, only stating that it would come out in Fall 2025. If the delay was less than six months, as Zelnick said, this suggests the company was originally eyeing a late-November or December release date for GTA 6. But of course, nothing is absolutely confirmed on that front.</p><p>Now that GTA 6 has a specific release date, Zelnick said it's unlikely that the game will be delayed again. "Generally, when we announce a date, we're able to hit that date," he said.</p><p>A delay for GTA 6 was always likely, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">every Rockstar game in the past 10+ years has been delayed.</a> It is indeed true that when Take-Two announces a specific date--not a vague release window--that the company sticks to its plans. That's not <em>always </em>true, though. GTA V's PS5 and Xbox Series X|S edition, for example, was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-delayed-to-march-2022-new-trailer-shown-at-playstation-showcase/1100-6496035/#:~:text=GTA%205%20On%20PS5%20And,Shown%20At%20PlayStation%20Showcase%20-%20GameSpot" data-ref-id="1100-6496035">given a November 11, 2021 release date before shifting to March 2022.</a></p><p>For GTA 6, Zelnick said Rockstar's ambition to create something truly special is an effort that takes time.</p><p>"Rockstar is trying to create the best thing anyone has ever seen in entertainment. Not just interactive entertainment. That's a tall order," he added.</p><h2>"I don't play video games"</h2><p>Also in the interview, Zelnick was asked if he's played GTA 6. He apparently has not, as the executive replied, "I'm not a gamer. I don't play video games."</p><p>Zelnick said he does share his opinions "pretty openly" about what he sees with regards to game designs and concepts. However, he said his job as Take-Two's CEO is to attract, motivate, and retain the video game industry's best talent, and then to "get out of their way."</p><p>In other Rockstar news, it's been reported that the studio may be working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">ports of GTA 4 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-feels-really-good-about-switch-2-amid-reports-of-rdr-2-port/1100-6531595/" data-ref-id="1100-6531595">Red Dead Redemption II for Switch 2.</a></p>

In a new interview with French magazine <a href="https://www.lefilmfrancais.com/index.php?option=com_papyrus&amp;view=recherche&amp;searchword=hideo+kojima"><em>Le Film Français</em></a>, Kojima said Physint is five to six years away from release.</p><p>This timeline isn’t too surprising – Kojima Productions’ next release is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> on June 26, and the studio is already developing its next game after that, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-new-game-called-od-with-jordan-peele">OD</a>, for Xbox. Assuming Kojima Productions has no other surprises, Kojima claimed last year that Physint's development would begin in earnest after the launch of Death Stranding 2 (likely up to bat after OD), so the five-to-six-year timeline makes sense.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WEpK67JDLu8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WEpK67JDLu8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“Besides Death Stranding 2, there is Physint in development. That will take me another five or six years. Maybe after that, I could finally decide to tackle a film,” Kojima told <em>Le Film Français</em> when asked about directing a movie, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-reveals-his-next-espionage-game-physint-is-5-6-years-away/"><em>Video Games Chronicle</em></a>.</p><p>Kojima also told the magazine he received many offers to direct a movie when <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/04/15/opinion-how-kojima-leaving-could-be-good-for-metal-gear.aspx?amp">he left Konami in 2015</a>. Considering how much Kojima loves films and the people behind them, seeing him direct one wouldn’t be surprising. Consider those extra-long Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding cutscenes practice for his directorial debut.</p><p>While waiting for Physint, check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/05/08/building-a-stronger-connection"><em>Game Informer’s</em> Death Stranding 2 hands-on preview</a>, and then read about how <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/05/08/how-death-stranding-2s-interactive-encyclopedia-helps-players-make-sense-of-the">Death Stranding 2’s interactive encyclopedia</a> helps players make sense of the lore.

			<p>Today, at Computex 2025, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-125-games-doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-update-june-more-dlss-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that NVIDIA DLSS 4 is now available in over 125 games and applications. Following the news, NVIDIA provided more details and trailers about upcoming games and existing PC games that are being updated to include DLSS 4 and other NVIDIA technologies.</p>
<p>Let's start with Portal with RTX, which was upgraded from DLSS 3.5 to the new version while also updating the Frame Generation and Ray Reconstruction models to the latest and greatest versions. Additionally, the game now supports <a href="https://wccftech.com/neural-radiance-cache-technique-aims-to-make-path-tracing-faster-on-nvidia-gpus-thanks-to-tensor-cores-and-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Radiance Cache</a>. Taking advantage of the neural shader's capabilities to leverage AI to infer a great many rays and bounces from a limited set of indirect lights, the performance is improved even further. The flagship GPU, the GeForce RTX 5090, runs Portal with RTX at 277 average frames per second with full ray tracing enabled, according to NVIDIA tests. The RTX 5080 registers 171.5 frames per second, while the RTX 5070Ti achieves 143.7 frames per second.</p>
<p><iframe title="Portal with RTX | Improved Performance with DLSS 4 &amp; NRC" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GyS3TtOC7hA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tomorrow, Saber Interactive will release Roadcraft, a rather unusual game where players will use construction machinery to restore sites damaged by various natural disasters. The game includes DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution (with the transformer AI model), and DLAA on day one. NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation can be enabled via the NVIDIA app overrides and will be added in-game soon. As seen in the trailer, Roadcraft runs at over 250 average frames per second with everything enabled on the RTX 5090.</p>
<p><iframe title="RoadCraft | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pXDtRgeXrvQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Two days later, 1047 Games will launch SplitGate 2's Open Beta, which also features integration of the whole DLSS 4 suite: Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex.</p>
<p>On the same day, the popular free-to-play melee-focused Battle Royale game NARAKA: Bladepoint will receive the <a href="https://wccftech.com/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously announced</a> path tracing update, greatly improving its visuals. The game already supported DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, but this update will also introduce Ray Reconstruction. In the NVIDIA trailer, the game runs at around 350 average frames per second with everything enabled.</p>
<p><iframe title="NARAKA: BLADEPOINT | Full Ray Tracing &amp; DLSS Ray Reconstruction Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ElOkr-bhS2E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On May 24, F1 25 launches <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-pc-specs-revealed-rtx-5080-for-path-tracing-at-1080p60fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with path tracing</a> and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and Reflex.</p>
<p>In early June, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-beta-impressions-desert-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune: Awakening</a> will be released with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation (which was not yet available in the recent beta), Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex. The NVIDIA trailer shows the game running at over 300 frames per second in some instances.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dune: Awakening | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XlYFajRAed0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The same technologies will be available in MindsEye, the single player triple-A action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-gets-june-10-release-date-pre-orders-and-new-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to launch on June 10</a>.</p>
<p>A week later, Remedy's <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-preview-hands-on-with-remedys-first-multiplayer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a> will make its debut with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, DLAA, Reflex, and path tracing. You can check out the new showcase below.</p>

<p>On July 24, the Soulslike action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-opens-pre-orders-and-shares-pc-specs-ahead-of-july-24-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> also comes out with the full set of NVIDIA DLSS technologies (though there's no ray tracing.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fFzo_o8mH8w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>inZOI, the new life simulation game released in early access by KRAFTON, will receive its DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation update in August.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, NVIDIA also demonstrated the Horizon 'clone' Light of Motiram running at over 400 frames per second with Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="LIGHT OF MOTIRAM | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PgFVQ8BezLg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, Crimson Desert will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Reflex, and ray traced effects. Kyungjoon Cho, Head of Game Engine System Division, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Crimson Desert represents a major step forward for Pearl Abyss in intense action and open world design. With NVIDIA's graphics technologies, we're ensuring that players experience and explore the continent of Pywel through high-quality graphics and smooth gameplay.</em></p>
<p>Keita Iida, Vice President of Developer Relations at NVIDIA, added:</p>
<p><em>Pearl Abyss has crafted a visually spectacular and deeply immersive experience with Crimson Desert. By integrating ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 4 and Reflex technologies, they're providing players with breathtaking visuals, lightning-fast responsiveness, and exceptional frame rates that bring the game world to life.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kojima-physint-five-six-years<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Physint&nbsp;</em>creator Hideo Kojima has indicated that it's going to be quite a while before we get to play his new take on the "espionage action" genre he helped to pioneer.</p>

<p>In an interview with French cinema magazine&nbsp;<em>Le Film Francais&nbsp;</em>(thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-reveals-his-next-espionage-game-physint-is-5-6-years-away/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Kojima talks about his love of film, and he also addresses the multiple video game projects he's currently working on.</p>

<p>As well as the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">set to launch in June</a>, Kojima also named&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>, which he says will "take [him] another five or six years" to make. He's previously stated that the production of the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-od-physint-strikes" rel="nofollow">heavily impacted by SAG strikes</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/physint-kojima-comments-billboard.jpg?itok=XIPMjIJH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/physint-kojima-comments-billboard.jpg?itok=DvhlVugs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hideo Kojima says he'd like to work on a movie after&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-next-generation-espionage-action-game" rel="nofollow">only revealed back in February last year</a>&nbsp;and that Kojima's games usually sport both high production values and a lot of polish, I don't think anyone was expecting to see&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>for at least the next few years. Still, knowing it's that far away is a touch disappointing.</p>

<p>After&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>are released, Kojima says he might like to try his hand at making a movie; he says he "grew up with cinema" and that he'd prefer to make a film "while still young" if he's going to do it at all.</p>

<p>As VGC points out, Kojima doesn't make any reference to&nbsp;<em>OD</em>, his <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-new-game-od-in-partnership-with-xbox-and-filmmaker-jordan-peele" rel="nofollow">collaboration with filmmaker Jordan Peele</a>, but since he's promoting the Sony-exclusive&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, that might not be so strange.&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>, too, was announced during a Sony event, so it may well be a PlayStation exclusive.</p>




<p>For the time being, though, Kojima will be focused on the release of&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-gold-kojima-daruma-doll" rel="nofollow">went gold earlier this month</a>, prompting the filling in of the second eye on Kojima's daruma doll.</p>

<p><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>arrives on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on June 26th.&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>&nbsp;will, if Kojima's estimates are correct, launch somewhere around 2030-2031, thus probably making it a PlayStation 6 title at this point. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has sounded off on increasing game prices, saying he questions why people are complaining about $80 games when that price is actually a "steal" in terms of what's being offered, at least for some games. He said this in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCTm-cxuYTQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Critical Hits Games</a>, stating that many products in regular life have gone up in price over the years, so it was only a matter of time before video games did as well.</p><p>"I think it was almost too late for the video game companies to start looking at the pricing structure," he said, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/former-playstation-exec-says-usd70-or-usd80-games-are-a-steal-as-long-as-people-choose-carefully-how-they-spend-their-money-i-dont-think-they-should-be-complaining/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>.</p><p>In the '90s, many new releases sold for $60 USD. Adjusted for inflation, that's around $80 today, which is the price that Nintendo and Xbox will charge for some games this year. Sony, for its part, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-could-get-more-expensive-as-sony-considers-plans-to-deal-with-tariff-impact/1100-6531526/" data-ref-id="1100-6531526">it might increase prices, too.</a></p><p>Not every game will become more expensive, though. Variable pricing in gaming has existed since the beginning, and it's going to continue into the future.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-remastered-announced-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microids has announced&nbsp;<em>Syberia Remastered</em>, a modernized remaster-slash-remake of the original point-and-click classic with revamped gameplay and improved visuals.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Syberia/status/1924150647177306347" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, Microids promises that the remaster will feature a "stunning visual overhaul", as well as "redesigned gameplay". It will, however, tell the "same unforgettable story" as the original, so don't worry; the plot details haven't been changed.</p>

<p>The remaster will see protagonist Kate Walker and her automaton companion Oscar exploring "carefully rebuilt" environments which use an art style that "stays true" to original creator Benoît Sokal's vision while also utilizing "beautifully enhanced 3D", according to Microids.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/microids-syberia-remastered-train.jpg?itok=-7uZ5USf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/microids-syberia-remastered-train.jpg?itok=4vGZpUCT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Syberia Remastered&nbsp;</em>​​​​​​brings gameplay and visual improvements to the 2002 adventure classic later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether or not that means the new game will feature pre-rendered environments in a similar way to the original isn't clear, but it does sound like Microids is overhauling the visual style completely, so perhaps you'll be able to explore a fully rendered version of Sokal's world this time around.</p>

<p>In keeping with modern design trends,&nbsp;<em>Syberia Remastered&nbsp;</em>will offer "a fresh take" on the original's puzzles, which have been "redesigned to provide a smoother and more intuitive experience".</p>

<p>Additionally, the remaster will feature a reworked UI, as well as "improved 3D navigation", so it should be a little easier to move Kate around her environment now; the slightly clunky movement of the original sounds as though it's been addressed, which is nice.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it's still the same tale of Kate's "legal assignment" that transforms into "a profound journey of self-discovery". If you love the original&nbsp;<em>Syberia</em>, it sounds very much like this is the remaster you've been waiting for.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/syberia-remastered-town.jpg?itok=YyeEGrOu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/syberia-remastered-town.jpg?itok=Z--j6_qQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Syberia</em>'s environments have been redesigned in full 3D, by the looks of things.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Syberia&nbsp;</em>series began all the way back in 1999 with first-person adventure&nbsp;<em>Amerzone</em>, so&nbsp;<em>Syberia&nbsp;</em>is technically the second game in the series, although it's the first to bear what would become the franchise's name.</p>

<p>A sequel followed in 2004, followed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-3-gets-release-date-and-revealing-trailer" rel="nofollow">another thirteen years later</a>. The latest game in the series,&nbsp;<em>Syberia: The World Before</em>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-world-before-release-date-set-for-march-2022" rel="nofollow">released in 2022</a>, and is the first to launch following Sokal's death in 2021 from a long-term illness.</p>

<p>With regards to the future of the series, it's not just&nbsp;<em>Syberia Remastered&nbsp;</em>you've got to look forward to; an animated series based on the franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-animated-series-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">is also in development</a>, although we don't know when it's arriving yet.</p>

<p><em>Syberia Remastered&nbsp;</em>launches sometime later this year for PC. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3660220/Syberia__Remastered/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it right now via Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/call-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-wz-ladra-attachments-1851781095<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the most interesting additions joining the fray in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 3 Reloaded </em>(what a mouthful!) is the Ladra submachine gun. It’s a fast-firing SMG reminiscent of the Tec-9. But with such a high rate of fire comes a lack of control, which we’ll aim to resolve with the right attachments. While I’m not the best player, I can hold my own, and I know how to build a loadout to suit my purposes, especially in CQB. As proof, I offer you a sweet Ladra loadout in <em>Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Warzone </em>that saw me achieve nearly 500 kills fast!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197562" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="197562,195618,195752" data-current="197562"><div><p>THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23086.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><hr><h2 id="h152348"><a id="1"></a>Best attachment choices for the Ladra</h2><figure id="" data-id="a5f118754e800fe7c008274999ebeb88" data-recommend-id="image://a5f118754e800fe7c008274999ebeb88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The attachment screen for the Ladra SMG in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The attachment screen for the Ladra SMG in Black Ops 6." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a5f118754e800fe7c008274999ebeb88" data-recommend-id="image://a5f118754e800fe7c008274999ebeb88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The attachment screen for the Ladra SMG in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>For the Ladra, which already features a high Mobility and Handling rating, we’re focusing on increasing its Firepower and Accuracy</strong>. The latter is nothing to scoff at on the base weapon, but the goal here is to create a laser beam that’s capable for short- and mid-range engagements.</p><p>As such, I chose the following attachments:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Optic</strong>: Remuda Mini Reflex</li><li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Muzzle Brake</li><li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li><li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Precision Foregrip</li><li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag I</li><li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Commando Grip</li><li><strong>Stock</strong>: Heavy Stock</li><li><strong>Laser</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs </li></ul><p>You can swap the Heavy Stock for the Combat Stock at will, and, as always, your choice of Optic. I chose the Mini Reflex for its accurate sight picture and small profile, allowing for easier target acquisition in and out of ADS.</p><h2 id="h152349"><a id="2"></a>Best perks for the Ladra</h2><figure id="" data-id="32ccca841b6872fd6c2f87f9d9745084" data-recommend-id="image://32ccca841b6872fd6c2f87f9d9745084" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The perk and equipment loadout screen for the Ladra in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The perk and equipment loadout screen for the Ladra in Black Ops 6." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32ccca841b6872fd6c2f87f9d9745084" data-recommend-id="image://32ccca841b6872fd6c2f87f9d9745084" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The perk and equipment loadout screen for the Ladra in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>With your attachments squared away, let’s focus on the rest of the build. The right equipment and perks for the Ladra can really turn the tide of a round. In this case, we’re opting for flash-and-awe tactics with the fast-firing and highly mobile SMG. With the Flashbang, you can blind an entire room and sweep and clear with a mag or two.</p><p><strong>As for the perks, we’re opting for abilities that allow us to move quickly and quietly across the map</strong>, while uncovering enemy whereabouts to get the drop on everyone.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Flashbang</li><li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li><li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: War Cry </li><li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ninja</li><li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Tracker</li><li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Vigilance</li><li><strong>Specialty</strong>: Recon</li><li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Gunfighter</li></ul><p>You’ll note I chose War Cry instead of the Assault Pack. Typically, for this type of weapon, I’d say the Assault Pack proves most useful to replace all of that rapidly depleting ammunition. But here, speed and momentum become paramount, and War Cry’s movement buff is key!</p><hr><p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>’s Season 3 Reloaded is available right now on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-dark-ages-chelsea-flower-show<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>and the Chelsea Flower Show might not be the most obvious crossover you can think of, but thanks to Xbox, Bethesda, and "leading bespoke firepit designers" The Firepit Company, it's becoming a reality tomorrow.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the medieval FPS will be getting a firepit display at the Chelsea Flower Show from May 20th to May 24th, thus "seamlessly blending the game's take on medieval stylings with cutting-edge craftsmanship".</p>

<p>The display will see several elaborately-designed firepit globes set among lush greenery, with the central firepit being built around the Doom Slayer himself and a number of other globes featuring designs of "intricate demons and elaborate adversaries" from&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-chelsea-flower-show-display.jpg?itok=ud_h9JOL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-chelsea-flower-show-display.jpg?itok=J-kYh9RF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>is getting, of all things, a Chelsea Flower Show display.</figcaption></figure><p>The centerpiece features not only the Doom Slayer, but also a number of "dark flowers", including dark variants of the likes of Zantedeschia, petunia, and Centaurea cyanus. You'll also find a pedestal with the Slayer's symbol carved into it.</p>

<p>Bethesda communications director Steve Merrett says it's "amazing" to see how&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>has been "adapted into a centerpiece worthy of any outdoor area", while The Firepit Company's Jason Andre describes the display as "iconic" and a "pleasure" to work on.</p>

<p>If you want to see the displays, you'll be able to do so in London <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">between May 20th and 24th</a>, although tickets <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show/ticket-options" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">aren't cheap</a>&nbsp;and are limited in availability at time of writing.</p>




<p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>franchise, and the third game in the reboot series, which began with 2016's straightforwardly-titled&nbsp;<em>Doom</em>.</p>

<p>A prequel to that game,&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>sees the Doom Slayer battling back the forces of Hell in order to save humanity. It introduces a number of new weapons and combat mechanics to the series, including parrying, a throwable shield that can also be used to block projectiles, and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3017860/DOOM_The_Dark_Ages/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/doom-the-dark-ages" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-new-ultra-plus-mod-allows-users-to-push-graphics-settings-further-introduces-4k-resolution-cutscenes.1192785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ultra-plus-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 mod now available online introduces plenty of visual improvements to the game developed by Sandfall Interactive.</p>
<p>The new Ultra Plus mod, which was developed by Lazorr and can be downloaded from Nexus Mods, introduces plenty of visual improvements by fixing some visual issues as well as visual settings that can be pushed past those available in the vanilla game. Besides the improvements to Global Illumination, Shadows, Reflections, Shading, View Distance, and Texture Quality, the mod also introduces upscaled 4K resolution prerendered cutscenes, which look amazing. Unfortunately, the modder has released no comparison screenshots, though <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODM3">some</a> shared by Nexus Mods users <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODM4">show</a> how the mod can bring <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODM5">considerable</a> visual <a href="https://imgsli.com/Mzc5ODQw">improvements.</a></p>
<p>Even in its vanilla state, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a role-playing game that is more than worth experiencing for all fans of the genre. With its unique twists to classic turn-based combat, a beautiful and unique world, a compelling cast, and a moving, thought-provoking story, the game developed by Sandfall Interactive is undoubtedly one of the best RPGs of the current generation, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, the game is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

<p>The most recent episode of The Last of Us season two just aired, and in the opening moments viewers are soon introduced to a character not seen in the games: Joel's father.</p>
<p>Played by Tony Dalton, whose name you may recognise from his portrayal of Lalo Salamanca in Breaking Bad spin-off Better Call Saul, Javier Miller is a police officer in Austin during the 80s. He is revealed to have violent tendencies towards his two sons, Joel and Tommy, having previously also been beaten by his own father.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://ew.com/the-last-of-us-tony-dalton-joel-dad-javier-miller-11737057">EW</a> following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-six-recaptures-some-much-needed-levity-but-with-only-one-episode-left-have-the-showrunners-bitten-off-more-than-they-can-chew">the sixth episode's debut this morning</a>, The Last of Us creator and series showrunner Neil Druckmann said Dalton was his "first choice" to play Joel's father, jokingly adding the actor was "the most charming, threatening man" he had ever seen on television. Druckmann specifically highlighted his performance in Better Call Saul.</p>
<p>Thankfully for Druckmann, it was not a case of 'don't meet your heroes' with Dalton, and the Naughty Dog head was so pleased with the actor's work on The Last of Us TV series he went on to cast him in Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>
<p>"He immediately came to mind," Druckmann told the publication of Dalton's unspecified role in the upcoming game. "I just offered it to him on the spot."</p> <div>

<p>Along with Dalton, actress <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion">Tati Gabrielle will also star in Naughty Dog's upcoming sci-fi project for PlayStation 5</a>.

            <p>"What morbid force is calling you deeper into the heart of the caves?" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3004390/The_Cave_Diver/">asks the Steam page for The Cave Diver</a>. It ain't calling me, developer Ovsko. I read the opening words of your description and immediately started running away from my laptop. I'm still running, in fact. This article is being breathlessly dictated to Oisin over the phone. I'm somewhere in the vicinity of Luton, now, and hope to make it all the way to Scotland by the weekend.</p>
<p>After that, there'll be the problem of securing naval travel as I continue my headlong flight. Then I'll have to worry about frostbite as I gallop past the North Pole and begin my long traversal of the Pacific. At some point I will reach New Zealand, which - according to this handy <a href="https://www.antipodesmap.com/">antipodal mapping site</a> - is approximately as far away from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-cave-diver">The Cave Diver</a> Steam page currently loaded on my laptop as I can get without venturing into outer space. I do not rule out venturing into outer space, which is notable for its complete and categorical deficit of caves.</p><!--more-->
<p>Perhaps you think I'm being hysterical. Friend, The Cave Diver is about perishing repeatedly in crawlspaces a few inches wide, deep below the surface. It's a game based on <a href="https://x.com/LostMemeArchive/status/1896898262399168898">that awful cutaway image</a> you've doubtless seen and flinched away from on social media. And also, beloved lunchbreak physics diversion <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/qwop">QWOP</a>. What kind of vile intellect turns QWOP into... <em>this</em>? I guess there's nothing for it but to roll the trailer.</p>

<p>The premise here is that you're trying to find a possibly-mythical subterranean flower that has the ability to cure your paraplegia. You move using your hands and arms and, where called for, the element of momentum. You can also scrawl signs on the rock to navigate by during your next attempt, in the quite likely event that you die. The threat of being crushed or trapped aside, the depths harbour some kind of ancient, ravenous evil. Going by the logo art, The Oesophagus Diver would have been an acceptable alternative title.</p>
<p>It's out later this year. With any luck, I'll have reached New Zealand by then and reinvented myself as a travelling hairdryer salesman who still dreams of being an astronaut. It wouldn't be the first time. If you have a grotesque fascination with caves - which to be honest, I sort of do, as long as I can stand up in them - you might also enjoy free 20-minute spookelunker <a href="https://sole-rift.itch.io/crawl">Crawl</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Despite the best efforts of all concerned, there are once again new PC games this week. See how they frolic among the days ahead, trampling all over our life commitments and need for tranquility like boisterous, fugitive oxen. Please equip yourself with a broom, weighted net and klaxon and help me herd them back into the pens, for proper disassembly. Here are a few I've rounded up already.</p>
<h2>Monday 19th May</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3546740/Champions_Tactics_Reforged/">Champions Tactics Reforged</a> may yet prove a routine turn-based PvP battler, but it does have exceptionally handsome tabletop figurines. The kind of thing I wish I'd been able to paint back when I played Mordheim.</li>
<h2>Tuesday 20th May</h2>
<li>Here be some "Enhanced" editions of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2427410/STALKER_Shadow_of_Chornobyl__Enhanced_Edition/">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow Of Chornobyl</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2427420/STALKER_Clear_Sky__Enhanced_Edition/">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2427430/STALKER_Call_of_Prypiat__Enhanced_Edition/">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call Of Prypiat</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-siege-and-the-sandfox">The Siege and the Sandfox</a> is a sidescrolling stealth metroidvania affair with some moderately bewitching pixelart visuals.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jumping-jazz-cats">Jumping Jazz Cats</a> is a feline racing game, if such a thing can be credited.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1466390/Kathy_Rain_2_Soothsayer/">Kathy Rain 2: Soothsayer</a> is a private-eyeful of point-and-click, involving a serial killer and a biker detective.</li>
<h2>Wednesday 21st May</h2>
<li> Twoot twoot! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-train-2">Monster Train 2</a> is pulling up to the station with another confusing payload of tower defence and roguelite deck-building.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/">FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> is one for the Animal Crossers and Zeldarlings, a "slow life" RPG about doing up a neglected island and/or fighting monsters in the surrounding open world.</li>
<h2>Thursday 22nd May</h2>
<li>Break the traditional construction grid in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265070/City_Tales__Medieval_Era/">City Tales - Medieval Era</a>, out this day in early access.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deliver-at-all-costs">Deliver At All Costs</a> is about barging through a 1950s toy-town in the style of a GTA game. I played about 40 minutes at an event last year and found it a bit shrugworthy, but the scenery is nice.</li>
<li>Sure, go on then - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown">a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles tactics RPG</a> from Clickolding and I Am Your Beast outfit Strange Scaffold.</li>
<h2>Friday 23rd May</h2>
<li>Did you miss the original Onimusha 2? It's back with new controls and gossamer HD visuals in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny">Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/9-kings">9 Kings</a> is about using cards to build kingdoms, and hurling rocks at armies.</li>
<li>Let's make it two detective game reccs this week. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2714620/Duck_Detective_The_Ghost_of_Glamping/">Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping</a> asks you to "throw bread to the fine beak of lady justice". Commendable!</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the denizens of the Treehouse up to this week? Well, James has been making forbidding noises about Computex 2025, the latest appalling rebirth of the Taipei, Taiwan-based tech show. Expect a few headlines with unpronounceable acronyms in them, and probably a lot of unreportable guff about genAI. Speaking of events: I'm attending Summer Games Fest for RPS in a couple of weeks, so I'm trying to clear out a few features before I'm deluged in fresh interview material.</p>
<p>Nic and Brendy are juggling various review commitments, like brilliant hell jesters on unicycles. Graham is forming terrible plans and chewing his way through another stack of freelance edits. Ollie continues his quest to write a complete instruction manual for all of existence, aka our guides section, and Jeremy is still blissfully on holiday. What are you up to this week? Playing anything fun?</p>
