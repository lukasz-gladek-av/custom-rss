                <p>Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann revealed some more narrative details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" data-ref-id="5000-654981">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> in Creator to Creator discussion with Civil War director Alex Garland.</p><p>The studio behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection/" data-ref-id="5000-537795">Uncharted</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us/" data-ref-id="5000-125470">The Last of Us</a> revealed Intergalactic, a brand new sci-fi game meant to kickstart a franchise, at The Game Awards 2024. That announcement trailer revealed a fair bit about Intergalactic's premise, namely that it follows a bounty hunter who gets standard on the distant planet of Sempiria. Ahead of season 2 of the popular The Last of Us TV show, Druckmann appeared on Sony's Creators to Creators podcast for a discussion with film director Alex Garland, who is promoting the upcoming film 28 Years Later. Toward the end of the conversation, Druckmann revealed more about the universe Intergalactic is set in and Naughty Dog's goals with the project.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iJUab499PVA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Druckmann highlights that Intergalactic will be "a game about faith and religion" and is set around 2000 years in the future in a universe that diverged from our own in the 1980s. He reveals that Naughty Dog has created 2000 years of history for the religion of Sempiria, which has been cut off from communication with the rest of the galaxy for the last 600 years prior to the start of the game. He also explained how Naughty Dog wants players to feel lonely and lost in a place whose people and history are mysterious to them.</p><p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is in development for PS5 but does not have a release window at this time. Druckmann admits that the Naughty Dog "still have a ways to go" in developing the game and he doesn't have a clear idea of the final form Intergalactic will take just yet, so don't expect it to release soon.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Sony is testing out new AI software, and it's using a beloved character--Aloy from the Horizon series--to show it off.</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-RJ7O9Tqf4">YouTube video</a> narrated by Sharwin Raghoebardajal--a software engineering director at Sony Interactive Entertainment who focuses on gaming tech, AI, and face technology for the Advanced Technology Group within Sony's PlayStation Studios--appeared online last week, giving players a look at an AI-ified version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn/">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west/">Horizon Forbidden West</a>'s main character, Aloy.</p><p dir="ltr">Raghoebardajal verbally interacts with Aloy throughout the video, starting off by greeting her and asking how she's been doing.</p><p dir="ltr">"Hello, I'm managing alright," AI-Aloy replies flatly. "Just dealing with a sore throat. How have you been?"</p><p dir="ltr">Raghoebardajal then proceeds to ask Aloy if she's willing to discuss events that have taken place in the Horizon franchise, like her search for her mother.</p><p dir="ltr">"Certainly," Aloy says, replying to Raghoebardajal's request for info with all the well-acted intonation of a TikTok text-to-speech video. "I discovered I'm a clone of Dr. Elizabeth Sobeck, which allowed me to understand my purpose and origins."</p><p dir="ltr">When asked what it's like to be a clone, Aloy replies with nightmare-inducing mouth animations, saying, "Being a clone feels unique, connecting me to the past while allowing me to create my own path and future."</p><p dir="ltr">Eventually, Raghoebardajal requests that Aloy take him into the game world.</p><p dir="ltr">"Sure, we'll transition to the game world now, get ready for the adventure ahead," Aloy replies in a tone so un-emotive it's rather hard to believe any sort of adventure awaits.</p><p dir="ltr">The screen goes black, then transitions to Horizon Forbidden West. Raghoebardajal continues communicating with Aloy in-game, asking her where they are. Using the same expressionless tone she's used for the entire video, Aloy explains that they're at The Scalding Spear, a large settlement near Arrowhand.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Raghoebardajal, AI is being used for Aloy's facial animations, verbal responses, and her voice itself. Notably, the Aloy in this demonstration sounds nothing like Aloy's real-life voice actress, Ashly Burch, who voiced the character in both games. Burch hasn't commented publicly on the demonstration, but has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ashlyburch/p/Cw-q5DNx7Yw/" rel="nofollow ">historically supported protections against AI</a> for voice actors in video games.</p><p dir="ltr">As this article was being written, the video was removed from YouTube via a copyright strike filed by Muso TNT Ltd., a company that focuses on content protection and anti-piracy efforts in the entertainment industry. The company recently rebranded, and is now known simply as Muso. It's unclear why the video was taken down or if the footage had been leaked and uploaded by a channel not associated with Sony or Raghoebardajal.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the video has been removed, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge managed to capture a gif</a> of what the demo looked like in action.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is just a glimpse of what is possible," Raghoebardajal said of Aloy's AI demonstration.</p>

Mario has cleaned up an island with a sentient hose, launched himself through the stars alongside Rosalina, and possessed innocent bystanders with the help of a living hat. Itâs Mario Day (March 10), so what better time than now to look back at years of <em>Super Mario </em>history and determine the best and worst part of each of our second-favorite Italian plumberâs adventures. (He gets second place because Luigi will always be #1 in our hearts.)</p><p><em>This piece was originally published on April 20, 2023. We are re-publishing it today with the addition of Super Mario Bros. Wonder for </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-bundle-mario-day-sale-mk8-odyssey-wonder-1851768159&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-bundle-mario-day-sale-mk8-odyssey-wonder-1851768159"><em>Mar10 Day 2025</em></a></span><em>.</em></p></div></div><div><p><strong>Best: That Iconic Mario Movement </strong></p><p>Itâs really tough to single out one thing about the original <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>that stands out as its best aspect. It was a triumph on so many levels: unforgettable music, distinctive character design, and the best platforming levels the nascent genre had yet seen, just to name a few. But none of that would have mattered if just running and jumping as Mario through all those treacherous environments and making those Hail-Mary leaps over Bowser at the end of each castle didnât feel so damn good. Today, of course, playing as Mario doesnât feel particularly remarkable, but thatâs just because Nintendo knocked it out of the park in designing his movement, creating something that immediately felt so intuitive, natural, and amazing that games have been building on it ever since.</p><p><strong>Worst: The Water Levels </strong></p><p>Look, I appreciate that Nintendo wanted to change up the action as you traversed the Mushroom Kingdom, so I can totally forgive the presence of <em>Super Mario Bros</em>.â water levels. But in a game that was revolutionary in part because of just how good the movement feels, these stages, in which you sluggishly try to avoid swimming straight into a slow-moving Blooper or Cheep Cheep, really deflate the momentum. Swimming stages have continued to be a staple of Marioâs adventures, of course, but Nintendo would tweak the movement to make them less of a drag. By <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>, you already felt like you had more control underwater, and if you scored one of those snazzy frog suits, you were really in business.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-bowser-jack-black-peaches-song-1850344353&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-bowser-jack-black-peaches-song-1850344353">Fans Think Jack Blackâs Bowser May Have Rickrolled Us All With âPeachesâ Song</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Best: The Four Playable Characters</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Mario had to share the spotlight for the first time in this oddball sequel, and the distinctive abilities of each of his playable companions added a lot to the fun. Toadâs strength and speed and Peachâs float are cool, of course, but my favorite has always been Luigi with his floaty jump and its adorable animation. Thatâs my Mario brother right there! Notably, this is the first time that Luigi was depicted as taller and skinnier than his brother, rather than simply being a palette swap like he was in <em>Mario Bros.</em>,<em> Super Mario Bros.</em>, and the Japanese version of <em>Super Mario Bros. 2.</em></p><p><strong>Worst: Sub-space </strong></p><p><em>SMB2 </em>has this thing called Sub-space, a dark alternate dimension that you access with the potions you occasionally find. If you happen to enter at the right spot, youâll score a mushroom for your trouble, but unless youâve previously memorized where those lucky spots are, youâll likely waste a potion and come up empty. Secrets and discovery are a great part of <em>Mario</em> games and have been ever since we first had our mind blown by warp zones in the original, but this trial-and-error method of hunting down helpful items wasnât fun or rewarding.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-nintendo-box-office-jack-black-1850343976&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-nintendo-box-office-jack-black-1850343976"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> Expected To Pass $1 Billion, Biggest Movie Release This Year</a></span></p></div><div><div><p><strong>Best: Giant Land</strong></p><p>Like the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, this sequel is such a work of genius, a product of the creative team firing on all cylinders, that itâs extremely difficult to point to one thing as the stand-out feature. But if thereâs one aspect thatâs particularly indicative of the gameâs excellence for me, itâs Giant Land, the gameâs fourth world, in which everything is super-sized: huge goombas, koopas, blocks, and piranha plants totally shake up your sense of scale. But again, itâs not really Giant Land in isolation that makes <em>Super Mario Bros. 3 </em>so great. Itâs just one instance of the inventiveness with which the creative team approached making this game, with each of its realms feeling like a distinctively different step of your epic journey into the heart of Bowserâs territory.</p></div><p><strong>Worst: All those autoscrollers</strong></p><p>Bowserâs airships have a real sense of drama to them. They suggest that Bowser isnât some flailing, impotent baddie and that heâs got real military might, an empire at his disposal. But the way in which the screen scrolls at its own pace through these stages, often more slowly than you might want to yourself, feels constraining in a game that, like the original, is at its best when youâre enjoying remarkable freedom of movement. And then, just as youâre approaching the gameâs climax, youâre hit with several more autoscrollers in Bowserâs world, as you face his tank fleet, his navy, his flotilla of little airships, and then another group of tanks before finally entering the challenging final castle. I appreciate the effort to make Bowser feel formidable, but these stages needlessly prevent you from speeding through, making them both a late-game drag and the bane of speedrunners everywhere.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/chris-pratt-super-mario-bros-movie-voice-soprano-jersey-1850319120&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/chris-pratt-super-mario-bros-movie-voice-soprano-jersey-1850319120">Chris Prattâs OG Voice In <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> Was Too âNew Jerseyâ</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Best: Yoshi</strong></p><p><em>Super Mario World </em>is when Nintendo finally introduced Marioâs dinosaur companion Yoshi, who our hero gets to ride around throughout the game. He rules because he can just eat enemies Mario would have to stomp or throw a well-timed fireball at. Then, when he eats certain koopa shells, he gets powers like flight, earthquake stomps, and three-way fireballs. We love a multi-talented king, and he deserves to be the star of his own game. Which he was in the next one.</p><p><strong>Worst: Lost some flavor</strong></p><p><em>Super Mario World</em> portended Nintendoâs general approach to sequels on its new, 16-bit system: refine, refine, and refine some more. This resulted in countless memorable classics, but was not without drawbacks. One reason some people prefer <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> over its sequel is that <em>Super Mario World</em> filed off so many rough edges it may have lost some of its âflavor.â The movement physics feel less weighty, the various landsâ themes are a bit mundane and donât do much to inform the level designs (what makes a level designâ¦chocolate?), and overall the game is just too easy. (That said, fans who create custom levels have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/it-took-three-years-to-beat-the-hardest-super-mario-wor-1687517377&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/it-took-three-years-to-beat-the-hardest-super-mario-wor-1687517377">addressed that last point quite thoroughly</a></span>.)</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-super-mario-bros-movie-2023-easter-eggs-credits-1850307140&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-super-mario-bros-movie-2023-easter-eggs-credits-1850307140">14 Of The Best And Most Obscure Secrets We Spotted In <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Best: Throwing eggs at shit</strong></p><p>As the title suggests, the star of <em>Yoshiâs Island </em>is none other than the green dino himself. Because Yoshi isnât playing second fiddle to Mario, the second <em>Super Mario World </em>game builds around him, and he gets a whole new set of abilities he didnât have before. This includes being able to change enemies into eggs, which follow you in a single-file line until you decide to hurl them. This factors into combat, puzzle solving, and coin collection as you throw your spawn into places you canât reach. Who among us doesnât want to throw eggs at our enemies without consequence?</p><p><strong>Worst: Saving that damn baby</strong></p><p>In <em>Yoshiâs Island</em>, our egg-wielding hero is tasked with delivering baby Mario across the Mushroom Kingdom. Every time youâre hit by an enemy, the baby will float away in a bubble, along with all his hopes and dreams of becoming a moderately successful plumber in adulthood. So every time you get hit by a stray koopa shell, you have to chase after Mario before he floats too far away. Sure, itâs better than dying in one hit, but then the baby starts crying up a racket and you start to doubt the life decisions that led to this dangerous babysitting gig. </p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-64-bowsers-castle-speedrun-skip-world-record-1850313563&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-64-bowsers-castle-speedrun-skip-world-record-1850313563"><em>Mario Kart </em>Players Land Groundbreaking Trick After 27 Years</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Best: The jump to 3D was a cultural reset</strong></p><p><em>Super Mario 64</em>âs transition from 2D sidescroller to 3D platformer was a capital-M Moment for video games. Nowadays we rarely see many consoles have a âkiller appâ that sells you on everything a system is about, but <em>Super Mario 64</em> did just that in 1996 when it launched alongside the Nintendo 64. It proved popular 2D games like the <em>Super Mario </em>series could exist in 3D spaces and transcend previous technical limitations. Though the Nintendo 64 conceded market dominance to the original PlayStation by the end of its lifecycle, the system still stands tall as a symbol of Nintendoâs ability to adapt old structures into new ideas and <em>Super Mario 64</em> is a key part to that.</p><p><strong>Worst: But by todayâs standards, it can feel pretty rough</strong></p><p>But like some influential games, <em>Super Mario 64 </em>does feel a bit sluggish compared to everything it helped pave the way for. Even by 1996 standards the N64 juggernaut has a troublesome camera, and Mario doesnât move with a lot of the same precision he does now, though a lot of that could be attributed to the systemâs controller, which was the companyâs first foray into analog stick control. A lot of these issues were improved upon in the <em>Super Mario 64 DS </em>remake, which served as a technical showcase for that handheld the same way the original did for N64, but this is the way of things when something truly special is iterated on. Take it easy, old timer, the future games will take it from here.</p><p><strong>Watch More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-truff-collectible-pack-hot-sauce-1850320046&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-truff-collectible-pack-hot-sauce-1850320046">We Taste-Tested The Super Mario Bros. Movie Hot Sauces</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Best: Bowser Jr. </strong></p><p>Some might say Bowserâs son is the Scrappy Doo of the <em>Super Mario </em>universe and that weâd be better off without him, but I say, âThose people are wrong and should be thrown in Bowserâs dungeon.â This guy frames Mario and gets him thrown into jail and forced to do community service. Thatâs already more hardcore than anything his fatherâs ever pulled off. Heâs also super cute, a talented artist, and a villain in his own right. And meta aside, heâs fun as hell to play in <em>Super Smash Bros</em>. Thank you <em>Sunshine </em>for bringing this good boy into the world.</p><p><strong>Worst: Needed more TLC</strong></p><p><em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> felt strangely unpolished for a new <em>Super Mario</em> game. There are lots of glitches, random difficulty spikes, and just a surprising number of rough edges in general. Even the F.L.U.D.D. jetpack system is a little clunky at times. One bit that really symbolizes <em>Sunshine</em>âs inchoateness is its infamous pachinko level, in which Marioâs launched into a giant pachinko machine to gather red coins without falling to his death out of the bottom. Sounds fun! And it couldâve been with more iteration, but the levelâs unreliable, quarrelsome physics and unavoidable-feeling deaths remind us that even Nintendo has to work really hard to make these games feel as effortlessly perfect as they often do.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-review-chris-pratt-jack-black-1850309488&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-review-chris-pratt-jack-black-1850309488"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> Feels Like It Was Designed In A Lab</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Best: Revitalized the seriesâ 2D rollout</strong></p><p>When the first <em>New Super Mario Bros. </em>game launched in 2006, the series hadnât seen a new 2D side-scroller since <em>Super Mario World 2: Yoshiâs Island</em>, and you didnât even play as Mario in that one. The âNewâ in the <em>New Super Mario Bros</em>. title positioned it as a resurgence of the classic <em>Mario </em>formula, which came as a welcome surprise because people were missing that style of game by then. In the years since, âNew Super Mario Bros.â<em> </em>has become the default branding for games of this style.</p><p>Itâs now been several years since weâve had a new <em>Mario </em>side-scroller. We have all these questions about a possible 3D game after <em>Odyssey</em>, but itâs been 11 years since <em>New Super Mario Bros. U</em>. So maybe itâs also time we got a new <em>New Super Mario Bros</em>.</p><p><strong>Worst: They all kinda blend together</strong></p><p>While each <em>New Super Mario Bros. </em>game has distinguishing factors, like <em>New Super Mario Bros. U</em>âs Boost Mode that lets someone use the Wii U GamePad to interact with the environment, the series broadly lacks the same innovation we see in 3D <em>Mario </em>games. Theyâre solid, clearly meant to be evocative of classic game design, and can be fun to play with friends. But thereâs a reason the <em>New Super Mario Bros</em>. games arenât talked about with the same breathless fervor of <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> or <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>. Theyâre fine! Theyâre good! But thatâs all they really are. Hopefully that changes somewhere down the line and we can see side-scrolling <em>Mario</em> games innovate in the way they did before.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bowser-jack-black-peaches-streaming-mario-bros-movie-1850307871&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bowser-jack-black-peaches-streaming-mario-bros-movie-1850307871"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> Makes Bowser Kinda Pathetic, And Itâs Great</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Best: The level design</strong></p><p>Because <em>Super Mario Galaxy </em>takes place in space with Mario jumping and running around different tiny planets, Nintendo was able to play with level design in a way that felt truly special a decade removed from <em>Super Mario 64</em>. On top of some excellent Mario platforming, <em>Galaxy </em>brought new layers to getting around that gave both Nintendo and players new space to play in. Now, rather than just considering âcan I make this jump,â there are scenarios in which the gravitational pull of a small planet creates some really clever design moments. It might not have had the same cultural impact as <em>Super Mario 64</em>, but <em>Galaxy</em> was still a pretty innovative spin on the formula.</p><p><strong>Worst: The Wii Remote waggle</strong></p><p><em>Super Mario Galaxy </em>is a game I sometimes have trouble finding fault in, and even this point I donât have too much of an issue with it because itâs such a small thing in an otherwise stellar game. The Wiiâs motion controls can either feel baked into a gameâs core, or bolted onto it out of obligation, and <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>âs definite feels like the latter. The Wii Remote is used to gather items by pointing at them and is utilized in some levels to deal with obstacles. The motion controls do ultimately feel unnecessary, but that didnât stop Nintendo from trying to emulate them in the Switch port.</p><p><strong>Watch More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-super-mario-bros-movie-little-italy-nintendo-1850305248&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-super-mario-bros-movie-little-italy-nintendo-1850305248">Actual Italians Tell Us What They Think About <em>Super Mario</em></a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Best: Four-player co-op</strong></p><p>Between <em>Mario Party </em>and <em>Mario Kart</em>, the series has never been lacking in multiplayer experiences, but there hadnât been one in a 3D platformer before <em>Super Mario 3D World</em> hit the Wii U in 2013. Up to four players can band together as Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad to jump through some exceptionally polished <em>Super Mario </em>levels. It captures the chaos of <em>New Super Mario Bros.

Choose your coop partners carefully, friends, as they will color your <em>3D World </em>experience.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-seth-rogen-donkey-kong-voice-1850293751&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-seth-rogen-donkey-kong-voice-1850293751"><em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> Fans Knock Seth Rogen For Barely Trying</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Best: âJump Up Super Star!â</strong></p><p>Yes, yes, <em>Super Mario Odyssey </em>is a joyful platformer with a lot of excellent game design to back up its hype. But when we talk about the best part of the Switch game, itâs clearly the song âJump Up Super Star!â Featuring Paulineâs soaring vocals (as portrayed by Kate Higgins), the jazzy track serves as the backdrop for one of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>âs<em> </em>best levels. Itâs a swinging certified banger that perfectly encapsulates the joy of <em>Super Mario </em>games with a catchy hook and a ton of swagger. Sucks that Nintendo wonât put it on streaming services.</p><p><strong>Worst: The moral conundrum of possessing the innocent</strong></p><p>One of the main conceits of <em>Super Mario Odyssey </em>is that Mario has a living hat companion named Cappy. Throwing the hat onto certain enemies, objects, and even human beings allows Mario to make them do his bidding. Sure, the game doesnât sit with the implications of that very long, but you do. A wise man once asked in a since-deleted tweet what would happen if Mario were to throw his hat onto the head of a pregnant person. Does the plumber control not only the parent, but the unborn child, as well? I saw that question asked six years ago and have not been able to look at Cappy the same way since. And now, neither will you. </p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-super-mario-bros-best-ranked-odyssey-1850286446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-super-mario-bros-best-ranked-odyssey-1850286446">Every <em>Super Mario</em> Game Ranked From Worst To Best</a></span></p></div><div><p><strong>Best: The Wonder Flower</strong></p><p>Most levels in <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>have multiple paths to the ending thanks to the Wonder Flower. This new power-up triggers a Wonder Effect, which shifts the level entirely in varied and unpredictable ways. In one stage, it might conjure bubbles from the ground that can send Mario and friends bouncing above (or, if youâre not careful, into) hazards, sparing you the need to arduously trek through the environment, while in the next, it may turn the stage into an auto-scrolling musical. Some can make you feel like youâre in a whole new level entirely, like one that launches Mario into space, allowing you to float through zero gravity over the original terrain. You never know quite what youâre going to get, and seeking them out makes each level worth replaying.</p><p><strong>Worst: Repetitive bosses</strong></p><p><br>Itâs nothing new for a <em>Mario </em>game to make you face the same boss or bosses multiple times throughout your journey; in fact, this trend dates back to the original <em>Super Mario Bros</em>.However, it sticks out a bit more in <em>Wonder </em>when mechanics like the Wonder Flower are constantly shaking things up. You fight Bowser Jr. four times in the main quest and while Marioâs strategy changes depending on what power-ups you have at your disposal, the little koopaâs doing the same withdraw-and-spin maneuver throughout. Different villains sprout up in between those encounters, but <em>Wonder</em>âs boss runs can feel monotonous when the same angry kid keeps popping up. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/spongebob-secret-lair-brings-iconic-cartoon-to-magic-gathering<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced a new Secret Lair for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. It isn't a retro-throwback like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-pixel-perfect-secret-lair-brings-retro-vibes-to-table" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pixel Perfect</a> or a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-secret-lair-chaos-vault-previews-psychedelic-land-cards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chaos Vault</a> drop. No, this is a <em>Spongebob</em> Secret Lair, bringing one of the most iconic cartoon characters in the world to the popular card game.</p>

<h2>The <em>Spongebob</em> Secret Lair Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://collider.com/spongebob-magic-the-gathering-special-secret-lair-images/" rel="nofollow">Collider</a>, the Spongebob Secret Lair will be broken up into three different drops. Each of these drops will be available for purchase on March 24 in both non-foil (MSRP $29.99) and foil (MSRP $ 39.99) bundles respectively.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spongebob-secret-lair-legendary-creature-card-artwork.jpg?itok=cvseAXMU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spongebob-secret-lair-legendary-creature-card-artwork.jpg?itok=yacf3Owk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these drops, aptly titled <em>Spongebob Squarepants: Legends of Bikini Bottom</em>, features Spongebob and his friends as Legendary Creatures, all featuring art by Caleb Meurer and Gregg Schiegal. These cards are reimaginings of classic Magic: The Gathering cards. Those cards are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Jodah, the Unifier</em> as "Spongebob Squarepants"</li>
	<li>Charix, the Raging Isle as "Mr. Krabs, Penny Pincher"</li>
	<li><em>Skrelv, Defector Mite</em> as "Plankton, Tiny Tyrant"</li>
	<li><em>Granzilaxx, Illithid Scholar</em> as "Squidward, Sarcastic Snob"</li>
	<li><em>Toxril, The Corrosive</em> as "Gary, The Snail"</li>
	<li><em>Barktooth Warbeard</em> as "Patrick Star"</li>
	<li><em>Toski, Bearer of Secrets</em> as "Sandy Cheeks, Martial Astronaut"</li>
</ul><p>The reskin choices here are humorous. Gary The Snail as a 7/7 creature that can spawn snail tokens and drop poison tokens is such a jarring departure from the lovable mollusk. Patrick Star is just a 6/5 creature with just the flavor text, "I don't get it..." which is spot on.</p>

This drop features classic Magic cards with Spongebob artwork inspired by internet memes. Counterspell showing Spongebob in a mocking chicken pose. Night's Whisper sporting a close-up of Squidward's face with bloodshot eyes. If you've been online long enough, you've seen these images.</p>

As the name implies, this drop contains a number of land cards sporting locations from Spongebob's underwater home of Bikini Bottom courtesy of artist Jon Vermilyea.</p>

<p><em>Spongebob Squarepants</em> is the longest running children's cartoon on Nickelodeon. Debuting in 1999, the show has run for 15 seasons alongside five animated feature films.</p>

Weâll have to wait until <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">April 2nd to find out if Nintendo is fixing the issue with the new Switch 2</a>, but as iFixit discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjGaEMXa3mQ">during a teardown of the Alarmo alarm clock</a>, the company is already embracing more reliable Hall effect sensors in at least one of its devices.</p></div><p>Unlike disassembling most modern smartphones, <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/108554/happy-mario-day-ifixit-adafruit-explore-what-makes-the-nintendo-alarm-clock-tick">iFixitâs teardown of Nintendoâs Alarmo</a> appears to be relatively painless.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rocket-league-season-18-introduces-new-mutators-voice-reporting-and-new-rocket-pass/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest season of Rocket League is on the horizon, as announced in a <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/rocket-league-season-18-springs-forth-futura-garden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new blog post</a>, and is set to begin on March 14 at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET / 4 PM GMT. There are a lot of new changes coming with this approaching season, with a focus on a futuristic theme in the Futura Garden Arena, as well as other high-tech items that you can get to customize your car.</p>
<p>With a new season comes a new season pass, where you will automatically unlock the Dodge Charger Daytona Scat Pack Car Body. If you purchase the Rocket Pass, you'll also be able to obtain the Azura Car Body, Space Tower Antenna, Spaceship Topper, and Waypoint Trail. Those who log in during Season 18 will also unlock the Future Fashion Banner.</p>
<p>One of the major changes in this new Rocket League season is the new mutators that will be available to use in Exhibition Mode and Private Matches. Below is the full list of mutators that you'll be able to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jumps - From a double jump to an octuple jump, or no jumps allowed at all, the decision is yours.</li>
<li>Number of Balls - you can choose to have one, two, four, or six balls in play.</li>
<li>Ball Gravity - Options include low, high, super, and default gravitational pull.</li>
<li>Dodge Timer - Change the dodge timer.</li>
<li>Possession Score - Players can earn points by keeping possession of the ball.</li>
<li>Normal Goal Score - Increase the amount of points for each goal.</li>
<li>Aerial Goal Score - Increase the amount of points for each successful airborne goal.</li>
<li>Assist Score - Players can earn up to three points for each assist.</li>
<li>Enforce Territories: This mutator enables the Split Shot Wall, which dives teams across each half of the field. Those that touch the ground of the opponents' side of the field will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocket-league-season-16-out-now-adds-improved-post-demolition-camera/">demolished</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've ever been in an intense Rocket League match and thought you scored a goal, but you were off by just a hair, a new ping sound will echo throughout the arena. This will happen if the ball hits the crossbar or goal posts to ensure that you don't lose momentum and start celebrating too early.</p>
<p>To make sure that the game is being kept safe for the decent people of Rocket League, player reporting is now being expanded to include voice reporting. This means that as well as being able to block, mute, and report other players, you'll now be able to submit audio evidence if you suspect that they are violating the Community Rules. For those concerned about what that means for them, there is a <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/voice-reporting-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed FAQ</a> that explains everything you need to know.</p>

It claims the new device will be an Xbox-branded PC gaming handheld from an existing OEM and that itâs codenamed âKeenan.â Itâll have an official Xbox guide button and is currently planned to launch later this year, with the successor to the Xbox Series X/S generation of consoles greenlit for a planned launch as early as 2027. Notably, it sounds like itâll be a single next-gen console, with the current Series S potentially subsumed by the handheld if itâs successful. <br></p><p>The report also claims that the next generation of controllers might feature âdirect-to-cloud connectivity.â Itâs believed the Microsoftâs work with generative AI and the existing Windows platform for PC will both play a greater role in Xboxâs future as well.

This time around, however, it doesnât seem like Microsoft plans to fight the competition with exclusives. The company started bringing its games to PlayStation 5 and the existing Switch last year, and its more powerful specs suggest weâll see even more Xbox games on Switch 2. Microsoft also previously committed to start bringing <em>Call of Duty </em>back to Nintendoâs platform in one form or another. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The leak, which was originally shown to The Verge but is now public shows Horizon Forbidden Westâs Aloy talking and responding to someone asking her questions. You can watch the footage below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As expected, the quality of the AI-powered character isnât no where near the quality of having a team of developers working on it. But, as that hasnât stopped Sony from hyping it up in a presumably behind-the-scenes presentation that went public.</p>



<p>As said by director of software engineering at Sony Interactive Entertainment, Sharwin Raghoebardajal, the footage is just a prototype that has been developed alongside Guerrilla Games.</p>



<p>While itâs clearly not up to par with traditional development methods, Sonyâs exploration into AI is likely going to turn a lot of heads in the industry, especially for developers. As pointed out by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, almost half (49 percent) of 3,000 respondents to a Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2024&nbsp;survey&nbsp;said that generative AI tools are currently being used in their workplace.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-forced-gen-ai-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Activision faced criticism for its blatant use of AI imagery for its marketing</a> (and bad ones at that), with the community criticising the lack of effort. </p>



<p>Itâs clear that AI isnât going to go away and thereâs still important conversations to be had in its role in game development, but some of the current use cases are becoming very questionable, especially when it comes to video games and the art form.</p>



<p>What do you think of AI and its use in video games? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony is working on a prototype AI-powered version of at least one its PlayStation game characters. An anonymous tipster has shared an internal video from Sonyâs PlayStation group with <em>The Verge</em> that demonstrates an AI-powered version of Aloy from <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>. After we published this story, the video was pulled from YouTube due to a copyright claim <a href="https://www.muso.com/">from Muso</a>, a copyrights enforcement company which advertises Sony Interactive Entertainment (aka PlayStation) as a client.</p><p>The video is narrated by Sharwin Raghoebardajal, a director of software engineering at Sony Interactive Entertainment who works on video game technology, AI, computer vision, and face technology for Sonyâs PlayStation Studios Advanced Technology Group. We watched Raghoebardajal demonstrate an AI-powered version of Aloy that can hold a conversation with a player through voice prompts during gameplay.</p><p>Aloy could be seen responding to queries with an AI-powered synthesized voice and facial movements, both in a demo setting and within the full <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> game. Raghoebardajal makes it clear this is just a prototype that has been developed alongside Guerrilla Games to demonstrate the technology internally at Sony.</p><p>The technology demo uses OpenAIâs whisper for speech-to-text, and both GPT-4 and Llama 3 for conversations and decision making. Sonyâs has its own internal Emotional Voice Synthesis (EVS) system that it uses for speech generation, according to Raghoebardajal, and audio to face animation is powered by Sonyâs own Mockingbird technology.</p><p>While the demo is seen running on PC, Sony has also experimented with running parts of this technology directly on PS5 consoles with âlittle overhead,â according to Raghoebardajal. Sony first demonstrated this internally a year ago, before showing a more advanced version behind closed doors at its Sony Technology Exchange Fair (STEF) in Tokyo in November.</p><p>âThis is just a glimpse of what is possible,â says Raghoebardajal. This tech demo doesnât answer the more obvious questions over whether it even makes sense to talk to Aloy when youâre supposed to be playing as her in <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, or the impact such a technology could have on voice actors and game developers.</p><p><em><sub>The video above was pulled after The Verge published our story; you can see an animation above.</sub></em></p><p>Nvidia has been working on its own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24031687/nvidia-ai-npcs-convai-ces-2023">similar technology for AI-powered NPCs</a> in games, where you speak freely to video game characters. Ace, as Nvidia calls it, has been demonstrated several times throughout 2024, and the GPU maker has even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/19/24105681/nvidia-ai-ace-video-game-character-npc-covert-protocol">worked with Inworld AI</a> to create <em>Covert Protocol</em>, a playable tech demo of Nvidiaâs AI game technology.</p><p>Microsoft has also been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948454/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-developer-tools-inworld-partnership">partnering closely with Inworld AI</a> to eventually bring AI characters to Xbox, allowing game developers to use generative AI characters, storylines, and more. Microsoft has also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse">created its own Muse AI model that generates gameplay</a>, designed initially for game developers to create a game environment for prototyping and ideating.</p><p>There is already a lot of fear among game developers and studios about how AI could impact the creative process of making video games, particularly when so many layoffs are impacting the gaming industry. Almost half (49 percent) of 3,000 respondents to a Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2024 <a href="https://images.reg.techweb.com/Web/UBMTechweb/%7B4fe03be1-d6b1-4f91-95f4-b4bdea9e739e%7D_GDC24-SOTI-Report_Final.pdf">survey</a> said that generative AI tools are currently being used in their workplace, with 31 percent saying they personally use them.</p><p>Sonyâs experiments with AI-powered PlayStation characters are bound to generate more conversation around the role of AI in video game creation, just ahead of GDC next week in San Francisco. We reached out multiple times to Sony for a comment on this leaked internal video, but the company didnât respond. Weâve asked again to confirm whether Sony pulled the video, and if it has further comment.</p><p><em><strong>Update, March 10th: </strong>Added that the video has been pulled by a copyright agent which counts PlayStation as a client.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>If the internet has taught me anything, its that Stardew Valley and Baldur's Gate 3 are two games folks simply cannot get enough of, myself included. Fortunately, a newly-released, fan-made mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30888?tab=description" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Baldur's Village</a>, combines the two in a pretty spectacular way. With the Baldur's Village mod, Stardew players can add 20+ characters, six new locations, new shops, new items, and new events, all inspired by Baldur's Gate 3, to the popular farming sim.</p><p>"A new village has recently been built north of Pelican Town, and its new residents seem... rather unusual," the mods description reads. "You can find the entrance to Baldur's Village at the top of the southern mountain map, right next to Linus' tent."</p><p>After venturing up north, players will be greeted by an entirely new area occupied by several familiar faces, including Gale, Shadowheart, Wyll, Karlach, Halsin, and everyone's favorite, blood-sucking aristocrat, Astarion. Currently, Astarion is the only new neighbor players will be able to romance, as he is the only one the team has finished designing heart events and gift preferences for. However, the team has confirmed that its next focus will be creating Halsin's romance storyline, followed by expanding world-building background stories and gameplay features.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456696-5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456697-10.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456698-7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456699-9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456700-8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456701-3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456702-4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456703-2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456704-1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456705-6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4456696,1300-4456697,1300-4456698,1300-4456699,1300-4456700,1300-4456701,1300-4456702,1300-4456703,1300-4456704,1300-4456705" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456696-5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456697-10.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456698-7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456699-9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456700-8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456701-3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456702-4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456703-2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456704-1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4456705-6.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456696-5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456697-10.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456698-7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456699-9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456700-8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456701-3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456702-4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456703-2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456704-1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4456705-6.png"></figure><p>In order to get the Baldur's Village mod up and running, players will also need to install the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2400" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stardew Modding API</a> (SMAPI), the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stardew Valley Content Patcher</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/999" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Portraiture mod</a>, all of which can be downloaded for free over at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a>.

                <p>Directors Neil Druckmann and Alex Garland sat down for a wide-ranging and fascinating chat recently where they discussed their professional careers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Microsoft is reportedly aiming to release its next-gen Xbox Series X/S successor in 2027, with a much-rumoured handheld Xbox arriving later this year.
</p>
<p>
That's <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027">according to Windows Central</a>, which reports an Xbox Series X/S successor has been greenlit "all the way up to [Microsoft] CEO Satya Nadella" and is now "fully in production". The publication doesn't have much to share in the way of specifics, but it claims the new console is a "premium successor to the powerful Xbox Series X", and is currently slated for a 2027 release.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft has, of course, already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-says-next-xbox-will-deliver-largest-technical-leap-seen-in-a-hardware-generation">confirmed it's working on an Series X/S successor</a>, with Xbox president Sarah Bond last year saying - amid fan fears the company may be looking to abandon the console market - it was "invested in [its] next-generation road map" and "focused on... delivering the largest technical leap that you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."

<p>
While 2027 is obviously still some considerable way off, Windows Central says Microsoft has other Xbox hardware plans due to reach fruition much sooner. The company is reportedly currently working alongside an unspecified "PC gaming OEM" to launch an Xbox-branded gaming handheld later this year. It's claimed the device is being developed under the codename Keenan, and will - according to Windows Central's sources - look "unmistakably 'Xbox'", sporting familiar design sensibilities and even an Xbox guide button.
</p>
<p>
The idea of an Xbox handheld is nothing new. Back in 2017, Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> revealed Microsoft had "roughly designed an Xbox handheld" in the past. However, he's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-discusses-potential-xbox-handheld-plans">repeatedly returned to the subject over the last year</a>, fuelling speculation the project had been revived. When questioned about a potential Xbox handheld last November, Spencer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">suggested any such devices would still be a few years away</a>, but with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2 looming</a>, and reports suggesting Sony is also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-prepping-playstation-5-portable-plans-to-battle-nintendos-handheld-dominance">working on its own handheld device in the form of portable PS5</a>, it might be Microsoft felt the need to accelerate its plans.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, Windows Central claims Microsoft is <em>also</em> internally developing its own Xbox gaming handheld, separate from this year's partner machine, which is due to release alongside its Series X/S successor and "several new controller options" in 2027.
</p>
<p>
All this comes after a 2024 that saw Microsoft's continued dedication to the console market repeatedly questioned, particularly following its decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-confirms-multiplatform-future-is-here-to-stay">bring select first-party Xbox games to other platforms</a>. And while that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-age-of-mythology-and-age-of-empires-2-remasters-heading-to-ps5-this-year">multiplatform strategy is accelerating in 2025</a>, the company has been keen to reiterate its commitment to the Xbox hardware business - last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reveals-three-new-xbox-console-variants">announcing three new Xbox console variants</a> alongside talk of its next-gen plans.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-with-community-shaders-add-on/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skyrim-gets-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-with-community-shaders-add-on.1130421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-with-community-shaders-add-on/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, the Community Shaders team has released a new major update to the Skyrim graphics framework mod. Following the introduction of features like <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-true-pbr-with-community-shaders-1-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physically Based Rendering</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-dynamic-cloud-shadows-thanks-to-new-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skylighting, and dynamic cloud shadows</a>, Community Shaders version <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.2.0</a> adds support (through an add-on) for AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation, delivering a 60-70% performance uplift for most users. NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, which was implemented a couple of months ago, was also improved, although it remains an older version since the most recent ones do not support DirectX 11. Moreover, neither Multi Frame Generation nor Reflex are currently supported due to issues that NVIDIA should fix on their end. On the other hand, AMD Anti-Lag 2 should be supported.</p>
<p>According to the authors, the Frame Generation feature automatically optimizes Skyrim in a similar way to the extremely popular Display Tweaks mod. Therefore, Display Tweaks is not recommended to be used in conjunction, although it is still supported. The modders also note, as our readers already know very well, that frame Generation works best when your computer can already run the game at around 60 frames per second. The frame rate is then doubled to 120 frames per second, providing reliable frame pacing. Because of this, the feature only enables itself on 120Hz and higher displays, although it can still be forcefully activated from the Community Shaders panel.</p>
<p>The new Community Shaders release also brings several other improvements to Skyrim, such as a new grass shading model and improved grass collision, a parallax shading fix, mipmap LOD bias for TAA/FSR/DLAA to deliver sharper textures, the latest transformer model for DLAA, tweaks to screen space global illumination, brighter skylighting with improved shading, improved wetness effects, and various tonemapping tweaks. There will be several graphics showcases of CS 1.2.0 on YouTube in the next few days, no doubt.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">There could be an official Xbox-branded handheld out by the end of this year. A new report states that Microsoft is partnering with a PC gaming company, like ASUS or Lenovo, on the device, with a targeted launch in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027" rel="nofollow ">WindowsCentral</a>, the handheld is codenamed Keenan and will be similar in nature to the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lenovo-legion-go-s-windows-handheld-preorders-are-live-steamos-model-releases-in-may/1100-6528675/">Lenovo Legion Go S</a>--which will be the first device outside the Steam Deck family to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steamos-is-coming-to-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-starting-with-lenovos-new-unit/1100-6528686/">run on Valve's SteamOS</a>. So, the Xbox-branded handheld will likely run on Windows, featuring the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass. The report also states the system will likely sport an Xbox guide button and aesthetics that fit the Xbox ethos.</p><p dir="ltr">Interestingly enough, Microsoft Gaming CEO <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-device-is-a-few-years-out-apparently/1100-6527758/">Phil Spencer mentioned an Xbox handheld is a "few years out"</a> in November.

This longer-term plan lines up with the report of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-might-not-be-a-traditional-console-may-launch-in-2027-per-insider/1100-6529996/">the next Xbox launching in 2027</a>. Basically, Microsoft plans to kick off the next generation with a Xbox Series X successor accompanied by an internally developed handheld system.</p><p dir="ltr">However, unsurprisingly, it's noted that this schedule could shift as Microsoft works on the future of the Xbox brand. For instance, WindowsCentral points to the Xbox-licensed handheld scheduled for this year to serve as sort of a test drive for Microsoft.

Mio, the angsty introvert of the duo, writes science fiction to cope with her difficult upbringing. Zoe, a bubbly fantasy writer, escapes into stories of dungeons and dragons to process her trauma. While playing Hazelightâs latest co-op adventure, I was curious how the action-platformer would spotlight both its leadsâ fictions in its final levels, assuming it would no longer be alternating between the sci-fi and fantasy worlds. Would it take place in some kind of neutral world that wouldnât show favor to either of its heroes? Could Hazelight maybe just hone in on one of their stories for simplicityâs sake? As it turns out, the studio didnât take any of the easy options, and the result is an incredible display of the teamâs technical skill and inventive game design.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196123" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Whatâs Coming Out Beyond The Day Before | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="125" data-playlist="196123,196789,197298" data-current="196123"><div><p>Whatâs Coming Out Beyond The Day Before | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21655.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Split Fiction</em>, Mio and Zoe have been trapped in a virtual reality that extracts ideas from authorsâ brains, to be packaged and sold by a tech corporation called Rader Publishing. An accident occurs, and Mio and Zoe are stuck in a shared simulation, being thrown back and forth between sci-fi and fantasy stories, the pair working together to battle through each otherâs imagination.</p><p>Beyond the occasional side quest, the simulation keeps a divide between both worlds, but as the pair tear down the facade from the inside it becomes more unstable, and theyâre almost able to break free and go back to their real world. However, in a last-ditch effort to save his brain-scraping machine, Rader of Rader Publishing forcibly enters the simulation himself, destabilizing all thatâs come before to introduce the final 30 minutes of the game.</p><figure id="" data-id="23f1a9871494a2b10b8d369d092c48d4" data-recommend-id="image://23f1a9871494a2b10b8d369d092c48d4" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A ship flies to the right side of the screen and is suddenly a dragon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A ship flies to the right side of the screen and is suddenly a dragon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Video Game News / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="23f1a9871494a2b10b8d369d092c48d4" data-recommend-id="image://23f1a9871494a2b10b8d369d092c48d4" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A ship flies to the right side of the screen and is suddenly a dragon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At first, it appears both players are, for the first time, existing in two separate worlds. Mio wakes up in her sci-fi story, while Zoe is thrown into her fantasy world. But after some brief platforming, the two find each other, yet each side of the gameâs split screen depicts entirely different levels. Structurally, they are identical, but where Mio sees buildings and gaseous planets in the distance, Zoe sees a magical forest. <em>Split Fiction</em>âs co-op gameplay requires communication and coordination, but it was all while occupying the same space. Now, because the level is rendered as both sci-fi <em>and</em> fantasy, some objects are only interactive for one player, while the other has to find some way to help them from their âside.â For example, something that appears as just a pushable box to Mio might be a bouncy mushroom for Zoe, something she can use to jump high enough to reach an objective. Or perhaps some flora in the fantasy world could appear as a computer terminal in the sci-fi one. <em>Split Fiction</em> mostly delegates puzzle-solving and combat roles by giving its characters different tools. In the final level, that division of labor becomes inherent in the world design. Mio and Zoe are occupying the same space, but only one of them can see the way forward at a time. It leads to silly moments like when Zoe has to swim to reach an objective and Mio canât see how sheâs floating above whatâto herâlooks like a chasm. These two worlds are rendered simultaneously, with both characters moving through their respective worlds, affecting the other, all without once showing any signs of performance trouble. Itâs a clever way to give sci-fi and fantasy equal weight in the final push, but it doesnât stop at one impressive technical feat.</p><p>As the simulation continues to fall apart, <em>Split Fiction </em>starts playing with the boundaries of everything you thought you knew up to that point. Hazards appear in Mioâs sci-fi world that she has to avoid by moving to the right side of the screen where Zoeâs fantasy story takes up space, then suddenly thereâs an onslaught of enemies, aircrafts, and obstacles blocking your progress that requires both players to rapidly move between both levels, as you watch both characters and the worlds around them seamlessly shift from one genre to the other.</p><figure id="" data-id="a179b5d27177045af7914086fb42462d" data-recommend-id="image://a179b5d27177045af7914086fb42462d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The split screen divide moves across the screen, showing more and less of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as it moves." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The split screen divide moves across the screen, showing more and less of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as it moves." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Video Game News / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a179b5d27177045af7914086fb42462d" data-recommend-id="image://a179b5d27177045af7914086fb42462d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The split screen divide moves across the screen, showing more and less of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as it moves." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>But it doesnât end there</em>. After a brief boss fight with a kaiju version of Rader in the simulationâs home, Mio and Zoe are sent back to their respective worlds and all the rules youâve been taught about how these intertwined worlds work go out the window. The splitscreen that was once just a dividing line to help both players navigate the world from their perspective becomes a chaotic obstacle you have to navigate. The bar in the middle of the screen rotates, pivots, and shifts in ways that constantly change the confines of both the sci-fi and fantasy worlds, exposing both players to different dangers and paths forward.</p><p>The split down the middle of your television becomes a weapon for your enemy to wield, depriving you of literal screen space where you can safely exist, moving the divide between both worlds to push you into the dangerous sides of your own creation. Thereâs a section where <em>Split Fiction</em>âs camera shifts to a top-down perspective, with the splitscreen spinning around like a carousel, exposing dangers from the fantasy world like piranhas, or science-fiction industrial grinders, and all you can do is frantically jump between worlds until Rader throws something else at you. Itâs challenging and requires you to pull from your knowledge of every previous level to recognize hazards from one world and maneuver your way to safety in the other. <em>Split Fiction </em>manages to pull this off without a hitch, which is another incredible technical feat on top of being stunning gameplay.</p><figure id="" data-id="e033f0c43e674bf00ae0f43049c4b9e0" data-recommend-id="image://e033f0c43e674bf00ae0f43049c4b9e0" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A split screen spins like a carousel, exposing different parts of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as Mio and Zoe jump across them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A split screen spins like a carousel, exposing different parts of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as Mio and Zoe jump across them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Video Game News / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e033f0c43e674bf00ae0f43049c4b9e0" data-recommend-id="image://e033f0c43e674bf00ae0f43049c4b9e0" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A split screen spins like a carousel, exposing different parts of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as Mio and Zoe jump across them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Thereâs something kinda poetic about an artless corpo having to wield Mio and Zoeâs created worlds to take them down because heâs incapable of imagining something of his own. The final boss fight, against Raderâs giant god form, is literally just him reaching into both of their stories and tossing whatever beast or machine he can in hopes that it might save his creation. <em>Split Fiction</em>âs final level is relentless, dragging both players between science and magic without a momentâs respite. Words donât do it justice. Its visual splendor is mixed with clever and challenging game design, all tied in a tight thematic bow. Itâs the kind of thing you can only experience to its fullest once, and Iâm already miffed Iâll never get to experience the delight of playing it for the first time with my co-op partner, slackjawed and gobsmacked at how Hazelight pulled it off.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Last week AMD launched FSR 4 alongside its first RDNA 4-equipped desktop GPUs. It's a drastic improvement over previous versions of the tech suite, introducing AI-powered upscaling that is only possible thanks to dedicated hardware on the new cards. It's an advancement that Sony's Mark Cerny is saying will come to PS5, albeit not until 2026.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-mark-cerny-fsr-4-to-play-a-key-part-in-the-next-evolution-of-pssr-upscaling" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a>, Cerny was full of praise for AMD's FSR 4 release, saying that the upscaler surpasses the work Sony has done with its PS5 Pro-exclusive solution, PSSR. "And results are excellent, it's a more advanced approach that can exceed the crispness of PSSR," Cerny explained. "I'm very proud of the work of the joint team!"</p><p>Cerny says that FSR 4 will need to be backported to the PS5 Pro, essentially through a new version of PSSR that takes into account all the advancements AMD has made. Cerny says that for the most part the information the upscaler requires from a game will stay the same, which will make implementation by developers easier, but that it isn't as easy as supporting FSR 4 natively. This is due to the PS5 Pro having an entirely different architecture than RDNA 4, and thus not one that can support it fully like AMD's latest GPUs.</p><p>"RDNA 4 and the hardware in PS5 Pro are completely separate designs, which is why I speak in terms of 'reimplementation' on PS5 Pro when I talk about the new upscaling network used in FSR 4," Cerny continued. "I'm definitely looking forward to a future with co-developed hardware features for machine learning that will dramatically increase the interoperability."</p><p>FSR 4 doesn't have the same performance gains as its previous iteration, in part due to the additional overhead required for the vastly improved results. Cerny, however, believes the PS5 Pro can still support these image improvements despite the much weaker hardware in the PS5 Pro, without requiring major re-architecture. "That is what we are targeting, and we believe we can achieve it," Cerny added.</p><p>Sony and AMD continue to collaborate on Project Amethyst, with its first major milestone coming with the release of PSSR. Cerny believes there's a lot more to come by working closely with AMD, especially when it comes to machine learning and ray tracing enhancements for future console hardware. "All I can say is stay tuned! Thereâs a lot of opportunity with our Amethyst collaboration, and we know that ray tracing is a huge part of the graphics future," concluded Cerny.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/luffy-one-piece-lakers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is Monkey D. Luffy.&nbsp; He's 19 years old, neurodivergent as hell, and, I donât know if youâve heard, but he's gonna be king of the pirates. In <em>One Piece</em>âs <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-just-read-1-025-chapters-of-one-piece-and-its-a-damn-1847671952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,000+ ongoing manga</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-leading-into-one-pieces-historic-1-000th-epi-1848078095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">episodic anime odyssey</a>, Iâve seen him overcome insurmountable odds <a href="https://kotaku.com/hasan-piker-one-piece-socialist-twitch-youtube-politics-1850295738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liberating islands from fascist marines</a> and imperialist oligarchs, and stomp out anyone who dare deride folks who fed him whenever his ship graced their shores. Although his ethos isn't a cypher to unravel, his basketball in a recent <em>One Piece</em> and Los Angeles Lakers collaboration clip is. Allow me to put my hands on the proverbial SportsCenter desk and give my take on Luffyâs b-ball skills and why he wouldnât be in the Straw Hatsâ starting five.&nbsp;</p><p>On February 28,&nbsp; <em>One Piece</em> and the Los Angeles Lakers released âa first-of-its-kind collaborationâ during a game against the Clippers. The highlight of the event was a special anime featurette where Luffy donned the Lakersâ purple and gold jersey and played basketball. The thirty-second clip was sick as hell and has amassed 594,000 viewers on YouTube all losing their minds over how surreal it is watching Luffy balling for the Lakers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="LOS ANGELES LAKERS x ONE PIECE Collab Anime" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VfKwPIbycbg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>But Luffy lacks fundamentals. Let's start with Luffyâs ball handling: Unsurprisingly, Luffy won the jump ball in his score-less handicap game against a group of nameless marines whoâre auspiciously dressed in Dallas Mavericks jerseys. As we all know, Luffy ate the Gum-Gum fruit, allowing him to stretch his limbs to far greater reaches than Michael Jordan at the end of <em>Space Jam</em>, so having insane ups isnât anything wild. What is wild is Luffyâs abysmal ball handling and security. Within moments of possessing the rock, it was swatted away with ease by a player flanking him at half court. Luffy doesnât even make any movement toward the net before losing possession. Thatâs some embarrassing lack of full court awareness. Whatâs worse, the ball is about to go out of bounds within nine seconds of the game. Who let him cook?</p><p>Thankfully, Luffy locks the fuck in and puts his stringbean arms to use, clasping the ball with one hand, sliding through the Marineâs defense, laying up a shot off the glass, and dunking on his opps before cheesing at the courtside camera. Luffyâs dunk further emphasizes the aura from his score with a well-timed rafters sign hyping up the crowd, asking, âWhoâs the king?â before he posterizes two marines. Although animeâs glorious king rose to the occasion, if this were a real basketball game, he wouldnât be in the same area code of my Straw Hats starting five. Iâd have kept him sat on the bench until the last quarter of the game to save the day like one of his battles.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, letâs talk about my starting five. For sports-averse readers, a starting five are players coaches put out on the court who display a high amplitude for scoring, an impenetrable defence, and seamless chemistry. If I were in charge of the Lakers x <em>One Piece</em> collab, I would've capitalized off the concept to further elevate the big-game feel of <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-demon-slayer-team-up-before-dodgers-cubs-play-tokyo-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anime melding with sports</a> beyond Luffy soloing an entire team. While the Straw Hats are short five players to constitute an NBA-regulated team, letâs pretend those rules donât apply (given Luffyâs Gum-Gum powers were allowed) for the sake of building my <a href="https://kotaku.com/nba-playoffs-anime-ja-morant-chris-paul-basketball-1848900403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fantasy anime basketball team</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Why draw the Straw Hats in Lakers jerseys and keep them on the bench?<span></span><a href="https://lakersnation.com/lakers-giving-out-shirts-posters-for-one-piece-night-against-clippers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Â©Eiichiro Oda/ Shueisha Â©Eiichiro Oda/Shueisha, Toei Animation Â©Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc.</a></figcaption></figure><p>My team needs a point guard who can pop off with laser beam shots from half court like it's nothing. No other player would fit this role better than the Straw Hatsâ resident sniper, Usopp. Usopp never misses his target in the heat of battle, so his scoring ability coupled with his court presence and leadership makes him (or that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhXNmMLdivk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper King</a> fellow) an ideal point guard to carry the game until we need to sub him out for Luffy.&nbsp;</p><p>As the senior officer of the Straw Hats crew with ample experience as a crew member on other ships and one of the seven warlords of the sea, Jinbeâs expertise and strategery overqualified him as my teamâs shooting guard. Whatâs more, his <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Fish-Man_Karate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fish-man karate</a> would provide defensive versatility for our team on account of him moving enemies without touching them with blasts of air, and his <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Haki/Armament_Haki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">armament haki</a> would give him enough space and durability for his wide-ass frame to get open for open shots.&nbsp;</p><p>The next player on my starting five would be the devil child herself, Nico Robin. Having eaten the <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Hana_Hana_no_Mi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flower-Flower fruit</a>, a devil fruit that lets her sprout duplicates of her body on any surface within her range, Robin would be the center in my starting five. Her defensive presence would make for a wealth of scoring and rebound opportunities from virtually anywhere on the court, including off the enemy teamâs body (which probably wouldnât count as a foul).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And finally, my Straw Hatâs small and power forward would be Sanji and Zoro. Sanjiâs whole deal as the Straw Hatsâ versatile cook makes him perfect for adapting to whatever task spontaneously asked of him. Whatâs more, heâd be able to handle mid-range shots supporting our point guard or ball-handling all with his fucking feet. Thatâs sick as hell. As our power forward, Zoro would basically be asked to do the same tasks as Sanji, with the only difference being him being the most dependable player. Seeing as how he took <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAtZoIFW2Uw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the brunt of Luffyâs pain</a>, heâs the only man strong enough to fulfill the role. Although the two donât get along as well as Draymond Green and Jordan Poole on a good day, when push comes to shove, the pair are the most in sync of the entire crew. As â<a href="https://gamerant.com/one-piece-zoro-sanji-wings-of-the-pirate-king/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the wingâs of the pirate king</a>,â Sanji and Zoro come in clutch with rebounding off each otherâs offensive and defensive attacks without communicating with one another.&nbsp;</p><p>What of the rest of the crew? Well, Iâd have Nami serve as the coach since her role as the navigator basically makes her the closest thing to being the crewâs real captain. Her cheerleading and chastising would not only keep Zoro and Sanji (mostly Sanji) from butting heads, sheâd also suss out the pattern of the enemy teamâs plays and chart us towards victory. Chopper would be doctoring, naturally, with the option to sub in for Jinbe should he exhaust his armament haki in the first quarter of the game and need a breather. Hopefully his <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Rumble_Ball" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumble balls</a> wonât count as juicing up. Franky would also serve as a replacement for Robin or Sanji should they blow up in the first half of the game. Brookâ¦.can be our teamâs Drake and cheer for us on the sidelines by singing or something. This isnât because I donât like the skeletal bard, I just think itâd be harder to justify his soul-swapping ghost ability on the enemy team as fair in this already ludacris rule breaking anime basketball game.&nbsp;</p><p>While Luffy is nice enough alone on the court, basketball is a team-based sport, so itâs weird the collab had him playing like LeBron James in the paint without his nakama by his side. If my Stephen A. Smith-esque analysis of Luffyâs skills and fantasy booking are anything to go on, the Straw Hats are a far cry from being as bad as the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-cant-do-it-all-alone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017-era Cleveland Cavaliers</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-monster-hunter-wilds-streamlined"><h3>The New Monster Hunter Is The Most Streamlined Yet, But Thatâs Not Such A Bad Thing</h3></a><p>"Iâve played so many Monster Hunter games, and I donât have time for the bullshit involved in Monster Hunter games"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/fiio-ft1-review-sennheiser-hd6xx-best-midfi-headphone-canjam"><h3>I Went To A Fancy Headphone Convention And Fell In Love With The Basics</h3></a><p>The classic Sennheiser HD 6XX and the new Fiio FT1 are the budget kings of headphones, beloved by many.
