            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed what you can expect from the first season of free-to-play skateboarding sim&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>when it arrives next week, and there are a ton of new cosmetics up for grabs, plus more.</p>

<p>As detailed in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/skate-season-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the game's official blog, the first season of&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>will bring two seasonal events with it, as well as "a little makeover" for San Vansterdam, lots of new challenges and objectives for you to pursue, and, of course, a brand new battle pass.</p>

<p>First up, it's the first of two seasonal events, Skate-o-Ween. It's San Vansterdam's annual Halloween celebration, but EA says it's "less focused on the spookiness" and "more about getting a chuckle out of someone". It runs from October 21st to November 11th.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-season-1-details-skating.jpg?itok=9GkDyJ_V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-season-1-details-skating.jpg?itok=x-M6o5tQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skate</em>'s first season is bringing new stuff galore next week.</figcaption></figure><p>The second big event this season is the 7-Ply Maple Harvest, which begins on November 18th and ends on December 2nd. Both events will feature updated community parks, plus new themed cosmetics you can grab either via in-game challenges or by visiting the Extravert Shop.</p>

<p>Completing seasonal events will earn you event currency, and you can then use that currency to grab special cosmetic items. EA says it'll have more info about both events before they go live in&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>.</p>

<p>Season 1 will also bring new general cosmetics for you to earn outside of the specific seasonal events, but of course, the battle pass will have both a free and a premium track, and you'll have to cough up some cash if you want to get premium items.</p>

<p>It's not all about spending money, though; several new music tracks are also being added for Season 1, including the likes of Bad Religion's "Against the Grain", Jane's Addiction's "Stop!", and Gang Starr's "Full Clip", among others.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3354750/skate/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/skate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/skate-game-preview/9PHF9K5Q6ZLZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and its first official season kicks off on October 7th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft is getting ready to announce an ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell <em>The Verge</em> that the software maker has started testing ad-supported games streaming internally, allowing employees to play select titles free without a Game Pass subscription.</p><p>I understand that the free ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming will include the ability to stream some games you own, as well as eligible <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/tag/free-play-days/">Free Play Days</a> titles, which let Xbox players try games over a weekend. You’ll also be able to stream <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/672037/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-activision-retro-classics">Xbox Retro Classics</a> games.</p><p>Sources tell me the internal testing includes around two minutes of preroll ads before a game is available to stream for free through Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft is also currently testing a limit of one hour for sessions, with up to five hours free a month. These limits may well change when the service is officially launched.</p><p>The ad-supported Xbox Cloud Gaming version will be available on PC, Xbox consoles, handheld devices, and via the web. Microsoft is planning to test free streaming through a public beta test soon, before launching it fully in the coming months.</p><p>Microsoft’s free streaming test comes in the same week that the company expanded Xbox Cloud Gaming access to its Xbox Game Pass Premium and Essential plans for the first time, as part of a revamp to Game Pass and a 50 percent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/790658/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-console-price-hikes-notepad">price hike for Ultimate subscribers</a>.</p><p>Xbox Cloud Gaming also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789461/xbox-cloud-gaming-launch-1440p-resolution-bitrate-changes">came out of beta</a> this week. Game Pass Ultimate members can now stream select games in 1440p resolution, with up to 30Mbps bitrates. Ultimate subscribers also get up to 20Mbps bitrates for any other games streamed at 1080p. Premium and Essential subscribers are limited to 1080p resolution and a 12Mbps bitrate.</p><p>An ad-supported version of Xbox Cloud Gaming has been long in the works. Microsoft Gaming CFO Tim Stuart first dropped hints about a free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/23999661/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-free-version-ads">nearly two years ago</a>. Microsoft also made it clear recently that it wants to make Xbox Cloud Gaming more accessible.</p><p>“I think for us, it really opens up the opportunity to make it much more affordable, and make it more accessible to players. Whether that’s going into new regions, or new ways to actually access the [Xbox] cloud,” Jason Ronald, Microsoft’s VP of next generation, said on an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760813/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-new-price-plan-hint">Xbox podcast in August</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's inching closer to last thing UK time on a Friday, so my job is to bring you the single most devastating and depressing bit of news I can to get the weekend started right. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/building-relationships">Building Relationships</a>, the funky little game in which you play a house in search of a romantic connection with another building, has had its full release delayed to early 2026.</p>
<p>See, I told you it'd be devastating. A few months' extra wait until you can engage in more vaguely flirty banter with a windmill. I knew I should have insisted we develop some embeddable tissues which could be inserted into articles.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"It was a tough decision, but I wanted to give more time for the game to breathe -- to polish on the narrative and ensure that the game feels smooth," developer Tanat Boozayaangool wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2666920/view/526481129361900884?l=english">Steam post</a> about the delay. "I want to tell a meaningful story through this game, but right now, everything feels rushed. I'm thankful for the reception on this game so far, grateful for all the opportunities that the community has enabled for me.</p>
<p>"But looking at the game as a whole, it just needs a lil bit more time. This will also give the team time to work through bugs, optimization, and accessibility features to ensure that we launch with the best version of Building Relationships. Rest assured, that the end is in sight: the story arc has been set, the plot determined -- I just need to give it a bit more polish."</p>
<p>They then shared a teaser image of the player building sitting next to a windmill in a garden. COME ON, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MAKING THE ADDED WAIT EASIER.</p>
<p>I digress. While I played the Steam demo for Building Relationships (which is still live if you want to dive in) after reading some <a href="https://www.vg247.com/building-relationships-steam-next-fest-demo-made-me-crush-on-a-windmill">Next Fest coverage Oisin wrote about it</a> back when both of us were at brash and occasionally funny RPS sister site VG247, both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/building-relationships-is-a-short-hike-but-you-are-trying-to-chat-up-toy-houses">Edwin</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-am-happy-to-report-that-building-relationships-has-more-than-one-joke-and-most-of-them-are-pretty-good">Nic</a> have also written about it here. Here's an except from the former's piece that neatly sums out what the game's all about:</p>
<blockquote>Building Relationships stands out the most in hindsight because it felt the most at ease in its own skin and also, because it's not every day you get to chat up a small apartment building. (I personally wouldn't date an apartment building because all the ones I've lived in had mold, but this one had a certain forlorn charisma, reminiscent of that friend who's too busy pairing off everybody else to find love himself.) It's a pocket open worlder with boisterous katamari physics in which you bounce about fluttering your curtains at bungalows and completing very simple quests, such as fishing (in this case, for cars). It is a game wholly invested in the act of enjoying a pun, which is surely the definition of a promising first date. It has pleasantly daft writing, blossoming biomes that remind me of Proteus a bit, and some amusing camera angle choices during conversation.</blockquote>
<p>Right, I'm off to try and distract myself until early next year with some non-building related puns.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! It’s Friday, and I’m so happy because today is my last day before I go off on a two-week vacation. But before I leave, I have one more Morning Checkpoint for you all. Yup, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other cool stuff is back again, and this time we’re looking into the rumored <em>Halo</em> remake, mourning the death of AOL dial-up, and preparing for so many damn games to launch in October. Enjoy, and I hope you get to go on a vacation very soon. You deserve it.</p> <h2><strong>Amazon is erasing guns from old James Bond posters</strong></h2> <p>Here’s something strange. Amazon, the new owners of the James Bond franchise, are allegedly digitally erasing guns out of old promo images of various Bond actors and using those censored images on Prime Video. <a href="https://hmssweblog.wordpress.com/2025/10/03/altered-007-images-raise-fan-concern-about-amazon/">This was documented by 007 fan blog <em>The Spy Command,</em></a> and it’s all really silly, with some images simply cropped to hide a gun and others changed more drastically. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/philnobilejr.bsky.social/post/3m2c4ko55zc2j">There’s also evidence that some of the images are being tweaked using AI tools.&nbsp;</a></p>

 <h2><strong>The rumored <em>Halo </em>remake is reportedly being developed by the <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> company</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/10/02/rumor-halo-ce-remake-co-devleoped-by-a-virtuous-studio/">As first reported by YouTuber Mr.Rebs and corroborated by XboxEra</a>, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-combat-evolved-remaster-remake-ps5-xbox-1851523975">previously reported but not yet announced remake of the original <em>Halo</em></a> is allegedly being developed by Abstraction Games, a studio owned by Virtuous.&nbsp; Virtuous is the same studio that developed this year’s smash hit RPG, <em>Oblivion Remastered.</em></p>

 <h2><strong><em>Payday 3</em>‘s promised offline mode has been canceled</strong></h2> <p><em>Payday 3</em> launched in 2023 to negative reviews, and players flocked back to <em>Payday 2 i</em>nstead. Since then, the devs have been trying to improve the game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/payday-3-solo-offline-mode-beta-update-june-27-heist-pc-1851560236">In June 2024</a>, the studio behind the game launched a pseudo-offline mode that still required the internet. At the time, it was called a “stepping stone” to a true offline mode. Well, that’s not actually going to happen after all.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/as-if-things-werent-bad-enough-payday-3-has-canceled-its-promised-offline-mode/">As reported by <em>The Game</em></a><em>r</em>, during a recent livestream,<em> Payday 3</em>&nbsp;general manager Jonas Skantz confirmed that the studio wasn’t planning to make a true offline mode, claiming that adding the fan-requested feature “is not feasible for where we are going with the game.”</p>

 <h2><strong>Five of the most wishlisted games on Steam are launching in October</strong></h2> <p>We’ve talked a few times about how October is going to be a month packed with video game releases. And here’s more evidence of that. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/buckle-up-five-of-the-most-wishlisted-games-on-steam-are-all-coming-out-this-month/">As spotted by<em> PC Gamer</em>,</a> some of the most wishlisted games on Steam right now, including <em>Battlefield 6</em> and <em>Little Nightmares 3,</em> are all launching in October. Good luck out there, folks.</p> <h2><strong>AOL’s dial-up internet service is officially dead</strong></h2> <p>*SCREECHING NOISES* *DIFFERENT LOUD NOISES* *DEEE DEEE DDEEEEE DOO DOO DOOOOOOO* Okay, finally online. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/aol-dial-up-internet-shuts-down-08162912737f2fb221f10ba87ce5fc41">Now to look up news about my internet provider AOL, and oh no….</a></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-toasty-guy-from-mortal-kombat-has-left-the-studio-after-30-years-2000631151">The Toasty! guy from<em> Mortal Kombat</em> has left the studio after 30 years</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-sora-2-videos-pokemon-spongebob-dragon-ball-2000631137">OpenAI’s new video tool is producing slop featuring copyrighted characters like Goku</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-game-boy-build-masterpiece-mario-zelda-2000631059">Hey, the new Lego Game Boy is awesome and not very expensive</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

                <p>Microsoft is gearing up to announce an ad-based version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, according to a new report. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge's sources</a> said Microsoft is now testing an ad tier for the streaming service, with employees trying it out now before it may launch publicly for everyone.</p><p>The report said the free ad-based tier for Xbox Cloud Gaming will allow players to stream "some" of the games they already own, along with select titles from the "Free Play Days" promotion that allows people to play select titles on weekends at no cost. Xbox Retro Classics titles may be included, too.</p><p>In terms of the ads themselves, the report said the current iteration has people watching two minutes of preroll ads before jumping into a game. The report also mentioned that there could be streaming limitations, including a cutoff of one-hour sessions each and up to five hours for free each month. It's possible things change before the ad-based program goes live, if it does at all.</p><p>The Xbox Cloud Gaming version with ads is said to be in the works for PC, Xbox, handheld devices, and internet browsers. Prior to this report, an industry analyst said Microsoft might look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ad-tier-could-come-next-expert-says/1100-6535154/" data-ref-id="1100-6535154">offering people the ability to play games for free in exchange for watching ads.</a></p><p>An ad-based tier is no surprise, as <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-game-pass-for-free-microsoft-is-experimenting-with-ad-views-for-access-to-hundreds-of-xbox-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox boss Tim Stuart first hinted at it some time ago</a>. In August this year, Xbox boss Jason Ronald teased an evolution of Xbox Cloud Gaming, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biXDUvQByBw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying on a podcast</a> that Microsoft was looking for a way to make the service "more affordable" and "accessible," and dropping the price to $0 is in line with that ambition.</p><p>GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an attempt to get more details.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-exits-beta-with-some-improvements/1100-6535146/" data-ref-id="1100-6535146">Xbox Cloud Gaming left beta and added more improvements.</a> Additionally, Microsoft announced that the highest-quality streaming, 1440p, will be locked behind the Game Pass Ultimate paywall, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">the price just went up to $30/month.</a></p><p>Back in 2012, Square Enix launched an ad-based streaming game service called Coreonline before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-kills-ad-supported-streaming-service/1100-6417195/" data-ref-id="1100-6417195">killing it off 15 months later due to a lack of uptake from players.</a></p>

                <p>So, you're bored at work, probably sitting in front of your computer scrolling nothing to look busy. (Did I just snitch on myself?) Maybe you'd rather be playing Sucker Punch Productions' new samurai fantasy sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a>, but you've got however many hours until you get home. Well, if you wanted to make the wait easier, you should definitely check out the recently released "Music from Watanabe Mode" soundtrack. It's a total vibe.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei is the PlayStation 5-exclusive sequel to 2020's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima/" data-ref-id="5000-474583">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. Many things in Yotei are similar to Tsushima, but there are a few differences. One of them is the newly introduced Watanabe Mode, a collaboration with Samurai Champloo director Shinichirō Watanabe that features original lo-fi music created under his direction. You could only listen to these beats on your PS5 if you selected Watanabe Mode--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-brings-back-kurosawa-mode-adds-new-modes-from-samurai-film-directors/1100-6533108/" data-ref-id="1100-6533108">one of three playable options</a> based on samurai film directors like Akira Kurosawa and Takashi Miike--but now, Sony has dropped the soundtrack on music streaming services.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_EoEz8oFso" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4_EoEz8oFso" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Released on October 3--one day after Yotei hit PS5--<a href="https://ghostofyotei.lnk.to/watanabe" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the "Ghost of Yotei - Music from Watanabe Mode - EP"</a> houses nearly 30 minutes of chill beats to kill (time) to. You can listen to it just about everywhere: Apple Music, Spotify, Amazon Music, Pandora, YouTube Music, and a streaming service I've never heard of called Deezer.</p><p>It's a real chill vibe. If you're familiar with Samurai Champloo and the artists Watanabe collaborated with for that legendary anime's soundtrack, then you know what to expect from this brisk but banging EP. It could fit right in with an episode of SamCham, and really brings that lowkey energy to Yotei's vengeful scenarios. It's a nice juxtaposition between the serious and the calm.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei launched on PlayStation 5 to generally favorable reviews from critics. In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-lone-wolf/1900-6418414/" data-ref-id="1900-6418414">Ghost of Yotei review</a>, writer Richard Wakeling awarded it a 9/10, saying it "builds and improves upon its predecessor with a gripping story, rewarding exploration, and fantastic combat, with each aspect emphasizing the characteristics of a new protagonist." Now that it's finally out, we've been busting ass on a bunch of guides to make your time in 1600 Ezo (modern-day Hokkaido, Japan) easier. This includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ghost-of-yotei-weapons-locations-guide/2900-7098/" data-ref-id="2900-7098">where all the weapons are</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ghost-of-yotei-best-skills/2900-7091/" data-ref-id="2900-7091">the best skills to unlock</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ghost-of-yotei-wolf-den-locations/2900-7102/" data-ref-id="2900-7102">how to find all the wolf dens</a>, and more, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/which-ghost-of-yotei-mode-should-you-play/2300-6466416/" data-ref-id="2300-6466416">which mode you should play</a>. (You want my opinion? Play Watanabe Mode. It's perfect.)</p>

		<p>A few weeks on from the early access release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/skate-4">Skate</a>, EA and Full Circle have now revealed what’s coming in Season 1: Hesh &amp; Fresh, kickflipping off on 7th October.</p>
<p><iframe title="skate. | Early Access Season 1 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Mi9EKoBCSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The free-to-play reboot of the popular extreme sport series, Skate has taken players to the skate park paradise of San Vansterdam. Now the city is getting even bigger with new locations, weekly challenges, a skate pass with both free and premium reward tracs, and seasonal events for Halloween and Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>New Skateable Areas</strong>: Find seasonal decor at spots like The Orb and The Skateway plus other new areas for you to discover throughout San Van.</li>
<li><strong>New Events:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skate-o-Ween (Oct. 21 – Nov. 11): </strong>Skate-o-Ween in San Van is a lighthearted Halloween celebration that’s less about the spook and more about getting a chuckle, creating an inventive costume and just skating in a fun outfit.</li>
<li><strong>7-Ply Maple Harvest (Nov. 18 – Dec. 2): </strong>The annual San Van 7-Ply Maple Harvest is a long-standing festival celebrating the city’s unique maple trees; in the 70s, skaters discovered that the trees’ wood were perfectly suited for skateboard construction. It’s a community tradition rooted in accomplishments, growth, and reflection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New Challenges and Tasks: </strong>Season 1 will introduce 40 new Challenges that will rotate in and out weekly. Players can also take on all-new daily, weekly, seasonal and event Tasks to earn Tix and unlock fresh rewards.</li>
<li><strong>New Brand Partners and Soundtrack Additions: </strong>New brands are joining the in-game store, including NHS’s Santa Cruz, Independent and Creature. Season 1 also brings 21 new songs with a 90’s vibe – featuring tracks from Bad Religion, Dinosaur Jr., Ice Cube and more. The full track drops soon!</li>
<li><strong>Lightning Update and skate.Pass: </strong>Launching alongside Season 1 is the brand new Lighting Update and skate.Pass, which you can read more about in <strong><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/the-grind-vol-six">The Grind Vol. 6.</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Skate might technically be in early access, but the game is free-to-play and available across PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, and Xbox One.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-with-the-full-game-on-the-cart">A 'proper' physical</a> release for the game on Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/yooka-replaylee-gets-a-launch-date-on-switch-2-full-physical-release-confirmed">was confirmed</a> when the digital launch was announced (which is much sooner - next week, in fact, on 9th October), but we can now ditch those placeholders in the knowledge that the Switch 2 cart will arrive on shelves in time for Christmas.</p>
<p>The physical version on all platforms comes with some extra goodies: a map and some stickers. Here's how the PR blurb puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This physical edition for Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PlayStation 5 includes the base game (with physical cartridge for Nintendo Switch 2), a collectible game map poster, and an exclusive character sticker pack. All platform versions will be priced at $49.99 USD (SRP).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This reworking is described as the "definitive rebuilt and enhanced version", which not only gives <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/yooka-laylee">the 2017 Kickstarter success</a> a significant glow-up for modern platforms, but also throws in a ton of new pagies, new minigames, remixed worlds, and an orchestral soundtrack featuring lush new arrangements of Grant Kirkhope, David Wise, and Steve Burke's tunes.</p>
<p>The team at Playtonic recently confirmed that the Switch 2 version would be running at 30fps, although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/yooka-replaylee-runs-at-30fps-on-switch-2-team-investigating-performance-mode">they've said</a> that they're "investigating the possibility of implementing a performance mode to follow some time post launch".</p>

			<p>The multiplayer beta for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-october/">now live in its early access period</a> for users who've pre-ordered the game and Xbox Game Pass subscribers. It'll be live for anyone who wants to check out the beta, not included in those two categories, on October 5, but even before it opens to the general public, reports have surfaced across social media that cheaters are running amuck through the game.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-beta-is-out-and-is-already-plagued-by-cheaters">Eurogamer</a>, after a bunch of <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/ca/en/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-ricochet-anti-cheat-update">talk from Treyarch and Activision about its new and improved anti-cheat</a>, which even goaded cheaters on by saying, "<em>Cheaters will try to test the limits during the Beta. That’s exactly what we want because #TeamRICOCHET is here, watching, learning, and removing them as they appear</em>," cheaters have taken up the challenge Activison put to them.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In fairness, the above clip comes from an account that<a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1973874240253489434"> Treyarch has already found and banned</a>, so the team is indeed doing its best to get rid of cheaters as they appear, but this doesn't say very much about the preventative measures, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-beta-how-to-enable-secure-boot/">adding the same Secure Boot protections that Battlefield 6 has</a>, in Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>Is it enough for Treyarch to ban these accounts after they've already gotten in-game and ruined a match or two? On one level, yes, as long as cheaters are being caught, then you could argue that's the anti-cheat protections working well. That said, the players who have their matches ruined by cheaters who are only caught after the fact might not feel that way.</p>



<p>As long as there are people playing multiplayer games, there will be those who will cheat, and it's a constant battle for developers to minimize the impact of cheaters as much as possible. But it's worth asking what these kernel-level measures are for if they're not even prepared for the opening hours of an annual beta test. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-devs-explain-why-the-game-has-an-obnoxious-install-size-on-pc.1315768/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I don’t play <i>Helldivers 2</i> nearly as much as I should. But the last time I called in the stratagem that is installing the game through Steam, I sat in awe at the absurdly massive 141.51GB install size. My drives are perpetually overflowing with nonsense, so it really is a me problem. But seriously? Why the hell is this game so large? Thankfully, Arrowhead Game Studios has an answer.</p> <p>In a recent “<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286">Tech Blog</a>,” Arrowhead’s deputy technical director explained just why we all have to flinch at that colossal storage requirement upon installing or reinstalling <i>Helldivers 2</i> on PC. Turns out, it’s old, platter-based storage mediums with their slow, spinny discs to blame. Unlike more modern solid state drives that have evolved beyond the need for mechanical moving parts, hard-disk drives (HDDs) are really slow, and by duplicating various bits of data, you can improve performance for those on older hardware.</p>

 <p>So yeah, that massive install size actually represents multiple copies of the various bits of code that make up <i>Helldivers 2</i>. As the blog states, this is done to put essential data “in physically close proximity to where they would be needed in the game.” This reduces the “seek time” an HDD needs to do to load up something. The blog continues:</p>

 <blockquote><p>For example, our build system will ensure that a copy of a tree texture is stored on the same part of the disk as the level geometry data. When the game loads the level, the read head can access all the necessary information on a single, continuous sweep, without having to “seek” to a different location. This dramatically speeds up loading times.</p></blockquote> <p>The blog spills some digital ink speculating whether or not, in 2025, saddling everyone with duplicated files is necessary–especially when common practice for building a PC has been to use an SSD for quite some time. Based on Steam user surveys, Arrowhead says it thinks about 12 percent of PC gamers on the platform still use old-school spinny drives. And since <i>Helldivers 2</i> is a multiplayer game, that means you want that 12 percent to also be loading into the game as fast as you are. So yeah, it’s not just about catering to these players specifically. It’s about making sure everyone, even those who don’t have access to a more modern drive, still has a good, speedy time. Real woke shit right there.</p> <p>That said, if you have an older machine and can’t afford a meatier graphics card or CPU upgrade yet, switching over to an SSD is one of the more affordable options for improving not just your gaming, but your entire machine’s performance. And hey, even a 512GB SSD is <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">cheaper than a year of Game Pass right now</a>.</p>

                <p>Aggro Crab is at it again with another frenetic physics-based cooperative game. After taking the gaming world by storm with Peak, which Aggro Crab co-developed with Landfall, the studio has given a first look at its next title, a four-player forklift co-op game called Crashout Crew. A demo for the game will be available during this month's Steam Next Fest.</p><p>The announcement trailer showcases four players attempting to fulfill warehouse orders, driving unusually fast forklifts that drift and boost, yielding predictably hilarious results as they spin out and bounce around.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1973794973847072977" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">welcome to 💥CRASHOUT CREW💢<br>form a crew of up to 4 overworked friends and drift into a frantic co-op forklift experience where teamwork is key, disaster is inevitable and managing stress is all on you.<br>DEMO drops Oct 13th as part of Steam Next Fest‼️<br>it's time to clock tf in. <a href="https://t.co/xZFL9ezwPT" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/xZFL9ezwPT</a></p>  — AGGRO CRAB 💥 (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1973794973847072977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3583210/view/524229329545071235?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam Community post</a>, Aggro Crab describes the warehouse as a "full-blown raceway" in which players aim to fulfill contracts that have unique and unusual boxes to ship. The trailer shows off a couple of examples, such as fragile eggs that will break if run over and crates filled with bees that will unleash a swarm if mishandled.</p><p>The Steam Next Fest demo, playable from October 13-20, will feature three of these contracts, which can be modified with "safety violations" to add layers of difficulty. Crashout Crew has a broad 2026 release window.</p><p>Aggro Crab began work on both Crashout Crew and Peak after canceling a sequel to the studio's dungeon-crawler roguelike Going Under. While some at Aggro Crab worked on Peak with Landfall, the rest of the studio "locked in" on Crashout Crew, which was conceptualized at a game jam.</p><p>So fret not, Peak fans, as Aggro Crab promises that Peak is still receiving updates. Last month, the climbing co-op game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peaks-latest-patch-brings-major-fixes-and-color-blindness-mode/1100-6534562/" data-ref-id="1100-6534562">received some major fixes</a>, most notably a colorblindness mode, and a recent update even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peak-players-are-passing-time-at-the-airport-in-increasingly-elaborate-ways/1100-6535123/" data-ref-id="1100-6535123">added activities to the airport lobby</a>.</p>

During the conversation, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/about-that-ea-deal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hosted on Dring's The Game Business Show website and podcast</a>, the two discussed Battlefield 6's highly successful beta--which attracted an estimated 25 million players, surpassed 2.4 million Steam wishlists, and has 1.7 million Steam preorders. These figures, according to van Dreunen and London-based market researchers Ampere Analysis, suggest that Battlefield 6 could absolutely dominate at launch.</p>

<p>"However, Battlefield 6 clearly has huge momentum," Dring wrote. "Ampere believes the game will sell five million units in its first week, and the excitement for the game is growing as we near its October 10 launch. It's pretty much guaranteed a big day one, and if it can deliver a strong start, that will likely have a knock-on effect on Call of Duty (which arrives over a month later)."</p><p>For reference, <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2021/12/03/insider-battlefield-2042-reportedly-sells-over-4-million-copies-in-first-week" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reports suggest</a> that 2021's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/" data-ref-id="5000-532981">Battlefield 2024</a> sold 4.23 million units within its first week.</p><p>Call of Duty and Battlefield are fairly different beasts, with the former focusing mostly on smaller engagements and direct firefights while the latter is known for its enormous maps and blend of infantry and vehicular combat. However, they nevertheless fight for a similar audience, and we've often seen them matched up against each other during the fall gaming blitz.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s second Prime Day of the year is just around the corner, which means it’s a great time to finally make some computer upgrades happen. If you’re on the hunt for a compact desktop that keeps up with your productive days, the Dell OptiPlex 7020 MFF mini PC is going for $1,000 on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4465/">It typically retails for almost $3,399, so this is a whopping $2,399 off (71% off) the regular price tag.</a> There’s enough power for all your everyday plus resource-intensive tasks, and it’s an easy yes at the current discount. Just act fast, because the offer might wrap up any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4465/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast, Reliable Performance for All Tasks At Hand</h2>
<p>This isn’t one of those ultra-compact mini PCs that fit in the palm of your hand. Those are great if you just need something basic for everyday tasks, but you’re usually trading off a lot of power for the size. The OptiPlex 7020 is slightly bigger, but still easy to carry around.</p>
<p>It boasts a 14th Gen Intel Core i7-14700T processor with 20 cores (8 performance + 12 efficiency), and is also capable of hitting up to 5.2GHz speeds. This translates into ultra-fast performance for all your tasks, whether it’s using a bunch of different applications at once, dealing with never-ending spreadsheets, working on creative projects, or even gaming. The built-in 32GB of DDR5 RAM keeps things running smoothly, while the 1TB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD makes sure you’re not stuck waiting around for the system to boot and the programs to load. Average work days will feel a lot more productive and, honestly, a lot less frustrating.</p>



<p>For connectivity, you’ve got Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth, plus a whole bunch of ports for all your essentials, including one USB-C 3.2 Gen 2×2, three USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, one USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, two USB 2.0, two DisplayPort 1.4a, one HDMI 1.4b, one RJ-45 Ethernet, and a universal audio jack. The DisplayPorts, HDMI, and USB-C here also let you connect up to four displays, so there’s plenty of room for expansion as well.</p>
<p>This mini PC runs on Windows 11 Pro, and you even get a keyboard and mouse in the box. Setting it up and getting started is easy. Those who like their desks to be as clean as possible will appreciate how it just mounts at the back of your monitor. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4465/">Just be sure to grab it while it’s still discounted (-71%).</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/good-boy-does-the-dog-die-horror-movie-indy-showtimes-2000631497</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fellow-animal-lovers-i-promise-the-dog-horror-movie-is-safe-to-watch-and-also-very-good.1315732/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>If you’re a fan of horror movies or dogs, you’ve probably heard about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/good-boy-trailer-horror-movie-dog-actor-release-date-2000618245"><i><span>Good Boy</span></i></a><span>, the horror movie in which the events play out from the perspective of a retriever named Indy. I am a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-nickname-pet-name-go-black-white-legends-arceus-1850392164"><span>card-carrying dog lover</span></a><span> who can barely stand to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-rocket-raccoon-animal-vio-1850408326"><span>see an animal distressed in a movie</span></a><span>, and I still bravely made my way to the theater to see the film after being intrigued by its premise and the rave reviews coming out of advance screenings earlier this year. I had resigned myself to possibly leaving the movie early if Indy’s No Good Very Bad Night proved to be too much. Thankfully, I didn’t feel the need to, and I was actually really impressed with the titular good boy’s performance, considering Indy had no prior movie training. If you’re a fellow animal lover who’s wary of the film, I understand your hesitation, but </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>is an interesting enough experiment that it’s worth seeing, and is surprisingly restrained as far as the horrors it subjects its furry star to.</span></p> <p><span>We won’t get into major spoilers until later, and we’ll put a big ol’ spoiler warning over it if you’re concerned about that, but what I left </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>most excited to talk about was how well it masks Indy’s lack of film experience. After the movie, director and co-writer Ben Leonberg presents a short documentary breaking down how he and his crew managed to pull off a horror movie starring a dog who had no prior training. Indy is Leonberg’s dog, and </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>was filmed with a small crew of people the dog was familiar with. So any time you see his character upset or scared, he’s actually just chilling. Leonberg explains how almost every shot of this pup is only made unnerving or scary by the surrounding shots of ghostly figures and the ominous music.</span></p>

 <p><span>Indy may not know he’s in a movie, but</span><i><span> Good Boy </span></i><span>is tailor-made for him and his perspective. Scenes are shot from his level, and you go long stretches of the movie without seeing a human face. </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>isn’t merely a horror movie with a dog in its cast; it is a horror movie that makes every creative decision in its tight 72-minute runtime to emphasize that he is the star of this waking nightmare. </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>follows Indy as he and his owner, Todd, move from the city to the family’s seemingly haunted rural home. From the outset, Indy sees ghosts his owner doesn’t, and as Todd’s condition worsens, Indy begins to fear they may be a threat to the ailing human.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000618247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618247"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618247">© IFC</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Thanks to some smart filmmaking decisions, good editing, and shot composition, Indy is a very emotive actor for someone who has no idea what’s going on. In the documentary, Leonberg and his crew show how they would make sounds from behind the camera to get the dog to look where they needed, and his lack of training meant that they could spend all day shooting and only get a few seconds of usable footage. The whole production took over a year because the team was committed to Indy being the star, and I mean, look at that face. That’s a face made for the big screen.</span></p>

 <p><span>But you’re probably wondering if Indy is shown suffering throughout the movie. The horror genre has a way of putting its stars through grave situations that usually end with them bloodied and battered, if not worse. Without spoilers, I will say that </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>is pretty tame as far as what it subjects Indy to for most of the film. I imagine that was a conscious choice, considering, again, Indy isn’t an acting dog, and the more distressing moments his character is put through are some of </span><i><span>Good Boy</span></i><span>’s more awkward shots because it was clear the crew didn’t want to stress the pup out, so some scenes, like when Indy stumbles into a fox trap, are a little clunky, but they’re also very quick.</span></p>

 <p><span>Now, for the question a lot of you may be wondering: Does Indy die? I can tell you that </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>doesn’t do a lot of terrible shit to its canine star, and none of that will matter if the poor baby doesn’t make it to the end, right? Well, here’s a spoiler warning, so if you don’t want to know, don’t scroll down any further.</span></p>

   <p><span>No, Indy doesn’t die in </span><i><span>Good Boy</span></i><span>, but another dog does. As Indy investigates his new home, he learns about Todd’s recently deceased grandfather, who was also subjected to the horrors of this house. The old man also had a dog named Bandit who could see the same monsters Indy does, and Todd mentions that his grandfather’s dogs all “ran away” over the years. Well, that wasn’t true for at least one of them. At a point later in the film when shit’s getting real, Indy finds Bandit’s skeleton in the house cellar. In a few instances, Bandit’s “ghost” tries to help Indy by guiding him to clues within the house, but he’s only able to do this because he’s already dead under the house. If that’s a deal breaker for you, I understand. But if you’re primarily worried about on-screen dog suffering, </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>is as about as light on it as it can be with its premise.</span></p> <p><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>is such an interesting, imaginative movie that I do urge people who just enjoy cinema to give it a watch, even if they’re worried the subject matter might be challenging. The movie is an experiment that really pays off because its crew commits, and the moments where it pulls its punches speak to that commitment to its star’s comfort. If the premise scares you off, that’s understandable, but if you’re even mildly curious, as a dog lover myself, I say it’s worth giving it a shot.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> developer Arrowhead Studios still doesn't have a solution for the shooter's groaning installation size on PC — but it is working on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>update</u></a> posted to Steam earlier today, Arrowhead's deputy technical director, Brendan Armstrong, penned the first in a series of posts in which the engineering team talks about the "technical health" of the game, as well as the "technical challenges we're working through."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Admitting that the installation size "seems to be a hot topic right now" — at 150GB, Helldivers 2 takes up three times the space on PC than it does on console — the developer revealed that one of the reasons the PC size is so much bigger is because of data duplication and mechanical hard drives.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The main issue with a mechanical HDD is seek time," Armstrong explained. "An HDD stores data on a spinning platter, and a physical arm with a read head has to move across the platter to find and retrieve data. The time it takes for this arm to 'seek' or move to the correct location is a significant performance bottleneck. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Imagine a large game level with various objects — trees, rocks, buildings, props. If the data for these objects is scattered all over the hard drive, the read head has to physically jump around the disk, which adds a lot of time to the loading process."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, the director added, is why Arrowhead deliberately duplicates certain data files like a common tree texture or a sound effect and "place copies of them in physically close proximity to where they would be needed in the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Much of the data in the PC version of Helldivers 2 is duplicated. The practice of duplicating data to reduce loading times is a game development technique that is primarily used to optimize games for older storage media, particularly mechanical HDDs and optical discs like DVDs," the director explained. "This practice is largely unnecessary for games deployed on Solid State Drives (SSDs) which is why the console versions of Helldivers 2 do not do this."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, the post admits that with the advent of SSDs — which store data on flash memory chips that have no moving parts — seek time is virtually nonexistent, but as long as mechanical HDDs are part of the minimum spec PC requirements, it has to be included. Steam user surveys are "unable to give us data on mechanical HDD use in the overall gamer population," but Arrowhead's "best estimates" put it at around 12% of all PC gamers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Until we can more accurately determine the number of mechanical HDDs that Helldivers 2 is installed on, it is difficult to know how many players will be impacted by reducing the amount of data duplication," the post said. "Even if that number is small, keep in mind that the load time for each player dropping into a mission is determined by the slowest member of the squad."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Helldivers 2 Review Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Arrowhead grapples with this issue and tries to get better data on how many of their players use mechanical HDDs, the team said it's made "some small gains in the next update" by sweeping for unused assets and "obvious problems," but admits we "will not likely notice them because the new stuff we’ve added will eat those gains."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the longer term, the team will make improvements to the engine to ensure the game doesn't waste RAM loading common data that isn't needed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Beyond that, the remaining work is a bigger, riskier, more speculative project where we apply some kind of compression to the game data and potentially replicate some of the de-duplication we do on consoles," the post concludes. "We don’t yet know if the impacts to load-times could make these approaches infeasible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’re taking your concerns very seriously but there are no easy solutions. Until we live in a world where we know that most of our PC players are using SSD drives, sacrificing some extra hard drive space is necessary to ensure we’re all able to load into missions in a reasonable amount of time. We’ve clearly reached the limits of how much duplicated data is acceptable so smarter solutions and compromises are now required. We are very carefully weighing up the costs and tradeoffs of the options we have, and we’ll be sure to find a better balance between loading times and installation size soon."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

But for now, we're going to focus on where you can <em>actually </em>buy Pokémon TCG: Mega Evolution in the US, and find those elusive ETBs, Booster Bundles, and more in stock. Be sure to bookmark this page and check back often to stay informed. We will keep this page updated when there are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-is-up-for-preorder-in-the-uk">developments for the UK</a> and Europe as well <strong>(Update: </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wjV0y?object_uuid=5949c6fe-9e19-4301-910c-85c54d598ef1&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Preorders are live for the UK at Amazon</strong></a><strong>).</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">To make navigating the preorder chaos as easy as possible, here’s the complete breakdown of where to secure your Mega Evolution boxes, bundles, and packs before launch. Just to note, it'll likely cost you, as finding sealed products like these at a fair price is already a challenge. </p><p id="elite-trainer-boxes-etbs"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Elite Trainer Boxes (ETBs)">Mega Evolution: Elite Trainer Boxes (ETBs)</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Evolution is already shaping up to be one of the most competitive Pokémon TCG sets in years, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-brave-symphonia-most-expensive-cards">Mega Lucario ex and Mega Gardevoir ex</a> driving demand through the roof. Unsurprisingly, Elite Trainer Boxes availability is chaotic, and pricing depends heavily on where you shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The retail price is $49.99, but most outlets are out of stock or only show fleeting availability. Best Buy and Walmart do occasionally cycle listings back in at or near MSRP, though they rarely last long once they appear. Amazon and similar retailers are far less reliable, with most third-party sellers inflating prices well into triple digits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to secure the product without the hassle of chasing restocks, TCGPlayer is the most straightforward option, though it comes at a premium. Resale prices there are averaging around $90, while Pokémon Center exclusives have reached roughly $200-$300. The best value remains catching a restock at <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q47mEG?object_uuid=5949c6fe-9e19-4301-910c-85c54d598ef1&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Best Buy</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEg2bG?object_uuid=5949c6fe-9e19-4301-910c-85c54d598ef1&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart</a>, but if reliability matters more than price, TCGPlayer is where you’ll actually get what you want.</p><p id="sealed-boosters"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sealed Boosters">Mega Evolution: Where to Buy Sealed Boosters</h2></p><div catalogid="4aaeaa5d-9765-4a22-8fef-b266790ea2f0" id="227469"><div id="227469" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Booster Box (36 Packs)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAgKV7?object_uuid=5949c6fe-9e19-4301-910c-85c54d598ef1&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Evolution's Booster Box</a> is the best option if you want the largest number of packs in one go. TCGPlayer has them for around $298.21 market price, which breaks down to about $8.28 per pack. That is still a markup versus MSRP (~$5), but still <em>slightly</em> better value than buying singles or smaller bundles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most other major retailers are sold out, so if you want a box right now, a trustworthy site like TCGPlayer is the place to get one, and has the <strong>best prices going in the secondary market right now</strong>.</p></div><div catalogid="4aaeaa5d-9765-4a22-8fef-b266790ea2f0" id="227470"><div id="227470" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Booster Bundle (6 Packs)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If $300 feels too steep, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z12dY?object_uuid=5949c6fe-9e19-4301-910c-85c54d598ef1&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Booster Bundles</a> are the next best option. Each comes with six packs and usually sells for MSRP when available, though they rarely stay in stock anywhere. On TCGPlayer, they run closer to $56.42, which is expensive but reliably available. Yet, they are ultimately also the worse value on paper, at an average cost of $9.40 per pack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, singles are the cheapest way in when retailers have them, typically $4-5 each, but they almost always sell out fast. On TCGPlayer, they sit at about <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEgOjX?object_uuid=5949c6fe-9e19-4301-910c-85c54d598ef1&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$8.62 per pack</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/985MLv?object_uuid=5949c6fe-9e19-4301-910c-85c54d598ef1&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$34.92 for a four-pack</a>, which is pricier but far easier to find. </p></div><div catalogid="4aaeaa5d-9765-4a22-8fef-b266790ea2f0" id="227474"><div id="227474" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sleeved Booster Pack Art Bundle (4 Packs)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Note, that while technically more expensive, buying the four pack of boosters is still more cost effective as you ultimately save on delivery, and that would probably be my recommendation for anyone looking to pick up a few packs without any stress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, there's the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgwVw?object_uuid=5949c6fe-9e19-4301-910c-85c54d598ef1&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blister Packs</a>, which bundle three boosters with a promo card, are another strong choice for casual buyers.

They have not yet seen a wide release, so availability is limited and prices are volatile. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On TCGPlayer, individual boxes are holding steady at around $55, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpL42?object_uuid=5949c6fe-9e19-4301-910c-85c54d598ef1&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">10 unit bundles are pushing closer to $550</a>. Walmart still lists these at $59.99 when they appear, which is a steep jump from the usual $19.99 to $24.99 range and strangely even more than the resale market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The best approach is to wait for wider release and target a box closer to MSRP, but if you want guaranteed access before then, TCGPlayer offers the most reliable option despite its inflated pricing. They are currently set to ship for October 10, 2025.</p></div><p id="uk-preorders"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="UK Preorders">Mega Evolution UK Preorders</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wjV0y?object_uuid=5949c6fe-9e19-4301-910c-85c54d598ef1&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pokemon TCG Mega Evolution - Request Invite Here<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/zj7bmP?object_uuid=5949c6fe-9e19-4301-910c-85c54d598ef1&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Elite Trainer Box – Lucario<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->£44.99</span></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6Dg6R?object_uuid=5949c6fe-9e19-4301-910c-85c54d598ef1&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Elite Trainer Box – Gardevoir<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->£44.99</span></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Q4DPOX?object_uuid=5949c6fe-9e19-4301-910c-85c54d598ef1&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Booster Bundle (6 Booster Packs)<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->£23.94</span></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aADrpp?object_uuid=5949c6fe-9e19-4301-910c-85c54d598ef1&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Booster Display (18 Booster Packs)<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->£71.82</span></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/ao6P3g?object_uuid=5949c6fe-9e19-4301-910c-85c54d598ef1&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Triple Pack – Psyduck<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->£12.99</span></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QWEmpn?object_uuid=5949c6fe-9e19-4301-910c-85c54d598ef1&amp;t=article" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Triple Pack – Golduck<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->£12.99</span></li></ul></div><p id="most-valuable-chase-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Most Valuable Chase Cards">Most Valuable Chase Cards</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/02/top-15-best-chase-cards-pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-ign-1759401864957.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With towering HP values, stunning full-art designs, and the punishing 3-Prize rule when a Mega ex is knocked out, Mega Evolution cards are already making waves in both the collector market and competitive play.
