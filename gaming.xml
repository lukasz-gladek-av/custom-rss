            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has shuttered another western studio: TiMi Montréal.</p>
<p>TiMi – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fired-assassins-creed-creative-director-now-at-tencent">which was headed up by former Assassin's Creed creative director Ashraf Ismail</a> after he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-creative-director-ashraf-ismail-fired-from-ubisoft">let go from Ubisoft</a> amid a flurry of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-more-top-ubisoft-executives-resign-as-publisher-renews-commitment-to-fostering-an-environment-its-employees-can-be-proud-of">high-profile departures</a> in 2020 – seemingly closed on Friday, 20th February.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-timi-montreal-closed">Game File</a> – which says sources had warned that a "shutdown was imminent" – a senior gameplay programmer wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fernandezluzuriaga_today-timi-montreal-is-officially-closing-share-7430638121156784128-RAMk/">LinkedIn</a> that though the team "had been aware this was coming for some time, it doesn't make the reality any easier".</p>
<p>A senior designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7430638121714659328?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7430638121714659328%2C7430644929057415169%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287430644929057415169%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7430638121714659328%29">added</a>: "This team was exceptional not just in talent, but also in camaraderie. It’s one of those experiences that sticks with you for a very long time, and I feel privileged to have been part of it".</p><p>The five-year-old studio had been committed to creating "AAA open-world multi-platform games" but was chiefly working on titles it had inherited from Jade Studio, TiMi's name before 2020, and mobile spin-offs, including Pokémon Unite and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-mobile">Call of Duty: Mobile</a> (which is different from the mobile Warzone game that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-will-shut-down">shutting down in April</a>).</p>
<p>According to its <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/timistudiogroup/">LinkedIn</a> profile, TiMi Group in its entirety employs between 5000 and 10,000 people.</p>
<p><em>An earlier version of this story inadverently classed TiMi as a NetEase studio, not Tencent. We've now updated the story - apologies for any confusion.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-industry-generational-divide-roblox-nintendo-2000672648</link>
            <guid>1443199</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>30 years ago </span><i><span>Toy Story</span></i><span> chronicled a generational conflict between an old-timey pull-string doll and a fancy new one with buttons. The two toys learned to get along. This week a trailer for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/toy-story-5-trailer-woody-tablet-buzz-jesse-bonnie-cast-2000671373"><i><span>Toy Story 5</span></i><span> arrived</span></a><span> showing both toys enacting a </span><a href="https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Butlerian_Jihad"><span>Butlerian Jihad</span></a><span> against tablets. While I agree on the potential detriments of excessive screen-time, it is telling how the creators and intended audience of&nbsp;<em>Toy Story&nbsp;</em>films now identify less with the kid playing with toys and more with the adult who just spent all of dinner hearing about “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/style/clavicular-looksmaxxing-braden-peters.html">looksmaxxing</a>.”</span></p> <p><span>If you’re a child who wants to watch a movie for children, or an adult who wants to watch a movie for adults, you thankfully have options beyond </span><i><span>Toy Story</span></i><span>. Disrupted as it is, the Hollywood entertainment industry has a built-in ecosystem to provide for demographics across all ages. Gaming still doesn’t.</span></p>

 <p><span>It has been an ominous month for the video gaming industry. AI infrastructure is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ram-shortage-ai-pc-gaming-china-cxmt-2000670712"><span>bodying the consumer technology world</span></a><span>. Another </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-website-down-shutting-down-servers-free-to-play-shooter-steam-playercount-2000669734"><span>multi-million-dollar live-service game</span></a><span> failed to meet its mark while Sony appears to be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonys-ps5-era-studio-acquisition-spree-has-been-a-disaster-2000671404"><span>rebuilding themselves</span></a><span> entirely in that image. Not only is Microsoft singularly focused on AI integration, but as I wrote this, the heads of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-goodbye-email-memo-xbox-microsoft-2000672084"><span>Xbox abruptly announced their departure</span></a><span> and replacement with reps from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xboxs-new-boss-promises-not-to-flood-it-with-soulless-ai-slop-2000672087"><span>AI wing of the company</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>All of these dramatic pivots occur in the shadow of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/why-the-video-game-industry-is-dying-2000671338"><span>inconvenient player trends</span></a><span>. More players are playing fewer games. The games they do play </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/most-playstation-5-owners-have-been-playing-the-same-games-since-2022-2000672009"><span>are years old</span></a><span>. Landing a “forever game” is obviously lucrative to the company behind it, and why Sony is wagering they’ll nail at least one for themselves, but it’s a formula that can only shrink the industry.</span></p>

 <p><span>So why, when the population has never been more immersed in gaming, with even</span> <a href="https://www.theesa.com/annual-esa-study-reveals-video-games-universal-appeal-across-generations/"><span>a third of octogenarians</span></a><span> hitting </span><i><span>Candy Crush</span></i><span>, is success so sluggish? Taste and preferences differ across demographics and geographies. Impassioned fans from European rail-sim lovers to Latin fighting game communities make do even when the larger industry doesn’t provide. Those hungry for more deck builders, 4X games and turn-based RPGs will find something to eat.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>But the biggest gap between cultures is time, not space. There we see devastating stagnation. The youngest players are burning unsupervised hours on </span><i><span>Roblox</span></i><span>. The oldest are in Odinsleep until a single-player blockbuster catches their eye. The middle of the pack, getting the hang of disposable income, are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/why-the-video-game-industry-is-dying-2000671338"><span>discovering other ways to spend</span></a><span>. The biggest players in the industry are still waiting for this entire bloc to gravitate toward the next </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span>, but year after year this just looks more like wishful, harmful thinking.</span></p>

 <p><span>Through the ‘90s, the video game industry very intentionally tried to narrow its players down to adolescent males, a controlled demographic that </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/console-wars-nintendo-sega-ad-research/"><span>made marketing much easier</span></a><span>. Movies, music and television did not do this beyond specific programs, because they knew their business relied on having something to sell to everyone. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>It’s no coincidence that the video game industry found its biggest successes when the facade slipped. </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>,</span><span> and the DVD capabilities of the PlayStation 2 were boomtowns, made up of people who did not previously see themselves as the primary audience for games and gaming hardware. The biggest disruptors of the last decade weren’t fantasy RPGs or open-world shooters but </span><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Gaming started to broaden its horizons, even if the dude-focused marketing divisions remained entrenched for years. If there is a crash on the horizon, it’s likely Nintendo will be the ones walking away from it the least scathed (</span><i><span>again)</span></i><span>. Games like </span><i><span>Mario</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Zelda</span></i><span> and <em>Mario </em></span><i><span>Kart</span></i><span> truly are widely beloved across generations, demographically pliable. The company has long understood the importance of trying to redefine what the experience of playing a game can be.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“If we continue to coalesce around the four or five genres, then we won’t get the new players because those people have already said we’re not interested in your genres,” former Sony Interactive Entertainment Chairman Shawn Layden </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-acquisition-preservation-1850951069"><span>said back in 2023</span></a><span>. “Don’t kid yourself that someone who’s said ‘no’ to</span><i><span> Call of Duty</span></i><span> for the last 15 years is going to start suddenly saying ‘yes’ to </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span>.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>It is worth mentioning that sales for </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span>, one of gaming’s evergreen cash cows, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-activision-2000652111"><span>slipped last year</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The current youth, opting for </span><i><span>Roblox</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Five Nights at Freddy’s</span></i><span> lore, are agnostic to the graphics-pushing that once defined industry progress. The people going to concerts, exhausted of being online but still enjoying posting, are compromising with the cruddiest flashcard digicams the 2000s had to offer. The fans who once reliably showed up for every new salvo in the AAA console war are now busy booking colonoscopies.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As gaming rigs return to the $6,000 range, the island of high-performance players will recede to the peninsula of 30,000 or so people who unironically have “XxX” in their username. The biggest gaming companies are placing unsustainable bets that rely on each one of these kinds of players showing up and subscribing to a singular vision of gaming. These are growing pains maturing at the worst possible time. But it’s the result of intentional decisions, not inevitable fate. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>If this industry wants a future for itself, it needs an ecosystem that everyone can participate in for the long haul, from first steps to one foot in the grave. That requires an inclusive approach that is very alien to its foundations. Those players will need a way to discover more than the next live-service game, finding the gaming equivalent to </span><i><span>Sesame Street</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Smiling Friends</span></i><span>,</span><span> and </span><i><span>Saturday Night Live</span></i><span> all on the same idiot box. Edutainment and courtroom dramas alike. The player base is huge. Bigger than ever. Ever growing. They won’t all fit into the next </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An apparent accident on the Southeast Asian YouTube page for Bandai Namco has revealed that the forthcoming Dragon Ball Game, codenamed Age 1000, is actually the next Xenoverse game in the Dragon Ball franchise.</p>



<p>The reveal was spotted by several individuals online when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bandai-namco/" id="1300">Bandai Namco</a> Southeast Asia had placed the Age 1000 reveal trailer in a now-deleted playlist titled “DRAGON BALL Xenoverse 3.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-dragon-ball-xenoverse-3-has-been-a-long-time-coming">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 3 Has Been A Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>It’s been nearly a full decade since the last game in the franchise was released. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2/" id="2178">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</a> was released in October 2016. The game has received numerous quality-of-life updates and has proven to be one of the most enduring modern Action RPGs.</p>



<p>The premise of the Dragon Ball Xenoverse titles is for players to create their own character in the universe of Z Fighters and level them up while experiencing brand new stories featuring classic heroes and villains from the Dragon Ball franchise.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-age-1000-fans-dragon-ball-online/" id="171842">When the game was revealed in January</a>, some believed it would be a follow-up to Dragon Ball Online, a 2010 MMORPG that has since been replaced by the Xenoverse line.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-game-features-new-work-from-akira-toriyama">The Game Features New Work From Akira Toriyama</h2>



<p>Despite his unfortunate passing in 2024, this new game will feature work from Akira Toriyama himself. Work began on the Age of 1000 project more than half a decade ago, and as such, Toriyama was able to work on world-building for the new title and brand-new characters.</p>



<p>More information about the game will be revealed during Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour on April 18 and 19. For more Dragon Ball on Insider Gaming, check out the upcoming DLC for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-summer-202-dlc-revealed-with-new-characters/" id="171864">Dragon Ball Sparking Zero.</a></p>

<p>The hugely-anticipated sequel to the brilliant roguelike deck-building game is set to feature "new cards, characters, events, enemies, environments, and more," with developer Mega Crit teasing, "will you attempt the climb alone... or enlist the aid of your fellow adventurers?"</p>
<p>That's right – while, like its predecessor, Slay the Spire 2 is listed as single-player on Steam, it looks like four-player online co-op will also be available from launch day.</p>

<p>According to the new teaser, players can also expect all-new relics, potions, abilities, and alternate acts – more on those below – when the game finally releases for PC via Steam next month. It's currently the sixth most-wishlisted game on Steam, behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, Deadlock, Light no Fire, Resident Evil Requiem, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>.</p><p>Developer Mega Crit had been aiming for an autumn 2025 release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slay-the-spire-2-has-been-delayed-but-it-wasnt-silksongs-fault-promise">but pushed it back to an unspecified Thursday in March 2026</a>, insisting at the time that "there's no single dramatic reason [for the delay]. Some personal life stuff hit the team (everyone's okay!), we kept saying 'wouldn't it be cool if...' one too many times, and honestly, the game just needs more polish to meet our standards".</p>
<p>I'm delighted to report that Slay the Spire 2 looks a lot like Slay the Spire 1  – which is a good thing – but upon closer inspection has some notable differences. As we summarised at the time, a lot of effort has gone into improving the visual presentation of the game, including 3D models in 2D environments, and a great deal more content stuffed in.</p>
<p>There are also alternate acts that allow you to choose different "a" and "b" variations of acts when you replay the game to help ease rerun repetition. Each alteration is said to have "radically" different environments, enemies, events, and bosses.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-wildlight-tencent-funding-layoffs-servers-2000669790">Tencent-backed</a> TiMi Montreal is shutting down less than five years after opening and without ever shipping a game. It appears to be the latest casualty of Chinese publishers pulling back on investment in North American studios.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-timi-montreal-closed?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true">first reported by <em>Game File</em></a>, news of the closure began to trickle out on LinkedIn late last week. “I am genuinely heartbroken that the public will never get to experience what this team was capable of producing,” one laid-off programmer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fernandezluzuriaga_today-timi-montreal-is-officially-closing-share-7430638121156784128-RAMk/">wrote</a>. “TiMi Montreal was made up of really talented people and working with them was a privilege, the level of skill and dedication on this team was something special.”</p> <p>The studio was founded back in 2021 and was pitched as working on “AAA open world multi-platform games.” It joined TiMi Los Angeles and TiMi Seattle as the third office of TiMi Studio Group in North America. The company behind mobile hits like <em>Honor of Kings</em> and <em>Arena of Valor</em> was trying to branch out into bigger-budget blockbusters.</p>

 <p>A studio in Montreal seemed to outsiders like the perfect way to scoop up talent from open-world adventure factory Ubisoft. That included <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em> creative director Ashraf Ismail, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/07/28/ashraf-ismail-tencent-ubisoft">who joined TiMi in 2022</a> after being fired from Ubisoft following allegations <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-creative-director-fired-from-ubisoft-f-1844724819">around some of his personal romantic relationships</a>.</p> <p>But TiMi Montreal never announced a game it was making, or disclosed any co-development support it was providing on any recently shipped projects. TiMi’s L.A.-based studio Team Kaiju, which attracted former leads from <em>Halo</em> and<em> Battlefield</em>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-closes-shop-on-team-kaiju">ended up shutting down back in 2023</a>. The retreat follows concerns about pricey development costs in the U.S. and competitors like NetEase cutting investment in <a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-scifi-bioware-1851707754">a bunch of recent studio startups</a> over the past couple of years.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has shuttered another western studio: TiMi Montréal.</p>
<p>TiMi – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fired-assassins-creed-creative-director-now-at-tencent">which was headed up by former Assassin's Creed creative director Ashraf Ismail</a> after he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-creative-director-ashraf-ismail-fired-from-ubisoft">let go from Ubisoft</a> amid a flurry of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-more-top-ubisoft-executives-resign-as-publisher-renews-commitment-to-fostering-an-environment-its-employees-can-be-proud-of">high-profile departures</a> in 2020 – seemingly closed on Friday, 20th February.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-timi-montreal-closed">Game File</a> – which says sources had warned that a "shutdown was imminent" – a senior gameplay programmer wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fernandezluzuriaga_today-timi-montreal-is-officially-closing-share-7430638121156784128-RAMk/">LinkedIn</a> that though the team "had been aware this was coming for some time, it doesn't make the reality any easier".</p>
<p>A senior designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7430638121714659328?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7430638121714659328%2C7430644929057415169%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287430644929057415169%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7430638121714659328%29">added</a>: "This team was exceptional not just in talent, but also in camaraderie. It’s one of those experiences that sticks with you for a very long time, and I feel privileged to have been part of it".</p><p>The five-year-old studio had been committed to creating "AAA open-world multi-platform games" but was chiefly working on titles it had inherited from Jade Studio, TiMi's name before 2020, and mobile spin-offs, including Pokémon Unite and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-mobile">Call of Duty: Mobile</a> (which is different from the mobile Warzone game that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-will-shut-down">shutting down in April</a>).</p>
<p>According to its <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/timistudiogroup/">LinkedIn</a> profile, TiMi Group in its entirety employs between 5000 and 10,000 people.</p>
<p><em>An earlier version of this story inadverently classed TiMi as a NetEase studio, not Tencent. We've now updated the story - apologies for any confusion.</em></p>

              <p>Every game in <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> series is defined, in part, by its aesthetics, the visual design choices coalescing every element into one cohesive vision. Even during the Hylian hero’s original 8-bit journey, strong art direction transformed simple sprites into sprawling labyrinths, mysterious woods, and terrible foes in the player’s imagination. While the core of <em>Zelda</em>’s story and gameplay has remained (until recently) mostly the same, the series reinvents itself artistically with nearly every entry.</p> <p><em>This article was originally published on June 27, 2023. It’s been republished today following the 40th anniversary of </em>Zelda<em>‘s launch in Japan.</em></p> <p>Looking back on the 40 year history of the franchise, one thing is clear: Link has had a lot of looks.</p>

 <p>Cel-shaded oceans, lonely ranches, and apocalyptic moon landings all paint the diverse canvas that is <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, but which entries truly <em>look</em> the best? There’s no bad-looking <em>Zelda</em> game—<a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-the-wand-of-gamelon-the-kotaku-review-1818811388">not from Nintendo, anyway</a>—but today we want to rank the most aesthetically inspired, from least inspired to most. We’ll be considering all the mainline <em>Zelda</em> entries, and please keep in mind that this isn’t a ranking of the best games in the series, but rather the best-looking.</p> <p>Let’s step into the art gallery that is <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> and take a look around.</p>

Pokémon turns 30 on 27th February, and in honour of this momentous anniversary, we've run a series of polls leading up to the big day, asking you to vote for your favourite Pokémon from each generation.

            <title><![CDATA[Elon Musk Reportedly Delayed An Update To Grok Because It Kept Getting Questions About Baldur’s Gate 3 Wrong]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-baldurs-gate-3-grok-xai-2000672632</link>
            <guid>1443139</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Elon Musk, currently on track to become the world’s first trillionaire, is apparently obsessed with <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grok-ai-deepfakes-undressed-images-2000658486">teaching Grok about video games</a>. The xAI-powered chatbot was reportedly so bad at answering questions about <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a> last year that Musk actually delayed a major update to its model so the problem could be rectified.</p> <p>That bizarre anecdote comes from a recent <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-xai-leadership-style-big-year-grok-ipo-spacex-2026-2">deep-dive investigation into xAI by <em>Business Insider</em></a>. Musk’s penchant for chaos and micromanagement was apparently so bad that when confronted with Grok’s inability to correctly parse details about Larian Studios’ hit 2023 RPG based on <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, he pulled top engineers off other projects to get the chatbot sorted.</p>

 <p>“In one instance last year, a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game ‘Baldur’s Gate,’ according to people familiar with the matter. High-level engineers were pulled from other projects to improve the responses before launch, they said,” <em>Business Insider</em> writes.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Can I have just one normal week <a href="https://t.co/bip2afWQLe">pic.twitter.com/bip2afWQLe</a></p> <p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/2025332627645808932?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Lest you think this episode was a one-off, Musk was also apparently obsessed with teaching Grok how to play <em>League of Legends</em>. Some former xAI employees reportedly compare how the company is run to a never-ending fire drill. There are multiple “war rooms” running at the Palo Alto headquarters to tackle urgent issues, including getting Grok to Challenger rank in Riot Games’ popular MOBA.</p>

 <p>“At the end of 2025, at least five war rooms were running simultaneously, according to three people,” writes <em>Business Insider</em>. “One, they said, was dedicated to teaching Grok how to play one of Musk’s favorite video games, ‘League of Legends.'”</p>

 <p>That definitely sounds like the unparalleled, no-drugs grindset of someone worth a trillion dollars. It’s worth noting that all of this was happening the year following Musk exposing himself as <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670">a massive cheater</a> in games like<em> Diablo 4</em> and <em>Path of Exile 2</em>. <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>‘s own publishing head was busy calling out Musk’s promises of AI-generated video games <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-elon-musk-ai-xai-douse-2000632638">for missing the point</a>.</p>

              <p><span>Ever see those Facebook reels where </span><i><span>Mortal Kombat 1</span></i><span> modders try to dupe strangers into thinking NetherRealm Studios added Shrek and Captain Jack Sparrow to their fighting game to decapitate one another? Something along those lines capped off this year’s figure skating competition at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan as Sub-Zero, Deadpool and Kung Fu Panda squared off on the global stage.</span></p> <p><span>Kazakhstan skater Mikhail Shaidorov won the gold in men’s figure skating this year, the first from his country to land that prize. He’s also the first Olympic figure skater, ever, to best the Lin Kuei. During the Exhibition Gala, the closing, non-competitive, often silly segment, Shaidorov came out on the ice dressed like Jack Black’s famed Dreamworks cartoon martial artist. There he danced to Carl Douglas’s “Kung Fu Fighting,” doing some friendly sparring with Deadpool and Sub-Zero before farting on them, the sound effect echoing in the arena of champions.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Awesome performance! Mortal Kombat makes a special appearance at the winter Olympics! <a href="https://twitter.com/MortalKombat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MortalKombat</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/noobde?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@noobde</a> <a href="https://t.co/dD4DVJNIhd">pic.twitter.com/dD4DVJNIhd</a></p> <p>— The Freelancer (@TehFreelancer) <a href="https://twitter.com/TehFreelancer/status/2025388611852525942?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>     <p><span>It wasn’t the only bit of Disney on Ice goofiness this year. Earlier pairs skated to “Cotton Eyed Joe” and “Macarena.” Georgia’s Luka Berulava, who was the one dressed like Sub-Zero, joined partner Anastasiia Metelkina (dressed like Kitana) for a routine to The Immortals’ famed </span><i><span>Mortal Kombat</span></i><span> theme. The two ended with the warbled, dazed stance Mortal Kombatants do ahead of having their intestines ripped out.</span></p> <p><span>Needless to say I have never been more confused about IP rights at the Olympic games. Earlier in the week, during competitive performances, chaos brewed as several figure skaters, such as American gold medalist Amber Glenn, </span><a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/why-olympic-figure-skaters-struggle-with-music-licensing/"><span>struggled to secure licensing</span></a> <span>to the music used for their performances. This included Spain’s Tomàs-Llorenç, who performed </span><a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2026/02/09/minions-figure-skater-music-olympics/"><span>dressed like a Minion</span></a><span>. This blurred even more and even stranger when Czech skaters Katerina Mrazkova and Daniel Mrazek skated to an AI-generated song clearly </span><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/sports/olympic-team-faces-massive-backlash-after-using-ai-in-gold-medal-attempt-11492672"><span>leaning on samples from AC/DC</span></a><span>. However the legality shakes out, it’s clear that </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>-ification has already spread to the Olympic village.</span><span><br> </span></p>

            <p>Qiddiya Investment Company (QIC) has now completed its acquisition of the Evolution Championship Series – Evo, as it's more commonly known – and insists that "Evo's traditions, values, and identity will remain unchanged" under its new parent company.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fighting-game-players-in-uproar-after-evos-new-saudi-government-owners-calls-to-support-grassroots-events">Fighting game players were up in arms when news broke last year that RTS</a> – a gaming talent agency and owner of the Evo tournament series – would be acquired by the Saudi Arabian mega city project, Qiddiya.</p>
<p>As Eurogamer reported at the time the news broke, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fighting-game-players-in-uproar-after-evos-new-saudi-government-owners-calls-to-support-grassroots-events">the response online from fighting game community members was largely one of disappointment</a>, as various fans of the genre came out to express sadness at the new owner – which is a subsidiary of Mohammed bin Salman's Public Investment Fund (PIF) – and emphasised the importance of supporting grassroots community-run events given Saudi Arabia has been criticised by Human Rights organisations for its prolific use of slavery, the death penalty, and more.</p>
<p>Now, in a <a href="https://evo.gg/news/2026-business-update">statement</a> posted to Evo's website now the acquisition has completed, the organisation said it will "stage major international events" in Tokyo, Las Vegas, and Nice, France, later this year, "as it continues its role as a global platform for competitive excellence, cultural exchange, and community connection".</p><p>"Under RTS ownership, Evo's traditions, values, and identity will remain unchanged, with a continued focus on serving players, fans, and publishers at every level of the industry," the statement said. "Key leadership will remain in place, ensuring long-term stability, including Stuart Saw in his role as Chief Executive Officer at RTS."</p>
<p>Qiddiya's chief strategy officer, Muhannad Aldawood, added: "Evo is a global gaming institution, built on community, competition, and creativity. Through RTS and Qiddiya City, we are committed to supporting Evo's long-term growth in a way that respects its heritage and strengthens its role within the global Fighting Game Community. This is about investing in the future of play, and safeguarding what makes Evo special."</p>
<p>Numerous fans are not convinced, however.</p>
<p>"Support your locals any way you can, folks. I was already on my way out of Evo because I don’t like how corporate the scene has become," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1r94pvj/comment/o69vznc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> one commenter. "I don’t even want fighting games to be a scene anymore, just play and watch the games you like, give feedback that you care about, and growth will come organically." Another simply <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1r94pvj/comment/o69zec4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a>: "And this, everybody, is why supporting grassroots locals should still be the priority over pushing big tentpole tournaments."</p>
<p>A number of prolific players and content creators in the fighting game community, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1pq6xzu/sajam_boycotting_all_evo_events/">Sajam</a>, have pledged not to attend Evo this year.</p>

            <p>Nintendo is reportedly issuing refunds for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-10">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> upgrade.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, as the new release is officially known, released earlier this week. Following similar Switch 2 upgrades for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-fans-its-happening-nintendo-a-drops-a-surprise-switch-2-upgrade-for-xenoblade-chronicles-x-with-60fps-and-more">for £4.19/$4.99 USD, players with the Switch 1 version can get 4K and "up to" 60fps support in TV mode</a>, plus 1080p and "up to" 60fps when playing in handheld mode. Theoretically, anyway.</p>

"Long range textures seem to have [been applied] a convolution filter on it. And the overall image seems to be just FHD being upscales and antialiased with strong filters. Not really a true high resolution game.</p>

<p>Tamodolo was so unhappy, in fact, that they wrote to Nintendo requesting a refund.</p>
<p>"I just asked mine saying that the image quality of the upgraded version is worse than the original game (which is true)," they wrote. "They said that they normally don't refund digital games but can do in this case after analysing the problem. (which they did in something like one and a half minute).</p>
<p>"What I wanted to comunicate to Nintendo by doing this: This isn't the Nintendo quality I expected and [received] until now so I'll not pay for something that deliver less quality than a free patch."</p>
<p>They then told other unhappy players to follow suit, and to contact Nintendo via the form on the eShop.</p>
<p>"I [encourage] you all doing this to pass the message to Nintendo that this level of quality for something that is paid isn't acceptable and they need to improve."</p>
<p>"If we continue to ask for refunds, they might actually work on fixing it," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/1racsik/comment/o6j06u7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">responded</a> one commenter, while another confirmed they too had received a refund, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/1racsik/comment/o6iwl6s/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">writing</a>: "Did the same thing, talked to chat support for like five minutes, and got a refund. Told them pretty much the same thing, the upgrade makes the game look worse (I'm handheld only). No fighting, I just gave them the numbers they asked for and its on its way."</p><p>Eurogamer had good things to say about Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition when we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review">gave it four stars last year</a>, saying that while "not all its additions are for the better... this excavation of Monolith Soft's alien opus remains as fascinating and enthralling as it was a decade ago." Of course, that wasn't reviewed on the Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p><em>Tetris</em> has been immortalized in a playable McDonald’s <a href="https://retrododo.com/mcdonalds-tetris-handheld/">plastic chicken nugget</a>, a playable <a href="https://www.7-eleven.com/lp/tetris">fake 7-Eleven Slurpee cup</a>, and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/842702/tetris-my-play-watch-smartwatch-hands-on">playable wristwatch</a>. But the most intriguing way to play <em>Tetris </em>yet is encased in paper.</p></div><p>Last year the <a href="https://tetris.com/news/tetris-r-and-red-bull-take-competitive-gaming-to-new-heights">Tetris Company partnered with Red Bull</a> for a gaming tournament that culminated in the 150-meter-tall Dubai Frame landmark being turned into the <a href="https://www.redbullcontentpool.com/international/CP-S-20356">world’s largest playable <em>Tetris</em> installation</a> using over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/845269/who-needs-bricks-when-you-have-drones">2,000 drones that functioned as pixels</a>. Although the timing was a coincidence, Red Bull also published a 180-page gaming edition of its <em>The Red Bulletin</em> lifestyle magazine around the same time as the event, with a limited number of copies wrapped in a less grandiose, but no less technically impressive, version of Alexey Pajitnov’s iconic puzzle game.</p><div><p>To create a playable gaming magazine, Red Bull Media House (the company’s media wing) enlisted the help of Kevin Bates, who in 2014 wowed the internet by creating an <a href="https://gizmodo.com/make-an-awesome-first-impression-with-a-tetris-playing-1535287877">ultra-thin <em>Tetris</em>-playing business card</a>. In 2015, he launched the $39 <a href="https://www.arduboy.com/">Arduboy</a>, a credit card-sized, open-source handheld that attracted a <a href="https://community.arduboy.com/">thriving community of developers</a>. Over the course of a decade, Bates also created a pair of equally pocketable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtbneOFNvfw"><em>Tetris</em>-playing handhelds</a> that cost less than $30, and <a href="https://www.arduboy.com/mini">the shrunken-down USB-C Arduboy Mini</a>.</p></div><p>The GamePop GP-1 Playable Magazine System (as it’s officially called) is the latest evolution of Bates’ mission to use existing, accessible, and affordable technologies to reimagine what a portable gaming device can be. It took “most of last year” to develop, Bates revealed during a call with <em>The Verge</em>. He wouldn’t divulge the exact details of how his collaboration with Red Bull came to be. But if you’re looking to make an officially licensed version of <em>Tetris</em> that’s thin enough to flex, Bates has the experience, and he shared with us some of the technical details that make this creation work.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The game’s screen is made up of 180 tiny RGB LEDs on a custom circuit board that can flex and bend.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>While OLED display technology has given us <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854352/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on">tablet-sized devices that fold into smartphones</a>, they’re still expensive and fragile. To make a display that can survive being embedded in a flexible magazine cover without reinforcement, Bates created a custom matrix of 180 2mm RGB LEDs mounted to a flexible circuit board just 0.1mm thick. While the display and coin-cell batteries make it thicker in a few places — nearly 5mm at its thickest point — you genuinely feel like you’re playing a handheld made of paper. The flexible circuits are bonded between two sheets of paper to create the sleeve that wraps around the book-sized magazine, and it feels satisfyingly thin and flexible.</p><p>Flexible circuits aren’t a new idea. They’ve been used in electronics for decades. You can find them in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/29/22857413/motorola-razr-internet-button-flip-phone-data-cellular-charges">flip phones old enough they now feel like antiques</a>, and nearly every laptop. They’re also frequently used to miniaturize devices that don’t fold or flex at all, connecting internal components where space is extremely limited. But it’s only in the past five or six years that the technology has become available to smaller makers, and Bates says he’s been “messing around with the flexible circuits for about as much time.” This collaboration was an opportunity to use what he’s learned to create a device that would live outside his workshop.</p><p>The GamePop GP-1’s display resolution pales in comparison to the OLED screens used in folding phones, but Bates’ creation is far more durable. The game has not only undergone the typical safety tests, but Bates even “hit it with a hammer a few times” to test its durability. His display survived, but don’t try that with a folding phone. They’re <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/714552/how-tough-is-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-7">still far less durable</a>.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>To keep it as thin as possible, the </em>Tetris<em> game uses embedded touch sensors instead of physical buttons.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Instead of buttons, the game uses seven capacitive touch sensors that are directly “printed in the copper layer of the board,” Bates says. There’s no true mechanical feedback when pressed, but the paper’s flex helps them feel a bit like a button when you press down. Bates says the responsiveness of the sensors was specifically tuned to account for the thickness of the paper stock and the glues used in the final print run. You’re not going to be chasing <em>Tetris</em> world records on the cover of a magazine, but the controls are satisfyingly responsive and the game is surprisingly much easier to play than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/842702/tetris-my-play-watch-smartwatch-hands-on">other <em>Tetris</em> devices</a> I’ve tested.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Most of the game is made using flexible electronics, but there is a thin rigid PCB housing its processor and rechargeable batteries.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>How much does a flexible <em>Tetris</em> game cost to manufacture? Neither Bates nor Red Bull would divulge the total price tag for all the off-the-shelf and custom components you’ll find sandwiched inside the magazine’s cover. But to help keep costs down, not all components are flexible. Inside the edge of the cover, next to the magazine’s spine, you’ll find a long but thin rigid PCB where an ARM-based 32-bit microprocessor is located, along with four rechargeable LIR2016 3V coin cell batteries.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The magazine features a deconstructed USB-C charging port along the bottom edge of its cover.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Like most devices now, the game can be recharged using a USB-C cable, but it’s not immediately obvious where. Hidden along the bottom edge of the magazine’s cover is a deconstructed USB-C port. Instead of a metal ring, its socket is a small paper pocket containing a pin-covered head inside. It doesn’t feel quite as durable as the charging port on your phone, but it’s a welcome alternative to making the game disposable when the batteries die.</p><p>Bates did have to cut some corners. The GamePop GP-1 saves high scores, but modern <em>Tetris</em> gameplay features, like previews of upcoming pieces and being able to save tetrominoes for later, aren’t included. There’s sound effects, but when starting a game you only hear a small snippet of the iconic <em>Tetris</em> theme. The game’s piezo speaker “uses about as much energy as it does to run the rest of the system,” Bates says, so this helps prolong the life of the small rechargeable batteries. He tells us you can play for an hour or two that way, and the battery should last many months when not in use.</p><p>Red Bull made around 1,000 copies of the magazine. <a href="https://www.redbullshop.com/en-int/p/GAME-POP-The-Culture-of-Play/M-RBM25006/?preselectedVariant=M-RBM25006001">It’s only available online in Europe</a>, but can also be found in some stores and newsstands, including <a href="https://www.iconicmagazines.com/product/gamepop-magazine/">Iconic Magazines</a> in New York and <a href="https://raremags.co.uk/products/gamepop-issue-3">Rare Mags</a> outside Manchester in the UK. However, only 150 copies with the playable cover were produced, and none were made available to the public. They were distributed to <em>Tetris</em> competitors, those featured in the magazine, influencers, and select media.</p><p>The playable cover isn’t going to revolutionize the print industry, or pave the way for smartphones we can roll up and stick in our back pockets. The goal was to use existing tech in a way that gamers haven’t seen before.</p><p><em>Photography by Andrew Liszewski / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/881175/red-bull-media-house-game-pop-bulletin-magazine-playable-tetris-flexible-display]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="20fe735bc11c0"><a title="Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/20fe735bc11c0/pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>After years of waiting, we are finally getting some classic Pokémon on Switch! Nintendo and TPC surprised us all with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-officially-revealed-for-switch">announcement</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">FireRed and LeafGreen</a> will arrive on the Switch eShop immediately after the annual Pokémon Presents on <strong>27th February</strong> (with a swanky <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-is-getting-a-stunning-special-edition-release-in-japan">Special Edition</a> coming to Japan).</p>
<p>We're ecstatic, of course, though it does leave us with an almighty large decision to make, almost as hard as choosing our starter: which version are we going to buy?</p>
<p>For lifelong Pokémon fans out there, it's a decision that you have literally made before, probably some 20 years ago in front of a store shelf, but that doesn't mean that it's any less pressing this time around. Some people will pick up both versions just because they can, but for many of us, this is a one-and-done deal.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22ftymhjl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>With this in mind, we thought it was only fair that we remind you of the versions' Pokédex differences here, so you can make an informed decision when they finally drop.</p>
<p>As ever, the games' biggest distinguishing feature is which Pokémon are/aren't available to find in the wild, so here's a list of version exclusives (in Pokédex order), to jog your memory:</p>
<h2>FireRed Version-Exclusive Pokémon</h2>

<p>Of course, all of the above <em>can</em> be obtained in either version with a Trade at the Pokémon Wireless Club in the Pokémon Center.

            <title><![CDATA[Battlestate Head Responds to Tarkov Support Ticket in the Most Nikita Way Possible]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlestate-nikita-respond-tarkov-support-ticket/</link>
            <guid>1443049</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In case you’re not at all connected to the extraction shooter space, you should know that Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlestate-games/" id="1450">Battlestate Games</a>, can be a little confrontational on social media. The prolific developer, who has more than 350,000 followers on Twitter (now X) alone, has long been known for having zero filter when it comes to public-facing comments.</p>



<p>From suggestions on how to improve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-tarkov/" id="232">Escape from Tarkov</a> to condemnation of how Battlestate handles in-game issues, Nikita stares down hundreds of targeted posts and comments every day. Recently, one of those incoming comments was regarding a support ticket for Tarkov, which Nikita responded to in classic fashion.</p>







<h2 id="h-inflammatory-isn-t-the-word">Inflammatory Isn’t The Word</h2>



<p>On social media, Nikita Buyanov found himself, as he often does, sharing teaser clips of upcoming Escape from Tarkov updates. He often shares short mash-ups of real-world scouting, team activities, development footage, and weapons and attachments that are about to land in Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction shooter game.</p>



<p>He did just that on February 21, uploading footage teasing the upcoming Tarkov event that will welcome Icebreaker to the game in a new, super-sized event.</p>



<p>In the comments, <a href="https://x.com/JborgKasper/status/2025177817642598489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one user wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I have been playing this game since 2019 and been supporting in, and im not getting the support i think i should!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nikita, being a man of the people, took an interest in this user’s comment and asked what he needed from him. Lo and behold, a support ticket reference was handed over, and it took Nikita just an hour to deduce what was going on:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>you used radar cheat</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The response has since racked up 150,000 impressions, many of which are the result of Nikita’s fans backing him in this very ‘Tarkov-like’ scenario. Many praised Nikita’s transparency and bagged on the original poster for exposing themselves. Shortly after, the player who posted the comment declared they’d never cheated in their lives, but it’s not hard for Battlestate to detect such activity.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape From Tarkov With Nikita - EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pcetkc8gq1w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Escape from Tarkov has long had a problem with cheaters, which Nikita himself has referred to as fighting a multi-headed hydra. It’s the fight of a lifetime for many multiplayer-focused developers, but Battlestate Games and Escape from Tarkov often get it in the neck more than your average studio.</p>



<p>Of course, Nikita went a bit wavy shortly after, when another user commanded him to get off Twitter and optimise Escape from Tarkov, to which <a href="https://x.com/nikgeneburn/status/2025236246625484871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he responded</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>don’t f***ing tell me what to do boy. i want to sit on twitter a little, before i will go and personally optimize the game</p>
</blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[GTA 6 Digital Price Surfaces Online At £89.99]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-digital-price-appears-online/</link>
            <guid>1443046</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Eagle-eyed gamers eager to determine the pricing structure for this year’s release of Grand Theft Auto 6 have stumbled on a digital listing for the game on Xbox. While it’s almost certainly a placeholder, the listing has the price of the standard game at £89.99, which would likely result in a $99.99 price tag in the United States.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that the same site also has an option to purchase a PC code for the <strong>Rockstar Games Launcher</strong>, and that version is boasting a more acceptable pricing point of £60.99, a random number indeed.</p>







<h2 id="h-placeholder-prices-are-pretty-common-for-gta-6">Placeholder Prices Are Pretty Common for GTA 6</h2>



<p>This isn’t the first proposed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="36">GTA 6</a> pricing point we’ve seen in recent months, and it certainly won’t be the last.</p>



<p>The latest indication regarding GTA 6’s expected price comes from Loaded, formerly CD Keys. The digital storefront has long been a purveyor of game and DLC codes for almost every major platform in the space. It’s favored heavily by PC gamers because it often offers cut-price codes, even at launch.</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 surfaced recently on the site, bearing an £89.99 tag for the Xbox version of the game, and a £60.99 tag for the <strong>PC </strong>code.</p>



<p>Right now, there’s no indication that GTA 6 will be launching on PC alongside console platforms in November. We’ve also seen <strong>no confirmation </strong>from Rockstar or Take-Two regarding the game’s price, which has long been a point of contention in the gaming space.</p>



<p>For some, this could be the most expensive ‘standard game’ ever released, with the bottom-most tier of the game running up a bill of anything from $70 to $100. If Loaded’s placeholder price is any kind of accurate, we’ll see the price edge towards the latter end of that scale.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Digging deeper into the <a href="https://www.loaded.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-pc-rockstar-games-launcher" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GTA 6 Loaded listing</a>, we can see basic descriptors about the game. There’s a summary, screenshots procured from Rockstar’s official slate, and information suggesting it will come with online multiplayer at launch.</p>



<p>It’s nothing to write home about, and you could bet safe money on this being an arbitrary placeholder, but you never know, right?</p>



<p>Case in point, Loaded also has a listing <a href="https://www.loaded.com/state-of-decay-3-pc-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for State of Decay 3 on PC</a>, and that’s one of the most veiled games in the business right now. It was announced years ago and doesn’t have any kind of release window, but Loaded believes it’ll drop at £19.99 when it hits, which is almost <strong>definitely </strong>incorrect.</p>



<p>How much do you think GTA 6 will end up costing? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>This month's been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews">a surprisingly busy one for games</a>, and we're all on tenterhooks, waiting to see if RE9 is any good. Perhaps all that excitement was too distracting, as correspondence (and, indeed, correspondents) have been few and far between. So, prepare yourself for a <em>slight</em>, 'Lite' edition of our monthly letters page feature!</p>
<p>Got something you want to get off your chest? We're ready and waiting to read about your game-related ponderings. Each month we’ll highlight a Star Letter, the writer of which will receive a month’s subscription to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/site-news-love-what-we-do-become-a-nintendo-life-supporter">our ad-free Supporter scheme</a>. Check out the submission guidelines at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>So let's open it up, poke around the bills, and see what the postie's brought us this month...</p>
<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox - February 2026</h2>
<h3>"thrives when parallel" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, Nintendolife!</p>
<p>This letter in particular is probably gonna be a bit different, since it's less focused on Nintendo and more on a different console.<br>
As I mentioned the last time I wrote here, recently, through this website's recommendation, I got into the Trails series. I've been really enjoying it, but after Sky 1st, there was a break of a few games in between the next game playable on Switch 2, since at the time, Zero and Azure weren't fully functional. So, I decided to pick up a Steam Deck to play the series.<br>
Now that the groundwork and backstory has been laid, let me just say that I have come to realize that the Steam Deck and the Switch 2 complement each other perfectly. If there's a subpar Switch port, you can play it on Deck. If the game needs just a bit more processing power, you can play it on Switch 2. Need to just boot into a game? Switch. Want to overcustomize and use mods? Steam Deck. Got a group and just want to play some party games? Switch 2 all the way, baby.<br>
Whenever the Deck came out, I was hesitant to buy one. The only discourse about it you heard was "oh, its the Switch killer!" But through using it on my own, I've come to realize that it thrives when parallel with the Switch, not competing with it.<br>
I feel like sometimes we tend to forget in the gaming community that every console has its place. Nintendo focuses in on larger, higher-budget games, and without it I wouldn't have found Octopath, Ace Attorney, or Trails. But Steam gives so many really small indie games so much more visibility. Without it, I wouldn't have found 100% Orange Juice (which I really hope arrives on Switch soon, it'd be a perfect fit!), Super Ledgehop, Sora, or all the other really small games I play.<br>
In short, I love both my Steam Deck and Switch 2 and hope we can see them appreciated on their own merits. Next letter might be a 1000 word rumination on Trails and asking Alana for her personal opinions on each, we'll see.<br>
<strong><em>Bluelink</em></strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Happy to hear you're enjoying Trails! The Steam Deck is a fine machine. I imagine that for many the barrier to entry is justifying two fairly pricey portable systems, so it'll be fascinating to see how the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/random-steams-brand-new-game-console-sure-looks-awfully-familiar">Steam Machine</a> fits into the hardware landscape. If Sony continues closing its best studios and Microsoft keeps stepping on rake after rake, could Switch 2 and a Steam Machine become this generation's 'Wii60'?</p>
<p>(I spent longer than I care to admit trying to crush 'Switch 2' and 'Steam Machine' into a snappy portmanteau. See what you can do in the comments, lovely people.) <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"if only"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Nintendo Life,<br>
With the revealing of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, I have to ask…What is the point of an online multiplayer mode that you can only play with friends? I thought that the whole point of online multiplayer was that you’re like me and you don’t have any friends, let alone friends who actually play video games! If I can go online to race against strangers in Mario Kart, why can’t I go online to race against strangers in Super Mario Bros. Wonder? It’s a shame because the competitive multiplayer modes in Super Mario Bros. Wonder look like they could be fun, if only they were playable.<br>
<strong>Person With No Friends But Still Has Self-Worth</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It feels like the brief for this particular NS2 Edition was 'We need a Mario game on shelves when the Galaxy Movie comes out,' and whacking Rosalina in Wonder did the job.</p>
<p><del>We've all had fun with strangers online.</del> We've all had fun playing video games with strangers online, but I wonder (heh) if these minigames will have real longevity. As with a lot of S2 upgrades, for me they've been an excuse to revisit and 100% games I already played, not something I'm pumping dozens of hours - Animal Crossing notwithstanding. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"sterile experience"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Nostalgic for 8th Gen Nintendo</p>
<p>As a Nintendo Fan my whole life, I feel like the WiiU/3DS era was the time where Nintendo was the most fun. Customizable themes on the 3DS, rotating eshop music on the WiiU, checking Club Nintendo every month for the new rewards...it's these little things that made the Nintendo experience have so much whimsy and charm in contrast to the sterile experience we get nowadays. Even the excitement of getting a new console, the Switch 2, is diminished slightly because you boot it up and it's the exact same experience as the Switch. Maybe they don't prioritize the "little" things anymore, but I sure miss it.<br>
<strong>Dave Driver</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A splash of colour on the Home screen wouldn't go amiss, and those Club Nintendo bonuses were neat, although My Nintendo Store does get bits and pieces. I agree, the Switches aren't quite as homely.</p>
<p>Nintendo is best when it gets weird, and given that Switch 2 is so familiar and we're seeing so many enhanced versions of old games, I'm hoping for some big software swings this gen. Rhythm Heaven is coming soon, although even that is familiar. Fingers crossed for some more personality and..., erm, what's the opposite of 'sterility'? Fertility? Filth?...</p>
<p><em>Ahem.</em> Well, I've got myself all worked up now. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h2>Bonus Letters</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"May I share a detailed report of these issues along with our pricing?" - <strong>Lucy</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nah, you're alright, Lucy. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above). Type your name, email, and beautifully crafted letter into the appropriate box, hit send, and boom — you're done!</li>

<p>That little Hylian slip-up might be a hint of things to come, but first, let's take a look at what happened <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-rayman-gbc">last time</a>, when a trio of covers for the Game Boy Color's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/rayman">Rayman</a> went head-to-head (to-head). The votes were pretty evenly split, but it was the red European cover that walked away with 49% and the win. The green North American variant followed behind with 31%, while Japan brought up the rear with 21%.</p><div><figure data-videoid="SFfvavDRTdA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSFfvavDRTdA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFfvavDRTdA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed405340uomsvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>With The Legend of Zelda series celebrating its 40th anniversary this weekend, we're taking a look at the only BAB contender we <em>haven't</em> touched on before: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link's Awakening</a>. Now yes, BAB fans, we did look at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/09/poll_box_art_brawl_9_-_the_legend_of_zelda_links_awakening_dx">GBC's DX version</a> back in 2019, but the OG release came with regional covers of its own, don't you know.</p>
<p>Europe and North America went down the same route this time, so we've got a duel between East and West. Let's crack this egg open!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/zelda/related-articles:5571,150579 @ 1771787121 -->
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="8d3d0b10b62c3"><a title="Zelda: Link's Awakening - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8d3d0b10b62c3/zelda-links-awakening-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3033-the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We'll admit, this design is very similar to what you'll find for the GBC version in North America, but it's worth checking out again, all the same. It's a classic format for the series, with the title and sword/shield symbol pasted against a gold-y beige backdrop. Perhaps not the most stunning design out there, but it has become somewhat synonymous with Zelda over the years.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="1787e45990e19"><a title="Zelda: Link's Awakening - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1787e45990e19/zelda-links-awakening-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/3033-the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Much like the DX version, the Japanese variant for the original GB release swaps in original art of Link, Marin and Tarin against the backdrop of Koholint Island. Link's springing into action in this one, leaping through the air with his sword held aloft, while the other pair lounge around behind. It's bright, fun, and colourful — an almighty departure from the Western cover, no?</p>
