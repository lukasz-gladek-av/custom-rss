			<p>April 2025 was another Xbox-focused month on the sales charts and the active player numbers charts, with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered ranking as the best-selling game on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, and Call of Duty leading monthly active users on PlayStation and Xbox.</p>
<p>The latest monthly data comes from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lpoo3w2xuc2e">Circana</a> executive director and video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella, who posts some of the charting information Circana collects each month.</p>
<p>Five of the top 10 best-selling games for April 2025 were Xbox games, and three of those five were all in the top-five best-selling games for the month, with Oblivion Remastered at the top, followed by Forza Horizon 5 in the number two spot, and Minecraft at the number four spot. The other Xbox games in the top-10 were Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>
<p>Oblivion Remastered has also already become the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-dominate-ps5s-download-charts-for-april-2025-oblivion-remastered-already-the-uss-third-best-selling-game-of-2025/">third-best-selling game of 2025</a>, trailing only Monster Hunter Wilds and Assassin's Creed Shadows. On PlayStation specifically, four of the top five best-selling games for April 2025 in the US were all Xbox games.</p>
<p>In terms of monthly active users, Microsoft-owned Call of Duty led both Xbox and PlayStation platforms. Oblivion Remastered was the fifth most-played game on Steam, with the number one spot held by Schedule I.</p>
<p>So Xbox and Microsoft are very clearly dominating software sales, though on the hardware side, PlayStation has stayed in the lead, even with hardware spending falling overall compared to the sales in the US for April 2024.</p>

According to them, the plan was always to set this game a big, open world with connected tracks. And it was never going to be called <em>Mario Kart 9</em>, as this time around they wanted to “take the series to the next level.” </p><p>“We were thinking about what to do for the next <em>Mario Kart</em> game even during the development of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8-10-year-anniversary-1851507678&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8-10-year-anniversary-1851507678"><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></a></span>, and we began prototyping in March 2017,” said <em>Mario Kart</em> <em>World </em>producer Kosuke Yabuki. “It was at the end of that year when we officially started work on it as a project. I felt that in <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, we were able to perfect the formula that we’d been following in the series up to that point, where players race on individual courses. That’s why, this time, we wanted the gameplay to involve players driving around a large world, and we began creating a world map like this.”</p><p>At the time, the devs were developing this bigger, more open <em>Mario Kart</em> game for the OG Switch console. As the Nintendo devs explained, their process is to first design a game and what they want it to do, and <em>then</em> make it work on the hardware. However, to get 24-player races and the open world working on Switch was challenging, and involved a lot of compromises. </p><p>“When we were developing for the Nintendo Switch system, it was difficult for us to incorporate everything we wanted, so we were always conscious of what we were giving up in return,” said programming director Kenta Sato. “We discussed things like toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and we even considered dropping the frame rate to 30 FPS in some cases. It was a tough situation.”</p><p>According to Sato, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/3ds/mario-kart-7/1/3/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/3ds/mario-kart-7/1/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo considers it very important that <em>Mario Kart </em>games run at 60 FPS</a></span>, likely because this provides players with a solid sense of speed and makes the game feel more fluid and responsive. So instead of halving the framerate, they just...waited for a new console.</p><p>“We worked on [<em>Mario Kart World</em>] while kicking the can down the road in terms of deciding what to give up on, so at some point, we knew it was going to get messy,” said Yabuki. “But as we’d decided to release <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe — Booster Course Pass</em>, we thought that would give us a bit more time to continue development. That’s when the conversation of moving it to the Nintendo Switch 2 system came up, and this suddenly opened up a bunch of possibilities on what we could do. It was truly a ray of hope.”</p><p>It’s very interesting to see Nintendo so openly discuss framerates and how important they can be in high-speed games like <em>Mario Kart</em>. And yeah, they made the right call. <em>Mario Kart</em> at 30 FPS sounds depressing. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502"><em>Mario Kart World </em>and the Switch 2 are set to launch in United States on June 5.</a></span> GameStop says it will have some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-in-stock-target-best-buy-gamestop-preorder-1851781532&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-in-stock-target-best-buy-gamestop-preorder-1851781532">Switch 2 consoles available in stock</a></span> for fans who weren’t able to get a pre-order.

                <p dir="ltr">After Mario Kart 8 Deluxe introduced The Legend of Zelda and Animal Crossing characters to the series, people were curious where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/">Mario Kart World</a> would turn next for new racers. It's highly doubtful anyone predicted Cow from Mario Kart 64's Moo Moo Farm course. But Nintendo has revealed how a drawing--seen below--of the character driving a truck was the impetus for including the bovine.</p><p dir="ltr">In a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-3/">Ask the Developer interview</a>, Mario Kart World art director Masaaki Ishikawa discussed the origins of Cow as a playable character. "Each new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mario-kart-9-racer/2900-6141/" data-ref-id="2900-6141">Mario Kart game features new characters</a> to race with, but since we added so many to the previous game, we wondered where we could go from there," Ishikawa said. "And then one of the designers came up with that silly sketch of Cow cruising along, and I thought to myself, "This is it!" (Laughs) So that's when we realized the course surroundings actually contained a lot of untapped resources."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4498707-inserted_12_updated.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4498707" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4498707-inserted_12_updated.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4498707"></a><figcaption>This sketch of Cow driving a truck led to the character becoming playable in Mario Kart World, according to Nintendo.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4498707-inserted_12_updated.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Ishikawa added that Cow's inclusion then led to "Cheep Cheep and Pokey as racers." Additionally, Mario Kart World producer Kosuke Yabuki noted Cow also inspired "obstacle characters like Camel and Giraffe." As such, "Cow is actually a pivotal character in the Mario Kart series (laughs)," Ishikawa said.</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, we learned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-cow-can-eat-burgers-and-steak/1100-6530642/">Cow will actually eat burgers and steaks in Mario Kart World</a>. While that raises plenty of questions, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-how-eating-meals-and-unlocking-costumes-works/1100-6530926/">consuming meals in the racing game unlocks various costumes</a> for characters. Cow "is still in touch with her animal nature," according to Ishikawa. For example, "when she jumps, she strikes a proper quadrupedal pose," the art director said.</p><p dir="ltr">This same Ask the Developer interview also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-isnt-titled-mario-kart-9-because-nintendo-wants-to-take-the-series-to-the-next-level/1100-6531709/">explained why Mario Kart World isn't Mario Kart 9</a>. This upcoming game is all about taking "the series to the next level," such as with the open-world concept. It's one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mario-kart-world-14-new-details-nintendo-just-revealed/2900-6601/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6601">14 new details we learned about Mario Kart World</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/">Mario Kart World will cost $80</a>, sparking a contentious debate about the cost of new games going forward. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">Microsoft has since announced plans for $80 first-party titles</a> that will launch this holiday season. Recently, Gearbox CEO and president Randy Pitchford stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/real-fans-will-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen-if-borderlands-4-costs-80-says-randy-pitchford/1100-6531677/">real fans will "find a way to make it happen" if Borderlands 4 costs $80</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">On June 5, Mario Kart World will launch alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> as an exclusive game for the system. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-switch-2-game-accessory-preorders-are-live/1100-6530753/" data-ref-id="1100-6530753">Preorders are live for Mario Kart World</a>, as well as compatible accessories. </p>

                <p>Nintendo's Pikmin series might not be as well-known as Mario or Zelda, but that hasn't stopped Shigeru Miyamoto from wanting to bring the sprite-sized characters to the big screen.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pikmin 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"I spent a lot of time the past five, six years really wanting to grow Pikmin. Obviously, a lot of that is focused around Pikmin Bloom, and there was also new Pikmin titles that released. But I wanted to see if there's other ways that we can have people engage and get to know Pikmin that's outside of the population that plays video games, for example," he said.</p><p>"I think Pikmin has a lot of potential to be used in many different occasions. When you're looking at small kids, they have a certain appeal for things that are cute, and when they grow older, maybe in their twenties, they start to lose appeal for that," Miyamoto added. "But I think Pikmin has this unique ability to have appeal across a broad range in that it's still appealing for both younger audiences and older audiences, and in Japan. And so I'm hoping that we can expand that globally. So, whether it's some kind of a movie or show, things like that would be really fun."</p><p>With the massive success of the Super Mario Bros. Movie, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-mario-movies-title-leaks-and-calls-back-to-the-series-best-game/1100-6531540/" data-ref-id="1100-6531540">and the sequel on the way</a>, which will be followed by the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-trailer-story/2900-6252/" data-ref-id="2900-6252">Legend of Zelda</a>, maybe Universal and Illumination could make room for the tiny adventurers down the road.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-handheld-will-be-powered-by-custom-low-power-apu-from-amd-%E2%80%93-rumor.1195278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-amd-apu/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Contrary to what recent findings seemed to suggest, the yet-to-be-officially revealed Xbox handheld will not switch to the ARM architecture, but will be powered by an AMD APU.</p>
<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/qualcomm-job-posting-suggest-the-next-xbox-will-be-based-on-arm.1684130/post-270428048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeoGAF forums</a>, known AMD leaker KeplerL2 commented on the handheld, saying that it will be powered by a custom low-power APU from AMD. The Xbox-branded handhelds, on the other hand, will use whatever APUs are available to OEMs, including Z2E from AMD, Lunar/Panther Lake from Intel, X Elite 2 from Qualcomm, and N1 from NVIDIA.</p>
<p>Though it was expected for Microsoft to go with AMD again for its next-generation systems, including the dedicated handheld, which has been teased multiple times in the past, a job ad that surfaced online last week<a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generation-xbox-arm/"> suggested</a> that some of the next-gen Xbox products could make the switch to the ARM architecture. This choice could have made sense somewhat for a handheld system, as the ARM architecture provides better power efficiency, but it would have led to issues in terms of compatibility with current software, and not having access to a large part of the Xbox library wouldn't really fit with the current strategy of making Xbox games available on as many devices as possible.</p>
<p>With the Xbox handheld likely far from release, we will get to see the first glimpses of the company's handheld strategy with the aforementioned branded handhelds. The first one, known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-kennan-is-reportedly-being-made-by-asus/">Project Kennan</a>, is being developed in collaboration with ASUS, will run Windows, unsurprisingly, and feature an interface reminiscent of the Xbox consoles. This handheld should be released before the end of the year.</p>

			<p>A new Red Dead Redemption 2 mod is now available for download, introducing enhanced ambient occlusion and other visual improvements that bring the game's visuals closer to the quality seen in pre-release trailers.</p>
<p>The WOW... That's Beautiful mod, which is now available for download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/6335?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces enhanced ambient occlusion, more vibrant colors, finer texture details, better environment shading, and disables pedestrian light to enhance the game's visuals and bring them more in line with those seen in pre-release trailers. The end results are incredible, making it a great download for those who want to experience Arthur Morgan's story like never before.</p>

<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 launched on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One back in 2018 and was later ported to PC in 2019. While the game was never properly updated for current generation consoles, a new PS5 and Xbox Series X|S patch is <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-2-nintendo-switch-2-playstation-5-upgrade/">reportedly</a> in the works, together with a Nintendo Switch 2 port that could be released before the end of the year. Though unconfirmed, these new releases would definitely help Rockstar Games and Take-Two's release schedule for the second half of the year, especially after Grand Theft Auto VI has been delayed to May 2026.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. You can learn more about one of the best open-world games ever released by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-living-outlaw-life/">review.</a></p>

So <em>Mario Kart World</em> has had to dig deep to expand that roster even further, and has looked mostly to former enemies and background props for inspiration. In addition to Cow, who was previously an obstacle in Moo Moo Meadows, <em>Mario Kart World</em> also adds Goomba, Hammer Bro, Coin Coffer, Conkdor, Chargin’ Chuck, Snowman, and lots of other minor characters to its playable cast. </p><p>“The character designer quickly put together a prototype of Cow that could race, and surprisingly it didn’t feel out of place at all,” Ishikawa said.<strong> “</strong>So we thought maybe we could include other obstacle characters, and decided to add Cheep Cheep and Pokey as racers. As a result, the idea of taking obstacle characters, usually found in courses in past games, and having them participate in races made sense to me in terms of an interconnected world.”</p><p>Cow didn’t just immediately transform into<em> Mario Kart World</em>’s breakout star, however. It also led to lots of philosophical debates internally, as well as ideas for completely new game mechanics. “It was like, ‘They’re NPCs, but they’re playable? Which is it?’” said producer Kosuke Yabuki. “It was thanks to the introduction of various ‘NPC drivers’ that the idea to have Kamek appear as an item was born,” developer Shintaro Jikumaru added. “When Kamek casts a spell, the racers are transformed into playable NPCs, so one by one they might all turn into Cow mid-race.”</p><figure id="" data-id="9bde55b569477d3d97b2dca43110475f" data-recommend-id="image://9bde55b569477d3d97b2dca43110475f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1072" data-height="603" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cows appear in a meadow as Mario drives by.

Top-selling franchises have to find inspiration somewhere. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony is ending its PlayStation Stars loyalty programme, in its current form, after three years.</p>
<p>The programme first started in July 2022 and allowed players to earn reward points to be redeemed for PSN wallet funds and other products on the store. It became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-stars-program-now-available-in-uk">available in the UK</a> later that year.</p>
<p>However, Sony is now ending support for the programme as it evaluates "the types of activities our players respond best to", though it could return in some form in the future.</p>

<p>From today, new members to the PlayStation Stars programme will no longer be accepted and if current members cancel they won't be able to rejoin this version of the programme - all earned Points will be lost.</p>
<p>Current PlayStation Stars members can still earn points and products until 23rd July 3:59pm UK time (7:59am PDT, 11:59pm JST). No new campaigns will be available after this time.</p>
<p>This version of PlayStation Stars will fully end on 2nd November 2026. Current members can still earn points until this time. Digital Collectibles will still be accessible after these changes take place.</p>
<p>"Since launching the programme, we've learned a lot from evaluating the types of activities our players respond best to, and as a company, we are always evolving with player and industry trends," said the company on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/21/playstation-stars-coming-to-a-close-as-sie-evaluates-new-ways-to-evolve-future-loyalty-program-efforts/?sf277358162=1">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p>"Through this evaluation, we have decided to refocus our efforts and will be winding down the current version of PlayStation Stars. We will continue to evaluate our key findings from this programme, and are looking into ways to build upon these learnings."</p>
<p>At the launch of PlayStation Stars, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-stars-loyalty-programme-announced">Sony confirmed its Digital Collectibles were not NFTs, were not tradable, and did not leverage blockchain technology</a>.</p>
<p>It's unclear how the programme will evolve, but it would seem this isn't the last time we'll see PlayStation Stars.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-is-coming-to-ps5-this-summer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 is coming to PlayStation 5 this summer, another first party Xbox game that is making the jump to the blue team.</p>
<p><iframe title="Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II Comes to PlayStation 5 This Summer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sh4QQyM1KP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hellblade 2 will be optimised for both PS5 and PS5 Pro, such that Ninja Theory are putting an “Enhanced” label on the announcement artwork. This new release will have some additional features added into the mix, though these will also be made available as a free update for players on Xbox Series X|S and PC via both Xbox and Steam.</p>
<p>One of the most intriguing aspects on a technical level is what the PS5 Pro can offer over the Xbox Series X. The original release targeted 30fps on Series X with no performance modes, so will the PS5 Pro look to push for higher resolution, add a performance mode, or increase fidelity? We’ll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Writing in their announcement post, the team writes, “At Ninja Theory we have a rich heritage of releasing games on PlayStation, starting with Heavenly Sword back in 2007. If you’re familiar with our history, you’ll know that Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice was originally released on PlayStation 4 back in 2017. Developed by a small, passionate team, it resonated with so many of you, the players.</p>

<p>“We released the next chapter of Senua’s story a year ago today, and we know there are many of you who haven’t had the opportunity to experience that next chapter for yourselves. Today we’re excited to announce that we will be releasing Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II on PlayStation 5 this summer.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/24/microsoft-explain-why-they-bought-ninja-theory/">Microsoft’s acquisition of Ninja Theory in 2018</a> came off the back of the success of Hellblade. The studio had struggled to find stability for quite some time, despite critically acclaimed games like Heavenly Sword, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and DmC: Devil May Cry. The first Hellblade was an experiment in small budget game development at AAA quality, and it was a major hit for the studio. It was also a PlayStation 4 console exclusive at its original 2017 launch before being ported to Xbox and Switch in subsequent years. That Microsoft’s acquisition meant that the sequel would be Xbox exclusive was unpopular with PlayStation gamers, to say the least. But Microsoft’s current cross-platform strategy is at least breaking down this barrier for one of the most visually stunning games of last year.</p>
<p>Playing the game last year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review/">we said</a>, “Just like its forbear, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II is an oppressive, powerful and haunting example of the power of video games, and one that sets its own parameters for what a digital experience can be. It is a game that must be experienced, not least because, there’s nothing else quite like it.”</p>

			<p><span>Neowiz recently invited Wccftech out to a private hands-on event alongside other media and content creators at The Paramour Estate in sunny Los Angeles. As part of some of the first opportunities to go play Neowiz and Round8 Studio’s expansion to 2023’s surprising puppetry action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lies of P</a>, we enjoyed (and suffered) through some of the new content featured in this anticipated expansion and enjoyed a brief respite of tacos and a metal rendition of Feel to cap off the evening.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-overture-qa-its-an-opportunity-for-us-to-really-complete-the-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lies of P: Overture</a> takes the bold approach of making the DLC a prequel to the story, rather than continuing P’s adventure after the credits roll. To access the DLC in the first place was something that Neowiz hadn’t been entirely upfront about, but did seem to tentatively agree about a particular damaged and overgrown stargazer in the Path of the Pilgrim. A loading screen tooltip also advised visiting the Star’s Chrysalis near the Malum District. Whether there’s more to be done to access Overture’s new campaign beyond finishing the game for the first time and returning to that particular golden stargazer still has to be confirmed by Neowiz.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Anguished-Guardian-of-the-Ruins-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>Our hands-on time with Lies of P: Overture was split up into two sessions of equal length. Our first breakout session centered on the Battle Memories boss fights that are also set to come to the base game for Lies of P in a future patch. In this mode, players can challenge any boss they’ve fought once they finish the story and achieve at least one ending first simply by visiting the Hotel Krat stargazer. These fights are locked to the Legendary Stalker difficulty, but each features five different tiers of difficulty that ramp up the enemy’s strength and stats. Completing a fight on a particular might reward players with something special if the fight is completed in a certain amount of time, although I only saw items like collectible pins being unlocked by finishing a fight on the fifth tier. These pins, by the way, are part of a new cosmetic for Lies of P: Overture where the main character can equip and show off up to three pins on their satchel that otherwise don’t provide a statistical bonus from what I could see.</span></p>
<p><span>There’s a second battle mode called Death March where players go through a sort of Boss Rush with multiple fights in tandem with a limited supply of consumable items and resources, but it wasn’t something we were able to check out during our hands-on session.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the Battle Memories mode, we faced off a trio of bosses that highlighted how diverse the enemy types can be in Lies of P: Overture. The very first fight was a puppet and master fight where players have to contend with not just a human-type enemy capable of explosive light magic spells, but also a valkyrie sort of puppet that could attack independently. Players might instinctively move to finish off the puppet first, but all this does is phase the enemy briefly while the main boss revives their puppet and restores their durability to fight once more. The second was a hulking abomination within a dingy sewer whose attacks are just as damaging as they are telegraphed. I found this fight to be much simpler and straightforward than the puppeteer from the first encounter once I got a feel for getting back in the groove of parrying attacks. Sure, it did have an enrage mode during its final 1/3rd of health, but by then I had a good flow to the combat and P’s new Legion Arms definitely helped deal damage while staying a safe arm’s length away.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Carnival-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>The final boss was a massive chimera hybrid of multiple animal types, crystalline structures, and human-like upper torsos, each with differently wielded weapons that could swing and clear out a dozen meters across in a single slash or explode the ground around P if trying to play more defensively. On top of that, the boss transitioned into a second phase where its attacks got much more vicious in addition to a few beam lasers that would catch me by surprise. Trying to fend off this boss with the new bow weapon was largely ineffective, given the sheer amount of HP this boss had versus the miniscule amount of damage the bow could pull off (a tradeoff from having unlimited arrows and staying out of melee range, I suppose). While I could finish the first two bosses with relative ease on the third of five difficulty levels, I was only able to fend off this final boss on the first and second difficulty levels in the limited amount of time I had.</span></p>
<p><span>The second half of our Lies of P: Overture preview centered on actually diving right into the DLC from when it’s first available. Here, P and Gemini venture into the snowy outskirts of Krat and stumble across the Krat Zoo, seemingly still open to the public. There aren’t any NPCs to interact with during the introductory hours, so who’s to say if we might see the real Alidoro in all his katana-wielding glory later on in the DLC? Instead, it’s a snowy path filled with relatively straight corridors and a few spots off the beaten path for consumables and simple loot leading up to the front gates of Krat Zoo. Not all is as pristine and glamorous as Krat once was, as the wilderness is already filled with blue-blooded Carcass enemies and mutated animals alike. I suspect the Carcass Butcher’s Amulet purchased from Pulcinella in the base game might be one of the best accessories to put on for the DLC, at least in the early moments.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if you’re intimately familiar with the flow of Lies of P’s combat and are sufficiently geared up, the enemies in Overture are no joke. Even the basic mindless carcass zombies can knock P down in a few hits and trying to take on two or more from a bad vantage point can leave the player ganged up on. This is another time where I wished the bow was more effective, but instead it seems more used to harass enemies that might have poor pathfinding, or at least could simply not reach the player, rather than trying to engage on even footing. Instead, there were two weapons I gravitated towards the most in Lies of P: Overture’s modest selection of new weapon types. The first was a windmill-looking rotary saw that would actually charge up with stronger attacks if P dashes with the weapon equipped and a large gunblade, where P can fire off explosive shells at the end of combo swings or even propel himself around the arena like a Gunlance user in Monster Hunter. This latter type, much like the Bow and a number of other weapons in the Overture preview, is unique in that they do not have a separate handle and blade, meaning swapping about like you could with nearly every other weapon in Lies of P isn’t an option.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Even the minibosses that exist like skill checks against the player in order to progress could be a struggle early on in Lies of P: Overture. A hulking gorilla Carcass marked off the front gates to Krat Zoo and existed to make sure the player understood either how to perfectly parry, something I had to retrain my muscle memory after playing more lax titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and The First Berserker: Khazan as Lies of P: Overture features a much tighter parry window, or get used to dodging out of harm’s way. This gorilla was easily the death of me three or four times before I finally persevered, only to realize later on that no, that is simply a regular enemy type who shows up at least more than once in the back portion of the Krat Zoo. There were other vicious Carcass animals throughout Krat Zoo, including a stampeding mammoth, which was surprisingly much easier than either of the gorillas, and a corrupted crocodile, which served as the main boss for this playable section. Regrettably, I was not able to reach in the limited time available. Instead, I focused on exploring the side paths of Krat Zoo and taking a return trip to Hotel Krat to see what had changed.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Z-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>While I couldn’t venture out and see everything I wanted to outside of Hotel Krat, I did get a rough idea about how little has changed outside of the Overture map. Taking a moment to harvest some gold coin fruit or upgrade the weapons I had on me (there was a dragon spear ala Guan Yu’s signature weapon in the item box to try out) instead showed that there were the same rewards and +10 enhancement cap from the base game, although I would think that enhancement cap would be lifted later on in the DLC if the power scaling goes up. The P-Organ system also appeared to feature the same nodes from the original and respeccing still required gold coin fruit, something that seemed obvious given that both respeccing and even venturing into the Overture DLC both required completing the game at least once.</span></p>

<p><span>Three hours were not enough to do more than scratch the surface of Lies of P: Overture, and I’m already considering how my NG+3 playthrough will go in preparation for tackling the DLC. There’s initially a bigger focus early on with using large two-handed weapons in Overture, so I’m looking forward to picking up that gunblade once more and exploding my way to glory. There isn’t a firm release date beyond Summer 2025, but alongside the Overture DLC, there will also be a sizable patch with quality of life fixes for all players, including two new difficulty levels geared towards a more story-focused experience for those that might want to explore Krat but not have to fully engage with parrying and the other more difficult nuances to Lies of P’s combat. Lastly, Lies of P Overture will launch as a $29.99 premium DLC for the base game.</span></p>

			<p>A report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-loses-integral-staff-responsible-for-server-meshing/">Insider Gaming</a> points to more issues at Cloud Imperium Games, with the studio reportedly losing "<em>integral</em>" staff regarding server meshing and having been hit with more layoffs across all its departments.</p>
<p>According to Insider Gaming, after Roger Godfrey's departure in December 2024, Ivan Corbett and Jordan Wood have left the studio, leaving no producers at Cloud Imperium Games working on server meshing. Sources Insider Gaming spoke to described all three leaving as a "<em>huge loss</em>" for Cloud Imperium Games.</p>
<p>It's the latest news in what's been a rocky time for Star Citizen and Cloud Imperium Games. Last year, the studio suffered layoffs in <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/some-star-citizen-devs-reportedly-laid-off-as-cloud-imperium-restructures/">February</a> and <a href="https://www.cgmagonline.com/news/star-citizen-layoffs-funding-release/">November</a> 2024, and just ahead of the November layoff, a separate <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-expose-paints-a-fairly-bleak-picture-theres-no-actual-focus-on-getting-the-game-done/">report from Insider Gaming</a> described an internal environment where developers are overworked on anything but finishing Star Citizen to launch it out of the early access state it has remained in for its entire existence.</p>
<p>More recently, CIG has come under fire from players for its 'pay-to-win' Flight Blades. Players made their vitriol known to the point where CIG released a statement, admitting that it had "<em>missed a step</em>" with its implementation of Flight Blades, and that in an upcoming June update, players will be able to acquire them through in-game currency instead of just being able to buy them with real money.</p>
<p>"<em>The choice has and should always be yours. If you want to support the project early, you can, but it’s not required. If you own a game package, you’ll be able to pick these up with in-game currency in our next monthly patch. And for future gameplay kit introductions, we’ll ensure these items are obtainable in-game on day one,</em>" CIG wrote in its <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update/%%7Breply_id%7D">statement</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Thanks to everyone who’s weighed in, especially those who brought the heat constructively. This game has always been shaped by the community. Star Citizen wouldn’t exist without your passion and support, or your scrutiny and feedback. We hear you, and we take it all to heart.</em>"</p>
<p>Players were not appeased with this though, with many of the comments underneath still calling out the studio, claiming that it was always their plan to get players to buy into Flight Blades through "<em>FOMO</em>" and then offer them as an in-game item later.</p>
<p>It's definitely been a difficult time for CIG, but just how much this will impact Star Citizen remains to be seen. Earlier this year, CIG passed $800 million in crowdfunding for the game, which has been in early access since 2012.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/dune-awakening-interview-art-directors-gavin-whelan-and-david-levy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At PAX East 2025, there was one booth that dominated the convention floor and had dozens of stations open for people to play: <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dune-awakening-preview-pax-east-2024" rel="nofollow"><em>Dune Awakening</em></a>. Not only did I have the opportunity to download and play some of the <em>Dune Awakening</em> beta over the weekend, but I got to sit down with Senior Art Director Gavin Whelan and Associate Art Director David Levy to talk about their work on bringing Arrakis to life.</p>

<p>In our<em> Dune Awakening</em> interview with the art directors, let's dive into what it took to design and build this new MMO.</p>



<h2><em>Dune Awakening</em>'s Inspirations: Pulling From Many Sources</h2>

<p>"We all have experiences of what our perception of <em>Dune</em> is," Whelan said. "Some of the older devs like myself, we have the 1984 movie, which scarred me mentally when I was way too young. A lot of people have read the books, and there's the newer movies and TV series. The sandworm is kind of just this thing that's part of our general consciousness."</p>

<p>The original Frank Herbert novel provided a lot of lore for the dev team to go on, but so much of the style of the world has been adapted to film and TV already. I was curious how much of those designs were incorporated into the game versus what was being developed from scratch.</p>

<p>"We have the legendary movies, which we were working with those guys very closely," Whelan said. "They shipped a bunch of us down to the set. We got to sit inside an ornithopter, and the relationship between us and Legendary Pictures was very close. They were sending us concepts, reference images, prop photos, so we could start modeling things based on that."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whelan also met with Cinematics Director Greig Fraser to discuss details for the game. Plus, <em>Dune Awakening</em> Creative Director Joel Bylos was a passionate fan from the start who brought his perspective to every detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's great to have that sort of safety net," Whelan said, speaking of Bylos. "He is such a lore nerd on this. He will just go, 'No, that's not the way it goes. Here's the line in the book.'"&nbsp;</p>

<p>The close relationship between the developers and the filmmakers helps make <em>Dune Awakening</em> be an extension of that universe that shares similar themes while still carving out its own space in the <em>Dune </em>timeline.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Setting the Tone for <em>Dune Awakening&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>Associate Art Director David Levy, meanwhile, was bringing his own experience to the team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I worked on the TV series for <em>Dune Prophecy</em>, I was a lead for the concept team, so I worked on the TV series for three years," Levy said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having a team that's passionate about the source material was critical for getting the details of the world accurate and making it feel more lived-in, from the design of the lighting from the harsh Arrakis sun to the vehicles you can see and interact with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You'll see in the game we have big ships flying across the sky," Whelan said. "I nagged for so long to get those in because it wasn't essential gameplay, it was just something in the sky, but it set the tone."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, you can't talk about <em>Dune</em> without talking about sandworms. These are designs that are well-known from screen adaptations, but I was curious what the design process was like for the sandworms in&nbsp;<em>Dune Awakening.</em></p>

<p>"We needed to have a certain amount of articulation in the mouth for the smaller worms," Whelan said. "The tri-mouth design was much easier to anticipate and give it some articulation. And we have those out in the deep desert, though those are the small worms. The big worm – I have never worked on, and will never work on, a game where we have a creature that big."&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had to ask the two of them directly: can you ride a sandworm?&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We're working on it," Whelan said. "There are a whole bunch of challenges, it's going to be an interesting journey to get that working right. It has to be a visceral, engaging feeling."&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Dune Awakening</em>: Deep Desert &amp; Beyond&nbsp;</h2>

<p>A core element of <em>Dune Awakening</em> is the deep desert, a PVP area with high-risk, high-reward opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's a balance between the amount of freedom and amount of danger we give the player," Levy said. "It's going to be a very high-octane area."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two developers wanted to make sure that exploration pays off, giving players plenty to see and do if they venture out into the deep desert. At the same time, for players not interested in PVP gameplay, there's plenty of other missions to take on.</p>

<p>"There are aspects of this game for all gamers to come into," Whelan said. "I have a friend who is exclusively into PVP, and will really be into that area. Other people can research, resource gather, build, or craft. There's just so many cool elements that can attract a lot of people."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Plus, huge sandstorms will sweep across the map and reset the deep desert, giving Funcom opportunities to create new points of interest out there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every aspect of <em>Dune Awakening</em>, from the deep desert design to the character creator to the narrative, was built from a global team that had to navigate the challenges of developing a game when COVID was at its peak.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Eventually, we all transitioned to working online," Whelan said. "We had to coordinate something so complicated remotely. I love having people face to face in a room, where ideas can flow and you can see body language. Anybody can come up with the perfect idea, the perfect solution. But doing things on Teams meetings, it was a slow and challenging process."&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Levy's role, he was taking charge of how the lighting works in the world and how to make each day in-game feel dynamic and new.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I love photography, and we were able to translate Gavin's vision into something that is immersive and unconscious to the player, like the day-to-day changes. Every day will be slightly different weather. How do we make it beautiful, but also oppressive? There's so many different biomes, I'm excited for the player to feel that sense of immersion in the atmosphere."&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Dune Awakening</em>: One Big Sandbox</h2>

<p>At its core as an MMO, <em>Dune Awakening</em> has been designed to give the player agency to explore what kind of experience they want to have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I'm blown away by the creativity of the players," Whelan said. "We build a sandbox for players. They take ownership of it, and they start to shape it. Some people want to play straight <em>Dune</em> fantasy, we accommodate that. Others just want to have fun with it. We have heat maps so we can see what the players are doing and how they explore."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The player is the component of the game," Levy said. "They're not just a passenger who's going through a very linear experience. The player is making<em> Dune Awakening</em> after we've built it."&nbsp;</p>

<p>A core goal of <em>Dune Awakening</em> was to constantly let the player branch out and try new things. The immediate needs must first be met – food, water, shelter. But similar to other survival MMOs, once the player has a handle on those things, the world really starts to open up, and before too long they'll be flying ornithopters and gathering resources to make more complex tools.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not only were Levy and Whelan interested in making the game accessible to as many players as they could in the design of the world, they also wanted it to run on as many machines as possible.</p>

<p>"We have been very conscious of the fact that there are economic challenges," Whelan said. "People can't rush out and buy a graphics card. We want to make sure that the lighting and the world looks beautiful and consistent on low-end machines.</p>

<p>"We get to a point where the game looks beautiful, and then we start optimizing. We bounce back and forth making sure <em>Dune Awakening</em> looks good and runs well."&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Dune Awakening </em>was a big hit at PAX East, with the beta weekend allowing me to try it out on my Nvidia GeForce 3060Ti (runs great!) as well as on my Steam Deck (runs not so great). The <em>Dune Awakening </em>release date is June 10 with early access for those who buy <em>Dune Awakening Deluxe Edition</em> on June 5.</p>

<p>Whelan, Levy, and the whole team have worked to make <em>Dune Awakening</em> an authentic<em> Dune </em>experience for fans, and there should be many secrets to uncover when players jump in for themselves in just a few weeks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/671611/mario-kart-world-9-nintendo-explanation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-webster">Andrew Webster</a> <span>is an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-3%2F" rel="sponsored">latest entry</a> in its “ask the developer” interview series has some fun new details about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">the Switch 2 launch title <em>Mario Kart World</em></a>. Among the many things discussed is an explanation for why the game isn’t called <em>Mario Kart 9</em>, despite being a sequel to the best-selling <em>Mario Kart 8</em> — and it has to do with the game’s approach to open-world design.</p><p>“If the idea had just been to add more courses, then I think we would’ve called it <em>Mario Kart 9</em>,“ explained producer Kosuke Yabuki. “But, that wasn’t our approach this time. We wanted to take the series to the next level. So, we decided to drop the numbering this time and go with a completely new title, <em>Mario Kart World</em>. So, we’d already added “<em>MARIO KART WORLD</em>” to the concept art from the early stages of development.“</p><p>The development team also discussed the game’s origins on the original Switch. Many of the key aspects of <em>World</em> — including its interconnected map and increasing the number of players per race from 12 to 24 — were in place early on, but they apparently proved to be a challenge on the previous hardware.</p><p>“When we were developing for the Nintendo Switch system, it was difficult for us to incorporate everything we wanted, so we were always conscious of what we were giving up in return,” programming director Kenta Sato said. “We discussed things like toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and we even considered dropping the frame rate to 30 fps in some cases. It was a tough situation.” Yabuki added that when the idea of moving the game to the Switch 2 came up, “It was truly a ray of hope.”</p><p>There’s a lot more to dig into in the four-part Q&amp;A, including the fact that there will be 200 tracks to listen to and how important food is to the game from a worldbuilding perspective. So you should definitely check out <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-1%2F" rel="sponsored">the full thing</a>. My favorite detail, though, is how a character named Cow made it onto the roster of racers. As art director Masaaki Ishikawa explains it “Cow is actually a pivotal character in the <em>Mario Kart</em> series.“</p><p>After looking at this concept art, I can’t help but agree:</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"If the idea had just been to add more courses, then I think we would’ve called it Mario Kart 9," Yabuki explained. "But, that wasn't our approach this time. We wanted to take the series to the next level. So, we decided to drop the numbering this time and go with a completely new title, Mario Kart World. So, we'd already added "Mario Kart World" to the concept art from the early stages of development."</p><p>Mario Kart World's namesake draws from its tracks being part of one large open world. The game even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-free-roam-mode-features-missions-hidden-collectibles-and-more/1100-6530931/" data-ref-id="1100-6530931">features a Free Roam mode</a> where players can drive around and complete challenges off-track. Yabuki said that he "thought that with modern technology, being able to seamlessly transition between courses and realize a single, vast world wasn't beyond the realm of possibility," so this concept, and the name Mario Kart World, were present from very early on in development.</p><p>The decision to go open world and implement systems like dynamic weather was a massive undertaking for the development team. "The sheer volume of work required to prepare all the art needed to show time and weather changes in a seamless world... We were under no illusion," art director Masaaki Ishikawa admits later on in the interview. "We were even on the verge of giving up on it at one point."</p><p>Historically, Mario Kart games have either referenced the platform they are on or what number game they are in the series in their title. Mario Kart World joins the likes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-double-dash/" data-ref-id="5000-3633">Mario Kart: Double Dash</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-super-circuit/" data-ref-id="5000-2924">Mario Kart: Super Circuit</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-tour/" data-ref-id="5000-477986">Mario Kart Tour</a> in bucking that trend.</p><p>Mario Kart World will launch alongside Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5.

            <p>Donkey Kong - Nintendo's mighty monkey with a penchant for bananas - received a bit of a makeover recently, and now we know why.</p>
<p>We originally got a look at DK's new in-game look back in January, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">gorilla starred in the first brief teaser for Mario Kart World</a>. At this time, fans noticed he looked much closer to his Super Mario Bros. film design than before. Since then, this look has been featured in plenty of Nintendo advertising, and of course the main monkey is set to star in his own <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> game - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> - later this year.</p>
<p>Now, Donkey Kong designer and Nintendo legend <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> has shed some light as to why the company chose to redesign his iconic character for this generation.</p>

<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-shigeru-miyamoto-interview-i-see-nintendo-as-like-a-talent-agency-and-we-have-within-our-roster-a-lot-of-talented-characters">IGN</a>, Miyamoto said "when it comes to character creation and working with characters", he still has an active role in what goes on.</p>
<p>"Looking back to the first generation <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a>, we worked with Rare to create Donkey Kong Country," Miyamoto continued. "When we were talking about trying to create new versions, evolving Donkey Kong, we created the game called Jungle Beat. We worked together with the team that made 3D Mario. With the technology that was available at the time, we were able to make Donkey Kong more expressive."</p>
<p>The creator furthered that "going back to the design that Rare came up with, we reevaluated", with the team wanting to come up with something to make DK's design "more expressive" than before.</p>
<p>"And then when it comes to the movie, we decided to move forward with this new generation Donkey Kong design," Miyamoto concluded.</p>

<p>Soon after Donkey Kong's redesign was first revealed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kongs-new-look-in-switch-2-mario-kart-approved-by-former-rare-artist">former Rare artist Kevin Bayliss shared his thoughts on the new look</a>, stating: "You can take the KONG out of the Country, but you can't take the Country out of the Kong! (I love it - this is really funny! - Everything changes! - Change is good!)."</p>
<p>As for the monkey's upcoming game, Eurogamer's former EIC Tom Phillips has already had some time with Donkey Kong Bananza, which is set to launch on Switch 2 on 17th July.</p>
<p>"Yes, everyone might have been expecting Mario, but Bananza's brawny obliteration is far better suited to his one-time enemy," he wrote after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">hands-on with Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> was originally in development for the original Switch, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> has allowed the developers to realise their vision of an inter-connected world.</p>
<p>Nintendo began prototyping for the new Mario Kart game back in 2017, even during development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>. Development then began at the end of that year.</p>
<p>"I felt that in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, we were able to perfect the formula that we'd been following in the series up to that point, where players race on individual courses," explained Mario Kart World producer Kosuke Yabuki in a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-1/">interview from Nintendo</a>. "That's why, this time, we wanted the gameplay to involve players driving around a large world, and we began creating a world map like this."</p>

<p>Programming director Kenta Sato continued: "When we were developing for Nintendo Switch, we often worried whether we could find the right balance between planning and performance. Of course, the Switch system's performance is sufficient for developing different kinds of games, but if we had included everything we wanted to in this game's vast world, then it wouldn't have run at 60 fps and would have suffered from constant framerate drops.</p>
<p>"I think there were a lot of people on the team who were worried about whether we could really manage it. But once we decided to release this game on Switch 2, we expected our worries to evaporate all at once. I remember being overjoyed when I discovered we could express even more than we'd originally set out to."</p>
<p>Yabuki noted that had the idea for the game just been more courses it would've been called Mario Kart 9, but the new approach led to the name Mario Kart World. In fact, that name was added to concept art in the early stages of development.</p>
<p>"In previous Mario Kart games, after finishing a course, you'd move on to the next course," said Yabuki. "However, I thought that with modern technology, being able to seamlessly transition between courses and realise a single, vast world wasn't beyond the realm of possibility. So, with this in mind, we set out to create a new kind of Mario Kart...And that's when all our troubles began."</p>

<p>Sato had heard of difficulties in creating open world games and felt pressure to achieve this with Mario Kart, especially as Nintendo considers 60fps to be important for the series, as well as split-screen multiplayer. It seems the power of the Switch 2 allowed for this to happen.</p>
<p>The move to an open world also led to the increase of 24 players instead of 12, which was decided fairly early in development.</p>
<p>"By creating long routes in a vast world, you could end up with players spread out in various places, which could diminish the sense that they're racing against each other," said Yabuki. "So, we figured that by increasing the number of racers, you'd be sure to see some competitive action here and there."</p>
<p>Added art director Masaaki Ishikawa: "I felt like the 12 players we had previously was a lot, but as Yabuki-san said, once players spread out, the course starts to look sparse, and the visuals give off a sort of lonely feel. So, I thought that 24 players would be better because there'd be more interaction between various players. That said, it was quite challenging once we got going and the volume of design work increased. But it was worth it."</p>
<p>Speaking of art, the team wanted to recapture the "lively, bustling atmosphere" of Super Mario Kart on the SNES, with a key phrase being "playfulness". This led to the more rounded, cartoonish designs of Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>"The characters in the Super Mario series have a rounded look, so we wanted to give the vehicles a rounded design too, to match their appearance," said Ishikawa. "We also wanted to give the characters a livelier look even while they're in their vehicles, so we put everything together in a way that gives off a sense of playfulness through the combination of the characters' rounded designs, soft facial expressions, and rich movements."</p>
<p>The open world design means courses are now inter-connected across the world, but Yabuki said adding up all the possible variations would "easily exceed 100".</p>

<p>Lastly, the developers discussed the creation of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moo-moo-meadows-cow-is-the-true-star-of-nintendos-switch-2-direct">Mario Kart World's meme-worthy new character, Cow</a>.</p>
<p>"Each new Mario Kart game features new characters to race with, but since we added so many to the previous game, we wondered where we could go from there," said Ishikawa. "And then one of the designers came up with that silly sketch of Cow cruising along, and I thought to myself, 'This is it!' So that's when we realised the course surroundings actually contained a lot of untapped resources.</p>
<p>"The character designer quickly put together a prototype of Cow that could race, and surprisingly it didn't feel out of place at all. So we thought maybe we could include other obstacle characters, and decided to add Cheep Cheep and Pokey as racers. As a result, the idea of taking obstacle characters, usually found in courses in past games, and having them participate in races made sense to me in terms of an interconnected world."</p>
<p>Mario Kart World will launch alongside Nintendo's Switch 2 on 5th June as a key game in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">launch lineup</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-originally-switch-1<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that&nbsp;Switch 2 launch title&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>was originally in development for the first Switch, and that the release of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>'s Booster Course Pass DLC is the reason the game ended up on Switch 2.</p>

<p>The Japanese gaming giant's latest Ask the Developer article is all about the new&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game, which launches <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">alongside the Switch 2 on June 5th</a>. It turns out, though, that Nintendo began prototyping&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>all the way back in 2017.</p>

<p>According to producer Kosuke Yabuki, work on&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>began in March 2017, a month or so before the release of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>. Programming director Kenta Sato says the original plan was to develop for the Switch, but that this threw up a lot of technical issues.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-kart-world-switch-1-game-switch-2-shot.jpg?itok=9F4aF8SX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-kart-world-switch-1-game-switch-2-shot.jpg?itok=qtH1RAF- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>was originally intended as a Switch game.</figcaption></figure><p>Specifically, Sato says there were doubts about whether the original Switch was capable of accommodating&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>'s 24-player limit. The team discussed various solutions, including "toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and...dropping the frame rate to 30fps".</p>

<p>Yabuki says that the team "kick[ed] the can down the road" while trying to work out what to compromise on for&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, but that when&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>'s Booster Course Pass DLC was released, it gave the team "a bit more time to continue development".</p>

<p>During that time, the development team discussed moving&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>to the Switch 2, which became, as Yabuki puts it, "a ray of hope", opening up "a bunch of possibilities" and removing the need to compromise on performance or visual fidelity.</p>




<p><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will launch for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mario-kart-world-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on June 5th. It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">just one of the games</a> that will be available for the system on release, alongside the likes of&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and the bafflingly paid-for&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>.</p>
