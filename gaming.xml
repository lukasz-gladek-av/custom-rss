            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The indie game scene is where you will always find the more experimental titles that big publishers may not feel comfortable funding. It is such a vibrant scene that allows smaller teams and individuals to really go all out. There were a number of outstanding independent games released in 2025, and it was tough to decide on a top three, especially with how muddy the waters can be when trying to determine what counts as “indie” and not, but having made our decision, it’s time to lick the stamp and send it.</p>

<p>After coming up as runner up in our Best Narrative Award, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dispatch">Dispatch</a> has taken the crown to be the best Independent game of 2025. It blends great classic Telltale like storytelling with an excellent visual presentation, and fun superhero management gameplay. AdHoc Studio’s debut title has managed to set a new bar for episodic games, the likes of which we have really not seen for years.</p>


<p>Dispatch manages to take a rather normal segments of life, office politics and a dispatcher job, and turn them on their heads to provide a fun spin. Office politics are a lot harder to handle when you are dealing with beings that could cause you all sorts of problems without breaking a sweat. AdHoc has managed something many studios have struggled to do in the past, and that is balance fun gameplay with a great story, and a memorable look.</p>
<h3>Hades II – Runner Up</h3>
<p>It would be remiss of us not to have the sequel to our Best Independent Game 2020 winner as part of this list. While it can be argued that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hades-ii">Hades II</a> does not quite meet the same heights as the original Hades, very few games could do that. What we have in Hades II is a stellar sequel which saw resource gathering, new people to meet, two separate paths, and a more mechanically involved combat system all added to expand the system.</p>

<p>Hades II also brought us a new protagonist, Melinoe, and a story which sees the Titans declare war on Mount Olympus. Everything is absolutely solid in Hades II and it is only that the story was slightly less engaging than the original for why this has game has not climbed to the top of our Best Independent mountain. Hades II didn’t beat what many consider the perfect game, but it came near close to matching its predecessor.</p>
<h3>Ball X Pit – Runner Up</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ball-x-pit">Ball X Pit</a> is what you would call a mad mashup of ideas that works really well. Developed by Kenny Sun and some friends, it takes brick breaking, base building, and ball attacks to mix it all up into one of the most entertaining roguelikes of the year. It is a fast paced and intense experience with balls flying everywhere as you fight off waves of monsters. Balls can be fused to make new ball loadouts that have various effects, and you also need to rebuild Ballbylon so you can get even more power ups in your fight to beat the monsters.</p>
<p>Ball X Pit is a game that is very hard to put down once you have started your run, the action and need for quick thinking definitely grabbing your attention. Add in the colourful and bold action on the screen with the engrossing gameplay, Ball X Pit is an indie game that has captured a huge audience that just want to unload their balls.</p>
<p><strong>Honourable Mentions</strong> (in alphabetical order)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloverpit</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/pipistrello-and-the-cursed-yoyo-review-stringing-you-along/">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Phew! That’s a pretty big one out of the way. We’ll keep our awards rolling through the weekend. I hope that sounds good to you. Sounds… geddit? See you tomorrow.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The nights are heavy, the sun is frail. The mountain moans its hunger. The rivers are frozen scars and the trees are become hard flashes of black lightning. Bells haunt the wind and peculiar bearded men appear in the fireplaces, to be chased away with pies and brandy. The roses, strangely, are in bloom. 
</p>
<p>Put on your slippers. Stoke the embers. Pull up a chair. It is time to remember. It is time to renew. It is time to succumb to a growing addiction. It is time… to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skeal">Skeal</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>If you’ve played Skeal with us before, there is no need for further words - here’s a link to the <a href="https://whymog.itch.io/skeal-webgl-version">browser version</a>. If you’ve yet to play Skeal, further words will only spoil things. Go on, it’s free.
</p>
<p>Playing Skeal has been an RPS wintermas tradition since Alice O <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skeal-free-skiing-game">declared it so in 2017</a>. After Alice O returned to the sea in 2024 - rumour has it she may indeed now live in a greying tower - Graham <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-almost-christmas-which-means-its-time-to-play-skeal">took up the torch</a>. Now Graham is gone, and I continue the tradition in their stead. Am I making you sad? Excellent – this is the appropriate mood in which to play Skeal. But it’s the good kind of sadness, the sadness of release, the sadness of… truly terrible puns.

<p>Skeal is sort of a lesson in how you can transform a slight cringe into a teary-eyed guffaw by dragging out the punchline and committing to it whole-heartedly. It shouldn’t make me bawl but it does. I am going to get my sister’s partner to play it this holiday. He’s approximately the same age as me and I’m pretty sure this will make him weep too.</p><p>Then I will show it to my nephew, who will look at me like I’ve just offered to feed him a bowl of toothpaste. The key thing is that emotions will be had. I hope Skeal makes you have emotions too.
</p>
<p>Once more with feeling: Skeal is the work of Nick Cummings, who also makes games about <a href="https://www.whymog.net/games">laundry separation, hermit crabs and racoonomics</a>. St Nick, we should call him. Merry Decemberween all.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[HP Drops a 5-Star Laptop by 70% and Throws in $199 Worth of Accessories, Only on Amazon Not the Official Site]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-drops-a-5-star-laptop-by-70-and-throws-in-199-worth-of-accessories-only-on-amazon-not-the-official-site-2000654786</link>
            <guid>1388260</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is making it easier than ever to grab a new laptop without breaking the bank. We’re spotting plenty of amazing deals on a wide range of machines from popular brands like HP, Dell, Asus, Lenovo, and even Apple – basically, there’s something for everyone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6521/">One of our favorite discounts, however, is this 70% drop on the 15.6-inch HP touchscreen laptop, which brings the overall price down to just $650, but that’s not all.</a> You’re also getting a 6-in-1 accessory bundle worth almost $200 with your purchase for free, which adds even more value to the offer. This deal applies to the stunning moonlight blue version, which gives off a premium, sleek look. Just note that the discount wraps up soon, so it’s best to grab it before the price shoots back up to $2,200.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6521/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Power</h2>
<p>You’re greeted with a stunning 15.6-inch Full HD display upon opening the laptop. The screen features an ultra-thin 6.5 mm micro-edge bezel for a bigger viewing area, while the anti-glare coating keeps the visuals easy on your eyes. Touch support takes this a bit further by making navigation a breeze. You won’t have to rely on the trackpad or the mouse solely to get things done. Need to scroll a long document? Just use your fingers directly on the screen. The included touchscreen pen also makes it quite easy to swipe, draw, sketch, and even type!</p>
<p>The screen is paired with a full-sized keyboard, alongside a dedicated numeric keypad, which is quite comfortable to use. It provides your wrist with the support it needs for jotting down long documents, plus includes a dedicated Copilot key that launches the helpful AI assistant instantly. There’s also a built-in webcam, with integrated microphones for convenient video calls.</p>



<p>Power comes from the combination of an Intel Core i3-N305 processor and a modest 16GB RAM. Together, these let you push through busy, productive days with ease, regardless of the task at hand. The 1TB SSD, on the other hand, offers ample space to store all your important documents and files in a single place, without feeling limited.</p>
<p>Battery life is another strong selling point. A single charge offers over 9 hours of use, which means you can go an entire workday without worrying about running out of power. Recharging is fast too, so you won’t have to stay tethered to an outlet for long when running low. And finally, the free accessory bundle includes a touchscreen pen, a 128GB thumb drive, a laptop bag, a cleaning cloth, a camera protector, dust plugs, and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed. That’s everything you need to get started with work and entertainment, right away, and you’re basically getting far more than just a direct discount with this deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6521/">This laptop is currently down to just $650 at Amazon, which is practically nothing for a device this packed.</a> This is the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while, but the offer won’t be around for long. Grab it while there’s still time, as it could wrap up any moment now. Once it’s gone, we don’t expect it to be back at this price anytime soon.</p>

                <p>It's almost the end of 2025, and in the spirit of Spotify Wrapped, several big companies have invited subscribers to review their last year of activity. Sony got the ball rolling with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-2025-wrap-up-see-how-much-you-played-this-year/1100-6536799/">PlayStation Wrap-Up</a>, Steam offers a similar annual roundup, and the <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1999147161989128217" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Year in Review recap</a> has been announced for early next year--but where is Xbox in the middle of all this?</p><p>While it doesn't offer an Xbox wrap-up every year, it still feels odd for Microsoft's gaming brand to skip 2025. The year has seen several high-profile releases from the company and the launch of an Xbox-branded handheld gaming PC alongside Asus, but according to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-not-doing-an-xbox-wrapped-this-year-but-does-have-big-plans-for-the-25th-anniversary" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, Microsoft is allocating its marketing budget toward celebrating several major anniversaries in 2026.</p><p>The Xbox brand celebrates its 25th anniversary next year, Blizzard has its 35th anniversary to look forward to, and Bethesda is turning 40. Those are several significant milestones in proximity to each other, and it's a safe bet that Microsoft wants to accommodate them, possibly explaining the lack of an Xbox Wrapped this year. On top of that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2026-tickets-go-on-sale-soon-heres-how-much-theyll-cost/1100-6535959/">we'll see the return of BlizzCon in September</a>, and Blizzard has teased its "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-biggest-year-yet-coming-in-2026-for-35th-anniversary-president-says/1100-6537061/">biggest year yet</a>" for 2026.</p><p>Outside of Microsoft, several other gaming franchises will also have plenty of reasons to celebrate. The 30th anniversary of Pokemon is next year, Sonic the Hedgehog turns 35, and both The Legend of Zelda and Castlevania will reach the 40th anniversary milestone in 2026.</p><p>We have contacted Xbox to find out if there are any plans for a year-in-review wrap-up, and will update this article as soon as we hear back.</p>

<h2>Manor Lords Update 5 Version 0.8.029–0.8.050 patch notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Starting Location Selection</b>: Ability to select the starting location in the game setup screen for the player and adversaries.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>New Maps</b>: Devil’s Hill, Jagged Cliffs, Divided and Lake Lemm.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>New Game Modes</b>: Duel (1 vs 1 with AI) and Fractured Realm (4 Lord free-for-all).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>New Buildings, Jobs &amp; Resources</b>: Quarry, Stonemason, Lime Kiln, and their connected resources: Rough Stone, Dressed Stone, Mortar.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Wall Positioning</b>: A new system for positioning units on walls.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Ladder Climbing</b>: Units now climb ladders to access higher floors.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Hover Fortifications</b>: The player can now hover the castle fortifications and see the soldiers inside.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Gate Control</b>: Added the ability to open and close each castle gate individually.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Castle Upgrade System:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Module Upgrades</b>: Every castle module, including walls and gates, can now be upgraded to lv2.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Placement Logic</b>: Module placement is no longer restricted by distance to the nearest major module. The planner now displays the total Bailey Area. The Bailey area allowed for construction is limited by your lord’s or lady’s Rank (still WIP).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Wall Platforms</b>: You can now attach platforms to the castle walls. The level of platforms is capped by the wall type.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Affinity System:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Environment Types</b>: Each Region is divided by area into multiple Environment Types: (Meadow, Woodland, Farmland, Urban, Rural).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Building Affinities</b>: Different buildings can have Affinities with different Environment Types, for instance, the Animal Pen has a “Pannage” Affinity which decreases the time to yield for Pig Pens relative to the Woodland area.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Maintenance System:</b><br>
<wbr></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Workplace Maintenance</b>: A lot of workplaces now must be maintained by delivering resources to function properly.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Failure Risks</b>: Failure to maintain a building can result in various risks, such as collapse for mines, injury and even a minor death chance.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Rate Tuning</b>: You can tune a workplace’s level of maintenance, affecting Labor Speed.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Yield System:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Yield Definition</b>: Yield is a measure of how much your workplace produces. Various buildings use different timespans and benchmark values depending on their nature.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Yield Influencers</b>: Yield can be affected by Labor Speed, Efficiency, and Productivity.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Labor Speed</b>: Labor Speed measures how fast your workers perform workplace related tasks.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Efficiency</b>: Efficiency measures how much output you get per input when crafting, per plant when farming or per passive income cycle, depending on the production type. High Efficiency means your Gardens will produce more Vegetables and your Crafting tasks may produce extra items.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Productivity</b>: Productivity is a measure of your logistics: transport and labor times vs idle times, sickness, extension work and militia assignments.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Approval Rework:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Memory Weight Shift</b>: Approval memory weight was shifted to dramatically favor current events versus past events.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Approval Tiers</b>: There are now 7 approval Tiers. Landing in a specific Approval Tier will give various penalties and bonuses to growth, influence, income among others.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Food Resource Rework:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Food Categories</b>:All foods now fit within food categories; Foraged Goods, Meats, Fishes, Vegetables, Grains and Animal Produce.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Burgage Plot Requirement overhaul</b>: Burgage Plots now require a variety of foods from different categories, encouraging more diverse variety as they upgrade.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Expanded Vegetables</b>: Vegetables resource was split into Cabbages, Carrots and Beetroots.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Expanded Orchards</b>: In addition to Apples, Pears and Quinces were added as new Orchard options.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Expanded Meats</b>: Meat was divided into: Mutton, Chevon, Pork, Beef, Chicken, Small Game, and is produced by their respective animals accordingly.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Expanded Fish</b>: Fish was divided into Carp (from ponds) and Eel (from rivers).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>New Food:</b>&nbsp;Milk is passively produced by Goats for the Animal Produce category.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Wild Animals</b>: Deer were replaced by Small Game since it’s more plausible in historical terms. Small Game also yields Pelts, which is an early trade commodity.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Foraged Goods</b>: Alongside Berries, Mushrooms have been reintroduced as a Foraged Good.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Honey</b>: Honey is no longer consumed. It is intended for use in a future update, but for now can be sold, while the Apiary Extension boosts the yield of Farms and Orchards through the Pollination Affinity.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Regional Development System Rework:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Development Perks</b>: To a lot of players, the development tree was a weak point of the game and described as immersion breaking. Therefore, a new, more grounded system of Development Perks has been introduced. The player will now face more realistic choices at each settlement level and those choices reflect the settlement development stage.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Perk Design</b>: The perks are also designed to be more nuanced from a game design perspective so that choices are less immediately obvious, but compound into strong specializations over time.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Rollout Status</b>: Since it’s still in progress, only the first batch of perks (Origins) is available.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Policies</b>: Policies are temporarily removed (still undergoing rework).<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>General:</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Removed a lot of chance based mechanics in favor of more deterministic calculations to make yield balance more predictable (this includes farming and mining which used to be chance based).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Yields are more linear as Orchard Trees and Field Crops mature.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Moved consumption &amp; approval data to the Family structure instead of storing it on husbands (this was a temporary workaround to represent per family consumption and approval effects).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Since individual villagers no longer have a consumption update, we also moved the disease data to the Family structure. As a side effect, whole families will now get sick together.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Fishing nodes often spawn in rivers now (allowing river fishing).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Streams now use the river system and therefore will spawn small bridges.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added a new Elevation overlay for use with Farming and Livestock.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Replaced the Brewery extension placeholder.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added an additional road to Wirnitz in Germanic Valley<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added an extra hard cap for storage distribution limits, eg. if a stall has 21 items for some reason but only 20 storage space, the extra item will not count as supply.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Quality of Life Improvements:</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a “Protect Resource Area” checkbox for the Logging Camp and Firewood Cutter which makes workers automatically avoid deforestation near vulnerable resources.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Worker families assigned to a building being upgraded will now participate in the construction.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Oxen transporting Timber for construction will get the nearest log instead of nearest on the ground before from buildings.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Oxen transporting Timber will now prioritize delivering to a target near where the Timber is picked up.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Blocked sons with jobs from refueling the home if there is a female family member without any task that can do it instead.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Workplace animals will now be assigned a home as close as possible to the workplace.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When debranching a tree, Workers will always pick the one closest to them.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When cutting down a tree, Workers will pick the nearest one, unless too far away from the Logging Camp.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Changed order of goods produced for Blacksmith and Joiner to list Spears and Large shields first.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Artisans will start producing the first listed good when their workshop is built.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Trading Post Workers will now only use Horses that are assigned to their Trading Post (Horses are automatically assigned when they arrive).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Due to tester feedback, storage building workers supply their Stalls from their own Storehouse/Granary only.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When taking care of the dead, bodies will now be moved to the nearest Corpse Pit or Church.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Manor Specific:</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Manors no longer have families living in them (since Manors aren’t residential and can’t fulfil requirements it was always a bit weird).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When castle modules are placed on a wall, they will split the wall and snap the walls to edges instead of clipping with the module.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added an option to join 2 walls into 1 after you snap their ends together.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added missing wall snapping points to the outer towers.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When rotating a module, the attached walls should now stay attached. The rotation is limited if a module has wall connections.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Castle modules now collide with each other when placing in order to avoid building areas impossible for pathfinding and reduce clipping.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Adjustments:</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Deprecated some jobs since they no longer were fitting the game design: Removed Dye and Dyer in their previous implementation. Removed Firewood Cart and Food Cart.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Cloaks are removed, instead, there are two recipes for producing Clothes – either from Wool or from Linen.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Apiary is now a backyard extension. Wax is now produced every third cycle from an Apiary.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Removed the “Fence up” Upgrade from fields since it’s a leftover of the previous development tree and doesn’t quite fit anymore.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Temporary removal of the “Force Early Harvest” button in the Farmhouse.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Granary workers no longer supply Windmills since it was inconsistent with all the other workplaces needing to get their own crafting resources.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Pigs, Goats and hunting hounds no longer use the livestock order timer the Oxen/Mules/Horses do.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Technical:</b><br>

            <guid>1388236</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Vancouver-based game developer <strong>The Coalition</strong> is working hard (<a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-is-being-co-developed-by-people-can-fly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the help of Polish developer People Can Fly</a>) to complete <strong>Gears of War: E-Day</strong>, its first new game since 2019's Gears 5, for the planned 2026 launch. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> to the public during the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2024, but the studio has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-has-been-in-active-development-for-over-five-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actively on it for nearly six years at this point</a>. </p>



<p>Granted, the team also had other projects, such as supporting Splash Damage on Gears Tactics, 343 Industries on Halo Infinite, and Epic Games on The Matrix Awakens and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-the-coalition-unreal-engine-5-xbox-series-x-alpha-point-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alpha Point Unreal Engine 5 demo</a>. This year, The Coalition launched Gears of War: Reloaded, a remaster of the first installment in the third-person shooter series and the first franchise entry to launch on Sony's PlayStation 5 consoles.</p>



<p>But it's with Gears of War: E-Day that The Coalition truly aims to make an impact. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/18/xbox-bethesda-blizzard-activision-king-2025-games-thank-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to the Xbox Wire blog</a> as part of a larger end-of-the-year interview with developers from the Xbox, Bethesda, and Activision Blizzard King divisions, they stated:</p>



<p><em>Next year marks the 20th anniversary of Gears of War, and we can’t think of a bigger way to celebrate than with the release of Gears of War: E-Day. This is our most ambitious game yet, entirely built from scratch in Unreal Engine 5 to feel like Gears and play like new. This is a return to our roots as Marcus &amp; Dom face the Locust for the first time ever. It’s the best place to jump into the Gears universe and we can’t wait to share more next year.</em></p>



<p>It is unclear what metric they are considering for this particular claim. We know that E-Day will be more linear than Gears 5, which included open-ended exploration areas and some side content, so they are unlikely to be referring to scope. Perhaps it's merely a reference to an increased budget. </p>



<p>Anyway, Gears of War: E-Day will be an origin story set fourteen years before the first Gears game, on Emergence Day, when the Locust Horde first emerged from its underground tunnels to overwhelm the surface world of the planet Sera. Despite Gears of War: Reloaded's launch on PlayStation 5, E-Day is currently only announced for PC and Xbox Series S and X.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-breaks-its-pricing-rules-on-the-clip-5-speaker-basically-giving-it-away-as-a-christmas-deal-2000654316</link>
            <guid>1388233</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A quality Bluetooth speaker is a must-have for pretty much everyone. Whether you’re spending time with friends at the park or tackling household chores, a portable speaker can completely set the mood. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6243/">The JBL Clip 5 is the ideal companion for any situation where you’d want to reach for a Bluetooth speaker, and right now, you can grab it at a 25% discount on Amazon.</a> Originally priced at $80, the JBL Clip 5 is now available for just $60. With powerful sound, a durable design, and a range of stylish color options, it’s a high-quality option for music lovers on the move.</p>
<p>The JBL Clip 5 delivers powerful, clear sound with deep bass, no matter where you take it. Whether you’re at the beach, by the pool, or on a hike, this portable speaker ensures your music stays crisp and vibrant. It’s built with an IP67 rating, meaning it is both waterproof and dustproof. So whether you’re caught in a rainstorm or accidentally drop it in the sand, the JBL Clip 5 is made to withstand the elements. The rugged exterior combines durable fabric with rubber, ensuring the speaker can handle the outdoors and a bit of rough treatment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6243/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Portability at Its Finest</h2>
<p>The “Clip” in JBL Clip 5 isn’t just a name. The whole design is built around it. The speaker includes an integrated carabiner clip. While the speaker itself is compact and easy to carry, the clip allows you to securely attach it to your bag or belt loop. Once you’re at your destination, the clip can be used to fasten it to your beach chair or whatever else, making sure your music is always within reach and ready to go.</p>
<p>A portable speaker isn’t much good if the battery runs out halfway through a playlist. Fortunately, the JBL Clip 5 offers impressive battery life, delivering up to 12 hours of playtime on a single charge. And if you need a little extra time, you can activate the Playtime Boost feature, which prioritizes power and gives you up to three additional hours of listening time—bringing the total playtime to 15 hours. With this extended battery life, the JBL Clip 5 is equipped to last through a full day of adventure or relaxation alike.</p>



<p>JBL speakers are known for their stylish and vibrant designs, and the JBL Clip 5 continues that tradition. Beyond just the classic color options like black and white, the JBL Clip 5 offers a variety of fun and bold choices. You can opt for a sleek black-and-orange combination or choose a playful pink-and-blue, sand-and-green, or solid blue, purple, or red color schemes. For those who prefer something a bit edgier, there’s even a camouflage “squad” pattern. Just make sure not to set it down in the grass. You’ll never find it again.</p>
<p>As a JBL speaker, the JBL Clip 5 is equipped with Auracast. This lets you pair two or more Auracast-enabled speakers together, synchronized to the same audio, to create even bigger sound. It’s great for having a party, and making sure the same music is playing throughout different rooms of the house or both inside and outside in the backyard.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Nintendo Switch 2 Just Got Another Last-Minute Discount]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-just-got-another-last-minute-discount-2000654829</link>
            <guid>1388227</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re in the market for <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-better-tech-enshitification-google-review-1851784417">a Nintendo Switch 2</a> and live close to a Microcenter, you’re in luck. The PC store chain currently has the console marked down to just $400 in a surprise last-minute discount for the most popular new gaming hardware of the year.</p> <p>Microcenter is <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/695288/nintendo-switch-2-console">currently advertising</a> the console at $50 off it’s regular sticker price. Not bad for the Switch 2’s first holiday. The catch is that you have to actually go to Microcenter to get it, however. There’s no shipping, so you either need to live close or drive far. The store closest to me says it has 25 unit in stock as of this writing, though it’s not clear how long the discount will be in effect.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo Switch 2 is $399.99 at Micro Center (in-stores) <a href="https://t.co/Jw6BrF6Ufj">https://t.co/Jw6BrF6Ufj</a> <a href="https://t.co/SpmMKtmVIx">pic.twitter.com/SpmMKtmVIx</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/2001655303683678709?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s worth noting that this is only for the standalone console, not the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle. If you were planning on also buying that game, which costs an additional $80, you’d basically only be saving $20 off the normal bundle price. Still something, but not as good as the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle discounted to $450 that <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sale-cyber-monday-mario-kart-world-walmart-amazon-2000649232">Walmart and some other stores</a> were selling earlier this month.</p> <p>Any savings on a new console, especially one that’s sold as well as the Switch 2 in its first year, comes as a nice surprise. It’s also been an unexpectedly tough holiday season for new console sales. Circana recently reported that only <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-sales-inflation-economy-2000654196">1.6 million units were sold in November</a> across Switch 2, Switch 1, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, making it the worst pre-holiday sales month for gaming hardware since 1995. That’s because even with Black Friday discounts, the average cost of a new console keeps going up.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Mintrocket has revealed more on the forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> DLC In The Jungle in its latest vlog, including new locations, gameplay, and mechanics.</p>
<p>The DLC was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-in-the-jungle-announced">first teased at last year's The Game Awards</a> show, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-delays-in-the-jungle-dlc-but-sure-knows-how-to-soften-the-blow-with-these-other-announcements">back in June it was delayed until 2026</a>. It's still without a firm release date, but we now know more about what's included in its 10 hour runtime.</p>
<p>First up is the jungle village of Utara. Here, time flows in real-time, and Dave can spend time befriending villagers, gathering resources, and completing quests, all presented in an isometric view. It all sounds very Animal Crossing.</p>

<p>That view also lends itself to the new restaurant, the Bancho Grill. Rather than the fixed horizontal movement of the base game, Dave will be able to freely manoeuvre around this restaurant, with befriended villagers rocking up to eat.</p>
<p>And it's a grill rather than a sushi restaurant this time, as freshwater lake aquatic life requires cooking before eating.</p>
<p>As for the lake, expect plenty of dangers like piranhas and crocodiles, as well as tasty fish. Dave will be equipped with a new Jungle Gun that can freely transform between net guns, shotguns, snipers, and more, which should make underwater combat a little more flexible.</p>

<p>In all, it's looking like a substantial extension of the base game that sees Mintrocket experimenting with gameplay and minigames alike.</p>
<p>Dave the Diver is also heading to mobile devices next year, launching first in China and then globally. It will be fully optimised for the platform, with appropriate controls too.</p>
<p>It follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-finally-arrives-on-xbox-series-xs-two-years-after-making-a-splash-on-pc">release of the game on Xbox last month</a>, announced at the Xbox Partner Preview, meaning the game is now available across PC (Steam, Epic), PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch consoles.</p>

<p>Back on dry land</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It was almost exactly a year ago that we first heard about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a>'s 'In the Jungle' DLC at The Game Awards 2024. We got a brief look at the expansion in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/dave-the-diver-in-the-jungle-dlc-swims-onto-switch-in-2026">November Xbox Showcase</a>, but today, developer MINTROCKET has fully lifted the lid on what we can expect.</p>
<p>In a new 'Dev Dive' video, the team gives us our best look yet at the upcoming DLC, which apparently adds roughly 10 hours of gameplay to the already beefy base game.</p>
<p>We get to see the jungle village of Utara, complete with its own real-time day/night cycle, where Dave can converse with the locals, freely dive into the freshwater lake, and gather resources. It still feels a bit strange to see Dave move in a 3D plane, but the whole thing looks really rather sweet. This locale is also home to Bancho's Grill, a new restaurant to keep everyone happy.</p>
<p>The trailer also gives us a closer look at Dave's new diving spot, and his fresh transforming 'Jungle Gun' weapon to fend off the beasties therein.</p>

<p>It promises to be quite the expansion when it arrives on Switch and Switch 2 at some point next year. MINTROCKET still hasn't shared a precise date, but we'll be keeping an eye out over the coming months for more information.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Mintrocket has released a new developer diary to mark the end of the 2025, with game director Jaeho Hwang giving details on what has been happening at the studio and what to expect going forward. We get a look at Mintrocket’s new office, but the main area of concentration is Dave The Diver’s Into The Jungle DLC which is due out in early 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Latest In the Jungle DLC News, 2025 Recaps &amp; More! | DEV DIVE" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E5_pWDFRca0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Dave The Diver Into The Jungle is expected to have around 10 hours of new content for players to experience in the jungle village of Utara. Here Dave can spend his day helping villagers with their requests, or gathering fruit and minerals. If that doesn’t take Dave’s fancy there’s a new restaurant to visit that is run by Bancho. Here Dave can help serve multiple customers, with these customers being people Dave has built relationships with. The restaurant is not called Bancho Sushi, as the fish in the freshwater lake cannot be served like that, so instead the restaurant is Bancho Grill.</p>
<p>When Dave The Diver goes diving in the jungle lake he will have to watch out for threats like crocodile, catfish, electric eels, and piranhas. However, Dave is not an easy snack for these predators as he comes armed with the new Jungle Gun, which has multiple forms including shotgun, netgun, sniper rifle, and a regular gun depending on the danger. On land, Dave can wander the jungle with friends and experience different jungle themed minigames including what seems to be a guitar hero style rhythm game. In addition, there has been confirmation there will be guest characters from other games in the Into The Jungle DLC, but Mintrocket has not said who.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Mintrocket has announced it has partnered with XD to bring Dave The Diver to mobile devices. The mobile version is not going to be a straight port of Dave The Diver, with the UI and controls redesigned for the mobile experience. Dave The Diver Mobile will be released in China first with a global release to follow soon afterwards.</p>

            <guid>1388200</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you haven't heard of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lorns-lure-review-call-of-void" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Lorn's Lure</em></a><em>, </em>you're about to learn something today. One way to describe it is one of 2024's best indie games. Another is to say it's this amazing, somewhat niche, experimental, and ominously beautiful first-person <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/platformer/games" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">platformer</a> that takes place within a mysterious megastructure. It even has a brand-new DLC with <em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em>.</p><p>The main game is inspired by my favorite manga author, Tsutomi Nihei, who is a master of his craft. He puts his architecture background to incredible use and illustrates these haunting, gigantic structures filled with unfathomable secrets.&nbsp;</p><p>While <em>Lorn's Lure</em> already took some inspiration from Nihei, I was very intrigued to try out one particular map in this collection, called "Blame." It's the name of Nihei's most famous work, <em>Blame!</em>, so I knew this was going to be something special to me. Besides that, we have four other maps with a central "parkour" theme that are sure to keep your attention for a good few hours.</p><p>With five different maps offering five different experiences, I'm going to go against the grain and rate every level on its own merits with a handful of "mini-reviews" with their own number ratings, then we'll average those numbers up and see what we get for the whole package.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The<em> Blame!</em> vibes are strong here.&nbsp;</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Blame is the closest we get to an additional <em>Lorn's Lure</em> chapter. It's roughly the same length as a story chapter and focuses on exploration rather than speed. Mechanically, players are given just a few upgrades, so you don't have a double-jump or grapple at your disposal. This one is purely about the vibes, and that's what made me fall in love with <em>Lorn's Lure</em> in the first place.</p><p>Elements from the <em>Blame! </em>manga are perhaps more overt here than any other chapter, with concrete, drab megastructures looming in the distance, leading into areas with unknown technology, pipes (Nihei loves to draw his intricate network of pipes, after all), and castle-like buttresses and towers.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Please admire my video game photography skills.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This would make an excellent addition to the story of <em>Lorn's Lure</em> were it not a part of the <em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack. </em>While it's not the most difficult or intense chapter, it does what <em>Lorn's Lure</em> does best, instilling a sense of awe at the sheer scale of the world compared to tiny ol' you.</p><p>Final Verdict: 9/10</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Nothing else to do but jump.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em> - Fall</h2><p>Fall is a quick, intense experience in <em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em>. You're descending a giant pit, all the way to the bottom. <em>Lorn's Lure</em> mechanics dictate that falling too fast will result in your death as soon as you hit the ground, so the name of the game here is to take a measured approach.</p><p>You're equipped with a grapple, so Fall becomes quite an exciting experience when you're able to utilize this tool. The physics for the grapple are fantastic, so you end up feeling like Spider-Man, trying his best not to fall too hard while also rushing to the finish to get a high score.</p><figure role="group">

  </picture>
<figcaption>Make use of that grapple, or you're cooked.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is one of the shortest maps in the pack, but there's a decent variety of obstacles given that it's a completely vertical map. It can also be a bit challenging, even for someone like me who likes to take things safe, slow, and steady.</p><p>Final Verdict: 7.5/10</p><figure role="group">

                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorn-s-lure-parkour-map-pack-procgenv1.jpg?itok=V83xqfw7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

<figcaption>Sheesh, where to even begin when you only have a single checkpoint to start?</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em> - ProcGenV1</h2><p>ProcGenV1 is a very experimental map in this collection, but definitely one of the highlights of <em>Parkour Pack</em>'s offerings. As the name implies, it's a procedurally generated experience. There are, in essence, unlimited possibilities in ProcGenV1, as it creates a large environment of megastructures to explore.&nbsp;</p><p>The goal of this map is to find the "extraction hut," which finishes the level. The environment is filled with various other huts high and low, and most have an arrow pointing to the actual extraction hut. Huts have items that players can use at their disposal to aid in their adventure, adding a nice twist on the simplistic platforming of <em>Lorn's Lure</em>.</p><p>Items include a stamina boost, boots to increase your jumping abilities, a one-time use grapple (refillable if you find more), and a checkpoint USB. In the main game of <em>Lorn's Lure</em>, checkpoints are aplenty, but with them being so scarce in ProcGenV1, you're encouraged to be methodical and only take risks when it's absolutely necessary.</p><figure role="group">
<picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorn-s-lure-parkour-map-pack-arrow.jpg?itok=xJgXF3o- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture>
<figcaption>The arrow is just vague enough to still be challenging, especially when a level is as big as this.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I'm just amazed by the complexity of environments created in ProcGenV1. They are a little drab in appearance, but as I understand it, Rubeki Games will update this with new features every once in a while. I see a great deal of potential in ProcGenV1 evolving into something amazing; for now, it could use more variation in appearance and perhaps more items.</p><p>There's also a really pesky mechanic where some items are poisoned, and that decreases your stamina by a large amount for several minutes. Because of the way these levels are generated, you usually never have enough stamina to go anywhere when it's so low, so I usually waited it out until the poison debuff was removed.&nbsp;</p><p>Final Verdict: 8.5/10</p><figure role="group">

  </picture>
<figcaption>The closest I'll ever get to doing parkour in my life is through <em>Lorn's Lure</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em> - Rubeki's Pro Traceur</h2><p>Rubeki's Pro Traceur is a beautiful parkour-based map that replaces <em>Lorn's Lure</em>'s megastructures with a small urban environment. Resembling that of a European city, this map touts itself as a "parkour sandbox."&nbsp;</p><p>The main objective of this map is to gather all the crystals. It seems to take inspiration from <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> in particular, with its Delfino Plaza-esque visuals and vibes. Your objective is to gather all the crystals on this map, of which there are 25.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">
<picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorn-s-lure-parkour-map-pack-nice-view.jpg?itok=A5SW6SWu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture>
<figcaption>What a nice view!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Buildings are close together to create narrow alleys to bounce around on. Crystals at the top of the building are quite difficult to reach, especially when you're stripped of your usual climbing tools. I ran into an issue where I was given the option to pick up climbing tools right from the start, but I don't think that was intentional since it largely strips the map of any sort of difficulty.&nbsp;</p><p>Even so, Rubeki's Pro Traceur is fine for what it is. It's short and doesn't try to be anything but a little sandbox to give players the ability to flex their platforming skills. It's far from the slower, exploration-based platforming that I prefer, but it's still worth one play.&nbsp;</p><p>Final Verdict: 7/10</p><figure role="group">
<picture>

  </picture>
<figcaption>Gotta go fast, but also, I'm too scared to.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</em> - Sonic</h2><p>The idea behind Sonic is to create a high-speed obstacle course for players, with devastating consequences for failure. It's a somewhat linear track that hangs high above in a megastructure, so if you fall, you're going right back to the start. The twist here is that you're given super speed, so it's actually very challenging to deal with this newfound mobility.</p><p>You don't have any tools at your disposal other than this speed. Unfortunately, there was one obstacle near the start that, try as I might, I couldn't find how to overcome. I didn't get a real chance to experience this one, so I'll just admit defeat and say this level wasn't for me (especially since I prefer the slower, methodical gameplay as opposed to speed). While I won't give it a final score since I didn't complete it, I know this one isn't for me.</p><p>Final Verdict: N/A</p><figure role="group">
<picture>

<h2><em>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p>While Blame and ProcGenV1 are the main appeal here, there's something for fans of speedier gameplay in Sonic, Rubeki's Pro Traceur, and Fall. All-in-all, it's a nice little package to give fans more <em>Lorn's Lure</em> content, but what I'm <em>especially</em> interested in is seeing how ProcGenV1 develops in the future.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em><strong>Lorn's Lure: Parkour Map Pack</strong> was reviewed on PC using a code provided by the developer over the course of 5 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <guid>1388188</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Handheld gaming PCs have been enjoying a surge in popularity over the last few years. The Steam Deck was the device that truly opened the floodgates, proving that a near-full PC gaming experience could be packed into a portable form. Not long after, other handhelds like the Lenovo Legion Go and the Asus ROG Ally started popping up, giving players even more options. These systems are undeniably convenient and surprisingly powerful for their size, and there’s a certain appeal to curling up on the couch and launching full PC titles without dragging out a bulky laptop.</p>
<p>That said, handheld gaming PCs still come with a fairly narrow focus. They’re designed for gaming, and can’t do anything else. If you need a machine that can handle your workload, web browsing, content consumption, and gaming all in one package, a traditional gaming laptop remains the more practical choice. At the moment, Amazon is offering a particularly strong deal on the Asus TUF F16, making it worth serious consideration. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6520/">Normally priced around $1,000, the 2024 laptop is currently discounted to $800, representing a substantial $200 price cut.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6520/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This configuration of the TUF F16 is powered by an Intel Core 5 210H processor paired with an NVIDIA GeForce 4050 laptop GPU and 8GB of RAM. If you want something a bit better than that, the 2025 model is also on sale. That one comes with and Intel Core i5 13450HX processor and the NVIDIA GeForce 5050 laptop GPU with16GB of RAM. This one is $300 off, bringing the price down from $1,300 to just an even $1,000. Either comes with a 512GB SSD to for all your storage needs.</p>
<h2>Gaming Performance</h2>
<p>While the Asus TUF Gaming F16 is not a top-tier powerhouse built to max out every new AAA release, it offers very respectable performance for the price. Indie titles will run effortlessly, and many larger games should perform smoothly at medium settings without major compromises.</p>



<p>The Asus TUF F16 features a 16-inch display with a taller 16:10 aspect ratio. It runs at Full HD resolution and supports a smooth 144Hz refresh rate, making it well suited for fast-paced games and competitive play. Adaptive-Sync technology works to reduce screen tearing and stuttering for a more fluid experience. Slim bezels surround the display, giving you more usable screen real estate without making the laptop feel overly large or cumbersome.</p>
<p>In terms of design, Asus keeps things relatively understated. The keyboard is full-size and includes a dedicated number pad, something that has become less common on modern laptops. The gold-accented WASD keys add a touch of personality without pushing the system into flashy, over-the-top territory.</p>
<p>When it comes to battery life, the Asus TUF F16 holds its own. The 90Wh battery supports fast charging, allowing it to reach 50% capacity in roughly 30 minutes. There’s also a 100W USB-C port for charging phones or accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6520/">Overall, at just $800, the Asus TUF F16 delivers strong value. It’s a capable gaming hub that can easily handle your basic, everyday laptop needs.</a></p>

    <p><span>10-hour-long expansion due out in early 2026.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > MINTROCKET [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/nexon/mintrocket">MINTROCKET</a> has released a new “Developer Dive” video for <em><a title="Games > DAVE THE DIVER [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dave-the-diver">DAVE THE DIVER</a></em>, reflecting on 2025 and sharing studio updates, including a deep dive of information on the downloadable content “In the Jungle,” which is due out in early 2026. <span id="more-1016477"></span></p><p>Here are the details:</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ Downloadable Content “In the Jungle”</strong></p><p>Following the gameplay sneak peek as part of November’s <a title="Platforms > Xbox [27,273 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a> Partner Preview, Mintrocket reveals that the next downloadable content—the largest story expansion yet—will launch with approximately 10 hours of content. Much of this new <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,799 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> introduces fresh, surprising mechanics and systems that branch boldly away from the base game and previous downloadable contents.</p><p>In “In the Jungle,” Dave heads into freshwater as he embraces new responsibilities and challenges, including befriending the locals of his and a friend’s new home base: a quaint jungle village brimming with opportunity… and just a splash of danger.</p><p><strong>The Village</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Welcome to Utara, a jungle village where time flows in real-time. Here, Dave can spend his days freely diving underwater, gathering fruits and resources—and, naturally, building relationships with the locals by completing tasks and side quests.</p><p>As ever, Dave finds himself surrounded by potential friends (and future customers) whose trust and patronage must be earned. As relationships deepen, so too do the rewards, unlocking new opportunities throughout Utara and creating ripple effects that extend all the way to Bancho’s restaurant business.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_001.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>The Restaurant</strong></p><p>One of “In the Jungle’s” biggest departures from the base game is the introduction of Bancho Grill, a brand-new restaurant in Utara featuring a fully cooked freshwater menu.</p><p>Unlike Bancho Sushi, where movement was limited, Dave can now move freely throughout the Grill, serving customers across multiple areas rather than a single horizontal plane. As Dave’s bonds with villagers grow, they’ll begin visiting Bancho Grill as diners, making the restaurant a key hub, and a vital link, between Dave and the village community.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_005.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Systems and Mechanics</strong></p><p>This time around, Dave dives into a massive freshwater lake instead of the Blue Hole—one packed with new aquatic life, unexpected cuisine options, and plenty of lurking danger. New waters demand new tools, and Mintrocket revealed Dave’s latest piece of gear: the Jungle Gun. This versatile weapon can freely transform into net guns, shotguns, snipers, or regular guns, allowing Dave to adapt on the fly and giving players the freedom to experiment with their preferred combat styles.</p><p>Combined with a shift from fully horizontal movement to a more free-flowing isometric view, along with real-time progression, Dave will need to carefully balance priorities and make smarter use of space and time. Expect new minigames with friends, jungle-specific adventures, and a wide variety of activities that benefit Bancho Grill, or Utara as a whole.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_007.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_008.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_009.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DAVE-THE-DIVER_2025_12-19-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■&nbsp;<em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> <a title="Platforms > Mobile [3,087 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/mobile">Mobile</a></strong></p><p>Rounding out today’s Dev Dive, Mintrocket also revealed plans to complete Dave’s multi-platform expedition by bringing the game to mobile platforms together with a partner. <em>DAVE THE DIVER</em> on mobile won’t be a simple port—instead, the game will be fully optimized and redesigned to perform seamlessly on mobile.

Arkansas State was up 31-7 going into the fourth, but Missouri State battled back, scoring 21 points in the fourth to make it close.</p><p>Naturally, the Xbox Bowl was full of Xbox-branded partnerships, including Master Chief doing the coin toss to start the game. Corey Rucker Jr. of Arkansas State won Offensive MVP of the Xbox Bowl, earning himself an <a href="https://x.com/ESPNCFB/status/2001894073200701877" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Achievement Unlocked"</a> trophy, while Kyle Taylor of Arkansas State won Defensive MVP of the Xbox Bowl, taking home a similarly styled trophy.</p><p>As for the actual trophy for the champions, Master Chief was driven to midfield in a Warthog to present Arkansas State with the trophy, which took the form of an Rog Xbox Ally strapped onto a football-shaped piece of metal with the Xbox logo on it.</p><p>Both teams also received Xbox systems in the form of the Rog Xbox Ally handheld, and you can see in the video below that players from Missouri State were pretty stoked.</p><p>The popular College Football Campus Tour, which documents obstructed views at stadiums, even reported back from the Xbox Bowl, which was held at The Ford Center in Frisco, Texas. Section 204 Row 16 and Seat 23 had only 36% field visibility, which is pretty rough, as you can tell from the image below.</p><p>Check out some additional images from the Xbox Bowl below, as shared on social media.</p>

            <p>Ever since lead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">Dispatch writer Pierre Shorette went on the record as saying "we definitely cut some sex scenes"</a> and teased that we may "get to see those one day", the game's fanbase has held its breath in bated anticipation. But it's not happening.</p>
<p>I spoke to Shorette and Dispatch game director Nick Herman recently and they told me that while there were once plans for a sex scene involving your chosen love interest in the game, the actual scenes themselves "never tangibly existed". As in, there's nothing to reinstate.</p>
<p>"Let's curb this here, Pierre," said Herman.</p>
<p>Shorette nodded as if in agreement, then said: "The reality is we're definitely going to put those sex scenes in."</p>
<p>"God damnit," said Herman in response.</p>
<p>Shorette laughed; if it wasn't clear, that was a joke.</p>

<p>The duo explained that the problem arose when people found code in Dispatch for an event the team didn't build out. "They could see that we had booleans for 'if someone was going to spend the night' or 'which love interest was going to spend the night'," Herman said. The love interests in the game being Blonde Blazer and Invisigal.</p><p>Shorette continued: "So after the party, that was the point in the story where that would happen." The party occurs in Episode 6, so relatively near the end of the eight-episode season, and it's a wonderful scene - one of my favourites in the game.</p>
<p>It raises the question of why the studio decided against developing the sex scenes any further, and the answer is much simpler than you might think: "Money," Herman and Shorette said almost at exactly the same time.</p>
<p>"It was just money," Herman went on. "That whole scene was like double or triple the length; the whole party was almost an entire episode at Robert's apartment. And scoping: we probably pulled like 80 pages out of this game. It was a lot of writing that had to get cut to be condensed down into something that we could produce.</p>
<blockquote><em>"We probably pulled like 80 pages out of this game"</em></blockquote>
<p>"So just to say it: those scenes were never storyboarded. They didn't go into animation. So people say 'release them': they never tangibly existed."</p>
<p>"Everything that got made, shipped," Shorette added. "We wanted to put it in, we just ran out of money is what it really came down to. So you can blame the video game industry, not us. If people believed in us, we could have made it."</p>

<p>Shorette was referring to the several years of rejection Dispatch faced as AdHoc pitched the game to publishers and tried to get it to release - a twisting, turning saga I've written about in more detail in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success">a Making Of-style Dispatch interview</a>. Now, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-proves-episodic-gaming-is-back-with-a-capital-b-following-latest-player-milestone">the game is a big success, having sold 2m copies and counting</a>.</p><p>A limited budget meant Dispatch also couldn't deliver the breadth of choice some players wanted as far as romance options were concerned. You can't, for example, pursue a romance with any of the characters in the Z-team you lead, which is probably a good thing as far as HR is concerned.</p>
<p>It was while talking about a possible sequel and the expectations players will have for it, and for the characters in it, that Shorette said: "And want to have sex with."</p>
<p>"Good lord," said Herman again in response.</p>
<p>"We should put out a-" Shorette said, before being interrupted by Herman, who added: "-place where everyone can just have sex with everyone."</p>
<p>Shorette continued: "We'll make a Date Everything. But it has to be non-canon because it's so messy - that's the problem. You can't have a Date Everything because we have to take those seriously as relationships, not just treat this as like some fuck party.</p><p>"When you look at the relationships that we had, they're very specific and important to the story in terms of the type of characters they are. Robert is a guy that on the one hand has it together and can be supportive to someone like [Invisigal], but then also needs fucking help, you know? Which is perfect for Blazer.</p>
<p>"Malevola," he added, referencing the tall and muscled red demon woman who wears a tight top and tight denim shorts: "if we threw Malevola in there, everyone would just fuck Malevola. Demon Cindy Crawford. Muscle Mommy. It would be easy mode."</p>
<p>The success and general applause for Dispatch - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-feel-that-games-created-with-only-ai-will-have-soul-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-director-doesnt-think-ai-can-replace-human-creativity-but-the-studio-is-using-it-in-reasonable-ways">former Witcher 3 developer Konrad Tomaszkiewicz said Dispatch was his game of the year</a> - have meant people are now clamouring for a second season of the game. And <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">it sounds very much like a Dispatch Season 2 will happen</a>. However, with success comes expectation and, as Shorette said, "A lot of pressure. It'll be about what it's not as much as what it is."</p>

		<p>Not Knowing Software has released Chapter 1a for Cleared Hot, its take on the classics like Desert Strike and Jungle Strike. The major addition as part of the Chapter 1a release is a brand new helicopter, the RAH-66 Comanche, which is an agile craft but is susceptible to taking damage rather quickly. That is not the only addition, with a new test flight area, and more fixes. Plus Cleared Hot is now confirmed as Steam Deck Verified.</p>

              <p>Need an additional Xbox controller? It’s always a good idea to have an extra in case you want to play with a friend or have one on reserve if you run out of battery. We’ve found one that you can grab right now for a great price, this close to the holidays.</p>
<p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Gaming Controller is built for players who want more control, comfort, and customization from their gaming sessions. It feels great in your hands, with textured grips and a balanced design that helps you stay comfortable even during long play sessions. No matter what kind of games you like to play, you’ll find this model comfortable and easy to get used to.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6519/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A hardcore Xbox controller that’ll soon become your main</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6519/">You can get the Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Gaming Controller right now for just $110, down from its usual price of $150.</a> That is a discount of $40 and 27% off. This is a top of the line controller for the Xbox, so you’re getting a pretty decent price here, considering you’ll usually pay nearly $50 more.</p>
<p>Right out of the box the Elite Series 2 Core feels like an upgrade from a standard controller. The thumbsticks are responsive, the buttons click with just the right amount of feedback, and the overall feel is one of quality. It connects wirelessly to your Xbox or Windows PC, so you can enjoy gaming without cords getting in your way. The Bluetooth support also means you can pair it with other compatible devices for more flexibility.</p>



<p>One of the biggest benefits of this controller is how customizable it is. You can change stick sensitivity, remap buttons, and fine tune settings to match your personal play style. Normally, core Xbox controllers aren’t so easy or versatile when it comes to personalization, so you get a lot more options here to work with. That’s especially useful if you like to change things for shooters or even fighting games to better fit the way you play.</p>
<p>The Elite Series 2 Core also includes additional components you can swap in and out. Different thumbsticks and paddle options let you tweak the feel and response of the controller, so you can tailor it to different genres.</p>
<p>With a solid mix of premium build quality, customization options, and wireless convenience, the Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Gaming Controller stands out among controllers in its class. For this price, you should go ahead and snatch one up before they raise in price again. Everything gaming-related seems to be getting a price hike, after all.</p>

            <p>Larian hope to offer "more insight" into their usage of generative AI via an ask me anything session set to take place in the new year. It'll also be a chance to ask more general questions about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/divinity-larian">Divinity</a>, if you fancy. Naturally, this all comes after the Geoff announcement of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> devs' next RPG was swiftly followed by comments from CEO Swen Vincke which revealed the studio are making limited use of generative AI.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a second response to backlash against his assertions regarding Larian's use of genAI "to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text" - you can get the full context in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-want-to-release-divinity-in-three-to-four-years-and-theyre-making-limited-use-of-generative-ai">our</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-boss-responds-to-criticism-of-generative-ai-use-its-something-we-are-constantly-discussing-internally">other</a> recent pieces - the CEO's announced that the studio'll be hosting an ask me anything chat in the new year. Arguing that "a lot has become lost in translation" following Divinity's announcement, Vincke wrote that this back-and-forth is aimed at offering "the opportunity to ask us any questions you have about Divinity and our dev process directly".</p>
<p>While he put a pin in revealing a concrete date for the chat for now, writing that one'll be forthcoming once the calendar flips over to 2026, the CEO did take this opportunity to offer a bit more of his view on the subject "Larian’s DNA is agency," he wrote. "Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, and players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make.</p> <div>

<p>"In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes."</p>
<p>To be fair to Vincke and co, you can't accuse them of simply burying their heads and going quiet as the backlash has swirled. The CEO's tried to offer <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833">explanations and clarifications</a> in a number of formats, as has Larian's publishing director <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2001014486627705252">Michael Douse</a>. I'm not sure the latter's retweeting of <a href="https://x.com/ALegendaryDrops/status/2001908027214176682">posts</a> from <a href="https://x.com/WolfheartFPS/status/2001034796357837262">YouTubers</a> coming to Larian's defense or attempt to <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2001011867154833538">meme up the situation</a> have really helped, but hey, if you reap the rewards of being an abundantly active tweeterperson, you're usually doomed to fall on that same sword at some point.</p><p>If you want what I assume to be a meme-free discussion about Divinity itself, you can check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-talk-divinity-their-next-rpg-after-baldurs-gate-3-its-almost-as-though-its-the-first-in-the-series">Edwin's chat with Vincke</a> from earlier this week.

              <p>Happy holidays and Merry Christmas. This is the time of the year when radio stations start playing holiday-themed music nonstop and commercials are filled with festive tunes. But not all Christmas music is good. In fact, I’d say at least 80 percent of holiday jingles are old, boring, and terrible.</p> <p>However, I won’t toss all Christmas music under the bus; some holiday tunes have a way of making you feel the warmth and merriment of the season. With that in mind, here are the 15 best tracks to play this year if you want to get into the festive spirit but don’t want to listen to boring old crap. Christmastime is a fun time of year, when people should be feeling good and enjoying time off and the company of loved ones. Or at least getting cool presents. Why ruin that with some slow, sad song from the 1930s?</p>

 <p>So here are some good, fun tracks that range from newer hits to oldies that won’t make you fall asleep. And if you work in retail, I am so sorry that you have to spend, like, five weeks listening to all of these and more over and over again, and you all deserve huge bonuses for that torture.</p> <p>Oh and let us know what your favorite Christmas songs are in the comments below. I’ll be waiting for someone to share <em>Grandma Got Ran Over by a Reindeer.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Father Christmas – The Kinks</h2>  <h2>Santa Claus Is Comin’ To Town – Bruce Springsteen</h2>  <h2>Linus And Lucy – Vince Guaraldi</h2>  <h2>Last Christmas – Wham!</h2>  <h2>Run, Rudolph, Run! – Chuck Berry</h2>  <h2>Feliz Navidad – José Feliciano</h2>  <h2>All I Want For Christmas Is You – Mariah Carey</h2>  <h2>Christmas Wrapping – The Waitresses</h2>  <h2>Christmas (Baby Please Come Home!) – Darlene Love</h2>  <h2>You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch&nbsp;– Thurl Ravenscroft</h2>  <h2>Holly Jolly Christmas – Burl Ives</h2>  <h2>Santa Baby – Eartha Kitt</h2>  <h2>Rockin’ Around The Christmas Tree – Brenda Lee</h2>  <h2>Underneath The Tree – Kelly Clarkson</h2>  <h2>I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus – The Jackson 5</h2>

<p>NVIDIA is offering a free GPU to the best Fortnite players in the world during an upcoming tournament in the game, amid the growing shortage of the gear.</p>



<p>The price of GPU and RAM has skyrocketed in recent months amid growing shortages, driven by the increased use of AI, pricing many out of the components. However, the door has been opened for a limited number of players to claim an NVIDIA GPU in Fortnite.</p>

<p>On December 21 and 22nd, with the precise date depending on your region, Fortnite is hosting the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/competitive/events/s39_nvidia?lang=en-US&amp;region=NAE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NVIDIA GeForce RTX Cup</a>, a solo tournament where players can face off to secure grand prizes, including an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 GPU for the “top competitors.”</p>



<p>While earning the GPU requires being one of the best Fortnite players in your region, the shortage and growing price of components makes playing in the Fortnite tournament potentially an easier option than splashing out on the market.</p>



<p>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 GPU starts at $999.99 on the NVIDIA website, with prices on the secondary market being even higher.</p>



<p>Participation in the tournament also opens the door to earning a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rare-fortnite-cosmetic-finally-returns-after-seven-year-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rare cosmetic that has not been available in Fortnite for seven years</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-fortnite-rust-bucket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rust Bucket Back Bling</a>, which will be distributed to all players who earn at least eight points during the tournament.</p>



<p>There are restrictions to competing, however, as players need to have participated in at least 14 tournaments in the past 180 days to be eligible.</p>
