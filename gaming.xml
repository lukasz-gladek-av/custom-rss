			<p>No ZeniMax Online developer has been laid off following the cancellation of <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/">Project Blackbird</a>, a new statement shared online confirmed.</p>



<p>ZOS United-CWA released a new statement on Bluesky yesterday, commenting on the cancellation of the project, which came as a shock to the 222 ZOSU-CWA developers working on it, and showing appreciation for the media and players that would have loved to see the game. Unlike what happened at other studios, which saw layoffs following the cancellation of their projects, no ZeniMax Online developer has been laid off. Although the future remains uncertain, as Microsoft and the union established in December 2024 are still discussing how the studio will move forward following the project closure, the developers who worked on Project Blackbird still remain at ZeniMax Online with full pay and benefits. Layoffs may still be in the future for some of the members of the union, but as a result of organizing, those impacted will be able to depart the studio with dignity.</p>







<p>As already mentioned, ZeniMax Online Project Blackbird is not the only project that Microsoft confirmed to have cancelled earlier this month. The Perfect Dark reboot announced back in 2020 has <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">ceased development</a>, and its development studio, The Initiative, has been shut down. Rare's Everwild was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">cancelled</a>, while other studios have been considerably downsized, such as Turn 10, the developer of the Forza Motorsport series, which has reportedly become a <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-dev-turn-10-support-forza-horizon/">Forza Horizon support studio.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>8BitDo has released a new version of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364301/8bitdo-pro-2-controller-review-switch-back-buttons">wireless Pro controller</a> that was last updated in 2021. Many of 8BitDo’s recent controller releases, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619229/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-tmr-anti-drift-joysticks">Ultimate 2</a>, feature an asymmetrical joystick layout like Nintendo and Microsoft use. But the <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-pro-3">new Pro 3</a> mirrors the design of the PlayStation DualSense controller, with side-by-side sticks that are now upgraded with drift-resistant <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR technology</a>. The Pro 3 is also 8BitDo’s first controller that lets you easily swap the arrangement of its ABXY buttons.</p><p>The 8BitDo Pro 2 launched at $49.99 four years ago, but the new Pro 3 is debuting with a <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFGQ6J35?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">slightly steeper $69.99 price</a>. 8BitDo has also switched to using a 1,000mAh rechargeable battery for the Pro 3, and while the company says it offers up to 20 hours of gameplay on a full charge, it’s not removable. The Pro 3 includes a convenient charging dock that doubles as storage for its 2.4GHz dongle. When the controller dies, it can still be used while connected to a console via USB, and it will charge while you play.</p><p>The Pro 3 is available for preorder starting today and officially will be on sale on August 12th. There are three color options, each of which matches different retro consoles: gray (PlayStation), G classic (Game Boy), and purple (GameCube).</p><p>The Pro 3’s design is nearly identical to the Pro 2, but it’s gained a few extra buttons. It carries forward the Pro 2’s back buttons while introducing an additional set of smaller shoulder buttons. Its triggers also use Hall effect sensors for improved accuracy and durability, while newly added switches let you choose a longer trigger for racing games or a shorter one for faster reaction times in FPS titles.</p><p>Compatibility includes support for Windows, Android, both Switch consoles (with waking capabilities), SteamOS (you can shake the controller to wake the OLED Steam Deck), and Apple’s hardware, with Bluetooth, USB, or wireless 2.4GHz connectivity.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>The Pro 3 includes a pair of ball-top caps that give it an arcade machine feel.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></span></p></section><p>Out of the box, the Pro 3 uses the Xbox’s button layout, but you can swap the A and B buttons to match Nintendo Switch controllers or rearrange them all to whatever layout you prefer. The Pro 3 works with 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software V2 so that you can remap the layout, and the controller can store and switch between three different custom profiles.</p><p>Although the ergonomics are questionable, 8BitDo is also including a pair of arcade-style ball-top caps that can be attached to the Pro 3’s joysticks.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/706967/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-bluetooth-controller-tmr-swappable-buttons]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, the next Switch 2 exclusive from Nintendo, launches in just two days on Thursday, July 17, and ahead of its release, Nintendo has released a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-1/">three-part interview series</a> with the game's leads. That's how we learned <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/07/15/you-can-skip-locations-and-parts-of-the-story-in-donkey-kong-bananza-thanks-to-the-games">you can skip locations and parts of the story in the game</a>, and why <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/07/15/donkey-kong-bananzas-destruction-gameplay-can-be-traced-back-to-a-goomba-with-arms">Donkey Kong Bananza's destruction gameplay can be traced back to a Goomba with arms</a>. It's also where we learned more about Nintendo's transition from developing Donkey Kong Bananza on Switch to Switch 2.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked by the interviewer if Donkey Kong Bananza was planned as a Switch 2 game from the jump, producer Kenta Motokura explained that it began life as a Switch title, but was moved to Switch 2 around 2021 due to challenges the team (<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/07/01/the-super-mario-odyssey-team-developed-donkey-kong-bananza">which also developed Super Mario Odyssey</a>) ran into. Art director Daisuke Watanabe chimed in to add, "We first looked into how we could upgrade what we'd originally built for Switch to take advantage of Switch 2.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vIDbh6D414"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vIDbh6D414" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"One of the most obvious improvements was that we could place far more objects in the environment than before. Being able to place more objects in the terrain didn't just enhance the game's visual richness. More importantly, it increased the amount of things players could destroy, which amplified the exhilaration of being able to demolish anything and everything. That went hand in hand with the game's core concept of destruction. It convinced us that this game would be even more fun if we developed it for Switch 2."&nbsp;</p><p>One of the game directors Wataru Tanaka followed Watanabe up, explaining that from a programmer's perspective, the voxel technology powering the destructible environments in Donkey Kong Bananza uses a lot of system memory, leading to challenges on Switch. With the game being in 3D, Tanaka said dimensions of textures and materials grow by up to eight times, compared to 2D pixels. "So doubling all three dimensions [width, height, and depth in voxels compared to width and height in pixels] gives you 2 x 2 x 2, or eight times the data," he said. "It may sound simple to just 'double something,' but the reality is that memory usage, voxel density, and all kinds of processes end up gobbling up eight times the resources. It was clear that the memory available on Switch would struggle to handle that load, and we felt that manifesting the huge volume of terrain that we did in this game might have been unachievable on that platform."&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the move to Switch 2, Tanaka said the team gained not only more memory to work with, but great processing capacity, too, giving the team more freedom to incorporate gameplay ideas it previously abandoned because they were too demanding. He also said the Switch 2 could not only handle the heavy processing requirements, but do so at 60 FPS. "Things we'd given up on, like explosions flinging large objects or causing them to collapse, were now possible," Tanaka added. "Designers could also place as many objects as they wanted. There were so many moments when we thought to ourselves, 'Now we can really do this.'"</p><p>Watanabe finished answering this question, explaining, "Not only did Switch 2 enable the game to run well, it unlocked the game's full potential –&nbsp; no, it made the game possible."&nbsp;</p><p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches on Switch 2 this Thursday, July 17.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/07/01/our-impressions-after-two-hours-of-gameplay"><em>Game Informer's </em>hands-on preview impressions</a> after two hours with the game, and then check out this <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/ngt/2025/07/01/we-played-two-hours-of-donkey-kong-bananza-new-gameplay-today">Donkey Kong Bananza New Gameplay Today</a>.

<p>It's currently available for pre-order via the official website and Amazon, with shipping estimated to begin on <strong>12th August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's a look at all features for the Pro 3:</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/john-wick-hex-delisted/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/john-wick-hex-is-being-delisted-this-week-on-all-platforms.1244109/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/interviewing-mike-bithell-ygf/">John Wick Hex</a> is being delisted this week, publisher Big Fan Games has announced. It'll be entirely removed from sale on all digital platforms as of <strong>July 17, 2025</strong>. If you've already bought the game, you'll be able to continue playing it and redownload it, but if not, you'll miss out on your chance to get the game, seemingly forever. </p>



<p>The news was announced quite suddenly this week, giving players only days to decide whether they wanted to grab it before its gone, or let it pass them by for good. John Wick Hex is critically acclaimed as one of the best games based on a film or TV show in some time, including by Wccftech, who called it "<em>an action choreography masterclass</em>" when <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/john-wick-hex-action-choreography-masterclass/">we reviewed it back when it launched in October 2019 on PC</a>. It was out on consoles a year later, in December 2020.</p>



<p>"<em>John Wick Hex will be removed from sale on all platforms beginning July 17th, 2025,</em>" a statement on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1405790/view/596280216846860675?l=english">Steam page</a> began. "<em>After July 17th, 2025, existing owners of John Wick Hex will still be able to access the game via their digital libraries (PC/Consoles) and/or physical copies (Console), however new purchases of John Wick Hex will not be possible, regardless of platform or storefront</em>." No reason for the delisting has been given.</p>



<p>With the game being removed in just two days at the time of this writing, that puts its shelf life at less than six years since its release, a short lifetime even for a game based on a licensed series. If anything, it's a wonder why there haven't been more John Wick games, since the release of John Wick Hex was such a critical success. The films have also only grown in success and popularity in the last six years, and with all the collaboration between the video game industry and Hollywood of late, you'd think someone would have been working on making another John Wick game happen.</p>



<p>"<em>When all is said and done, John Wick Hex is an exceptional licensed game, and a wonderful strategic shooter even away from that,</em>" our review reads. "<em>It's the kind of game that's high quality and enjoyable, even if you are clueless about the John Wick movies themselves. The perfect kind of licensed game, that works as well as an introduction to the franchise as it does as an extension of it. Absolutely worth playing</em>."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-according-to-new-report/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-5-is-%E2%80%9Cfully-greenlit%E2%80%9D-according-to-a-new-report.1244106/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Now that Starfield has come and gone, the next major title Bethesda fans are waiting for is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-quite-playable-state-though-release-window-remains-unknown-rumor/">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>. After that, it'll be time for Fallout 5 to finally take center stage in the theatre of Bethesda's development efforts. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-will-follow-elder-scrolls-vi-starfields-procedural-generation-discussed/">That's been the plan</a>, according to Bethesda and Todd Howard, who, at this point, will likely finish his career with the release of Fallout 5, considering how long modern video games take to make. According to Windows Central reporter Jez Corden, speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DDr2ZSFIEXk?t=3845s">XB2 podcast</a>, the first major step in making Fallout 5 a reality has been taken, as the game is now "<em>fully greenlit."</em></p>



<p>That said, there's not a lot of clarity as to who is leading the project. According to Corden, a significant number of Bethesda's developers are working on more DLC for Starfield. The remaining staff are full-steam-ahead on The Elder Scrolls VI. Fallout 5 might have been officially added to the docket, but when it enters full production, and who will even be leading the way, isn't entirely clear.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Howard and his team are the obvious guess, but who knows what Bethesda and Microsoft will look like by the time Fallout 5 is ready to be the full focus of the studio. For now, despite claims that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-release/">Fallout 5 might be moved up the priority list thanks to the success of the TV show</a>, it seems like it'll be a number of years before Fallout 5 is out and on shelves.</p>

<p>The new edition boasts "refined camera controls, polished mechanics, enhanced textures, and full controller support with a newly designed controller-specific UI." There's obviously a bit of vagueness here, and as far as I can tell Aspyr haven't gone into detail for e.g what "polished mechanics" actually means. Although Aspyr's Jordan Reese did share the following with <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/dungeons-dragons-neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-interview/">Nintendo Everything</a> recently, via <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/50714-neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-dev-details-improvements-to-graphics-and">GoNintendo</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We’ve made several overall gameplay enhancements, many of which are noticeable as soon as you boot the game such as graphical overhauls and UI/UX redesigns, while others like updating the game client to a 64-bit architecture, and networking infrastructure are a little more behind the scenes to support modern hardware."</p></blockquote>
<p>Which, again, isn't a tonne to go on, although Reese also confirmed that you'll be able to switch to the "classic UI and control scheme". The edition also includes all three of the original's expansions, plus <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> and mod support. Although, again no explicit confirmation on whether old mods will work. Sensing a pattern here. Fingers crossed, since it's become a bit of a favourite for modders over the years. You can even play the entire <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> 1 campaign inside of it, in case you want to confirm that Larian didn't Flanderise Minsc - he was genuinely always like that.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/obsidians-hottest-dungeons-dragons-rpg-of-2006-is-out-now-in-ostensibly-enhanced-form]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bless me, An-Ansgaidh, for I have sinned. Not against the Herald of Annihilation. Never against my god. I have always carried out my duties, my service, faithfully. Like any good cultist in An-Ansgaidh’s service, I long to be free from the burden of flesh, the toil of our mortal existence. Being a writer is a life of confessions. Every drop of ink I put to page reveals a bit of myself, whether I want it to or not. But now I have the honor of spilling blood in the service of a great god in this Pikmin-esque cult builder. And I am enjoying myself, but I feel kinda bad about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My demo of Worship puts me in the robe of a cult leader sworn to An-Ansgaidh, Herald of Annihilation, the most compassionate of the Unseen Depth gods, who is determined to end our suffering by bringing an end to our pointless existence. Sick. My job is to gain An-Ansgaidh’s favor and expand Its cult. After playing a brief tutorial that gives me an overview of the controls and introduces me to a sassy and utterly deranged (in its own words, “charming a witty”) talking grimoire that serves as my guide, I’m dropped into a run in An-Ansgaidh’s service.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Worship Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t start with any cultists in my service, which is a bad look for a cult leader. Luckily, An-Ansgaidh starts me with some godless who just needs something to believe in. How do I convert them, you ask? I stab myself with a dagger and smear my blood across the ground to create sacred symbols. This whole thing is a ritual, you know. A circle to draw the godless within it to our cult. I press my hand to the blood-stained ground to activate its power. A square to summon the Execution Edict, a fraction of my god’s power so Its mighty hand might judge our enemies, and find them wanting. I press my hand to the blood-stained ground to activate its power. It awaits my command. I am patient. I am powerful.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Converting them to our unholy cause is simple as surrounding them with a circle.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But it does hurt to stab myself so much. I fret not over my hand (which is probably little more than a bloody pulp) but for my mortality. To drain my lifeblood across the ground for An-Ansgaidh is an honor, but it leaves me diminished, leaves me at the mercy of my enemies. All that to say: it literally drains my health, and I want to be freed from this mortal coil but in An-Ansgaidh’s time, not our enemies’. And we have so many enemies. The godless stand mute, unmoving, uncomprehending. They pose no threat. Converting them to our unholy cause is simple as surrounding them with a circle.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But I fear the others. No conversion will take hold of them. The behatted men with their rapiers that cut down my cultists like so much kindling, the black creatures who do not serve my god and spew bile at us. Once there are enough of us, they pose no threat. I raise my hand, mark what needs to die, and my cult descends upon them like locusts. I wonder if An-Ansgaidh, Herald of Annihilation, is a Pikmin fan. Probably not. Gods are not concerned with such trivial things as the Nintendo GameCube. But it reminds me of it all the same.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That is not to say our followers don’t die. Oh, they are resilient. They fall, dizzied, stars swirling about their heads, but they often rise before they are killed. But inevitably, some die, brought low before they can rise and recover. Early on in our ventures, I learned to avoid our enemies. I searched instead for the godless, converted them to our cult. It is only when I have overwhelming numbers that I challenge our foes, and they fall before An-Ansgaidh’s glory. Sometimes my followers perish. That is inevitable. But I try to keep them alive. A good cult is a strong cult, and a strong cult is made of many bodies.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">They are pliable. I can pick them up by the throat and throw them to ring bells, or gut them and use their blood to perform rituals instead of my own. I have no problem throwing them at things. They’ll be a little concussed, maybe. But they’ll live. Once you use them as a resource, though, it’s lights out. Curtains. Game over. I don’t like killing the cultists. Partially because it leaves me with one less cultist, making my unholy army a little weaker. But partly because it doesn’t feel right. I brought them into this. It’s my job to keep them safe. They’re my children (religiously speaking) and my children (metaphorically speaking). They follow me around like little dogs. Besides, there’s no shortage of blood for me to absorb. I can call it back from a botched ritual where a circle too closely resembles a square, from my cultists who fall in battle, from fountains, plants, and even stones (yes, reader: blood from a stone).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I don’t like killing the cultists. Partially because it leaves me with one less cultist, making my unholy army a little weaker. But partly because it doesn’t feel right. I brought them into this.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When my cult kills our enemies, or some of our own fall in battle, I perform a tribute ritual, inserting an upside-down triangle into the center of a circle I draw around the corpses of the dead. My reward is a chest, which might contain anything from a relic I can offer at an altar to a blood fountain to a catalyst. I can order my cult to carry catalysts back to our base, and plant them in the ground to gain new spells and perks like the ability to throw farther. As the cult grows in power, so do I, though I am still at the mercy of the world and require their aid. I have spells, yes, but they take setup. The violence of a mass of bodies is quicker, more efficient. By myself, I am nothing. Weak. The cult makes me whole. So I go, converting the godless, building favor with An-Ansgaidh. I break down the statues of The Last Church. I send the dead as tribute. I cover the world in my blood. My grimoire offers advice.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I find followers in strange ways. I find a village stuck between worlds, in the middle of a half-completed rite because musicians played a song with instruments built from the bones of horrors, and it remains unfinished. I track them down, carry them back to their stage. The song they play is a bop. Much of Worship's visual and auditory language is incredible. Only evil things are black, colored inside white outlines. Everything else is white, outlined by black. It’s not subtle, but it’s effective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, I gain enough favor to return to An-Ansgaidh victorious. It teleports my cult and I to The Last Church, something my grimoire blames for all of this earlier. I don’t understand until I get there and see a woman in white sitting next to a monster. They aren’t hurting anyone. The woman is singing. The monster sleeps with a little doll. Their names are Ulmira and Eleanor, respectively, and my god has commanded that they die.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I go to work. Of the two, Ealnor is the larger threat, but I cannot hurt her. When my cult gets close, she stuns them, swipes at them, leaves several dead. When we run away, she shoots fire. Her doll, animated by magic, chases us across the screen. I dive out of the way; my cult follows. We move around the edges. “How do I do this?” I think. Then I discover that Ulmira is here, too. She can attack, but she is smaller and weaker. I set my cult on her and then the strangest thing happens. Eleanor comes to defend her, shielding her from harm. And this is how I win. I wait. I bide my time, until Ulmira is vulnerable. And then I set my cult on her, and Eleanor springs into action to save her, taking the damage herself. Dozens die. But in the end, I am victorious. Ulmira holds Eleanor in her arms as she dies. And then she breaks down in tears. This is where my demo ends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is no denying that Worship feels good to play. That its minimalist art style looks beautiful. That the music is gorgeous. That it forces you to play smart, to use every resource. But I like that the last thing it did was make me feel bad. I am a cult leader serving a dark god. I will do nothing good with the power I gain. Winning shouldn’t feel good. And I am glad Worship understands that.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/worship-be-a-cult-leader-in-this-pikmin-inspired-roguelike]]></content:encoded>

        <h2><span><em>Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 +</em></span></h2><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>In the world of Gamindustri, four CPUs (also known as Goddesses) battled for supremacy in the War of the Guardians. One of the CPUs— Neptune—was defeated by the others and banished from the heavens. In her fall from grace, Neptune’s memories were lost, but a mysterious book revealed itself to her with knowledge of all of Gaminudstri’s history. Joined by Compa, IF, and the sentient book known as Histoire, Neptune embarks on an extraordinary journey across four different nations on a quest to save the entire world!</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Goddesses are Back!</strong> – Previously available on PlayStation Vita in North America, now you can immerse yourself in the zany <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,705 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> madness for the first time on PlayStation 4!</li><li><strong>Revisit Classic Neptunia <a title="Genres > RPG [17,416 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> Style Battles</strong> – Battle with up to three characters on the field, with 3 more as support.

Gamindustri faces a dire crisis! Ever since the advent of ASIC—the Arfoire Syndicate of International <a title="Companies > crim [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">Crim</a>e—morality has all but vanished. As much as 80 percent of all students are rumored to worship a being known as Arfoire, and the authorities have chosen to turn a blind eye to the threat. Basically, Gamindustri is pretty messed up, you guys. Ahem. Thus did Gamindustri fall into complete and utter disarray.</p><p>Will the Goddesses be able to reclaim their world from ASIC’s grasp, or will they be forced to wander the Gamindustri Graveyard, forever lost?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Four or More for War!</strong> – Have up to four characters on the battlefield, and four more on the sidelines, ready to jump in and give their support!</li><li><strong>Stella Goes Rogue!</strong> – Send Stella out to brave Gamindustri’s dungeons in this realtime mini-game and she’ll collect all kinds of treasure for you—you just sit back and eat pudding!

Neptune’s been sucked into an alternate dimension of Gamindustri! In order for her to escape from this late ’80s world, Neptune will have to collect enough shares to open up the path to her own dimension. Sounds easy enough—except a nefarious alliance called the Seven Sages wants to rid Gamindustri of all CPUs (also known as Goddesses), including Neptune!</p><p>Forging cross-dimensional friendships, will Neptune be able to defeat the Seven Sages, save this alternate dimension and get back to her own, or will she be stuck in the ’80s forever?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>+1 to Combos!</strong> – Customize attack combinations with up to five moves, opening a whole new array of ways to defeat your enemies!</li><li><strong>Bring a Dungeon Buddy!</strong> – The realtime mini-game Stella’s Dungeon is back, and this time she can bring friends!

Once we get our hands on the Pro 3, we'll update this article with our experience. At the moment, the Pro 2 is our top pick for Switch players who prefer this control layout. Similarly, this is how we felt about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BZ3HX62N,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFH12YYX&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original Ultimate Controller</a> before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-nintendo-switch-2-controller-amazon-prime-day-gaming-deal/1100-6529695/" data-ref-id="1100-6529695">testing the Ultimate 2 series</a>, which offers a markedly improved experience. In short, the Pro 3 should probably be on your radar.</p><hr><p>The 8BitDo Pro 3 costs $20 more than the Pro 2, but the $70 price point aligns with the Ultimate 2 Bluetooth, the manufacturer's flagship controller that supports both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connections. The Pro 2, meanwhile, only supported Bluetooth wireless and didn't come with a charging dock. The new version is the first non-Ultimate controller with a charging dock. A 2.4GHz USB-C dongle is stored in the bottom of the dock. The Pro series has always felt like the alternative flagship option for those who favor PlayStation over Xbox control layouts, and the Pro 3's specs solidify that.</p><p>Like the Ultimate 2, the Pro 3 can be viewed as an alternative to the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-SwitchTM-2-Pro-Controller-Switch/dp/B0F3VTFD6J?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</a></strong>. Nintendo's official controller feels great and even has a pair of back buttons, but there's no denying that 8BitDo's pair of premium gamepads are more versatile thanks to its suite of physical modifications and programmable customization options.</p><p>The TMR sticks on the Ultimate 2 are awesome, so it's exciting to see the tech added to the Pro series. 8BitDo's TMR sticks are noticeably smoother, more accurate, consume less power, and are said to be even more durable than the Hall Effect sticks found on the Pro 2, Ultimate, and other older controllers in the collection. Like Hall Effect, TMR sticks use magnetic sensors to register movements; this naturally reduces wear and prevents stick-drift issues from arising over time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532338-pro3bluetoothgamepad-13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532338" data-ratio="0.667" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532338-pro3bluetoothgamepad-13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532338"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Pro 3 has magnetic ABXY buttons</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532338-pro3bluetoothgamepad-13.jpg"></figure><p>Along with the TMR sticks, the Pro 3 mirrors the Ultimate 2's remappable buttons and trigger adjustments. It has two remappable back buttons and two extra shoulder buttons that are activated by microswitches. If you flip the switches on the back, the Hall Effect triggers become non-linear microswitch triggers. The latter shortens the pull distance, effectively turning the triggers into speedy buttons.</p><p>There are a couple of differences between the Pro 3 and Ultimate 2 Bluetooth. The Ultimate 2 series has rings around the sticks with adjustable RGB lighting effects. The Pro 3 has an upgraded D-pad with improved tactile feedback. Interestingly, the G Classic edition has a series of raised ridges--three in each direction--whereas the purple and gray models have the familiar directional arrows instead.</p><p>The Pro 3 also has a customization option that will be a big deal for some players: swappable face buttons. Inside the box, you'll find a small tool to remove the magnetic ABXY buttons. You can then reverse A/B and X/Y to fit your preference for Nintendo's and Microsoft's button layout. Though the Pro 3 doesn't offer Xbox console support, you can use it for Xbox Cloud Gaming as well as for games you have installed on Steam Deck, Windows, mobile devices, etc. Xbox's control layout, with Y on top and A on the bottom, is generally considered the default for any platform not made by Nintendo or PlayStation.</p><p>With the Ultimate 2 series, you need to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCWSX17,B0DRCV3SPH,B0DRCWJSKZ,B0F9P4P6HB&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">buy the 2.4GHz-only model</a> to get the Xbox layout and the Bluetooth model for Nintendo compatibility. The Ultimate series has always had a separate 2.4GHz model for PC players and a slightly more expensive model that adds Bluetooth and Switch support. There's nothing wrong with that release model, especially for those who aren't interested in Nintendo consoles. But it's cool that 8BitDo created a built-in solution for those who have issues with Nintendo's control layout on other platforms. You could even remap the buttons after switching their locations to use Xbox's layout on Switch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532337-pro3bluetoothgamepad-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532337" data-ratio="0.667" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532337-pro3bluetoothgamepad-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532337"></a><figcaption>The ball-top stick caps match each controller's theme. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532337-pro3bluetoothgamepad-10.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532339-pro3bluetoothgamepad-9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532340-pro3bluetoothgamepad-12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532339,1300-4532340" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4532339-pro3bluetoothgamepad-9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4532340-pro3bluetoothgamepad-12.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532339-pro3bluetoothgamepad-9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532340-pro3bluetoothgamepad-12.jpg"></figure><p>According to 8BitDo, the ball-top stick caps were "made purely for fun," but we're looking forward to checking them out. Regardless of whether they feel practical to use, they look pretty cool on the Pro 3 and are themed around the controller's color. For instance, the retro gray NES/SNES-inspired model comes with a pair of red ball-top caps. If you opt for the GameCube-themed purple edition, you'll get yellow ball-tops.</p><p>With 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2 app, you can adjust stick, trigger, and motion control sensitivities, create dead zones, modify rumble intensity, and remap inputs. Up to three unique control configurations can be saved directly to the controller, and you can cycle through them on the fly by pressing the profile button.</p><hr><h2>8BitDo is having a big year</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532353-8bitdopro3vsultimate2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4532353" data-ratio="0.35" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532353-8bitdopro3vsultimate2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4532353"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Pro 3 | 8BitDo Ultimate 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532353-8bitdopro3vsultimate2.png"></figure><p>The Pro 3 is just the latest major addition to 8BitDo's impressive accessory lineup in 2025.

                <p>Something has gone awry during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s new update, and the the mega-popular online shooter/metaverse is down. Epic has acknowledged the error with <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1945120590756495735" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a post on @FortniteStatus</a> that offers no indication of how long the game will remain offline.</p><p>"Hey everyone, we're extending downtime while we work to resolve an issue discovered during offline checks. We'll do our best to get Fortnite servers online ASAP. Keep an eye on this thread for any future updates."</p><p>There's unlikely to be any further explanation from Epic, but the fact that the company has publicly acknowledged a delay likely means it won't be resolved all that quickly--there's a possibility it will remain offline into the evening. If a fix was coming within an hour or two, Epic would almost certainly have just hunkered down and finished it instead of posting about it. While we have no official explanation for the delay, one datamining group <a href="https://x.com/osirion_gg/status/1945090149949272330" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has suggested</a> it's because the new patch doesn't account for a server-side hotfix that was deployed last week.</p><p>It's not the most opportune moment for this to happen, since this patch is Fortnite's first update in a month, and is intended to introduce Superman's Fortress of Solitude to the Battle Royale island, along with all sorts of other goodies like <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1945074480662892874" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Fantastic Four skins</a> that will likely be sold alongside the new movie later this month. It's another delay for Superman-related content, after the arrival of the new David Corenswet Superman skin on the battle pass was marred by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-superman-cosmetics-are-bugged/1100-6533120/" data-ref-id="1100-6533120">a bug</a> that prevented most folks from being able to unlock it.</p>

According to new data from The Game Developer Collective (a survey program run jointly with our partners at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/advance-your-business/media-and-entertainment/games-tech-intelligence-service">Omdia</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), developers say investors—specifically investors with mismanaged expectations—are the number one party to blame.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This month's Collective surveyed a panel of developers about the economic state of the game industry. When asked what the "main cause" of bad market conditions in the video game business, 64 percent of respondents stated "unreasonable investor expectations" were the number one cause of the downturn.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">60 percent of respondents ranked "mismanagement" as a close second. The next-highest variable was "too-high development costs," according to 43 percent of survey takers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's certainly a spicy statistic—but is it a fair sentiment? Some Studio founders and investors (who may be a bit biased here) disagree.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm not sure that's fair," said Midsummer founder and CEO Jake Solomon. "The venture capital model is built upon significant return on the VC investment."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When a VC funds our studio, they don't have any expectation of sharing in revenue, they don't set milestones, they don't dictate day to day operations, and they even pay the entirety of the agreed upon funding upfront, it's a great deal for developers. But any company funded by VC knows the deal, you are expected to not just make a great game, but a transformational one." VC investors can only make money through an "exit event" like an acquisition or IPO. "Exit events for game studios are rare," he noted.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/santa-ragione-says-apple-is-delisting-wheels-of-aurelia-without-justification-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Santa Ragione says Apple is delisting Wheels of Aurelia 'without justification'</a></p><p>Image via Game Developer Collective.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Griffin Gaming Partner Jason Della Rocca also disagreed, saying it's really "the complete reverse" "It is the market conditions that are driving investor expectations," he wrote in a comment to Game Developer. "Developers need to wake up and adapt to the new reality that they can no longer just be in the game making business. They need to embrace being in the fan building business, and understand that studio value and sustainability comes from identifying a specific audience/player base and feeding them great games."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">AstroBeam founder and CEO Devin Reimer (who also co-founded and was Chief Executive Owl of VR powerhouse Owlchemy Labs) rounded out the dissent, stating that investors have been "propping up some of the game industry given the withdrawal of platform funding and the collapse of game publishers."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"People are often looking for a simple villain to pin things on, while reality is not as simple or exciting to talk about," Reimer said, saying that "the increase in competition, rising development costs, lack of long-term studio funding, and [overestimates] of game growth during Covid" played a greater role.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-they-tried-to-choke-us-from-the-start-secret-6-madrid-workers-slam-owner-testronic-ahead-of-impending-closure" target="_self" data-discover="true">'They tried to choke us from the start:' Secret 6 Madrid workers slam owner Testronic ahead of impending closure</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Reimer was the only one we spoke with who called out what he referred to as a "mismatch" between investors and the way game studios work. "Successful game studios generally need to launch many games before they get a hit. For example, at my previous studio, Owlchemy Labs, it took 4 original IP games before we had our breakout hit."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Game publishers and platform funding works for this model, because they are focused on individual games. So a studio could get funding for many games without giving up equity in the company and each deal was judged on the odds of success of the title being funded. Meanwhile investors buy a stake in the whole company, and traditionally it is focused around a singular product."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Is it easier to find funding in 2025?">Is it easier to find funding in 2025?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While developers have plenty of reason to find fault with investors, there's some hope that funding for new games and studios may be thawing out in 2025.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's not a dramatic thaw, to be clear. The number of developers who reported receiving fundraising in the past 12 months is "virtually unchanged," according to the Collective report, with 30 percent of respondents saying their company received funding.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-star-wars-battlefront-2-player-surge-exposes-a-major-flaw-in-ea-s-business-model" target="_self" data-discover="true">The Star Wars Battlefront II player surge exposes the flaws in EA's business model</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But when asked if it was "harder, easier, or about the same" to get funding this year over the prior year, fewer number of developers reported that it was "harder" than the year before. 50 percent of respondents declared it was more difficult, a 23 percent decrease down from 2024.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's a chance this may just be developers adjusting to the new reality, as the number of developers saying there was "no change" increased from seven percent to 27 percent, a correlating increase. Fewer developers reported that it was "easier" to find funding this year, dropping from 9 percent to 6 percent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Della Rocca said this is part of a trend toward what he called "evidence-based investing." This follows a pattern of investors responding well to developers who can prove "audience validation" early in the process. "The real market failure is that there are very limited sources of funding for prototypes and audience validation," said the veteran investor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Anecdotally, it does seem like 2025 is better than 2024," said Reimer when quizzed about the topic. "But that isn’t saying a lot because 2024 was so bad."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Solomon warned that an improved investing environment may be true at the seed stage, as it still "makes sense" for investors to chip in at that level in exchange for relatively large amounts of equity. But he argued that 2025 is "the worst year" for Series A funding and beyond. "Valuations probably feel too high, exit events are few, and examples of good investment bets in games are not plentiful. It's rough sailing out there, and it's a shame, because many ideas being shopped are extremely low-cost and innovative, which is exactly what our industry needs right now."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One way or another, the game industry does need a way out of this mess that isn't just cashing in on trends and buzzwords. For all the investors out there looking to win over developer sentiment, Reimer might have a solution worth looking into: investing in at least the first two games from a studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Then you could at least see growth potential and your odds of a hit would go up significantly," he explained. "The problem is due to current high development costs, that means a very large investment out of the gate at a time where it is harder to get investment at all."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and Omdia are sibling organizations under Informa</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <p>
Cast your mind back, and you might recall <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a>'s eventual, near-decade-long journey to release. Well, a former exec overseeing the project has now spoken a little more on its troubled development, claiming its scrapped first iteration would have "killed the franchise".
</p>
<p>
Dead Island 2 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-announced">initially announced back in 2014</a>, with the expectation it would launch the following year. However, delays ensued and 2015 brought the news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-is-no-longer-being-made-by-yager">developer Yager had departed the project</a>, with studio boss Timo Ullmann saying its vision for the project "fell out of alignment" with publisher Deep Silver. Development then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-sumo-digital-sonic-racing">shifted to Sumo Digital</a> and finally to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/dambusterstudios">Dambuster Studios</a>, which released Dead Island 2 to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-review-its-still-2011-in-los-angeles">solid critical reception</a> in 2023.
</p>
<p>
Now though, as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/it-would-have-killed-the-franchise-insights-into-the-scrapped-2014-version-of-dead-island-2">reported by GamesIndustry.biz</a>, former Deep Silver head of communications Martin Wein has shed a little more light on Dead Island 2's troubled journey during a panel at Develop:Brighton. Asked for an example of when marketing or player research had helped get a development team back on track after it had veered away from a design vision, Wein specifically cited Dead Island 2, highlighting it as an instance of when he and his team had caused an "eight-year product delay".
</p>
<p>
As recounted by Wein, Deep Silver had a "major milestone with the [then] development studio" shortly after its 2014 E3 reveal. "And boy, that game sucked... It had nothing to do with what [made] the original Dead Island [...] really fun. So we commissioned a play test and got horrific feedback." Wein later told GamesIndustry. biz, "the developer wanted to pursue their vision rather than follow player feedback", and when the game remained the same at the next milestone, the decision was made to find a new studio.
</p>
<p>
"Sometimes you have to make hard decisions," Wein continued during his panel appearance. "Because we could have, at that point, put out a shit game. It might have made some money, but it would have killed the franchise... I think at that point Deep Silver did the right thing, and Dead Island 2 was a commercial success in the end. Because they took that step, and they said that we need to make a game that fits for the player."
</p>
<p>
All of which resolves at least some of the early mystery around Dead Island 2's troubles. As to its quiet time at Sumo Digital, Wein shared nothing on that period of its development - but its strange saga did at least have a happy ending. When Dead Island 2 finally released in 2023, some nine years after its announcement, the gory zombie sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-shifts-1m-copies-in-its-first-weekend-of-release">successfully shifted 1m units in its first weekend of sales</a>, and was loitering somewhere around the 4m mark by February this year. Hopefully a third entry, should it ever happen, will have a smoother road to release.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a> developer King is reportedly replacing laid off staff with AI tools they helped to build.</p>
<p>At the start of the month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">Microsoft announced around 9000 employees would be laid off</a>. This included roughly 200 staff from King.</p>
<p>Now, in a report from <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/">MobileGamer.biz</a>, sources stated they've spent the last few years building and training AI tools, which will now be replacing them.</p>
<p>"Most of level design has been wiped, which is crazy since they've spent months building tools to craft levels quicker," said one source from the company. "Now those AI tools are basically replacing the teams. Similarly the copywriting team is completely removing people since we now have AI tools that those individuals have been creating."</p>
<p>They added replacing people with AI tools was "absolutely disgusting", but the focus is "all about efficiency and profits even though the company is doing great overall".</p>
<p>"If we're introducing more feedback loops then it's crazy to remove the developers themselves, we need more hands and less leadership," they said.</p>
<p>Further, some programmers have been laid off for "arbitrary reasons", said the source, claiming staff may have been removed after expressing "dissatisfaction with the company or processes".</p>
<p>Another source described King's HR department as "an absolute shitshow and has been for years", adding it's an "extreme example of an HR department whose role it is to protect the company, not the staff".</p>
<p>Back at the Game Developer Conference in May 2023, King's chief technology officer Steve Collins described to Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-games-industrys-response-to-ai-reverence-and-rage">the ambition for King to pivot to an "AI-first company"</a>, after it acquired Swedish AI company Peltarion in 2022.</p>
<p>AI is a "tool" that's "in the hands of our level designers and our level testers, so they use that to augment what they're able to do in those spaces," said Collins. When asked if this might mean a shift from human workers to a reliance on AI, Collins replied: "I think we still have a large number of human beings, that's the thing! What we're trying to do is: how do we scale? How do we scale or create thousands of new levels?"</p>
<p>Discussing further, Collins added: "The reality is, this sort of technology can be leveraged. What it does is, it can move people up the stack, it can move people to the point where they're being more creative, they have more agency to bring to the content creation pipeline or whatever."</p>
<p>Now, it appears to have moved people out of the company.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft for comment on this report and the claims staff will be replaced by AI.</p>
<p>ZeniMax Online Studios was also impacted by layoffs at Microsoft. Now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-online-studios-union-speaks-out-on-microsoft-layoffs-states-those-impacted-will-depart-with-dignity">its union has spoken out</a>, stating those impacted will "depart with dignity".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build]]></content:encoded>

Topics discussed in the interview include redesigning Donkey Kong, figuring out the game’s tone and mood, and more. But one part that caught my attention is when Daisuke Watanabe, the game’s art director, and Wataru Tanaka, another director on <em>Bananza</em>, discussed voxel technology and the Switch 2 hardware. </p><p>The entire discussion around voxel tech, which allows the ground and terrain in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-nintendo-direct-diddy-1851784735&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-nintendo-direct-diddy-1851784735"><em>Bananza</em></a></span><em> </em>to deform and break apart dynamically, is surprisingly deep and worth reading. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/#:~:text=Tanaka%3A%20From,the%20game%20possible.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/#:~:text=Tanaka%3A%20From,the%20game%20possible." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The key moment came at the end</a></span>, when Tanaka explained that after experimenting with pushing voxel tech on the OG Switch, they discovered it wasn’t powerful enough to let them go as wild as they wanted. So the game hopped over to Switch 2 and suddenly was running at a smooth 60FPS. </p><p>“With the move to Switch 2, we gained not only more memory but also greater processing capacity,” said Tanaka. “That gave us the freedom to incorporate gameplay ideas we’d previously abandoned because they were too demanding. When we got down to trying it, we discovered that not only could it handle the heavy processing requirements, but it also ran at 60 FPS. Things we’d given up on, like explosions flinging large objects or causing them to collapse, were now possible.” </p><p>Watanabe further added that with <em>Bananza </em>running at 60FPS, smashing up the world became a lot more “satisfying” and was a big improvement over 30FPS. </p><p>“The physics of smashing involve lots of things all happening at once,” explained Watanabe. “Donkey Kong throws a punch, the terrain and objects break apart, and visual effects show debris flying outward. All of that is packed into a single moment. At 30 fps, we couldn’t fully capture everything that happens in that instant. But at 60 fps, we saw that sense of destruction coming through much more clearly.” </p><p>Watanabe added: “Not only did Switch 2 enable the game to run well, it unlocked the game’s full potential – no, it made the game possible.”<br></p><p>As a self-described video game tech snob who values high framerates, I’m very, very happy that the team behind <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>decided to focus so much on nailing 60FPS. Now, I just have to wait until July 17 to play the <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> team’s next big 3D platformer. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-switch-2-60fps-30fps-nintendo-1851786303]]></content:encoded>
