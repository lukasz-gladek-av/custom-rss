            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-best-worst-arcade-games-netflix-store-closing-1851610163">20 years ago on May 12, 2005, the Xbox 360</a> and the future of video games was unveiled on MTV, and it was hosted by Elijah Wood. And while going back to this 20 minute show is a bit embarrassing now, it’s wild how Microsoft and Xbox really did see the future coming before the rest of the industry.</p> <p><em>This article was originally published on May 12, 2025. We’re re-posting it today in honor of the Xbox 360’s 20th anniversary.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>But before we praise <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-celebrates-20th-anniversary-with-a-museum-that-mig-1848113162">Xbox</a> for predicting the online future of games and get really sad at how cosmetic microtransactions were already part of the plan in 2005, let’s make fun of this weird 20 minute infomercial that is the most ‘00s thing ever created. Here’s the full special if you’ve not seen it:</p>

  <p>“Fact: Gaming isn’t just a hobby. It is a lifestyle,” says an unnamed narrator during a short video at the front of the special. It explains video gaming started with <em>Pong</em> and Atari, some other stuff happened, then the original Xbox launched and don’t worry about that thing called the PlayStation.</p>

 <p>After that, the funniest moment in the entire special happens. Remember, up until this point we didn’t know the console was to be called the Xbox 360. It was just the “Next Gen Xbox.” So young Zack, who watched this MTV special back in 2005, was excited to learn more about the next Xbox. Elijah Wood yells, <a href="https://youtu.be/LTs0AoaMYGA?t=166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The future of gaming!” and points off screen</a>. The camera cuts to a…woman carrying a gray bag. Can you imagine the online chuds today watching this? Their heads might explode.</p>

  <p>In reality, the woman is carrying the Xbox 360 in her shoulder bag. She saunters up to a podium and pulls out the console. Sets it up. Hits a button. Green lights turn on. And the console’s name is revealed.</p>

 <p>The rest of special is mostly MTV nonsense, celebrities, and The Killers performing music. The only segment that is actually somewhat interesting happens about 11 minutes into the show: Sway from MTV is invited to talk to the designers behind the Xbox 360 and J Allard (one of the OG Microsoft execs behind the Xbox project.) It’s during this segment that we see a bunch of 360 prototypes and learn about why it looks the way it does. And then Allard walks Sway through the idea of buying digital content on a video game console using the internet.</p>

 <p>Today, this is something every device can do. Back in 2005, this was the future. It was hard for young Zack to believe that one day we’d buy games digitally on a console. 20 years later, it’s clear Microsoft was on to something with Xbox Live, the marketplace, a single username that follows you from game to game, and hanging out online with friends in voice chat. Though, the moment when Allard mentions buying clothes for your digital character, I realized microtransactions were being invented in front of my eyes and got sad.</p> <p>At the end of the event, Wood got on stage and signed off by saying: “I think we can all agree on one thing tonight: Xbox 360 is going to be amazing and I look forward to meeting all of you in the Xbox 360 universe.” I never met Elijah Wood online. But I do agree, the Xbox 360 was amazing and will likely be the one and only time Microsoft was at the top of the console gaming market.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Top 20 Games That Defined the Xbox 360]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-top-20-games-that-defined-the-xbox-360</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-top-20-games-that-defined-the-xbox-360.1361659/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Xbox 360 turns 20 years old today, and so what better time to look back at the games that most defined the console. The 360 was not only the most successful machine Microsoft has ever made, but arguably the most beloved too. And for great reason: the second Xbox mixed powerful hardware with innovative, boundary-pushing, and risk-taking software to power a memorable generation that lasted eight years – longer than any other Xbox so far. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I had a front-row seat to the Xbox 360 era from start to finish during my time at Official Xbox Magazine and then IGN, so here are my picks for the top 20 games that defined the Xbox 360.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">20. 1 vs. 100</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/1vs100-1763561775617.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2009</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of Microsoft’s boldest experiments in the Xbox 360 era was 1 vs. 100, a live game show where most players would be randomly selected to play along in The Crowd, while a lucky 100 would be chosen to be in The Mob and a single person would be chosen as The One. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You had to log on at specific times to play 1 vs. 100; it wasn’t available to you anytime you wanted to fire it up. Microsoft ran it with a live host from a studio in Seattle. But when you joined in for what was literally appointment gaming, you were rewarded with, in some cases, real-life prizes such as Microsoft Points – up to 10,000 for The One if they won, which is the equivalent of $125 – or free Xbox Live Arcade games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a truly unique social gaming experience emblematic of the creative risks and online bets Microsoft was taking and making in the Xbox 360 days, and though I was never selected to be The One, I was in the 100 once and won 80 Microsoft Points (aka $1). I know that might not sound like it was all that worthwhile, but I promise you it was as engaging and memorable as it was short-lived. My proudest Xbox Achievements are having all 12 of the possible 12 from 1 vs. 100, because the game is gone and, sadly, never coming back.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">19. Viva Piñata </h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/vivapinata-1763561822361.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2006</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Long before Microsoft paid $69 billion for Activision-Blizzard, it shocked the world by purchasing a controlling stake in Nintendo second-party powerhouse Rare in 2002 for $375 million – the equivalent of over $600 million today. Viva Piñata wasn’t the first game the studio made for Microsoft – the fine-but-forgettable Grabbed by the Ghoulies came first in 2003 before Rare dropped two solid launch titles for the Xbox 360 in 2005: Kameo and Perfect Dark Zero. But its first bona fide hit for Xbox was 2006’s Viva Piñata, a life sim in which you grew and maintained your garden full of adorable piñata-fied animals. It spawned a sequel, a Nintendo DS handheld version, and a short-lived animated series. In hindsight, it was ahead of its time; it would seem to have great potential to thrive now in a world where Animal Crossing is a massive hit for Nintendo. But even back in the 360 days, it was Rare’s first defining moment for its new platform.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">18. Lost Odyssey</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/lostodyssey-1763561851397.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Xbox has ever successfully gained a real foothold in the Japanese gaming market, but you can’t say that Microsoft never tried. Arguably the company’s biggest push came in the Xbox 360 era, when one of the biggest overtures made to Japanese audiences by the American behemoth came when it partnered with legendary Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi to help fund his new studio, Mistwalker. The two JRPGs Mistwalker created for Microsoft live on in Xbox lore: Blue Dragon, a cartoony adventure with art by another legend, Akira Toriyama, came first, arriving in Japan in 2006 and in the Xbox’s home market in the US in 2007. But it’s the second game – the darker, more serious, Unreal Engine-powered, four-DVD epic called Lost Odyssey, that showed the rest of the industry that the Xbox could go toe-to-toe with Sony and Nintendo in the JRPG department and wasn’t just a Western RPG powerhouse. No one questioned Xbox’s RPG credentials after that.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">17. Dead Rising</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/deadrising-1763561866252.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2006</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">By default, every game released for the Xbox 360 during its first few months that wasn’t also available on the original Xbox – and there weren’t nearly as many cross-gen games back then as there are now – was an Xbox 360 exclusive, since the PlayStation 3 didn’t release until late 2006. Among those exclusives was one of the most memorable zombie games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom’s Dead Rising, which was produced by Mega Man creator Keiji Inafune, was something we truly hadn’t seen before: a triple-A game set inside a gigantic mall with literally hundreds of characters on the screen at any given time. And those characters, of course, were zombies. So, so many zombies. (Side note: one of the Xbox 360’s most famous Achievements – remember, the console invented those too – was the Zombie Genocider Achievement that required you to kill the number of zombies equivalent to the population of Willamette: 53,594). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dead Rising was uniquely told on a timer – you had three in-game days to complete the story and, hopefully, escape the Willamette Mall. This resulted in numerous possible endings and, thus, ample reason to replay the campaign. Just as memorable was that as photojournalist Frank West, you could turn just about anything in the mall into a weapon. But you also earned Prestige Points by taking perfect pictures of the insanity around you – which you’d accumulate to level up and have a better chance of survival. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dead Rising was not only one of the defining games of Xbox 360’s first year, but it showed us that the “HD Era” was truly capable of giving us gaming experiences that we’d never had before.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">16. Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/geometrywars-1763561890752.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2005</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox Live Arcade – the brilliant indie-turned-small-scale-and-indie game publishing program that offered a curated selection of bite-sized games on a weekly basis (who remembers Xbox Live Arcade Wednesdays?) – did as much to define the Xbox 360 as any triple-A game did. The most-downloaded Xbox Live Arcade game ever was Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved, Bizarre Creations’ unlockable Project Gotham Racing 2 minigame that found a second life as a day-one debut download on the then-brand-new XBLA platform. Geometry Wars’s premise was deceptively simple: survive as long as you can while blasting larger and larger waves of encroaching enemies. For a lot of gamers, when they think of Xbox Live Arcade, the first thing they think of is Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">15. Ninja Gaiden 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/ninjagaiden2-1763561912495.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2008</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation may have had God of War, but Xbox had Ninja Gaiden. The first in Ryu Hayabusa’s modern revival helped legitimize the Xbox as a viable platform for Japanese-developed games, and the Xbox 360-exclusive sequel upped the ante for the more powerful new console. It brought more weapons, more bosses, and more resolution, now that Ninja Gaiden was in HD (fun fact, though: the first game natively supported widescreen way back in 2005!). Oh, and it also served up a whole heck of a lot more blood thanks to the new dismemberment system. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Gaiden 2’s action was far more violent thanks to your new ability to slice off the arms, legs, and heads from your foes. It only augmented an absolutely sublime fast-action combat system, even if having all those additional pixels couldn’t quite fix the troublesome camera. Sadly, this would prove to be series mastermind Tomonobu Itagaki’s final contribution to the franchise, but at the time, it asserted the Xbox 360 as the place to go for the best of any genre. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">14. Braid</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/braid-1763561934113.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2008</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Odds are, if I say the words “Summer of Arcade,” it brings up positive memories for you. The annual promotion was a genius bit of Microsoft marketing that sought – successfully, I might add – to fill in the quiet summer months that tended to be devoid of major game releases with 4-5 weeks of curated heavy hitters in the indie and bite-sized game space. The very first one took place in 2008, and boy did it ever set the tone! Galaga Legions, Bionic Commando: Rearmed, Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved 2, Castle Crashers, and a platformer called Braid from a then-unknown developer named Jonathan Blow. Though smaller in scope than a traditional big-budget game, Braid had every bit the looks and the brains of one thanks to its distinct painterly artstyle and challenging time-manipulation-based puzzles. If everyone wasn’t paying attention to Xbox Live Arcade before Braid, they sure as heck were after.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">13. Crackdown</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/crackdown-1763561955481.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is a double-edged sword that the original Crackdown will perhaps forever be thought of first and foremost as The Game That Came With the Halo 3 Beta. But anyone who bought Crackdown just to get a crack at playing Halo 3’s multiplayer for the first time quickly learned that the candy wrapper tasted just as good as the candy bar inside. Crackdown – the brainchild of original Grand Theft Auto creator David Jones – set players loose inside a comic-book-esque world as a would-be superhero with no rigid structure. Instead, you had total freedom to go anywhere and try anything in its Pacific City sandbox. That meant that, yes, you could make a beeline straight for the top kingpin of one of Crackdown’s gangs. You probably wouldn’t be powerful enough to take them down at that point, though – you got literally stronger in Crackdown by defeating enemies and picking up experience orbs of different flavors depending on how you took them down, such as with melee combat, in a vehicle, or with a gun. Eventually, you’d be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, lift cars over your head and throw them, and more. In a time when there weren’t a lot of good sandbox games not named Grand Theft Auto, Crackdown brought something fresh and fun to the table.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">12. Forza Motorsport 3</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/forza-motorsport-3-1763561974755.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2009</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why Forza Motorsport 3 rather than Forza Motorsport 2, which was the first entry on the Xbox 360? Easy: because FM3 is where Forza passed Gran Turismo as the best simulation racing series in the world. Visually, the series always set the bar high, and its second lap on the 360 kept the pedal to the metal in that department. And the car list was never in question. But what Forza Motorsport 3 added was the Rewind mechanic that allowed you to press Y to reverse the action a few seconds if you crashed or took a turn too fast. You could turn it off, of course – Forza Motorsport was always nothing if not customizable – but it added a thick layer of accessibility and approachability to what had always been a pretty buttoned-up, serious racing sim. The Rewind feature only added to what I always called the “soul” of Forza – my vague but I think accurate way of describing the joy and spirit that Forza Motorsport always brought to players, whereas Gran Turismo, for all its simulation racing brilliance, always felt more…clinical. Forza Motorsport 3 was Turn 10’s turning point where the studio passed the competition and never looked back.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">11. Left 4 Dead</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/left4dead-1763562044063.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2008</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve and partner Turtle Rock Studios (who Valve acquired mid-development) practically started the four-player PvE trend in shooters with Left 4 Dead, a brilliant, sometimes scary, and always replayable co-op shooter that had you proceeding through several five-level-long campaigns, surviving waves of zombie attacks thrown at you by the AI “Director” while you clamored for each map’s limited resources, seeking the shelter of the safe room at the end of each chapter. Its mechanics were simple but fun, and thanks to the Director’s always-changing placement of common and special enemies alike, it never quite played the same way twice. Plus, running an entire campaign only took 60-90 minutes to complete, so you and your friends could jump on Xbox Live, have fun together, and feel like you accomplished something by the time you signed off for the evening. It’s almost quaint to think about now in our current age of long-tail live-service games that try to keep you on a hamster wheel, grinding to the next unlockable or piece of content. But Left 4 Dead both respected your time and made great use of it. Many games have since imitated it, but none have ever topped it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Limbo</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/limbo-1763562065234.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2010</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Limbo didn’t come along until over halfway through the Xbox 360 generation, it is nevertheless the standard-bearer for what Xbox Live Arcade was capable of. Developer Playdead’s side-scrolling physics-based platformer told the harrowing story of a boy who…well, no one’s quite sure, really – there are many intriguing theories as to what the real story of Limbo is! But what’s not up for debate is that Limbo is about as close to perfect as a video game can get in terms of mechanics, art, animation, audio design, and polish. (Playdead’s next game, 2016’s Inside for Xbox One, would prove to somehow be even better than Limbo, but that’s a story for another day.) It was the perfect rebuttal to film critic Roger Ebert’s assertion from three months before Limbo released that video games weren’t and could never be art. Limbo defined Xbox Live Arcade, cementing Microsoft’s already established small-games platform as one of the very best things about the Xbox 360.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Rock Band</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you were a gamer in the late 2000’s, odds are you were either an active participant in the plastic-instrument rhythm-game craze that Guitar Hero started, or you knew someone who was. Developer Harmonix Music Systems built Guitar Hero but then sold it to Activision. That’s when the developer advanced the exploding genre forward with Rock Band, a four-player co-op game whose multiplayer experience is truly unlike anything else you’ve ever played. A singer, guitarist, bass player, and drummer worked together to hit the right notes as they came down the note highway, truly and emphatically delivering a convincing replica of the feeling real-life musicians have when they play together. Rock Band was truly remarkable, not just for its core gameplay and multiplayer alchemy, but also for its commitment to music. Harmonix added to the game’s music library with new songs via DLC <em>every single week </em>for <em>eight years</em>, eventually adding full albums like Pearl Jam’s Ten, Nirvana’s Nevermind, Rush’s Moving Pictures, Foo Fighters’ The Colour and the Shape, and more. Rock Band may not have been exclusive to the Xbox 360, but it was nevertheless a defining game for the console, standing out amongst the even heavier hitters coming up higher on this list that arrived at the same time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/oblivion-1763562122332.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2006</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around 30-60 minutes into the first-person RPG The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, when you first emerged from the dungeon and into the open world for the first time, you spun your character around and your jaw dropped. A truly next-gen, high-definition world was all around you, and in it you could go anywhere and, seemingly, do anything. That Oblivion dropped so soon after the Xbox 360 launched – just four months into the new Xbox’s lifecycle, and while PlayStation gamers were still stuck on the PS2 that wasn’t capable of anything that looked remotely like it – only made Bethesda’s first console-on-day-one role-playing game that much more incredible. While the Xbox 360 had a very good launch lineup, nothing at the time (or really in hindsight) made you have to buy the console immediately. Oblivion changed that. You had to get a 360. You had to see <em>this</em>. And the gameplay lived up to the graphics. Oblivion packed dozens of hours of open-world medieval-fantasy role-playing, spanning many memorable quests and locations. It was a generation-defining moment.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. BioShock</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/bioshock-1763562150169.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before BioShock, stories were mostly secondary in first-person shooters. Sure, there was Halo, but that was the (wonderful) exception to the rule. BioShock – the brainchild of Ken Levine, creator of the emergent-gameplay classic System Shock 2 – had the depth of a great book, the plot twist of a memorable movie, and the gameplay to match the very best of any action game on the market. It was set in a failed undersea utopia – the city of Rapture – where visionary Andrew Ryan’s dream turned into a nightmare. As players discovered Rapture, they found it overrun with creepy monsters as well as curious Little Sisters and their drill-armed, divesuit-wearing protectors, the Big Daddies. It’s not hyperbole to say that BioShock elevated video game storytelling, and the fact that it was initially released as an Xbox 360 exclusive only helped further define the second Xbox as a must-have entertainment delivery box for your living room.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Fable 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/fable2-1763562359554.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2008</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it wouldn’t be fair to say that Fable 2 was the Xbox 360’s Zelda, it was a large-scale action-adventure RPG with charm for days and a unique consequence system that would change your character’s physical appearance based on how good – or evil – you chose to be. Fable 2, for the most part, delivered on the remaining promises made by renowned designer Peter Molyneux’s first attempt on the original Xbox. No, you couldn’t plant a seed and watch it grow into a tree, but you could wander the world of Albion with your trusty dog at your side, battling Hobbes, leveling up by actually doing jobs, and building relationships – yes, even romantic ones – with townsfolk. Player choice was at the heart of Fable 2, making it yet another fantastic and unforgettable role-playing game for an Xbox platform that, until the 360 came around (see what I did there?), was known primarily as a first-person shooter box. There had never been and still hasn’t been anything quite like Fable, and the series was at its best with Fable 2, its first Xbox 360 entry. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Grand Theft Auto 4</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/gta4-1763562178945.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2008</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">To say that the buildup to Grand Theft Auto 4’s release was a big f’n deal would be a colossal understatement. The biggest franchise on Earth was going next-gen, with a brand-new game engine and the power of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 to allow for more open-world possibilities than ever before. And while the previous 3D games had all debuted as PlayStation exclusives, GTA 4 would ship day-and-date on Xbox 360. But Microsoft wanted more than that. So they paid through the nose for timed exclusivity on both of GTA 4’s brilliant expansion packs: The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony. Then-Xbox boss Peter Moore even announced this monumental get by repeating his Halo 2 release date trick, rolling up his sleeve to reveal a “tattoo” of the Grand Theft Auto 4 logo. Suddenly, the Xbox 360 was the best place to play the first next-gen GTA game, and both expansions were so good that I can’t imagine anyone – be it Microsoft writing the check or players picking up the 360 version of the game – regretted their choice.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/cod4-1763562216579.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shout-out to Call of Duty 2, which was a day-one launch title for the Xbox 360 and truly started Call of Duty’s ascent to becoming the biggest non-Grand Theft Auto video game franchise in the world, but Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was the one that really sent the series into the stratosphere. It almost seems silly to say now, but before Modern Warfare, Call of Duty had only ever been a first-person shooter set in World War II. Infinity Ward not only jumped the timeline forward, but everything else, too. The stellar single-player campaign was full of shocking moments, while the multiplayer built on top of the fast time-to-kill the franchise was already known for and paired with some truly memorable maps to make it a must-play. That this hit just after the juggernaut known as Halo 3 – combined with the effortlessness of connecting with your friends on Xbox Live – cemented the Xbox 360 as the place to play multiplayer shooters.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Mass Effect</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/masseffect-1763562446751.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mass Effect promised players a true space opera – a trilogy of games where your choices would affect your relationships with other characters and lead to your own unique outcomes and endings. Your character would import into the subsequent games in the promised trilogy, and in the end it would be unlike any role-playing game you’d ever laid your hands on. And the first Mass Effect – an absolutely visually stunning Unreal Engine-powered epic from the RPG kings at BioWare – delivered on its end of the bargain. The Mass Effect universe felt lived-in, with myriad alien species all interacting with each other at the Citadel, a galactic hub at the virtual center of the universe. You played as a male or female Commander Shepard, a human who becomes the first of their species to be welcomed into the ranks of the Spectres, a group of space sheriffs given incredible power and leeway to protect the galaxy. No one had ever seen anything like Mass Effect before, and the fact that it came from the same development team that gave us the original-Xbox-exclusive Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, meant that Xbox truly had some of the world’s most talented RPG developers on its side.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Gears of War</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/gears-1763562246425.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2006</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You know a game is a big deal when its developers can ask Microsoft to double the amount of RAM in the Xbox 360 before the console makes it to market – and Microsoft says yes. Gears of War was perhaps the best-looking action game anyone had ever seen when it was released just 11 months into the Xbox 360’s lifespan, but it had incredibly weighty third-person cover-based gameplay to match its stunning looks. Gears of War dropped us onto the planet Sera, into the middle of a war between humans and the Locust, an underground-dwelling alien race hellbent on obliterating humanity. Gears of War is a war story, and while its Active Reload system, delightfully vicious chainsaw finishing moves with the Lancer rifle, and engrossing team-based multiplayer were all top-shelf, it’s arguably its empathetic characters that secured its place in gamers’ hearts. Marcus, Dom, Baird, and Cole – Delta Squad – really felt like brothers, and we became emotionally invested in their wartime journey. It’s no wonder Microsoft later bought the franchise for $2 billion.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Halo 3</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/halo3-1763562264089.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Released: 2007</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Xbox 360 may not have had a new Halo game on day one, but as the rest of this list has shown, it didn’t need it. Still, when the day finally came in September of 2007 for the hugely anticipated Halo 3 to drop – nearly two years into the new Xbox’s life – it couldn’t have been a bigger deal. The original Xbox’s Halo 2 had infamously ended on a cliffhanger, and Halo 3 was built to resolve it – throwing plenty more hardware horsepower at Master Chief in the process. Story-wise it stuck the landing this time, giving players a satisfying conclusion that closed the book on Bungie’s trilogy, but not before Chief told us, “Wake me, when you need me.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, multiplayer picked up where Halo 2 left off, augmenting the best online multiplayer infrastructure with Forge, a new level-editing tool that let players build their own maps. In hindsight, this is where Halo peaked in terms of success, popularity, cultural relevance and impact, as Call of Duty took its place at the top of the first-person shooter ladder after the release of the aforementioned Call of Duty 4. But we finished the fight, and the Xbox 360 eliminated any remaining doubt as to its dominance in the games industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those are our picks for the 20 games that defined the Xbox 360.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Competition in premium headphones has never been as fierce as it is currently with Apple, Sonos, Bose, Sony, and Beats in a heated contest over the over-ear market. Each brand brings legitimate quality to the table which makes choosing sound alone an increasingly difficult decision. The tiebreaker becomes price when comparable products are competing at similar performance, and Beats just made that decision incredibly easy. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5824/">just crushed the Beats Studio Pro to $149 for Black Friday, down from $349, delivering a 57% discount no competitor can match</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5824/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>40-Hour Battery Life Outlasts Every Competitor</h2>
<p>The <strong>battery endurance is up to 40 hours of playback with active noise cancellation on</strong>, beating what Sony, Bose, and Apple offer at any price. You charge these headphones once and use them for an entire week of commuting, working, and exercising without seeing low battery warnings. The extended runtime transforms how you think about wireless headphones since charging becomes a weekly ritual rather than a daily annoyance. Fast Fuel charging adds 4 hours of playback from just 10 minutes of charging when you forget to plug in overnight.</p>
<p><strong>Lossless audio via USB-C</strong> (paired with compatible sources over cable) provides audio quality that even an audiophile can appreciate. Wired mode switches off Bluetooth compression entirely, ensuring studio-quality playback that simply can’t be replicated by wireless transmission. Three built-in sound profiles allow the listener to tailor the listening experience to the content or personal preference.</p>



<p>This custom acoustic platform creates rich and immersive sound that is on par with many headphones costing considerably more. The bass response remains controlled without bleeding into midrange frequencies, and the vocals sit clearly atop the mix. High frequencies extend smoothly without any harshness to cause fatigue in long listening sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Fully adaptive active noise cancellation continuously adjusts based on your environment</strong> and fit on your head. The system monitors external noise and internal seal and optimizes cancellation in real time as conditions change. Transparency mode lets outside sound through naturally when you need awareness of your surroundings. Switching between modes happens instantly through on-ear controls without interrupting playback.</p>
<p>Personalized spatial audio with <strong>dynamic head tracking provides a fully immersive 360-degree listening experience</strong>. The system interacts with your head movements and adjusts audio placement to maintain the exact positioning of the sound elements, even as you move your head to either side. This technology works with compatible content to accurately place instruments and vocals in three-dimensional space around you.</p>



<p>Improved compatibility<strong> works seamlessly across both Apple and Android ecosystems</strong>. One-touch pairing connects straight away to iPhones via the Apple chip inside, while similar quick-pairing functionality is in place for Android devices. Native features work across the board, unlike some competitors, where specific operating systems receive the best features.</p>
<p>On-ear controls manage music playback, phone calls, and voice assistant activation without reaching for your phone. The physical buttons offer a type of tactile feedback that touch controls can’t compete with, enabling adjustments to be done without looking or removing the headphones. Siri, Google Assistant, or other voice assistants are activated with the press of a button for hands-free queries.</p>
<p>For $149, you get premium noise-cancelling headphones with 40-hour battery life and lossless audio for 57% off of its MSRP, which puts it below budget competition offering far less value. Sony’s WH-1000XM5 and Bose QuietComfort Ultra are $300-$400 options that don’t offer near the same level of battery life.</p>

              <p><strong>Amazon saves its best Black Friday deals for Prime members</strong>, and this portable monitor shows why the membership pays for itself, quite literally. Non-subscribers see regular pricing, while Prime members unlock exclusive discounts that slash products down to absurd lows. The <em>KYY</em> 15.6-inch portable monitor handles both <strong>gaming and productivity with a Full HD IPS display</strong> that travels anywhere your laptop goes. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/">dropped this to $66 for Black Friday, down from $99, but only Prime members access this record low pricing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Desktop-Quality Visuals Anywhere</h2>
<p>The <strong>Full HD display gives 1920×1080 resolution for sharp text and clear images throughout the 15.6-inch display</strong> panel. The IPS technology assures accurate colors and consistent brightness from any viewing angle of up to 178 degrees. You see the same image quality whether you look straight on or from the side, which counts if you do group work or adjustable setups. HDR technology enhances contrast between bright and dark areas, making games and movies look more dynamic. The display reduces blue light radiation and eliminates flickering to protect your eyes against fatigue during extended viewing.</p>



<p><strong>USB-C connectivity enables single-cable connections</strong> that handle video signal and power delivery in tandem on compatible devices. You plug in one cable to laptops supporting Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C 3.1, and the monitor works immediately without external power. The two USB-C ports make way for different device connections and cable routing preferences. Mini-HDMI input accommodates devices lacking USB-C video output, ensuring compatibility with older laptops, gaming consoles, and desktop computers.</p>
<p>The<strong> ultra-slim profile of 0.3 inches and a weight of 1.7 pounds</strong>&nbsp;make this portable, rather than just technically portable. You slip this into a laptop bag beside your computer without adding any noticeable bulk or weight. The slim build fits in the same compartments as tablets or thin ultrabooks do. This kind of portability changes the way you think about workspace setup, as bringing a second monitor along becomes simple.</p>



<p>The <strong>included smart cover protects the screen</strong> during transport and converts into an adjustable stand for desktop use. Being budget-friendly, the exterior uses PU leather that resists scratches and feels premium. Two grooves in the bottom of the cover provide different viewing angles for comfort with multiple setups. The magnetic frameless design of this keeps the cover attached securely without adding bulk or interfering with the display.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility with gaming consoles</strong> extends the monitor’s usability beyond laptop productivity. You hook up a Playstation 4, Xbox, or Switch directly to this for portable big-screen gaming anywhere. Hotel rooms, guest bedrooms, or any space with a power outlet becomes a gaming station. The native 1080p resolution of the console output is matched and color accuracy from the IPS panel is better than many hotel TVs.</p>
<p><strong>Connectivity to your smartphone transforms the monitor into a desktop experience</strong> for your mobile device. You will connect compatible phones via USB-C and expand your mobile workspace into a proper screen size. This feature works great for presentations, video watching, or using mobile apps on larger displays. You need no apps or drivers for this setup; it works immediately via plug-and-play functionality.</p>
<p>Built-in dual speakers provide audio without requiring external speakers or headphones. The sound quality handles video calls, casual entertainment, and basic gaming adequately. <strong>A 3.5mm audio jack</strong> houses headphones or external speakers when you need better audio quality. The speakers add in convenience for quick setups where carrying additional audio equipment isn’t practical.</p>
<p>At $66 for Prime members, you’re getting a full-featured portable monitor with an IPS panel, smart cover, and multi-device compatibility for 34% off. Competing portable monitors with similar specs sell for $100-150 without the included accessories.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> has had a disappointing launch in Europe, with sales reportedly down 63 percent compared to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s bumper debut week.</p>
<p>We already knew something was up when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-the-wake-of-battlefield-6-and-arc-radiers-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-suffered-a-much-smaller-launch-than-previous-cod-games">Activision's own response felt a little more muted than previous years</a>, but according to estimates from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european">The Game Business</a> and data from <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login">GSD</a>, sales are also down by "more than" 50 percent when compared to its predecessor, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, Black Ops 7 is available for no extra charge on Xbox and PC Game Pass for those subscribing to the pricier Ultimate tier, which will undoubtedly skew sales figures. Nonetheless, with an 'Overwhelming Dislike' verdict on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">Metacritic</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-the-lowest-metacritic-user-score-ever-for-a-call-of-duty-game">making it the most unpopular Call of Duty game ever by Metacritic user score</a> - the data will be grim reading for Microsoft and Activision.</p>
<p>All that said, according to GSD's data, that hasn't stopped Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 from being Europe's biggest-selling game this week, both by unit sales and revenue.</p>
<p>"If you can accept Black Ops 7's fundamental changes to the formula on their own terms, you'll have a good trip, despite the psychochemicals coursing through your veins," we said in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 review</a>, awarding it 3/5 stars. "I'm just not convinced those changes bode well for the health of the series."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-patch-curbs-one-of-the-biggest-zombies-grinds-fixes-crashes-across-all-modes">The latest Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 patch</a> has brought a handful of fixes for the sci-fi FPS, including substantial adjustments to various camo challenges that have been proving troublesome for the cosmetically-minded player base. This includes a few weapon camos in Zombies, which were three times harder to unlock than intended.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It took me a long time to become even halfway decent at <em>Forestrike</em>. The martial arts action game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252953/olija-game-review-nintendo-switch-steam-pc-ps4-xbox">from <em>Olija</em> developer Skeleton Crew</a>, has a unique twist in that it lets you see what will happen in most battles and then practice your strategy accordingly. It turns the act of combat into a type of puzzle game, but one that still requires fast reflexes and precision decision-making to be successful. And it has successfully turned me into a solid fighter — at least in the realm of a pixelated video game.</p><p>You play as a martial arts student named Yu, who, despite being relatively green, is tasked with ridding his homeland of an evil empire. To do this, you mostly travel across the landscape beating up bad guys. <em>Forestrike </em>has a roguelite structure, meaning that each time you play the levels and scenarios change slightly, and also that you’re going to lose a lot. But that losing is also inherent to the premise: This is a game about constantly learning. Along the way you’re accompanied by various martial arts masters who will teach you new techniques to aid in your quest.</p><p>Central to all of this is an ability known as foresight. In essence, this lets you preview a battle before you go in for the real thing. It’s like a practice run; you can see how things will play out and practice your strategy in advance. Battles in <em>Forestrike</em> are fast, usually lasting just a few seconds, but like a great martial arts movie, they involve a carefully orchestrated series of movements. Foresight lets you figure out exactly how you want to proceed before you’re actually in danger.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that <em>Forestrike</em> is easy. Early on, I got my ass kicked regularly. Even when you know exactly when you should dodge, or pick up a weapon, or use a slow but powerful kick, it’s still a challenge to nail it when it counts, no matter how much you train. The game also constantly throws different challenges at you; sometimes you can only use foresight a limited number of times in a battle, other times not at all.</p><p>Foresight is not a crutch to make the game less challenging, but more of a tool to sharpen your skills. It’s like tossing some warm-up shots before an actual basketball game. Those challenges help keep the game fresh even as many of the battles can be pretty similar. The same goes for its structure, which lets you regularly unlock new skills for each run and eventually meet new martial arts masters who will each teach you new techniques, giving you even more options.</p><p>Eventually, things started to click. And when you do eventually pull off a flawless run through a big group of enemies it feels <em>incredible</em>, like you’re really in a classic action movie, pulling the strings. But those few seconds of perfection involve a whole lot of practice.</p><p><sub>Forestrike <em>is available now on Steam, and is “coming soon” to the Nintendo Switch.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/826331/forestrike-review-nintendo-switch-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-goes-hard-on-watch-ultra-2-now-selling-at-new-all-time-low-for-black-friday-day-2-2000646455</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-goes-hard-on-watch-ultra-2-now-selling-at-new-all-time-low-for-black-friday-day-2.1361626/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For a long, long time, the premium adventure watch market was dominated by Garmin and Suunto, but then Apple came to the party with the <em>Ultra</em> series and hasn’t looked back since. The <strong>Apple Watch Ultra 2 competes directly with flagship models from both brands</strong>&nbsp;and adds in smartphone integration that those dedicated sports watches just can’t match.</p>
<p>Apple keeps strict pricing on their own website and in Apple Stores, so it’s a complete waste of your time checking there for deals. But Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5821/"> just dropped the Ultra 2 to $599 for Black Friday, down from $799, which marks a record low and saves you $200 on Apple’s most rugged wearable</a>. This 25% discount is the deepest cut this watch has ever seen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5821/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Titanium Construction Survives Everything You Throw at It</h2>
<p>A <strong>49mm case made of titanium</strong> resists corrosion and impacts that would destroy aluminum watches within months of serious outdoor use. The sapphire front crystal laughs at scratches regular glass couldn’t survive, maintaining clarity through years of adventure abuse. Verification through military standard MIL-STD 810H testing shows the watch handles extreme temperatures, shocks, and conditions that exceed those most users ever encounter. <strong>Water resistance reaches a depth of 100 meters</strong>, enabling serious diving alongside swimming and water sports.</p>
<p>The 49mm size provides space for a bigger battery and a more luminous display than standard Apple Watch models have. The <strong>Always-On Retina display peaks at 3000 nits of brightness</strong>, and remains readable under direct sunlight where other screens totally wash out. The larger Digital Crown and customisable Action button work with gloves on, as well as in cold weather where touch-only controls fail.</p>



<p>Precision<strong> dual-frequency GPS</strong> delivers accuracy that serious athletes and navigators require. By utilizing both L1 and L5 satellite frequencies, the system reduces errors from signal reflection off buildings and terrain. The recorded routes of your runs better match the actual paths you run, rather than placing you directly through buildings or zigzagging all over.</p>
<p>The running features compete directly with dedicated running watches from Garmin and Coros. Advanced metrics track running form, including ground contact time, vertical oscillation, and stride length. Automatic track detection senses when you’re running on a standard track and makes adjustments accordingly. Support for custom workouts accommodates structured training, like warmups, intervals, recovery periods, and cooldowns. Training load analysis shows how your workouts are affecting your body over time to help you avoid overtraining.</p>



<p><strong>Cellular connectivity lets you leave your iPhone behind</strong> while maintaining communication capabilities. You call, text, stream music, get directions, and access apps without your phone nearby. That sense of freedom completely changes outdoor activities where carrying a phone would add bulk or create risk. Emergency SOS works anywhere with cellular coverage, providing safety during solo adventures.</p>
<p>That means <strong>battery life reaches 36 hours of normal use with the Always-On display active</strong>, extending to 72 hours of runtime in Low Power Mode for multi-day adventures. This is considerably beyond the typical Apple Watch models and closer to what dedicated adventure watches can manage. The extended battery life makes the Ultra 2 a practical choice for ultra-long hikes, ultra-marathons and multi-day trips in general.</p>
<p>Health monitoring includes tracking heart rate, the measurement of blood oxygen, ECG capability, and sleep analysis. Fall detection and crash detection provide automatic emergency alerts in case of accidents. Temperature sensing tracks overnight variations useful for cycle tracking and illness detection. All of these features run continuously without affecting battery life much.</p>
<p>At $599, you’re getting Apple’s flagship adventure watch with titanium construction and precision GPS for 25% off its standard price. Comparable Garmin watches cost between $800-1000 without the smartphone integration that Apple provides.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-swallows-its-pride-macbook-air-falls-to-all-time-low-and-goes-2x-cheaper-than-pro-2000646450</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-swallows-its-pride-macbook-air-falls-to-all-time-low-and-goes-2x-cheaper-than-pro.1361614/</guid>

              <p>MacBook Pro models start at $1,599 which puts Apple’s professional laptops out of reach for many buyers who want quality computing without spending a fortune. The MacBook Air with M4 chip delivers similar performance for everyday tasks at literally half the cost of its Pro sibling.</p>
<p>Apple never discounts products on their own website or in Apple Stores, and keeps strict pricing that forces deal hunters toward third-party retailers. Amazon dropped this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">2025 MacBook Air (256GB model) to $749 for Black Friday, down from $999</a>, and marks a record low that <strong>already moved over 10,000 units this month</strong>. This 25% discount represents the kind of Apple savings you simply won’t find anywhere else.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Pro-Level Performance in Air Package</h2>
<p>Housing the most recent Apple silicon architecture,<strong> the M4 processor in the MacBook Air unleashes performance</strong> that increasingly blurs the line separating Air and Pro notebooks. The chip handles demanding tasks like video editing, photo manipulation, and software development without the thermal throttling that plagued Intel MacBooks. The<strong> unified memory architecture means the CPU and GPU can share the same 16GB pool efficiently</strong>, and sidestep the bottlenecks traditional systems experience. This level of performance handles professional workflows smoothly, which the previous generations of Air just couldn’t manage well.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Intelligence integration</strong> comes built into this M4 MacBook, bringing AI capabilities directly into the operating system. The system helps with writing tasks, image generation, and intelligent assistance without requiring cloud processing for many features. The M4’s Neural Engine processes AI workloads locally and keeps your data private while delivering fast results.</p>



<p>It features a<strong> 13.6-inch Liquid Retina Display with vibrant colors and sharp text</strong> for extended work sessions comfortable. This display features P3 wide color gamut for accurate color reproduction that photographers and designers require. This <strong>system comes with 500 nits of brightness</strong> for clear visibility in bright environments without struggling to see content. Bezels remain thin from all sides to retain maximum screen space within the compact chassis.</p>



<p>It’s a 12MP <em>Center Stage</em> camera that provides clear video calls with a<strong>utomatic framing that keeps you centered as you move</strong>. The camera tracks your position and adjusts the frame with optimal composition during video conferencing. That will work across FaceTime, Zoom, and other video applications without manually having to change anything.</p>
<p>Fanless design means <strong>this MacBook runs in complete silence, no matter the workload</strong>. The M4 chip creates such minimal heat that passive cooling takes over the thermal management without mechanical movement. You work in quiet environments such as libraries or late-night sessions without disturbing anyone with the fan noise. This silence is a real advantage compared to Pro models that immediately fire up their fans when doing resource-intensive work.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery life reaches 18 hours of video playback or about 12 hours of typical mixed use</strong>. You can go through a whole day without searching for outlets or managing power settings. This is due to the M4 chip architecture, which brings performance with power-sipping efficiency.</p>
<p>We have Apple’s latest MacBook with an M4 chip and 16GB RAM for $749, which is a straight 25% discount off the original price and makes it half as expensive as entry-level models of the MacBook Pro. For Black Friday, this sale makes current-generation Apple Silicon accessible without compromise or having to settle for older models.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-goes-nuclear-on-9100-pro-ssd-pricing-all-sizes-are-selling-for-a-new-all-time-low-2000646445</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-goes-nuclear-on-9100-pro-ssd-pricing-all-sizes-are-selling-for-a-new-all-time-low.1361611/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Storage speed dictates how fast your entire computer feels, from boot times to application launches to game loading. The<strong> Samsung 9100 PRO</strong> is the cutting edge of SSD technology and harnesses <strong>PCIe 5.0</strong> to deliver double the read speeds of previous generation drives.</p>
<p>This kind of performance transforms workflows for gamers, content creators and even professionals running AI workloads that require instant data access. Amazon slashes prices on all three capacities: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/">the 1TB dropped from $199 to $134</a>, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/">2TB dropped from $279 to $219</a>, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/">the 4TB dropped from $469 to $369</a>. That means <strong>every capacity hits record low pricing</strong> that makes next-generation storage genuinely accessible.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5819/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>14,700 MB/s Read Speed Removes Every Bottleneck</h2>
<p>The resulting sequential <strong>read speed of 14,700 MB/s nearly doubles what the PCIe 4.0 drives</strong> offer and revolutionizes how fast data navigates your system. Windows boots in seconds, applications launch in real-time and large file transfers take place faster than it can process what’s going on. Games with DirectStorage support can load levels in moments rather than the loading screens that define current gaming experiences. What’s more, it actually <strong>far exceeds what most users can currently saturate</strong>&nbsp;which truly means the drive will stay relevant as software catches up to the hardware capability.</p>
<p>The <strong>sequential write speeds match the impressive read performance</strong>, handling large file creation and modifications without slowdowns like cheaper drives experience. To video editors working with 8K footage, timeline scrubbing remains responsive, while exports complete in a fraction of the time. For content creators moving huge project files around between drives, transfers finish almost instantly.</p>



<p>The PCIe 5.0 x4 interface leverages four lanes of the latest PCIe standard to achieve these speeds on a compatible motherboard. Intel 13th and 14th generation platforms, along with AMD Ryzen 7000 series, support PCIe 5.0 natively. The M.2 2280 form factor fits standard slots without adapters or special mounting requirements. Older PCIe 4.0 systems run this drive at reduced speeds, still delivering excellent performance while leaving upgrade headroom when you eventually update your platform.</p>



<p><strong>Samsung’s thermal solution is also great and</strong> manages the heat generated by high-speed operation. Included in both the controller and NAND packages are heat spreaders for dissipating thermal energy during sustained transfers. Additional thermal management is provided by systems with dedicated M.2 heatsinks or motherboard cooling solutions.</p>
<p>With this drive,<strong> AI computing workloads benefit considerably from its speed characteristics</strong>. Machine learning models load their training data much faster, and a lesser time is spent waiting for storage. Local AI inference runs more responsively when the models stream from the high-speed storage. In fact, the specifications target AI computing aside from gaming and professional workstations.</p>
<p>At these Black Friday prices, Samsung’s flagship PCIe 5.0 SSD becomes within reach at all capacities. The $134 1TB offers 33% savings, bringing next-gen speed to budget builds. The best value for enthusiasts looking for significant capacity with maximum performance is the $219 2TB. The $369 4TB offers premium storage to pros and power users needing both speed and space.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/i-wish-these-tales-games-would-have-been-remastered-before-tales-of-berseria/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>With the Tales series Remaster Project, Bandai Namco is bringing back older entries in the series to modern consoles and PC, allowing more users to enjoy some solid JRPGs such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-vesperia-definitive-edition/">Tales of Vesperia</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-review-the-power-of-friendship-enhanced-and-improved/">Tales of Graces f</a>, whose action-oriented combat systems continue to be among the best in the genre.</p>



<p>Series producer Yusuke Tomizawa recently confirmed that<a href="https://wccftech.com/bandai-namcos-tales-series-has-a-lot-brewing-but-the-most-interesting-will-take-a-while-to-show/"> more remasters are planned</a>, shortly before the release of Tales of Xillia Remastered last month. He promised the next announcement would follow the October 2025 release. That promised announcement, Tales of Berseria Remastered for PC, PS5, Xbox Series, and Switch, has now arrived, to the disappointment of many fans, myself included.</p>



<p>As you may have noticed if you visit Wccftech daily, I didn't cover the announcement earlier this week, despite being a massive fan of the series. I was so disappointed by it that I didn't want my negative feelings to show in my report, because <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-berseria-review-tale/">Tales of Berseria is objectively one of the best entries in the series</a> and one that I thoroughly enjoyed, having played it for over 200 hours across the Japanese PlayStation 4 release and the global Steam release.</p>



<p>The game definitely deserves these new quality of life updates, including early access to the Grade Shop, destination icons, and the ability to toggle encounters. However, since the original released just in 2016 and is easily playable on other modern systems, a simple Nintendo Switch port would have served the same purpose.</p>

<p>Still, there are a few other Tales games that I wish Bandai Namco would have remastered before Tales of Berseria, to help the franchise stay relevant during its prolonged hiatus since the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-arise-keeping-the-flame-alive/">Tales of Arise</a> in 2022.</p>



<h2 id="h-tales-of-hearts-r">Tales of Hearts R</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Tales of Hearts R doesn't deserve to remain stuck on PlayStation Vita</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although Tales of Hearts R was launched in 2014, only two years before Tales of Berseria, the game has a major issue that its successor does not: availability. Having been released exclusively on the PlayStation Vita, one of Sony's less successful gaming systems, very few players had the opportunity to experience Kor Meteor and his friends' journey across the world of Organica. With the very real possibility that the Vita digital store may eventually go offline, the game's access could become even more limited.</p>



<p>It would be a massive shame if Tales of Hearts R never gets remastered. Not only are the story and characters quite enjoyable, tied together by a mineral-based theme that suits the world rather well, but the combat system is, to date, one of the best 3D renditions of the series' Linear Motion Battle System, granting players the chance of performing some cool, intricate combos without being overly broken with the Chase Link system. Even better, Tales of Hearts R solved the recurring issue of unbalanced boss fights by introducing a combo-breaking mechanic for all enemies, which can be countered by the players with a timed button press, allowing expert players to keep up the pressure. All this, combined with the unique fighting styles of all playable characters, makes Tales of Hearts R a joy to play for action game fans.</p>

<h2 id="h-tales-of-the-abyss">Tales of the Abyss</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>While Tales of the Abyss would deserve a remake in my opinion, a remaster would be very welcome</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tales of the Abyss, much like Tales of Hearts R, has an availability issue that's made even worse by the fact that neither the original PS2 release nor the Nintendo 3DS ports are available for purchase digitally, forcing players to track down physical copies of the game, which can be both costly and challenging, or rely on emulation. This, coupled with the great story and characters and its enduring popularity among fans, would have made a remaster of the game far more preferable than Tales of Berseria Remastered (though something could already be brewing, judging from <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.facebook.com/tales/posts/pfbid0AgTrWaitqVq48nF11pma2sKktjLkiUc462WG4hoTEqyto7fFg7iJPoJX4T9XeSZUl">a new image Bandai Namco shared on social media</a>).</p>



<p>While a remaster would quickly bring one of the series' best entries to a wider audience, I would personally prefer a full remake. Luke's compelling story and charming companions are exceptional, but some gameplay elements feel a little dated. Specifically, the combat system feels restrictive due to its reliance on the old Artes trees, forcing players to exploit glitches to get creative. Additionally, the overtuned Free Run mechanics make it too easy to negate powerful enemy attacks.</p>

<h2 id="h-tales-of-rebirth">Tales of Rebirth</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Tales of Rebirth is a challenging game that takes a slightly different direction from the rest of the series in terms of combat</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While Tales of Hearts R and Tales of the Abyss have been released in the West at some point, a few older entries in the series haven't, at least not officially. Among them is Tales of Rebirth, which is not only the last all-original mainline 2D entry in the series, but an excellent game in its own right that was made<a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-rebirth-english-patch-download/"> fully playable in English for the first time only last year.</a></p>



<p>While Veigue's story can be hit-and-miss (and involuntarily hilarious) sometimes, the game's battle system is one of the most articulate combat systems in the history of the series, featuring some very interesting mechanics such as battlefields being divided in three different planes instead of one and the Rage mechanics which can be manipulated on the fly to improve either offensive and defensive capabilities, making for a very dynamic system that makes battles engaging for its entire duration. The ability to enhance Artes with unique skills is the cherry on top of a combat system that is far from being the flashiest in the series, but is one of the most interesting nonetheless, attempting and succeeding at addressing the button-mashing criticism sometimes addressed to the series as a whole.</p>

<p>With Tales of Xillia Remastered already having been released, remastering Tales of Xillia 2 next would have been a given. Not only is the game already localized, it uses the same engine as its predecessor, and it's generally, in my opinion, a much better game, successfully addressing many of its criticisms, such as the empty fields that replaced a classic world map, pacing, and lack of optional content.</p>



<p>Although it recycles much of Tales of Xillia's locations, Tales of Xillia 2 succeeds at making the second venture through the united world of Rieze Maxia and Elympyos engaging with a very personal story, which is elevated by some of the dark implications of Ludger's alternate realities eradication. Things do get a little confusing at times, as it usually happens when multiple dimensions are involved, but ultimately, Tales of Xillia 2's story and main characters, amazing combat system, and stellar soundtrack make it a game worth experiencing. Hopefully, it won't take long for the<a href="https://wccftech.com/bandai-namcos-tales-series-has-a-lot-brewing-but-the-most-interesting-will-take-a-while-to-show/"> already confirmed remaster to come out.</a></p>

<h2 id="h-tales-of-destiny-director-s-cut">Tales of Destiny Director's Cut</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Tales of Destiny Director's Cut is still today the best entry in the Tales series that most fans in the West haven't played</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While I haven't purposelly ranked which Tales game I would have liked to see remastered before Tales of Berseria on purpose since I would love to see all of them on modern consoles and PC, if I only had to chose one, it would be Tales of Destiny Director's Cut, and not only because the original PSX release was the first entry in the series I played, or because I have played the game for close to 500 hours back in the day when I had all the time in the world and loved every second of it.</p>



<p>Seventeen years after its release, the remake of the second entry in the series continues to be, in my opinion, the best Tales game ever released. Everything, from the story, which does a great job of making Stahn's journey both exciting and epic, to the charming cast of characters and gameplay, remains unmatched in the series to this day.</p>



<p>However, if I were to pick only one reason to remaster the game, it would be its combat system. Marking the debut of the Chain Capacity system which has been iterated upon by future entries in the series, the Tales of Destiny Director's Cut rendition of the franchise's Linear Motion Battle System is, simply put, amazing, combining deep strategic thinking with the Weakness system that increases damage when hitting the enemy with an element they are week to, with almost complete combo freedom, doing away with the Artes tree system employed by past games to deliver an extremely deep experience with tons of tech that would even put some traditional fighting games to shame.</p>

<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">All of the Tales of Destiny Director's Cut mechanics come together really well to deliver the best combat system in the series, as showcased in the combo video above by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@ssrai">donguri900</a></em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Even if we were to ignore the game's quality, remastering Tales of Destiny Director's Cut in the near future would be the best way to get the series out of the slump it has fallen into following the release of Tales of Arise. Although there are surely some technical challenges, such as source code issues and localizing the game in English for the first time, remastering the game ahead of the launch of the next entry in the series would give Western players what feels like a brand-new, excellent title that could revitalize a series that has been stuck on remasters for far too long. And with so many 2D titles finding success nowadays, there's really no reason not to make the game's beautifully detailed sprites shine at higher resolutions.</p>



<p>These are the Tales games I would have loved to see getting the remaster treatment before Tales of Berseria, but there are many other entries in the series still stuck on old consoles. Do you agree with my list, or would you like to see any other entry in the series getting remastered? Let us know in the comments!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-bulky-smartwatches-oura-ring-4-is-not-selling-for-a-new-all-time-low-on-amazon-2000646440</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Health tracking usually means strapping a bulky smartwatch onto your wrist and then remembering to charge it every few days. The <strong>Oura Ring 4 takes a completely different approach by putting comprehensive health monitoring into a sleek ring</strong> that disappears on your finger. You forget you’re wearing it within minutes which can’t be said about even the smallest smartwatches on the market.</p>
<p>Amazon dropped <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5816/">all colors and sizes to $249 for Black Friday, down from $349</a>, and marks a record low that makes this discreet fitness tracker genuinely accessible. The<strong> 29% discount applies across silver, black, gold, and stealth</strong> finishes in every ring size.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5816/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Finger-Based Sensors</h2>
<p>The position of a ring on your finger gives<strong> cleaner biometric signals</strong> than is possible with wrist-based devices. The arteries in your fingers sit closer to the surface, with less interference from tendons, bones, and movement artifacts. This placement captures heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen levels with improved accuracy compared to the traditional fitness trackers.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep tracking represents the Oura Ring’s greatest strength</strong>: an analysis of your rest in granular detail that actually displays patterns invisible to casual observation. It tracks the stages of sleep, movement, temperature variation, and calculates sleep efficiency scores. When you wake up, you get a detailed picture of how well you actually slept, rather than how many hours you spent in bed.</p>



<p>It takes a variety of health metrics and puts them into one daily number that shows if your body is ready for intense activity, or if you need to recover. <strong>Sleep quality, heart rate variability, body temperature, and recent activity levels</strong> are factored in to give an estimate. A high score would suggest that you can push hard in workouts, while lower scores recommend taking it easy.</p>
<p>Temperature tracking reveals small variations in your body’s baseline that are indicative of various states of health. It is used by women for cycle tracking, where body temperature changes predictably across menstrual phases. The ring spots illness before you feel any symptoms, often showing a rise in temperature a day or two before the worst cold symptoms set in.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life reaches about a week on a single charge,</strong> and dramatically outlasts smartwatches that need daily charging. The wireless charger tops up the ring in about an hour, and you’re even able to charge while working at your desk. That extended runtime means you capture sleep data every night without needing to charge before bed.</p>
<p><strong>Activity tracking counts steps, active calories, and movement</strong> throughout the day. It doesn’t require workout logging, as the ring automatically detects activities and categorizes them accordingly. Heart rate monitoring during exercise shows intensity levels and recovery patterns. The main focus remains on daily activity rather than detailed workout metrics which suits users who want health insights without obsessive exercise tracking.</p>
<p>The <strong>Oura app presents all this data in clean visualizations</strong>, highlighting trends and actionable insights. Daily scores for sleep, readiness, and activity provide easy status checks without the need to deep-dive into charts. The app can identify patterns across weeks and months, showing how changes to lifestyle decisions impact health metrics. Personalized recommendations based on your own data help one improve scores rather than just broad, generic advice. The cost for the subscription model, after the first month is free, is $5.99 a month, which grants access to full features and historical data.</p>
<p>At $249, you’re getting premium health tracking in a form factor that traditional fitness trackers can’t match. Apple Watch and Fitbit devices cost similar amounts, but require wrist real estate and daily charging. This Black Friday pricing opens up the Oura Ring to users who want in-depth health data without the commitment to the wrist.</p>

I don't usually go in for 'relic' effects on anything, but this looked a bit special. It felt artful and novel in a market where neon gamer gear dominates, screaming for attention, and 'cheapening' otherwise decent equipment. The Xbox face button layout, though, meant it wasn't specifically relevant to Switch owners.</p>
<p>Fast-forward several months, and there's <a href="https://www.pbtails.com/products/550-spyder-crush-controller-limited-edition-with-k-silver-tmr-joysticks">a new model</a> bearing Nintendo's classic button layout. Retailing for $79.99, this is the firm's familiar Crush pad but with '50s automotive stylings - specifically, it's celebrating the 70th anniversary of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_550">Porsche 550 Spyder</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hplwgy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>There's no official licensing on this tribute, but the finish is beautiful, if you're into that sort of thing. The red light strip along the bottom edge (you can change the colour - more on that later) looks like a tail light, while the decals and details across the face, plus the silver paint job and the 'grille', faux-number plate, and red strips on the rear, give the feel of a quality piece of retro memorabilia. The burgundy trim of the D-pad and the shoulder buttons add to the classy, retro stylings, too.</p>

<p>Opinion among Team NL is divided — you'll need to be a classic car connoisseur or have a thing for mechanical engineering and retro design — but I love the look and feel. It's a niche aesthetic and the pad won't suit every gaming purpose, but there's a luxuriousness to the finish and the chrome accents that gets my motor running. You feel like you should be playing with leather driving gloves when you're handling this thing (and maybe I did).</p>
<p>In the hands, gloved or otherwise, this Crush pad feels like an old-school Xbox 360 controller, but weightier, and definitely glossier. The metal of the default sticks is just the beginning, and the slickness of the bodywork is probably a dealbreaker if you main games that give you sweaty palms.</p>
<p>Fingerprints were my immediate concern on taking the pad from its black and white case and removing the little foam collars around the sticks, but surprisingly, I haven't found them an issue. I assumed I'd need a microfiber cloth after every session, but it's been fine sitting on the side over the past couple of weeks, despite the dust on my TV shelf and my sticky gamer paws.</p>

<p>A braided USB-A to C cable is included for charging (the claimed 30-hour life feels accurate, although that'll depend on your lighting intensity), plus a dongle for 2.4G wireless connection and plastic/rubber sticks if you want to swap out the zinc alloy pair.</p>
<p>And honestly? If you're into your online shooters or just want to be competitive in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, you'll want to switch the stick covers; channel-hopping in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blippoplus">Blippo+</a> was a dream, a tense shootout in Springfield less so. I had no issue racing in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID</a> or unleashing ninja skills in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a>, but chromed metal just doesn't offer enough grip for split-second, precision inputs.</p>
<p>The sticks themselves are the TMR variety, so power efficient and offering commensurate performance and protection against drift to Hall Effect. Obviously, it'll take a year or two of use to thoroughly test their resilience, but there's nothing to suggest they'll start wandering. They feel robust and responsive.</p>
<p>Changing the sticks involves removing the magnetic faceplate, which can be tricky if you don't have decent nails, but gripping the front housing up around the shoulder buttons while pressing down on the sticks with your thumbs will eventually prise the cover away. Swap out the metal ones, clip the caps into the plastic domes, pop the cover back on, and you're away.</p>

<p>PB sells other faceplates, although it would be weird to buy one of these and then ruin the aesthetic with a clear orange cover. Also worth noting is that the carry case's foam insert holds the two-part plastic sticks only, so you'll need to store the metal ones safely somewhere else.</p>
<p>Removing the chrome ones feels like sacrilege, though, like you've whacked some cheap rims on a vintage Jag. It functions well, with gyro controls, some very nice rumble (the growl it makes when it connects to the console feels, brilliantly, like a revving engine), and pleasingly springy analogue triggers. The D-pad felt fine for a blast through some NSO classics, and the whole controller has a premium-feeling heft to it.</p>
<p>Even the RGB lighting feels somehow sophisticated here. Holding down the 'T' (turbo) button and moving the left stick lets you pick the exact colour of the light strip, while the right stick changes the face and central Home buttons. You can tweak the intensity of the LEDs, too, and I appreciated that it's all there and selectable via the pad itself, no external software needed. You can't buy a lightbulb these days without downloading a bloody app.</p>

<p>Face button lighting presets are selectable, as well: Super Famicom-style is the default, but you've also got PlayStation blue with the customary hues of Sony's shapes, or Xbox green and corresponding button colours. There's also a Dreamcast-style option - at least I think that's what the orange home button and this colour layout are referencing. Obviously, the Nintendo ABYX labelling remains, but it's a neat nod to other platforms.</p>
<p>No clicky microswitches is a big plus, personally; all the face buttons feel nicely responsive without the irritating, cheap-sounding click that makes playing in a quiet space irritating. Toggling the switch on the top edge changes from 'S' (Switch) to 'X' (XInput), and everything functioned exactly as you'd expect when testing with Steam using the included dongle (or wired if you prefer) and iOS over Bluetooth.</p>

<p>While you get added turbo options via the aforementioned button, you don't get NFC reader for amiibo or a 'C' button for easy Switch 2 GameChat access. There's no headphone jack, either, so headset gamers should look elsewhere, and you don't get any fancy back buttons, either.</p>
<p>Another minor quirk is that '-' and '+' here are in the position of the Home and Capture buttons on Nintendo's controller, so prepare for some accidental screenshots at first. Also, you can't wake your Switch 2 up with this - not an issue for me as I always turn it on via the console, but some people really like the convenience of grabbing the pad down the side of the sofa and powering on.</p>
<p>This isn't the kind of pad you'll leave jammed down the side of the sofa, though. For $80, there are functions missing that you might hope to have. If you only get one controller for Switch 2, look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Nintendo's own option</a> or something from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-pro-3-bluetooth-controller-tmr-sticks-and-hall-effect-triggers-elevate-this-switch-2-compatible-pad">8Bitdo</a>. You're really paying for the <em>style</em> here. The Crush 550 needs pairing with a high-backed, leather-studded chair and a glass of Margaux while enjoying a visual novel or a light puzzler. It's <em>not</em> what you want if you're in the midst of a nailbiting deathmatch, perspiring between frantic frags and Dorito downtime. You wouldn't want to rag this into the ground with twitch shooters.</p>

<p>It really depends what kind of gamer you are, then. I find this a pleasure to play with, and I'll be using it whenever a game doesn't demand more performance than it can manage. A classic car is a perfect comparison; this is a fair-weather pad, a beautiful Sunday driver you take out only when conditions allow. If you're in the market for something for the weekend and value-for-money is less important than sophistication, this will look and feel great in your showroom.</p>

              <p>Mini PCs pack full desktop functionality into compact cases that disappear behind monitors or tuck into tight spaces where traditional towers won’t fit. The Mac Mini made this form factor popular, but Apple charges premium prices that put compact computing out of reach for budget-conscious buyers.</p>
<p>The <strong>Kamrui GK3 Plus</strong> provides a similar set of everyday capabilities at a fraction of the cost and performs well at web browsing, office work, streaming and even light photo editing. Amazon dropped <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/">the 16GB/512GB model to $189 for Black Friday, and applying the 10% promo code gets it down to $170 from the usual $229</a>&nbsp;which is a record low that makes desktop computing absurdly affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Intel N95 Processor Handles Daily Tasks With Ease</h2>
<p>The 12th generation <strong>Intel Alder Lake N95 processor</strong> runs at a base frequency of 1.7GHz and boosts up to 3.4GHz when tasks require extra power. Four cores take care of multitasking scenarios like running a browser with multiple tabs while streaming music and working in documents. This chip delivers 35% better CPU performance and 78% improved graphics compared to older N100 and N5105 processors found in competing budget mini PCs.</p>
<p>The integrated Intel UHD Graphics runs 4K video playback, casual photo editing and general desktop work with ease. You will not be editing 4K video timelines or playing demanding games, but everyday computing feels responsive and capable. The graphics output supports three displays simultaneously through dual HDMI ports and a VGA connection.</p>



<p>This 16GB of DDR4 RAM is enough to supply modern computing without slowdowns that plague systems with less capacity. You keep dozens of browser tabs open, run multiple applications side by side, and jump between tasks without waiting for content to reload. This amount of memory matches what many premium laptops include and is well above what budget systems often offer. You notice the difference immediately in daily use, where 8GB systems start to struggle with basic multitasking.</p>
<p>The 512GB M.2 SSD stores your operating system and files on fast solid-state storage. Boot times measure in seconds rather than minutes, and applications launch quickly without the delays hard drives cause. <strong>Storage expands through an additional 2.5-inch drive bay that accepts SSDs up to 2TB</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s compact,<strong> measuring only 5.1 by 5.1 by 1.96 inches</strong> and it is small enough to mount behind a monitor via an included VESA bracket. This mounting option creates a pseudo all-in-one setup that keeps your desk clean and hides the computer from view. The size makes it perfect for entertainment centers where it connects to TVs for streaming without the bulk of a traditional PC. You escape the limited app selection of smart TVs by running a full Windows installation with access to any streaming service or application.</p>
<p>Connectivity includes Gigabit Ethernet for fast wired networking and dual-band WiFi for wireless flexibility. Bluetooth 4.2 interfaces connect wireless peripherals like keyboards, mice, and headphones. The port selection has USB connections for external devices and storage in addition to the video outputs. This connectivity handles typical home and office setups without requiring adapters or hubs.</p>
<p><strong>Windows is ready to go, right out of the box</strong>.</p>
<p>At $170 with the promo code, you’re getting a complete desktop computer with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD for less than most people spend on accessories. Performance won’t be of the same caliber as Apple Silicon, but general computing tasks run smoothly without the premium price tag.</p>

              <p>Nintendo has dominated portable gaming with the Switch 2, but Sony finally offers a compelling alternative for PlayStation owners who want their games on the go. The company built an empire around the PS5 as a living room powerhouse and the <strong>PS Portal extends that experience beyond the couch and into your hands</strong>.</p>
<p>This device <strong>streams your entire PS5 library to a beautiful 8-inch screen</strong>, and lets you play God of War or Spider-Man anywhere in your home or via cloud gaming on the move. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/">dropped it to $179 for Black Friday, down from $199</a>. That’s a record low, one which already moved over 8,000 units and counting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>PS5 Games to Your Hands</h2>
<p>The <strong>full HD 1080p display stretches across 8 inches of screen</strong> real estate, creating an immersive portable gaming experience. You see game details clearly with vibrant colors and sharp text, making even busy action sequences easy to keep track of. Screen brightness handles a wide range of lighting conditions, from dimly lit bedrooms to bright living rooms.</p>
<p>The<strong> 60fps capability</strong> ensures smooth gameplay that matches what you experience on your TV. Frame rates stay locked during intense action sequences, maintaining the responsive feel that PS5 games deliver on the console itself. The visual quality impresses given the streaming nature of the device, with minimal compression artifacts during stable WiFi connections.</p>



<p><em>Remote Play</em> <strong>connects directly to your PS5 console over WiFi</strong>, and streams games installed on your system to the portable device. You play your whole digital and disc library without buying games a second time or waiting for separate downloads. The PS5 does all the processing while the Portal displays the video output and transmits your controller inputs back. The upside of this is that you get complete PS5 graphics instead of downgraded portable versions.</p>
<p>The <strong>cloud streaming through Playstation Plus Premium</strong> unlocks gaming without needing your PS5 powered on: you access hundreds of titles from the Game Catalog and Classics Catalog streamed directly to the device. Select PS5 games from your digital library stream sans downloads, affording instant access to big titles wherever decent internet is found.</p>



<p>The<strong> features of the DualSense controller integrate</strong> directly into the Portal’s design: haptic feedback and adaptive triggers are built into the grips. You feel immersive sensations, from terrain textures to weapon recoil, the same as the standard PS5 controller. A familiar button layout means PlayStation players don’t need an adjustment period. The ergonomic design spreads the weight comfortably during long play sessions.</p>
<p>Tempest 3D AudioTech provides for spatial sound through the headphone jack or wirelessly via Playstation Link compatible devices. You really hear enemies coming from specific directions and environmental audio placed precisely in three-dimensional space. This audio quality adds a layer of immersion that most portable gaming devices lack. The experience approaches what you’d get through a proper home theater setup, compressed into a personal audio bubble.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life reaches several hours</strong> of continuous play and sees you through extended gaming sessions without the need for a charge. USB-C charging makes use of standard cables you already own, ensuring that topping up from portable batteries or wall chargers is a breeze. The device goes into sleep mode fast when you pause a game to conserve battery life for when you return.</p>
<p>At $179, you’re getting a premium portable streaming device with DualSense features and an 8-inch display for 10% off. The Switch 2 costs significantly more while running native games at lower graphical fidelity than streamed PS5 titles.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has announced "Teammates", an "AI experiment to change the game" and "deepen the player experience".</p>
<p>The developer/publisher said the project is "more than just talk" and will add "depth to gameplay by going beyond AI chatbots and turning NPCs into real teammates" as you play a first-person shooter.</p>
<p>The reveal comes after Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot told investors yesterday that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-believes-generative-ai-is-as-big-a-revolution-for-games-as-the-shift-to-3d-as-tech-is-embraced-company-wide">generative AI has been integrated across the entire company</a>, calling it a "revolution" for video games as big as the shift from 2D to 3D.</p>

<p>"First and foremost, Teammates is an experimental research project, albeit a playable one," Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/3mWlITIuWuu0MoVuR6o8ps">explained</a>. "Built around the mechanics of a first-person shooter, players take on the role of a member of the resistance in a dystopian future, tasked with moving through an enemy base to locate five missing members of their team.</p><p>"In the short playable level, players must recover the final memories of those who were sent in previously to discover their fates, while fending off squads of enemies along their path. Besides the AI voice assistant – Jaspar – the player is accompanied by two NPC squad members – Pablo and Sofia – also featuring the new advanced capabilities."</p>
<p>AI assistant Jaspar can highlight enemies or objects, provide story and lore details, alter game settings "on the fly", or even pause the game, all through simple and natural vocal instructions.</p>
<p>"But more than this, he is a dynamic and responsive character within the story," the company added. "The underlying systems can process the information available within the Teammates experiment’s environment, and contextual cues, interpreting and adapting to the player’s vocal input and actions."</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Today we’re unveiling Teammates, an AI-driven research project exploring how new tech can deepen the player experience.</p><p>More than just talk, this brand-new experiment adds depth to gameplay by going beyond AI chatbots and turning NPCs into real teammates. Find out more:… <a href="https://t.co/SyISwjJ5af">pic.twitter.com/SyISwjJ5af</a></p></div>— Ubisoft (@Ubisoft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1991930899252810021?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>You can also directly command - or "chat with" - your NPC teammates, Sofia and Pablo.</p>
<p>"Our early experiments showed players were quickly connecting with the AI-driven NPCs and the voice assistant concept," director of gameplay GenAI Xavier Manzanares added.</p>
<p>"Jaspar was helping players when they got lost or weren’t sure what to do, he could access menus and settings, tell players more about the world and the story. We really started to like Jaspar and saw how a system like this could be interesting for many different kinds of games."</p><p>“This technology opens doors to new, personalised experiences,” added data &amp; AI director Rémi Labory. “Player input shapes character reactions in real time, something traditional development can’t achieve. We’re also delivering a full pipeline, with the experience taking players from onboarding to debrief, which is a first.”</p>
<p>The team said it was "aware of the criticisms around AI in games", but insisted the goal "is not to replace creatives, but rather to find ways to enhance it by combining the strengths of the technology and the human creativity and ingenuity that are crucial to making games".</p>
<p>"At first, I had the same concerns as many others," explained narrative director Virginie Mosser. "But I discovered that it’s the exact opposite of removing the human from the process. I still write the story and character personalities, but instead of fixed lines, we create these kinds of fences that let NPCs improvise within the world but stay within the boundaries of the lore and motivations we have given them. They can improvise, but we still set the rules and direct the story and characters."</p>
<p>Ubisoft finished by saying that "Teammates" has already been shared with a few hundred players in a closed playtest. It will continue to test and develop the technology, "building the tools and gathering vital reactions and suggestions from real players and creative teams within Ubisoft to refine and expand the systems they have built, all with a philosophy of human creativity, ingenuity, and curiosity at the heart of their work".</p>
<p>This news follows the cessation of trading for Ubisoft, which sent the entire industry into mass speculation. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-116bn-tencent-investment-into-assassins-creed-maker-is-on-track-following-last-weeks-surprise-delay-to-financial-report">Ubisoft later confirmed that this was due to an issue with new auditors</a>, despite broad speculation of a grander acquisition.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, the estimated digital file sizes for the Switch and Switch 2 Edition of Samus' long-awaited adventure have also gone live on the eShop and official Nintendo website. So, if you didn't already know, here's what you can expect:</p>

<p>- Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (Switch) - <strong>28.9 GB</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>- Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition - <strong>31.6 GB</strong></p>

<hr>
<p>Of course, these sizes are still classed as an "estimate" at the moment and are subject to change before and after release, depending on the patches and updates distributed. The eShop also has Metroid Prime 4's Upgrade Pack listed as <strong>1.5 GB</strong>.</p>
<p>In comparison, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> (based on the first Prime entry) is just under 7 GB according to the Switch eShop.</p>

When in docked mode, players can choose from 4K at 60fps (quality) or 1080p at 120fps (performance). And in handheld/tabletop mode, the options are 1080p at 60fps (quality) and 720p at 120fps (performance).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has unveiled Teammates, a short playable experience powered by generative AI. It was developed by the team behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-blows-up-at-gdc-2024-between-ubisofts-neo-npcs-xboxs-narrative-graph-tool-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024's Neo NPC demo</a>, which was recently honored under the France 2030 program for advancing French innovation.</p>



<p>In the initial prototype from 2024, Neo NPCs demonstrated novel cognitive and natural language abilities, but they were still confined to a static environment. In Teammates, Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) are placed in a traditional first-person shooter setting and are equipped with advanced AI features. This allows them to respond dynamically to real-time voice commands, adapt their behaviour to each situation, and reveal their distinct personalities.</p>



<p>From mission briefings to battlefield commands, they react naturally, adapting to players' strategies, moods, and even personal slang. Ubisoft states that NPCs can interpret player intent and tone, as well as environmental cues, generating fluid, context-aware reactions that enhance immersion and player agency.</p>



<p>Virginie Mosser, Narrative Director on the project at Ubisoft, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>It’s really about experimenting with entirely new ways of creating interactive stories. Our role is to give AI meaning, to narrativise it, ensuring logic doesn’t replace soul. We designed Teammates to leave space for player creativity, finding that balance between emotion and unpredictability.</em></p>



<p>Ubisoft also showed a new in-game companion called Jaspar, a personal assistant designed to support players throughout their missions. Jaspar recognises players by name, assists with onboarding and understands the game's lore. He can also highlight threats or key objects in the environment, remind players of their mission objectives, suggest next steps, and act as a tactical guide when they are unsure what to do. The companion even has the ability to manage HUD elements, open menus, and adjust settings.</p>

<p>The Teammates experiment serves both as a playable prototype and a testbed for the underlying technology. Xavier Manzanares, Director of Gameplay GenAI at Ubisoft, explained:</p>



<p><em>Games of tomorrow will listen, understand and react to players far more than today, and our research gives a glimpse of what adaptive, generative play could add on top of proven game systems. It’s the first time we’ve shared an experiment this early with players, but our goal is to pave the way with a strong technology layer so our creators can start imagining the value it could bring to their project and players.</em></p>



<p>The team has also built an API that abstracts the complexity of generative systems, embeds necessary guardrails, including hallucinations, bias, toxicity, among others, and helps control its power to put it at the service of human creativity and play.</p>



<p>In the press release accompanying Teammates, Ubisoft co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot stated that creativity will remain 'deeply human', with AI tools only helping to bring creative visions to life in new ways.</p>



<p>But in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quarterly earnings</a> call, Guillemot added:</p>



<p><em>We are making great strides in applying GenAI to high-value use cases, delivering tangible benefits to our players and teams. It's as big a revolution for our industry as the shift to 3D, and we have everything to lead on this front.</em></p>



<p>It's probably going to be a while before we see this technology applied to actual games. However, Teammates has already been shared with a few hundred players in a closed playtest. The team behind the experience will continue to test, build tools, and gather feedback and suggestions from real players and creative teams within Ubisoft to refine and expand these systems. An explainer video is also coming soon for those who'd like to see it in action.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>The end of 2025 is fast approaching, so I've found myself going back to some of this year's releases to see which games might make their way into my top five. It was perhaps a mistake to boot up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>, however, as those who have played it will know what an absolute monster it is. Maybe I'll put a few hours into it before moving on to something else, we'll see...</p>
<p>I've also recently gone back to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/evil_within">The Evil Within</a> on the PS5. I can't believe it's over ten years old already! I do really love it though, even if it doesn't quite reach the lofty heights of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>.<br>
Happy gaming, folks!</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>The <em>tap, tap, tap</em> of 2026 on my door has kicked me into gear to finally finish <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. I am about 15-20 hours in, and boy, do I feel pain. It's a lot — like, <em>a lot</em> — but I haven't been this all-consumed by a game in a long old time.</p>
<p>I'm breaking up my Lumière sad times with the odd run of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>, which has also proven to be right up my street. Karl has been my go-to for longer runs so far, but I am becoming increasingly attached to my beloved frog wizard, Brome, and his adorable little animations. Let's hope I can get at least one run wrapped up before a certain space bounty hunter zooms into view next month.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>With GOTY approaching, I'm in catch-up mode. This weekend, I'll be carrying on with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a>, and hopefully returning to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a>. Non-2025, I've also dipped back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID</a> recently. How I wish Nintendo would put analogue triggers back in their controllers!</p>
<p>Not 'playing', but game-related, I'm eager to catch up with the movie-length <a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2WDfsiLiRA" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2WDfsiLiRA" rel="noopener noreferrer">NES 40th anniversary Portland Retro Gaming Expo panel</a> which went up earlier in November. And news of Rebecca Heineman's passing had me looking back over 40+ years of her work, so the 3DO port of Doom and <a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbIil2HPSU" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbIil2HPSU" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burgertime videos</a> are calling. <a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://bsky.app/profile/textfiles.com/post/3m5ugvjyzkk2m" href="https://bsky.app/profile/textfiles.com/post/3m5ugvjyzkk2m" rel="noopener noreferrer">F cancer, indeed</a>.</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<div><p>A couple of Steam releases caught my eye this weekend, and I do hope to see them both on consoles down the line. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710820/Cleared_Hot/">Cleared Hot</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2105620/Sektori/">Sektori</a> are the spiritual sequels you never knew you needed to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/desert_strike_return_to_the_gulf">Desert Strike</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/geometry_wars_galaxies">Geometry Wars</a>, respectively. Princess woes continue with both Zelda and Melinoë still at odds with Ganon and Chronos (and Typhon, I guess) in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> (now in physical cartridge glory, hurrah!) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. I do hope I get to tackle more of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>, it is one of the biggest surprises of the year IMO. In the middle of all this, I feel a lot of folks are overlooking a stellar Switch release that was nearly my game of the week if not for a certain pink ball: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/neon_inferno">Neon Inferno</a>. I have been eagerly waiting for this one for some time now, and it is delivering on every front.</p><p>

Game of the week is, without surprise, Kirby Air Riders. I know the original GameCube title (which is on my shelf) didn’t really raise many eyebrows back in 2003, but I am hopeful a lot more people get to slide around with it this time. It is another finely crafted SORA masterpiece that will certainly keep yours truly occupied until December arrives.</p></div>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I found a very neat game on Steam called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3503440/Astro_Prospector/">Astro Prospector</a>. It's about £5. Maybe less. And it's brilliant — this little snack-sized incremental game that's all about shooting asteroids and dodging bullets. Think <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cobalt_core">Cobalt Core</a> meets <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> with coffee theming.</p>
<p>Other than that, still plugging away at Hades II! I stopped for a while to let the ending get patched and to help judge an indie game competition (which is where I discovered Astro Prospector), but now both of those are done, I'm back on the grind. I'm not rushing towards the ending just yet, as I'm having more fun trying out silly builds and unlocking new weapons, and after that, I might move on to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, since I'm hearing good buzz about it (and the new <strong>Monster Factory</strong> episodes have me wanting to play <strong>Fallout</strong>-type games again).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the North they come, via the sea. For pillage, plunder, and slaughter, before disappearing back across the ocean, leaving the survivors to pick up again amongst the destruction. But the last few times have been different, and warriors have remained and are pushing further and further South, and they will continue to do so unless someone pushes them back into the ocean. The Chaos Marauders have arrived with the <em>Warhammer The Old World</em> Chaos Marauders Reinforcement Set. In this article, we'll have a look at the boxed set and the&nbsp;Arcane Journal: The Razing of Westerland supplement that contains their rules.</p>

<p><i>Warhammer The Old World </i>is a rank and flank wargame, brought back from retirement and based on the original <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy tabletop game after Games Workshop changed the setting into the current <em>Age of Sigmar</em>. You can check out our review of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-old-world-review-hit-refresh" rel="nofollow">Warhammer The Old World Starter Set</a> that launched the release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-2.jpg?itok=DuLOSkZB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-2.jpg?itok=uD0DAF_W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Warhammer The Old World</em> Chaos Marauders Reinforcement Set contains 50 miniatures to expand or begin your invasion force.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Components of Conquest</h2>

<p>To celebrate the release of the new Chaos Marauders miniatures, Games Workshop is launching them with a Reinforcement Set that contains:</p>

<ul><li>40x Chaos Marauder miniatures that can be built as 2 units of 20, or 4 units of 10, each with a headman (champion), standard bearer, and musician, and they can be armed with either&nbsp;hand weapons and shields, great weapons, or flails.</li>
	<li>10x Chaos Marauder Horesmen that can be built as 1 unit of 10, or 2 units of 5, each with a horsemaster (champion), musician, and standard bearer, and they can be armed with either cavalry spears, or flails.</li>
	<li>2x new Warriors of Chaos transfer sheets, each containing 246 Norscan tribes icons and rune decals.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-3.jpg?itok=Faas2KC5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-3.jpg?itok=JERmuLXY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new command units for the Chaos Marauders really stand out against the rest of the unit.</figcaption></figure><p>The multitude of weaponry and head options means that you can create several unique-looking units with the set, and the option to have all units (6 if split into their smallest forms) with a champion, standard bearer, and musician is great for optionality. The Chaos Marauders are also now on 30x30mm bases (25x25mm base before), which they fill, so they look a lot more beefier than before, accurately reflecting the battle-hardened warriors that they are. I love the Marauder standard bearer with axe, he looks like an absolute unit, only held back from devastating his enemies because he's carrying a huge banner.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-5.jpg?itok=5WUoq2nc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-5.jpg?itok=prLCd6iB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new Arcane Journal has the rules and background for the Chaos Marauders, and an awesome Path to Glory campaign for them.</figcaption></figure><h2>Rules Of The Arcane</h2>

<p>The new&nbsp;Arcane Journal: The Razing of Westerland, sold separately from the Mauraduers Reinforcement set, but containing their profiles, fits alongside the <em>Warhammer The Old World</em> Ravening Hordes rules for making your Warriors of Chaos army, supplementing and replacing some rules.</p>

<p>The book starts by detailing Frydaal the Chainmaker’s invasion of Westerland, along with a map of the invasion and background on the Marauder tribes and their 4 cults. It also includes a Path to Glory campaign, where players start with a small force and build up to full-sized armies over several linked games. You will need the Arcane Journal: The War of Settra’s Fury book as well, which details how to play the smaller-scale games that make up the first few campaign games. To supplement the campaign, the Razing of Westerland contains 3 scenarios that you can use in your Path to Glory campaign, reenacting&nbsp;the Chainmaker’s early battles in Westerland.</p>

<p>Arcane Journal: The Razing of Westerland also includes new profiles for Chaos Marauders and Marauder Horsemen, which replace those in Ravening Hordes. The main change is taking away the option to take a Chaos god mark and changing it to a mark of 1 of 4 Chaos Cults, either the Bloodied Hound, Carrion Crow, Slithering Serpent, or Fell Raptor. I prefer the Cult of the&nbsp;Bloodied Hound, which can gain the Marauders a +1 boost to their weapon skill once per game by passing a leadership test in the command phase, because if Chaos Marauders aren't attacking, what are they doing?</p>

<p>The journal also has a new magic lore for Chaos Sorcerers, Lore of the Shadowlands, which has spells like Shadowed Assailants, that deals 3D6 strength 1 hits to an enemy the caster is engaged with, with no armor or regeneration save allowed. The book closes with 18 new magic items that can be used by any Old World army.</p>

<p>The new Chaos Marauders and Marauder Horsemen miniatures are fantastic, and really capture the frozen waste barbarian nature of the warriors. The Chaos Marauders Reinforcement Set is a great way to start or expand your force with them, containing either 3 large units or 6 smaller ones, with full optionality, no matter how you spread your units. The Arcane Journal: The Razing of Westerland has some great background, and the Path to Glory campaign feels very in keeping with the Chaos Marauders campaign as they ravage Westerland. The new Cult and Chaotic Traits also allow you to flesh out your forces a lot more, giving some real individuality to your units and flexibility on the battlefield.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Swedish developer Fatshark is getting ahead of Black Friday sales by offering Warhammer: Vermintide 2 completely free to keep <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/552500/Warhammer_Vermintide_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>. If you add it to your library before November 24 at 10 AM Pacific Time, you'll keep it forever.</p>



<p>The promotion is part of the so-called '10 Years of Tide', the event that celebrates the tenth anniversary of the release of the first Vermintide game. For its part, the second franchise entry, launched seven years ago, has since more than doubled its original release content through free updates, DLCs, and major additions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/chaos-wastes-free-expansion-adds-rogue-lite-elements-to-vermintide-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chaos Wastes</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-gets-versus-mode-with-4v4-battles-and-several-characters-to-choose-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Versus</a>.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Fatshark released a free new map called "Return to the Reik," a beloved location from the first game that has been reimagined in Warhammer: Vermintide 2. River Reik returns with expanded, boat-focused gameplay that puts deck skirmishes front and center. Players will battle their way across swaying platforms, using the barge and riverbank environments to transform every encounter into a cinematic co-op spectacle.</p>



<p>This mission is a reimagining of the Warhammer: End Times Vermintide's popular level, blending nostalgia with deliberate changes and new encounters. Fatshark says they added new routes and set-piece moments, as well as boat props, to give the River Reik mission a distinct Vermintide 2 flavour, while maintaining the core story elements. The result, according to the studio, is a familiar yet surprising experience that will reward Ubersreik Five veterans and invite newcomers to discover a classic in a new light.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The studio's most recent game, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, is also part of the 10 Years of Tide campaign. As announced this week, the game will be updated with the new (and free) Hive Scum class on December 2. Hive Scum is a class that focuses on dual-wield expertise thanks to twin‑wield pistols and dual-wielding shivs. The December 2 update will also introduce a new Operation mission set in the trenches of Atoma, as well as a new time-limited special event in Darktide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon loves to push its own brands during Black Friday, and the Echo Dot always gets the deepest cuts. By selling these smart speakers at razor-thin margins-or even at a loss-Amazons ensures Alexa finds her way into as many American homes as possible. The strategy works brilliantly for the company, but it also gives shoppers some incredible deals. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">newest Echo Dot now drops from $49 to just $31</a> which is a record low price found only on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Best Sounding Echo Dot Ever Made</h2>
<p>Amazon says this is the <strong>best-sounding Echo Dot they’ve ever made</strong>, and the difference is actually appreciable: clearer vocals, deeper bass, and altogether punchier sound well above its weight class. Music fills a bedroom or office surprisingly well for something this small. Previous Echo Dot generations sounded thin and tinny in comparison. The audio upgrade alone justifies replacing older models you might have scattered around the house.</p>



<p><strong>Alexa integration</strong> makes this speaker a genuinely useful daily assistant: ask for the weather while you get dressed, set timers while you cook, or get quick answers to random questions throughout the day. The voice recognition works reliably from across the room, even with music playing. You can even tap the top to snooze your morning alarm when you need a few extra minutes.</p>
<p>Music streaming connects to all of the services you probably already use. <strong>Amazon Music, Apple Music, Spotify, among others, all work seamlessly through voice commands</strong>. Bluetooth connectivity lets you stream from any device when you want manual control. You can fill your entire home with synchronized music by pairing multiple Echo devices in different rooms. The ecosystem grows naturally as you add more speakers over time.</p>
<p>Smart home control makes the Echo Dot a<strong> central hub for any connected device</strong>: lights, thermostats, plugs, and many more accessories follow your every simple command. With its built-in motion sensor, routines can be automatically invoked as soon as you turn up in a room. The indoor temperature sensor allows you to create comfort-based automation, where you start the fan once it gets too hot.</p>



<p>Privacy controls certainly help mitigate these concerns about always-listening devices. The dedicated microphone off button physically disconnects the mics when you need guaranteed privacy. Amazon has built layers of protection into the system, stating explicitly that they do not sell your personal information. You can review and delete voice recordings at any time through the Alexa app, a big improvement over previous models in terms of data transparency.</p>
<p>Pairing options extend the functionality well beyond basic speaker duties. Pair with Fire TV devices for a home theater-like audio experience, link with compatible Eero mesh systems to extend Wi-Fi coverage throughout the house, and create speaker groups that play synchronized audio across multiple rooms. The Echo Dot works great on its own but really shines as part of a larger system.</p>
<p>At $31, the Echo Dot introduces smart home capability for a near-disposable price. In one small package, you’re getting better audio quality, Alexa integration, smart home control, and integrated sensors. This Black Friday deal brings the newest model to its lowest recorded price.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-inspired-sandbox-game-hytale-canceled-after-a-decade-of-development/1100-6532646/" data-ref-id="1100-6532646">Hytale was canceled</a> after spending a decade in development and the studio behind it, Hypixel, was slated to be closed as well. Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme subsequently revived the company and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/canceled-minecraft-competitor-hytale-isnt-canceled-after-all/1100-6536298/" data-ref-id="1100-6536298">purchased all of the rights for Hytale</a> from Riot Games. Collins-Laflamme also reiterated his commitment to releasing Hypixel in early access. Now, we know how much the game is going to cost.</p><p>On social media, Hypixel revealed that Hytale <a href="https://x.com/Hytale/status/1991884477816300023" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will retail for $20</a>. However, there will be more expensive editions with perks including cosmetics that fans can purchase in support of the team. After confirming the price, Collins-Laflamme noted that this decision puts him financially at risk because he's already committed to bankrolling his company and funding the game out of his own pocket.</p><p>"I'm pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible," wrote Collins-Laflamme on X. "I'm taking on a considerable personal risk after repurchasing the game and getting it ready for early access for a growing team of now 50 talented individuals. I said I was all in, and I am delivering on that promise. The game is unfinished and runs on a build from over four years ago. Charging more didn't feel right. I don't think the game is good yet. My team and I will push hard to make it good, then great. The vision is clear and progress is fast."</p><p>Collins-Laflamme added that he wants to attract as many players as possible, even during rough economic times. Hypixel has also released a post detailing <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-modding-strategy-and-status" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">how far along the modding feature is</a>. The short answer is there's still a lot of work to be done. For now, Hytale doesn't have a release date, but Collins-Laflamme has implied that the game's early-access period will begin relatively soon.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Capcom surprised fans with the announcement of a remaster of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/onimusha_2_samurais_destiny">Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny</a> for the Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>The same title eventually arrived in March of this year, and now in another update, Capcom has this week released a demo, which you can download right now from the eShop. According to the official description, it will allow players to experience the "gripping prologue" as you dive into the samurai action.</p>
<p>In our review of Onimusha 2 on the Switch, we mentioned how it was a faithful revival of one of the PS2's best games and included plenty of quality-of-life updates and extras that fans (and newcomers) were sure to appreciate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is a strong, worthy successor to the original that is now at its absolute best on Switch. Some of it feels dated by modern standards, with fixed camera angles that arguably should have been ditched back in 2002, but it still feels incredibly fun regardless."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/onimusha_warlords">Onimusha: Warlords</a> was also previously released on the Switch in 2019, if you want to start from the beginning.</p>

While we're still waiting on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-2025-black-friday-sale">Nintendo's deals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">Xbox</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-sale-2025-early-deals">Amazon</a> launched Black Friday sales earlier this week. Now <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">PlayStation</a> has entered the fray with a spread of discounts on games, accessories, and even PS5 consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's worth checking your wishlist and doing some scrolling, as a starting point, we're seeing great discounts for anyone looking to start or fill in the gaps on a Final Fantasy collection. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Final Fantasy Games on Sale for Black Friday </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, you’ve got options. The PlayStation Store offers the best discounts on the FF7 Remakes, but Amazon is actually offering physical copies. It really comes down to how much you care about having those games lined up on your shelf vs. sitting in your digital library. If you’re on the PC side, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/playstationpublishersale2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam is also running a PlayStation publisher sale</a> that includes roughly the same discounts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Final Fantasy Pixel Collection is pretty unreal bang for your buck. It includes the pixel remasters of the first six Final Fantasy games for just $30 total with the current price drop, making it a great choice for something you can really dig into over the holidays. The discount also applies to the <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrRWl?object_uuid=464cd0b5-f8e2-4b16-a1ca-a7eee5a1762f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch version</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for news on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-a-completed-story-at-square-enix">third and final part</a> of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy, you can pick up the first two games at a discount. Remake Intergrade (Intergrade just meaning the PS5 version) has dropped to $19.99 for physical and $14.99 for digital. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, released just last year, has dropped to $39.99 for the physical copy on Amazon and $34.99 through PlayStation. Michael Higham's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">9/10 review of Rebirth for IGN</a> describes how it "impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion as both a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenge and depth, and as an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most recent mainline release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-review">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, has dropped to its <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0BPMTJJ6D" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest ever price on Amazon</a>, which happens to be $5 cheaper than you can find it on the PlayStation Store. While outside of Black Friday deals themselves, Amazon does have a teensy tiny 5% discount on the most recent spin-off release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review">Final Fantasy Tactics: Ivalice Chronicles</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>More PlayStation Black Friday Deals </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation has knocked $100 off both its PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles, the only real console deals we’ve so far this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-predictions-and-latest-news">Black Friday</a>. There’s also PlayStation Plus discounts and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dualsense-ps5-controllers-black-friday-early-deals">spread of DualSense controllers</a> on sale, including my personal favorite, the limited edition Ghost of Yotei version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Blythe (she/her) is an SEO Coordinator at IGN who spends way too much time in character customization screens and tracking down collectibles. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-game-deals-ps5-black-friday-2025]]></content:encoded>
