			<p>Greedfall developer Spiders has laid off most of the animation team, according to Lead Animator Erwan Perrin, who wrote the following message <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/erwan-perrin_hey-weve-recently-been-informed-that-activity-7353013917415079936-aKPM/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<p><em>Hey! We’ve recently been informed that, like most of the Industry, Spiders Games will proceed a layoff plan and sadly most of the Animation and Rig team will be affected …If you're looking for some talented and passionated Paris based Animator or a Rig Artist, hit me up.</em></p>



<p>It is unfortunately only the latest instance of a seemingly unending wave of layoffs, from the largest companies (<a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warner Bros. shutting down Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB Games San Diego</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA laying off between 300 and 400 employees including at Respawn and Codemasters</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft shutting down The Initiative</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">canceling the new MMO in development at ZeniMax Online Studios</a>) to mid-sized ones like <a href="https://wccftech.com/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed-2026/">Supermassive</a> and now Spiders, too.</p>



<p>Greedfall 2: The Dying World hasn't done well since <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-ii-the-dying-world-releases-september-24-in-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its launch in early access</a>, that's for sure. The game 'peaked' at 375 concurrent players on Steam, but it is barely being played at this point, with yesterday's daily peak registered at a mere 10 players. User reviews are also very negative—the total sits at 55%, but the recent reviews are even lower rated (40%).</p>



<p>One of the main sticking points for most of the community and, indeed, the undersigned, is the combat system, which was changed from the real-time action of the first Greedfall to a tab-targeting-like combat reminiscent of Dragon Age: Origins or MMOs like World of Warcraft. Spiders has since taken steps to improve the feel of the combat through better animations and sounds, but the core remained the same, and it definitely <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">felt very dated</a>. It's a shame, as the first Greedfall <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/greedfall-spiders-levelling-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was a fun and well-made action RPG</a> that warranted a proper sequel.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-uk-cma</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-ios-return-in-uk-uncertain-thanks-to-cma-decisions-epic-says.1250982/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic Games has revealed that it doesn't know whether&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>will be returning to the iOS platform in the UK, following the release of two CMA (Competition &amp; Markets Authority) roadmaps regarding Google and Apple's mobile platforms.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/the-cma-s-roadmap-doesn-t-open-the-mobile-app-ecosystem-to-competition-in-the-uk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Epic says that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s "return to iOS in the UK is now uncertain" thanks to the CMA's decisions, and that it "can't bring the Epic Games Store to iOS in the UK this year (if ever)".</p>

<p>For context, the CMA laid out roadmaps for market status investigations into&nbsp;<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/687f8ab528f29c99778a7455/Roadmap__Google_.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google</a> and <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/687f893cf2ecaeb756d0e1e6/Roadmap__Apple_.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Apple</a> respectively today, and in both cases, requiring the two companies to allow developers to point users to other app stores and payment methods falls under measures the authority "will consider from the first half of 2026".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-uk-ios-uncertain-superman.jpg?itok=y8MSz1g- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-uk-ios-uncertain-superman.jpg?itok=znU19HRh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite</em>'s UK iOS return is now "uncertain", according to Epic.</figcaption></figure><p>Epic calls this a "missed opportunity to introduce competition into a currently-monopolized market". It's a decision that's contradictory to one <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-apple-500-million-euro-fine" rel="nofollow">recently made by the European Commission</a>, which saw Apple slapped with a&nbsp;€500 million fine and forced to&nbsp;"inform customers, free of charge, of alternative offers outside the App Store".</p>

<p>According to Epic, Apple and Google must be "completely blocked from imposing fees and discriminating against apps using out-of-app payment" if "years of malicious compliance...and no genuine restoration of market competition" are to be avoided.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that if you've been hoping to play&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on your iPhone or iPad in the UK, then it looks like you're going to have a long while to wait; the earliest you can likely expect to play the game on your device is 2026, but it could take even longer than that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-uk-ios-future-uncertain-squid-game.jpg?itok=-iSH76Ef 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-uk-ios-future-uncertain-squid-game.jpg?itok=LorB1MCg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Epic has some strong words for the UK's CMA today.</figcaption></figure><p>For years now, Epic has been embroiled in legal battles with both Apple and Google over allowing alternate payment systems and storefronts on the two companies' Android and iOS operating systems.</p>

<p>The fight began back in 2020, when Epic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-slashes-up-to-20-off-purchases-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow">launched a sale</a>&nbsp;that promised discounts if players used the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>studio's proprietary payment system.&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>was removed from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-sues-google-over-fortnites-removal-from-play-store" rel="nofollow">Android</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-apple-store-version-removed-for-violating-app-store-guidelines" rel="nofollow">iOS</a> as a result, and Epic sued both companies, kicking off the ongoing legal struggle.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're not in the UK, your iOS&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>prospects might be a bit rosier; in May, the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-app-store-returns" rel="nofollow">restored to the US App Store</a>, and of course, <em>Fortnite</em> is also available on Android via the Epic Games Store. If you're in the UK, though, you'll just have to wait for more on this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's giving you the chance to drive a ridiculously rare car, plus two other gorgeous vehicles.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://www.gran-turismo.com/gb/news/00_5317833.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</em>website, update 1.61 will either land today or tomorrow depending on where you are. It's set to arrive tonight at 10pm Pacific, so that's 1am Eastern or 6am GMT tomorrow.</p>

<p>Just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-157" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-156" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, the game's latest patch will be bringing three cars for you to drive, but there's a special addition in update 1.61 in the form of the '05 NISMO R34 GT-R Z-tune. If you're a rare car aficionado, you'll probably know what that means.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-update-1.61-z-tune.jpg?itok=SjBHE0wW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-update-1.61-z-tune.jpg?itok=BdAsE9FZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s latest update adds a legendary car.</figcaption></figure><p>The story behind this one is pretty special. You can see a full breakdown in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/gran-turismo-7-update-1-61-available-today/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this PlayStation Blog post</a>, but essentially, only 19 Z-tunes were made, and they're all constructed from stripped-down used cars with high-spec part replacements.</p>

<p>As well as the Z-tune, you can also expect to drive the '22 Honda N-ONE RS, a kei passenger car with front-wheel drive and a 6-speed manual transmission. It's a light, breezy vehicle with plenty of modern accouterments to keep you happy.</p>

<p>Finally in this update, the '22 Nissan Qashqai Tekna 190 2wd e-Power is a hybrid machine that features a revolutionary (no pun intended) electric-generating engine. The aim was to improve on previous models' emissions, a goal Nissan clearly reckons it's achieved.</p>

<p>You can see these cars in action right here in the&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.61 trailer. It's not very long, but it does give a sense of what these beasts are like on the track.</p>




<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.61 is due to land today at 10pm Pacific, or tomorrow at 1am Eastern/6am GMT. You can grab&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5 and PS4</a>.</p>

            <p>
Bad news everybody, I think I have discovered the game that is going to stop you doing anything else today. Witness the verminous splendour of turn-based puzzler Rat King, in which you simultaneously control two rodents who are exploring two different dungeons in splitscreen. I know, I know – to lose one rat in a dungeon may be regarded as a misfortune, to lose two looks like carelessness. But there is method to the madness. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Each questing squealer shares the same health bar, but faces a different 5x5 square room layout and enemy spawning patterns. As such, they will inevitably end up out of synch - one rat lodged in the corner of a room, for example, while the other fends off beetles in the middle. You need to work out the sequence of moves that keeps both rats alive, while scooping up coins to spend on items at shops, and guiding the varmints to the staircase to the next floor. 
</p>
<p>
It’s immediately engrossing, and it layers up very satisfyingly. Each rat can move between the rooms of its particular dungeon without waiting for the other, allowing you to effectively "reshuffle" one half of the screen when you can’t see a way to avoid damage. One obvious way to get your skavens in synch is to line them up against parallel walls, but if you bounce off surfaces repeatedly you’ll waken a vengeful ghost.</p>
<p>The ghosts are a lovely wordless characterisation of a soft design constraint. The basic idea is just to punish you for brute-forcing the simultaneous-move mechanic, but also, it makes sense that rapping on the walls of catacombs would rouse their resident spectres.
</p>
<p>
Items can be very helpful, though they only apply to the screen half in which they’re collected. There’s an ice cube that freezes a room’s enemies in place, for example, and a purple swirly that spins one rat’s control inputs around, allowing for more flexible movement as long as you don’t confuse yourself. 
</p>
<p>
The latter item makes the game feel like a lockpicking minigame in an Elder Scrolls <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, but the correct reference here is Michael Brough’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/868-hack">868-Hack</a>, which stole the luncheons and sleeping hours of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-works-and-why-betting-on-yourself-in-868-hack">many</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/priceless-play-2nd-november-2018">RPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/868-hack-review-pc">scribes</a> in times of yore. I haven’t played many "broughlikes", or at least, not knowingly, but Rat King already feels like a classic of the form.  I’ve only scraped the skin, I’m sure. <a href="https://torcado.itch.io/rat-king">Find it on Itch.io</a>.

It’s loaded from a separate menu and doesn’t overlap with the base game at all, and is missing things from it like Pro Rules and record tracking. <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, meanwhile, remains unchanged from its Switch 1 version. </p><p>Plant writes, “<em>Jamboree TV</em> runs in 1440p docked, but <em>Jamboree</em> is 1080p docked and still a noticeable 720p handheld.” There are no mouse controls added to the base game either. </p><p>That seems like a big missed opportunity, and the <em>Jamboree TV</em> section doesn’t sound substantial enough to make up for it. While a few of the new modes and mouse control mini-games clicked with some reviewers (there are no new boards, unfortunately), the Bowser TV section, which uses microphones and webcams to incorporate players directly into the chaos, is a bit thin. </p><p>“It’s a great idea in theory, especially because it’s an absurd riot to see my friends’ bodies emerge from warp pipes on screen,” writes Giovanni Colantonio <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/review/615084/super-mario-party-jamboree-tv-switch-2-edition&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/review/615084/super-mario-party-jamboree-tv-switch-2-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for <em>Polygon</em></a></span>. “The catch is that there are barely any minigames to support it all.”<br></p><p>It sounds like a glorified tech demo that points to where <em>Mario Party </em>will evolve in the future but isn’t quite worth the price of admission right now. There’s probably a world out there where Nintendo combined <em>Jamboree TV </em>and <em>Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> into a single pack-in that came free with the console and showcased all of its new features. But that’s not the one we’re living in. Here’s what other reviews are saying:</p><h2 id="h481"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/gaming/super-mario-party-jamboree-tv-switch-2-upgrade&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/super-mario-party-jamboree-tv-switch-2-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Inverse</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> All in all, the Switch 2 upgrade for <em>Mario Party Jamboree</em> isn’t the value add that it was for both the open-world Zelda games. The majority of the new minigames are fun, and the novelty of a first-party release that uses all of the new console’s bells and whistles will provide you with some fleeting entertainment. But spending an additional $20 for a few tricks and half-baked modes doesn’t make this party any better than it was the first time around. —Trone Dowd</p></blockquote><h2 id="h482"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/23/review-super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/23/review-super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>MyNintendo</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> While the base game of Super Mario Party Jamboree remains a must-have, the Jamboree TV expansion for Switch 2 is take it or leave it. For the price, the new Carnival Coaster mode and mouse minigames are a fun time, and the new rulesets for Mario Party are a welcome inclusion. Alas, Bowser Live struggles to make good use of the camera and microphone, CameraPlay is only worth it if you have friends or family to play with online, and the increased resolution is not supported with any of the original side modes. Just one new game board would have added so much value, but Jamboree TV doesn’t even have that. —nintendojam</p></blockquote><h2 id="h483"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Speaking of which, Jamboree TV adds two great rulesets to try out alongside the original that put fun spins on the classic dice-rolling action.

It’s a fun way to shake up the traditional format and it builds even further upon the strategic foundation of the base game. — Logan Plant</p></blockquote><h2 id="h484"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/review/615084/super-mario-party-jamboree-tv-switch-2-edition&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/review/615084/super-mario-party-jamboree-tv-switch-2-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The upgrade winds up falling on the inessential side – especially since it misses a chance to add some new maps or characters – but the full package is one of the Switch 2’s smartest value propositions at present.

Sure, Carnival Coaster isn’t something I’ll want to play for an hour at a time, but it works as one small attraction in a larger amusement park.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tolkien’s Middle-earth has captured the imagination of fantasy fans worldwide ever since The Hobbit was published in 1937. And although Peter Jackson is the film director who successfully brought the books to life on the big screen, you might be surprised to learn Middle-earth also has a rich video game history that goes back decades. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The earliest video game adaptation was created in 1982 by Beam Software, which developed a text-adventure game based on The Hobbit. The game was a huge hit and went on to sell over 500,000 units in Europe, despite middling reviews from critics. Such is the power of Tolkien’s works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In total, there are over 50 video games based on the works of J.R.R. Tolkien that span numerous genres, like action-adventure, RPG, strategy, and more. As we prepare for another new Tolkien game just on the horizon, we’ve gone through this long history and chosen the 11 best Lord of the Rings games ever made.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Lord of the Rings Video Games</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">11. The Lord of the Rings: War in the North</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The legal rights to adapt The Lord of the Rings into video games are almost as complicated as Middle-earth’s lore itself. In the early 2000s, Tolkien’s literary works and Peter Jackson’s film adaptations were treated separately, with Vivendi and Tolkien Enterprises owning the rights to adapt the books for games, while EA owned the rights to adapt Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings movies. In 2009, Warner Bros. was able to bring together both movie and book rights and, at long last, develop games that incorporated story elements from both the literary and cinematic worlds of Tolkien.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/11/25/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north-review">The Lord of the Rings: War in the North</a> is the first Middle-earth game to feature story and design elements from both books and films. This hack-and-slash RPG stars a trio of original characters: The Ranger Eradan, the Dwarf Farin, and the Elf Andriel, each with their unique playstyle. The trio goes on a journey parallel to the events of the film trilogy after they’re enlisted by Aragorn to help the Fellowship, all while Frodo makes his way to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. While the combat is generally considered enjoyable, albeit typical of its time, the real draw is that Lord of the Rings fans get to role-play as self-insert friends of Aragorn during the iconic events of the Peter Jackson movies.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. The Lord of the Rings Online</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since 2007, thousands of players have ventured into the many regions of Middle-earth itself thanks to the extensive digital world of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/12/the-lord-of-the-rings-online-shadows-of-angmar-review">The Lord of the Rings Online</a>. While certainly not as popular as other MMORPGs like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy 14, Lord of the Rings Online has cultivated a dedicated player base thanks to the way it brings the world of Tolkien to life, allowing players to explore the far corners of Eriador, Rhovanion, Gondor, and Mordor. A visit to The Lord of the Rings: Online can even be considered essential for any Lord of the Rings fan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Create a unique character and travel around Middle-earth during the events of The War of the Ring and undertake quests and raids crafted after events from the novels. What’s more, the game is still going strong after 18 years, with the most recent expansion, Legacy of Morgoth, released in late 2024. It also remains the only Lord of the Rings MMORPG, and will remain so for the foreseeable, especially after Amazon canceled its own planned Lord of the Rings MMORPG in 2021.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Lego The Hobbit</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">TT Games, formerly Traveller’s Tales, has transformed beloved franchises into wildly popular, comedic adventure Lego games for years. Lego The Hobbit follows the same formula that made the studio’s Star Wars and Harry Potter games such beloved hits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A zany re-telling of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/10/lego-the-hobbit-review">Peter Jackson’s Hobbit movies</a> built of plastic bricks, players can adventure through the events of the trilogy’s first two films, An Unexpected Journey and The Desolation of Smaug (the third film, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, had not yet hit theaters.) You can unlock and play as dozens of different Hobbit movie characters in this humorous adventure, which splices plenty of great skits and sight gags into an otherwise pretty faithful (if heavily condensed) recreation of the movies. Expect to battle goblins, ride barrels, and steal from a colossal dragon. But as enjoyable as this all is, just know there is a better Tolkien movie trilogy with a better Lego adaptation slightly further down this list.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">EA Los Angeles launched a series of real-time strategy games based on Middle-earth in 2004, during the height of the genre’s popularity. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/12/04/the-lord-of-the-rings-battle-for-middle-earth">The Battle for Middle-earth</a> is rooted in the tried-and-tested Command &amp; Conquer formula: you take command of either the forces of Gondor or Mordor, establish a base by building unique structures and units, and then send out an army that will fight a war to determine the fate of Middle-earth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle for Middle-Earth was a critical and commercial success when it was released,  thanks to its satisfying single-player story mode that included separate, complete campaigns for both Gondor and Mordor. Many praised the way it perfectly translated the world of Middle-earth to the RTS genre, and EA LA would go on to one-up their achievements with a far superior sequel that you’ll also find in this list.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lord of the Rings is the kind of property that allows for all kinds of adaptations. RTS? Sure! MMORPG? Absolutely. How about a Final Fantasy-esque turn-based RPG? Surprisingly, also yes –  you’ve found your way to The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Criticized for being maybe <em>too</em> inspired by Final Fantasy 10, right down to having a similar battle menu, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/11/02/lord-of-the-rings-the-third-age-3">The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age</a> nevertheless combines a familiar, turn-based combat system and class-based party system with the world of The Lord of the Rings.  The result is a satisfying RPG that has become an enduring fan-favorite. The Third Age, like War in the North, is set parallel to the events of the Peter Jackson films, with players taking on the role of characters who are hot on the trail of the Fellowship. Along the way, you visit many of the same locations that appear in the film trilogy, and battle familiar foes like the Balrog. There are even moments where you can temporarily team up with members of the Fellowship itself in battle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not the most original game on this list, but  The Third Age is a great way to feel like a part of The Lord of the Rings movies without simply playing as Aragorn, Gandalf, or Frodo.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth 2</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">EA LA followed up their Tolkien RTS with a superior sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/03/03/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii-review">The Battle for Middle-earth 2</a>. Like the first game, you can choose between a Good or Evil single-player campaign. The former’s story is centered on the Elf Glorfindel, who allies himself with the Dwarves to defend Rivendell from Sauron. Meanwhile, in the Evil campaign, Sauron sends his commander, the Mouth of Sauron, and the Nazguls to invade the North.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to the first game, players raise armies consisting of infantry, bowmen, pikemen, cavalry, and siege machines and command them using characters from The Lord of the Rings. The sequel also adds even more factions, including Goblins, Dwarves, and Elves, for a total of six factions. It’s the better game of the two Battle for Middle-earths by far, but sadly, neither is available to buy today thanks to EA losing the Lord of the Rings licence, and even owners of the old physical editions cannot battle online as online servers were shuttered in 2010.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Lego The Lord of the Rings</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the Hobbit game we’ve previously spoken about, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/26/lego-the-lord-of-the-rings-review">Lego The Lord of the Rings</a> is TT’s brickified adaptation of the original trilogy of movies directed by Peter Jackson. And if you’re only going to play one of them, this is the one you <em>want</em> to play. You can play as any of the 80+ available characters in Lego form, from Frodo and Aragorn to Lurtz and Tom Bombadil, all while running, jumping, and building your way through the events of the superior Tolkien film trilogy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lego games usually live or die depending on which popular franchise they're adapting, and TT had a great foundation in the vast, varied world of The Lord of the Rings. There’s something particularly charming about seeing Middle-earth brought to life in Lego form, which makes it  easy to recommend to any fan. Do you like The Lord of the Rings? Do you like Legos? Do you like fun platformers? Boom, one of the best Lord of the Rings games ever.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Back during the era of official movie tie-ins in the early 2000s, , EA published a couple of hack-and-slash games based on The Lord of the Rings films where you took control of members of the Fellowship and made your way through the key events, leaving a pile of orc corpses in your wake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Gauntlet-like gameplay suited the fantasy swords-and-sorcery battles of The Lord of the Rings well, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/04/lord-of-the-rings-return-of-the-king-review">The Return of the King</a> was especially notable for its inclusion of local co-op, allowing you to form your own mini-Fellowship and go through the adventure together. Using actual scenes from the Peter Jackson movie to serve as cutscenes (a benefit unlocked thanks to the PS2’s DVD drive) and gameplay that captured the scale of the films’ battles, Return of the King was head and shoulders above many official tie-in games released at this time. But it didn’t quite beat its own predecessor… </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/10/21/lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers-2">The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</a> and The Return of the King are very similar games built on the same hack-and-slash foundations, and so your favorite of the two is largely up to personal preference. Which scene from the movies do you most want to experience? For our money, the Helm’s Deep level in The Two Towers is among the very best moments in any Lord of the Rings video game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, you’ll find many of The Two Towers’ key moments re-created here (as well as a few from The Fellowship of the Ring, too.) But the real joy is found in taking control of  one of the members of the Fellowship themselves. Whether it’s the hack-and-slash sword combat of Aragorn, the speedy ranged bow attacks of Legolas, or the heavy axe swings of Gimli, The Two Towers’ combo-heavy combat felt as good as any action game released in the early 2000s. Throw in amazing visuals taken straight from the movies, and The Two Towers is a standard-bearer for official movie tie-in games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Middle-earth: Shadow of War</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously mentioned, complications around the rights to The Lord of the Rings have led to a variety of restrictions. The Middle-earth: Shadow games, though, were developed during a time when Warner Bros. had the rights to both Tolkien’s works and Peter Jackson’s movies, which meant developer Monolith Productions was able to take inspiration from the wider universe detailed in the <em>legendarium</em>, the lore bible that The Lord of the Rings is built on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/05/middle-earth-shadow-of-war-review">Shadow of War</a>, the second game in the series, goes to some unusual places because of that freedom. It involves figures like Shelob (here depicted as a woman, rather than a spider, because of lore reasons) and the never-before-seen Entwives, and ties protagonist Talion’s fate directly into the story of the Ringwraiths. Shadow of War’s overly complicated story, with its convoluted attempts to tie its world to the movies, is the reason why many have the sequel ranked below its predecessor when it comes to Monolith’s two Middle-earth games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But story isn’t everything. Shadow of War features a much larger, more varied world than its scorched brown predecessor, allowing you to explore more of Middle-earth. The same fantastic combat and, of course, the Nemesis system, all return from the first game, but they’re bolstered by a fortress siege system that captures the epic scale of iconic battles such as Helm’s Deep (albeit you’re fighting alongside an amassed army of brainwashed orcs, rather than men and elves.) All this helps skyrocket Shadow of War towards the top of our rankings, beaten only by its fantastic predecessor.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Set between the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/26/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a> sees the Gondorian Ranger Talion bond with the wraith of Celebrimbor, the elf who unwittingly aided Sauron forge the Rings of Power. Together, they go on a journey through the depths of Mordor to get revenge on Sauron’s generals who murdered Talion’s family. With fewer ties to the movies than in the sequel, Shadow of War, Shadow of Mordor tells a more cohesive story of revenge in Middle-earth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the true star of Shadow of Mordor is Monolith’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-warner-bros-shut-down-shadow-of-mordor-developer-monolith-and-canceled-wonder-woman-fans-lament-the-wasted-potential-of-its-nemesis-system">patented Nemesis system</a>. Every Orc in Shadow of Mordor is unique to your playthrough, each given a random design, traits, and name. But beyond just procedurally generating an army of unique foes for you to kill, the Nemesis System shifts and changes each Uruk’s relationship with both you and their peers depending on how you interact with them. If one kills you in combat, for example, they will get promoted for their valiant deed and will bring up their victory the next time you encounter them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This system, combined with the satisfying, Batman Arkham-style combat and a story that isn’t just a retread of Peter Jackson’s movies, easily makes Shadow of Mordor our favorite Lord of the Rings game of all time. Sadly, Monolith Productions was shut down in 2025, and so we’ll likely never see another Shadow game, nor the Nemesis System again. And so the two Middle-earth games serve as a proud legacy for this departed studio.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With a new line of The Lord of the Rings movies on their way, as well as the ongoing Rings of Power TV show on Prime Video, there will likely be even more Tolkien games coming in the future. Next up is the cozy game Tales of the Shire from Fictions and Weta Workshop, which will deliver an entirely different video game take on Tolkien’s world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-11-best-lord-of-the-rings-video-games]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review.1250955/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve played over 120 hours of Super Mario Party Jamboree since I reviewed it on Nintendo Switch last October. I loved it from the jump – giving it a 9 in my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review"><u>original review</u></a> – and it’s continued to be a top choice on game nights with family and friends. So I was thrilled when Nintendo revealed that this would be one of the first Switch 1 games to get a Switch 2 expansion, thinking an upgraded version with great mouse control minigames and interesting new ways to party would be a total slam dunk. Unfortunately, Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV is just as sloppy as its overly wordy title, with a handful of problems stemming from the frustrating decision to completely separate its new and old content. The fantastic base game is still hidden underneath a pile of annoying choices, but it’s tough to recommend the Switch 2 Edition as the clear, definitive version of the best Mario Party there’s ever been. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before I get into the major differences between Jamboree on Switch 1 and Switch 2, I highly recommend you <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review"><u>check out my original review from last year</u></a> if you’re looking for in-depth thoughts on the base game, because it all holds true. Super Mario Party Jamboree itself is still an amazing time, with fantastic boards and items that emphasize strategy more than ever before, a great selection of minigames that features returning classics and new favorites, and a gorgeous presentation and attention to detail that elevate the whole package. I’ve been playing Mario Party pretty much my entire life, and now that I’ve had it for almost a year, I can definitively say that Jamboree is my favorite entry in the series. If you don’t own it at all, I can’t recommend the Switch 1 version enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, with that all said, that doesn’t mean the Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV is worth the upgrade. This new version is essentially an <em>entirely unaltered port</em> of the Switch 1 release with the Jamboree TV expansion glued on. When you first boot it up, the menu will look familiar to anyone who’s played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review"><u>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury</u></a>: You select between Super Mario Party Jamboree (complete with a Switch 1 icon in the top left, indicating this is just the old game and nothing more, not even a resolution bump) and Jamboree TV, which displays a Switch 2 icon and actually makes use of the new tech. The difference between this and 3D World’s expanded version, however, is that 3D World and Bowser’s Fury are wholly unique games that make sense to separate, while these two share a majority of their content but differ in strange, limiting ways. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Mouse, Camera, Action!</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Jamboree TV is where all of the new minigames and modes that take advantage of the Switch 2’s hardware live. The clear highlight is the set of 14 new minigames that use the Joy-Con 2’s mouse controls. Switch 2’s mouse controls may not be comfortable for extended periods of time, but they work super well in the context of a 45-second Mario Party minigame, and I was surprised by how much I loved the entire lineup. Highlights include Stuffie Stacker, where you work with a partner to build the tallest tower possible out of blocks and Yoshi plushies, and the chaotic Goomba Scoopas, where you drive a snow plow to frantically shove piles of Goombas into your team’s gate. Playing with mouse controls means everyone has to use a single Switch 2 Joy-Con instead of a pair or a Pro Controller, but with the improved, larger design over the original Joy-Con, it feels like less of a concession and more of a legitimate option this time. Every mouse minigame is 2v2, which adds a ton of variety to the lineup of team games that appear in Mario Party mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of which, Jamboree TV adds two great rulesets to try out alongside the original that put fun spins on the classic dice-rolling action. The first is Tag-Team Rules, which pits two teams of two against each other. Every player still takes their own turn, but each pair shares the same pool of stars, coins, and items, so you need to work together on every decision to come out on top. It’s a fun way to shake up the traditional format and it builds even further upon the strategic foundation of the base game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Jamboree TV's clear highlight is the new minigames that use mouse controls.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I also love the new Frenzy Rules as a fast-paced way to fit a whole game of Mario Party in without it taking upwards of 90 minutes. Frenzy games only last five turns – or roughly 30 minutes – and each player starts out with 50 coins, a Double Dice, and even a star. Every roll and minigame feels crucial when you only have five turns to set yourself apart from the pack, and this is an exciting mode I never knew I wanted. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, it’s a shame Jamboree TV doesn’t add any new boards to the mix, instead focusing on side modes that are pretty forgettable. Carnival Coaster is a cooperative mode where you use mouse controls in an on-rails shooter, completing team minigames as you go to add more time to the clock. I play Mario Party to compete, not cooperate, and it starts to feel repetitive after just a couple of runs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Bowser Live uses the Switch 2’s built-in microphone and optional camera in an attempt to put <em>you </em>into the game. You enter Bowser’s lair and pop out of a warp pipe and – if you have a camera plugged in – see a live image of yourself. You then compete in completely controller-free minigames where you stack Goombas on your head or just literally scream into the microphone as loud as you can to score points.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Party Jamboree Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve known since the days of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/04/03/wario-ware-snapped-review"><u>WarioWare: Snapped!</u></a> that minigames control better with an actual controller than with a camera or microphone, and Bowser Live doesn’t do anything to change that truth. A microphone minigame where you clap to the beat, for example, is so much less precise than the Donkey Konga minigame where you do the same thing but with actual buttons. As a result, the appeal wears off after just a couple of minutes, and at my most cynical, it feels like a tacked-on mode designed to sell Switch 2 cameras and nothing more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jamboree TV in general makes use of the Switch 2’s ability to use a camera, as live feeds of you and your friends’ faces are visible throughout the party – although you don’t need a camera to access these modes and can play everything but Bowser Live without missing out on any content. I guess it’s a nice novelty and kids might like seeing themselves or their parents on the TV, but it’s not something I ever see myself using outside of testing it for this review.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>A Tale of Two Parties</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though some of the new content is worthwhile, things get really frustrating when you consider <em>how </em>Jamboree and Jamboree TV split up their content. As I mentioned, the Jamboree side of the fence is a straight port of the Switch 1 game, which means there’s no mouse control minigames, camera functionality, or option to do the Frenzy and Tag-Team Rules. That wouldn’t be a problem if the Jamboree TV side of things was an outright replacement and included everything Jamboree has to offer, but it’s inexplicably missing a ton of content from the Switch 1 side.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jamboree TV completely lacks Pro Rules, which was one of Jamboree’s best additions. It reduces luck and focuses on strategy, and I praised it in my original review. Here, it’s <em>only </em>available on the Switch 1 side, and so are all of Jamboree’s original side modes – that’s Koopathlon, Bowser Kaboom Squad, Paratroopa Flight School, Toad’s Item Factory, Rhythm Kitchen, the single-player campaign Party Planning Trek, and every mode in Minigame Bay besides Free Play. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan Ranks Every Mario Party</h3><p>I reviewed Super Mario Party Jamboree, and it's my new favorite in the series. Here's my ranking of all 18 games -- that's a lot of parties.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">More importantly, Jamboree TV lacks all of Jamboree’s achievements, customization, and unlockables. In the Switch 1 version, you have to earn Party Points to buy additional stickers and finish achievements to unlock three of the boards, but Jamboree TV just gives you everything right from the start, taking away the fun sense of progression and incentive to play single-player that I really valued. It also means if you’re buying this new on Switch 2, you’ll have everything unlocked in Jamboree TV, but nothing unlocked in Jamboree, which is just odd. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s stranger is that these two sides don’t talk to each other whatsoever: If you’re playing Jamboree TV and do something that would normally earn you an achievement over in Jamboree, nothing happens and the Switch 1 version doesn’t recognize it at all when you return there until you do it again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another example is minigame records. My group and I love to chase high scores in minigames – whether in Free Play or during a Mario Party game itself – but Jamboree TV doesn’t track records <em>at all. </em>Did you get a new crazy high score on the button-mashing Domination? Switch 1 Jamboree will congratulate you with the iconic “New Record!” sound effect and display that score until someone else beats it, while Switch 2’s Jamboree TV won’t track it anywhere.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>More than half of this is an unchanged Switch 1 game with zero performance updates. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even worse, the Switch 1 side didn’t receive <em>any </em>performance or resolution updates to take advantage of the new hardware. Jamboree TV runs in 1440p docked, but Jamboree is 1080p docked and still a noticeable <em>720p </em>handheld, which was the maximum resolution of the Switch 1 screen. Nintendo is charging $80 for the Switch 2 Edition at launch, when more than half of it is quite literally an unchanged Switch 1 game. And while it’s only $20 for the upgrade if you already own it, I’m still not sure that’s worth the compromised way this expansion works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you want to play Pro Rules with the enhanced resolution? It’s simply not possible. How about include the mouse control minigames while still working toward achievements? You can’t do that, either. It also takes so long to swap between the two versions that you’re better off just closing the software altogether and rebooting: the staff credits roll <em>every time </em>you leave TV, but at least they’re skippable. One of my favorite things about Jamboree is how many choices it gives you to make your Mario Party experience exactly what you want it to be, but Jamboree + Jamboree TV has entirely lost that graceful design just nine months later unless you only stick to the unaltered base game, which defeats the entire purpose of upgrading. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The next PS5 system update is coming soon, and it adds a new wireless controller-pairing feature, while Sony also discussed a "Power Saver" mode that's coming later.</p><p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/?sf278016696=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Sony said the DualSense controller and other PS5 peripherals were designed to support PC, Mac, and mobile devices, and the new update makes it easier to pair controllers to multiple devices simultaneously. This should make it "easier to switch between them without needing to pair each time," Sony said.</p><p>With the update, players can pair up to four devices simultaneously. Currently, users have to pair each time they connected a controller to a different device. As an example, Sony said you'll be able to take your paired DualSense controller and "seamlessly" switch to PC or a smartphone.</p><p>Below you can find instructions on how to pair a DualSense controller to multiple devices and how to switch between them. The instructions were written by Sony.</p><h3><strong>How to pair a DualSense controller to multiple devices:</strong></h3><ol><li>Make sure the light bar and player indicator on your controller is off. If they're turned on, press and hold the PS button until they turn off.</li><li>Press and hold one of the action buttons (triangle, circle, cross, or square) and the PS button for over 5 seconds. The light bar and player indicator flash two times.</li><li>Turn on Bluetooth on your device, and select the option to add Bluetooth devices. Your device detects nearby Bluetooth devices.</li><li>Select your controller from the detected devices. The light bar lights up, and the player indicator’s lights blink according to the slot number.</li></ol><h3><strong>How to switch between devices:</strong></h3><ol><li>Turn on the device you want to connect to.</li><li>Press and hold one of the action buttons and the PS button for about 3 seconds. When the light bar and player indicator blink, release both buttons. The light bar lights up, and the player indicator’s lights blink according to the slot number.</li></ol><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4537149-screenshot2025-07-23at9.12.42am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537149" data-ratio="0.32657417289221" data-width="1874" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4537149-screenshot2025-07-23at9.12.42am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537149"></a><figcaption>Four slots are available.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4537149-screenshot2025-07-23at9.12.42am.png"></figure><p>As for the Power Saver mode, this is a new mode that allows select PS5 games to "run with lower power consumption" to help "reduce environmental impact." This is part of Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/gm_en.html" rel="nofollow ">"Road to Zero" environmental plan</a> that aims to achieve "net-zero greenhouse gas emissions" by 2040.</p><p>With Power Saver mode enabled, select PS5 games will "scale back performance" to help the PS5 system reduce power consumption. As for what the scaled back performance will be, Sony said VR mode and "some gameplay features" may be limited in Power Saver mode.</p><p>"We'll share more details on this new option as we get closer to launch, including supported PS5 games and estimated impact, so stay tuned," Sony said.</p><p>For its part, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-facing-new-criticisms-over-xbox-one-ener/1100-6426634/" data-ref-id="1100-6426634">launched an energy-saving mode for Xbox more than 10 years ago.</a> An <a href="https://www.cnet.com/science/features/ps5-xbox-series-x-and-the-climate-crisis-facing-next-gen-video-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigation from CNET in 2020</a> found that Sony and Microsoft made progress in improving energy efficiency with the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but energy use in the newest games was "significantly higher than the previous generation."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>, the much-anticipated 4v4 fighting game, is headed to Evo next month. At Vegas, attendees will be able to play it for the first time, and watch a gameplay deep-dive panel in person.</p>
<p>Marvel Tokon, the upcoming four-character tag fighter from Arc System Works and Sony Interactive Entertainment, currently has six characters in this soon-to-be playable build. Attendees will be able to select from these characters to form their squad.</p>
<p>The panel itself - which is likely the most important aspect of Marvel Tokon's presence at Evo, for those keen to know more about the game - is set to take place at 8pm ET, on the 1st August. That's 5pm PT, or 1am BST/2am CEST on 2nd August. Those not at the show will be able to watch it online.</p>

            <p>Sony is getting ready to launch a PlayStation 5 system update in beta, which includes simultaneous DualSense wireless controller pairing across multiple devices (personally, hallelujah to this).</p>
<p>The PlayStation maker notes that many of its peripherals, such as the DualSense and DualSense Edge wireless controllers, are made to support devices including PC, Mac, and mobile as well as its own PS5 console. This compatibility "creates a more flexible and seamless gaming experience," PlayStation said.</p>
<p>But there's always been a bit of snag, shall we call it, when it comes to connecting a DualSense controller to more than one device. In fact, you can't do it right now, and instead have to pair the controller with a new device any time you want to use it elsewhere. It isn't the end of the world by any means, but it does take up time that we could use for other things, like starting a game straight away.</p>

<p>Thankfully, PlayStation understands the current way of doing things isn't the most streamlined, and its new beta update will allow participants to register up to four devices simultaneously which can then be switched between. "For example, you can take your controller which you use with your PS5, then seamlessly switch connection to a PC to play PC games, or connect it to a smartphone to enjoy Remote Play from your PS5. With this enhanced flexibility, you can enjoy gaming more freely across multiple devices," it explained.</p>
<p>Controllers can be paired by pressing a combination of the PS button and one of the action buttons (triangle, circle, cross, or square), which assigns a device to a chosen "slot". Once devices are registered, users can switch between them by pressing the PS button and the corresponding action button. The light bar will also light up, with the indicator's lights blinking according to the slot number.</p>
<p>Here's a table laying things out for you:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Slot number</th>
<th>Button used</th>
<th>Player indicator lights</th>
<th>Connected Device (Example)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slot 1</td>
<td>PS button and Triangle button</td>
<td>One light on</td>
<td>PS5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slot 2</td>
<td>PS button and Circle button</td>
<td>Two lights on</td>
<td>PS5 Pro</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slot 3</td>
<td>PS button and Cross button</td>
<td>Three lights on</td>
<td>Windows PC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slot 4</td>
<td>PS button and Square button</td>
<td>Four lights on</td>
<td>iPhone</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Beta access for this new feature is, for now, limited to invited participants. However, Sony will be rolling it out globally "in the coming months", so stay tuned. Personally, I am very much looking forward to it.</p>
<p>You can find full details about the simultaneous pairing update, as well as information on a new mode for games known as Power Saver, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/?sf278016696=1">via the PlayStation Blog</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-system-update-will-finally-add-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed that it intends to undergo a major internal restructuring into new units called "Creative Houses", following disappointing first-quarter financial results for the company.</p>

<p>As part of its latest <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5wMXD5U7aP5imdxB186rmg/d3ffd32ed3c2821d7e89d3c48d0ade35/Ubisoft_FY26_Q1_Sales_EN_vf.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial statement</a>, Ubisoft says these "Creative Houses" will help to "enhance quality, focus, autonomy, and accountability" across the company. The new entity Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft--report-new-gaming-entity-core-ip" rel="nofollow">created earlier this year</a> to shepherd its core IP will serve as the first Creative House, but we don't know what the others will be yet.</p>

<p>In terms of financials, Ubisoft reported a 3.9% drop in sales when compared to the previous year, as well as a 2.9% drop in net bookings. The studio blames "a lower-than-expected performance for&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>", as well as "a partnership that is now expected to materialize in Q2".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rainbow-six-siege-ubisoft-financials-reorganization.jpg?itok=Ac_wXmMA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rainbow-six-siege-ubisoft-financials-reorganization.jpg?itok=lAS_EreS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft blames&nbsp;<em>Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp;</em>for its poor first-quarter results.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite these underwhelming figures, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot reveals that recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-circana-march-2025-sales" rel="nofollow">tentpole release</a>&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>now has "more than 5 million unique players". Presumably, that translates to sales as well, given that the game isn't available on subscription services.</p>

<p>This performance, Ubisoft says, is "in line with expectations", so while the game hasn't been disappointing, it also hasn't exceeded Ubisoft's predictions. The studio also looks forward to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-dlc-2" rel="nofollow">release of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>on Switch 2</a>, which it expects will help the game "reach a broader audience".</p>

<p>It hasn't been the best couple of years for Ubisoft. In May, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible" rel="nofollow">released its summary</a> for the preceding fiscal year, which showed that both sales and profits were down compared to the previous year despite the release of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>.</p>

<p>Prior to that, in December last year, Ubisoft announced it would&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">shut down the live-service shooter&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">XDefiant</a>&nbsp;</em>and close two of its studios, with the French gaming outfit going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">close another location in January</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutdown-reorganization.jpg?itok=m-k6Xl8D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutdown-reorganization.jpg?itok=QY_pKjgK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft shut down its live-service shooter&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>in February.</figcaption></figure><p>Aside from the aforementioned Switch 2 release of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, it must be said that Ubisoft's release slate is looking a little barren for the next few months, so I wouldn't be surprised if the studio registers another drop in the second quarter. We'll have to wait and see what happens.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1947717804364353641" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, 1047 acknowledges that&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-1-0-release-date" rel="nofollow">"launched too early"</a>, and that in releasing the game, the studio "bit off more than [it] could chew", making <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"boneheaded mistakes"</a> along the way.</p>

<p>As a result,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will be "going back to beta", 1047 says, which means that "major parts" of the shooter will be rebuilt "to capture the spirit of what made&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>special".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splitgate-2-beta-layoffs-rework.jpg?itok=rQ5j7Fn6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splitgate-2-beta-layoffs-rework.jpg?itok=TnZ4toCq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>is going back to the beta drawing board, so to speak.</figcaption></figure><p>While in its new beta period,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s progression will be reworked, more portals will be added to its maps, and monetization will be simplified, according to 1047 Games. Not only that, but the studio will be "refocusing on classic game modes" the community has "been asking for".</p>

<p>As part of "rebuilding the core experience" of&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>, which 1047 Games says is not a "quick fix", the studio says it'll be laying off employees to "shift [its] resources to focus" on the rework. 1047 Games doesn't state how many employees will be losing their jobs.</p>

<p>The studio does, however, say that it intends to "retain as many team members as possible", and that as a result of doing so, the servers for the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>will be shut down next month. As a reminder, updates for that game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-updates-ending-as-1047-focuses-on-new-project" rel="nofollow">ended back in September 2022</a>.</p>

<p>If you're an avid&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>player, however, you'll be pleased to know 1047 says it's "exploring the possibility of supporting offline or peer-to-peer matches", so while nothing has been decided yet, it's not necessarily over for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>.</p>




<p>Despite dropping back into beta,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>isn't going away; it'll still be available to play, and Chapter 3 will be released as planned. However, it sounds like more big updates won't be released until&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>is ready for release (again).</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010012" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/splitgate-2/9pf5q1b0fhsl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

            <p>Riot's spin-off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting game</a> with the terrible name, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-l">2XKO</a>, is getting a closed beta in a few months and, to entice fans to sign up, the developers have released a new video showing off pink-haired <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League Of Legends</a> bruiser Vi doing some biffing. I know you like biffing, so I'm telling you about this despite being unable to reliably write the title of this free-to-play wrecker without carefully typing it out like my mum composing an email with a single forefinger. </p>

<p>"2XKO’s Closed Beta starts September 9, available globally on PC," said Riot in <a href="https://x.com/Play2XKO/status/1947686336020025842">a press release on social media</a>. "After Closed Beta begins, our goal is to keep the game online, outside of any necessary maintenance. This is a huge step for us. We’ll be deploying our backend systems at a larger scale for the first time, so things might be bumpy at first, but we’ll improve as we go."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/beta/">sign up here</a> if you are eager to batter Vi for all her baffling choices in Arcane's disappointingly disjointed second season. The beta will only happen on PC, so feel free to be a smug wretch to your long-suffering Xbox friends, although Riot do say that any progression made on PC will cross over to console if you decide to play on multiple platforms.</p>

<p>2KXO was-- excuse me, I mean 2OXK was - sorry, 2XOK was... FUCK. The fighting game formerly known as Project L was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-confirm-fighting-game-in-development">revealed during the EVO fighting game championship in 2019</a>, even though rumours and leaks outed the game not too long after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rising-thunder-cancelled">Riot bought Rising Thunder developer Radiant Entertainment</a> way back in 2016. The game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riots-fighting-game-project-l-finally-gets-a-name-but-not-a-good-one">given its untypeable moniker</a> last year, on the logic that it is a tag-team fighter in which you field 2x brawlers, and that those 2x brawlers will presumably KO somebody. 2... X... K... O, see? </p>
<p>I know. I hate it too. But if you're legitimately interested in the game's ins and outs, Riot have <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/whats-new-in-alpha-lab-2/">an admittedly thorough breakdown of a previous alpha</a> which shows various features, including how the tag team assists will work, as well as clues to how battle-passy things will get when it comes to unlocking cosmetics. This is something that will be interesting to witness, because cosmetics in a fighting game need to be interesting without obscuring or distracting from the clarity of the action. Will I be able to dress up as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dressing-up-as-santa-in-tekken-7-and-visiting-players">a cleanly defined Santa</a>, for example? Only time will tell.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/league-of-legends-fighting-spin-off-2xko-dangles-vi-in-front-of-fans-alongside-a-closed-beta]]></content:encoded>

                <p>According to one gaming analyst, the best-selling new PlayStation 5 game based on copies sold is Microsoft's Forza Horizon 5. Microsoft launched the game on PS5 at the end of March this year, and it recently eclipsed 3 million copies sold on PS5 to become the console's best-selling game of 2025, according to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/forza-horizon-5-is-now-2025s-top?just_subscribed=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Alinea</a>. </p><p>The research company said the recent sale on Forza Horizon 5 on PS5, which brought the price down to $45, helped the game surpass 3 million sales on Sony's platform.</p><p>Alinea added that Forza Horizon 5 is a juggernaut on Xbox, reaching more than 45 million players on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S through sales and Game Pass downloads. The game is reportedly performing well on Steam, too, reaching 6.5 million copies sold, Alinea said.</p><p>The company further predicted that the inevitable Forza Horizon 6 will launch on PS5 on day one. Microsoft has not announced any new Forza Horizon games, however.</p><p>Alinea's report went on to claim that the PS5 and Steam versions of Forza Horizon 5 have generated nearly $400 million in revenue. The research firm said Microsoft's ongoing strategy to release its games on other platforms is part of the company's transition "from a console platform holder to a third-party publisher."

            <p>Obsidian surprised us by announcing a sequel to shrunken-player backyard survival game Grounded earlier this summer. We assumed that Grounded, released in 2022 after two years in early access, had more years of live development ahead of it, which is often the case for multiplayer survival games like it. But that was never apparently the intention for Grounded.</p>
<p>Executive producer Marcus Morgan told me in an interview that Obsidian always intended Grounded to have a beginning, a middle and an end. "When we began Grounded 1, there was always this idea that there would be a close to Grounded 1," he said. "Obviously there's survival games like Ark, which are kind of ever expanding, or Minecraft, which are big platforms that are expanding. But a lot of our touch-points for Grounded 1 came from The Forest or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>. So when we were making Grounded 1, we knew there would be a beginning and a middle and an end to the game, in terms of the story we wanted to tell."</p>
<p>The unexpected success of Grounded shook these plans a little - "it took off way more than we could have ever imagined," he said - but an end to the story did eventually come, at which point the studio knew it wanted to do more but also knew it couldn't realise the ideas within the game's existing framework.</p>

<p>Mainly, Obsidian wanted to implement mounts, or "buggies" as Obsidian is now calling them - insects like ants that you can ride around on. "The reason we didn't actually have [mounts] in Grounded 1 was because the world and the space wasn't designed to actually have mounts," Morgan explained to me. To enable them, then, Obsidian moved the playing space from a confined backyard to a much larger park, while also taking the new-game opportunity to move to Unreal Engine 5 and implement other feature ideas as well.</p>
<p>I'm currently playing Grounded 2 ahead of its 29th July early access release so I'll tell you more about those new ideas and how successful, or not, they are when the embargo lifts on the same day. But to return to my point: that beginning, middle and end structure has remained - it has carried over to Grounded 2. In fact, Obsidian not only knows where it could end but where, excitingly, a third game could follow on from it.</p>
<p>While talking about the original plan for Grounded, Morgan said this: "At first it was like, 'We'll just make Grounded.' There's not the, 'Well maybe we'll have a trilogy.' Like, we hope, but that's not where we started." I pressed him on this mention of a trilogy and he said, "That was just me speaking aspirationally."</p>

<p>Then he added: "I don't know whether or not it's Grounded 2 or a Grounded trilogy, but I will say we absolutely have ideas and stories and expansions and features that we would want to go for. Whether that continues to expand Grounded 2 or whether that is going to Grounded 3... I want to start with Grounded 2 because that's not even launched yet and I've got to get my mind around that. But we do have more, there's more in our hearts and souls, even beyond where we see Grounded 2 going throughout early access. We do have more that we hope people want to see and play. It's in our hearts."</p>
<p>Another surprising thing about Grounded 2's development is that it's been shared. Grounded 1 was made entirely at Obsidian, but Grounded 2 has been co-developed with Embracer-owned studio Eidos Montreal. Morgan told me Obsidian sought the partnership, being, as it was, rather busy making both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2, which are both 2025 games.</p>
<p>"We knew we wanted to make Grounded 2 and we knew we were going to need help expanding and building on that," he said, "so we actually went out, like, 'Okay, where can we go find co-development help that shares similar sensibilities and has a passion and a love for the game?' There wasn't a lot of pressure or rush for it, we just wanted to find the right partner." And Eidos was apparently it.</p>
<p>There are actually more people working on Grounded 2 at Eidos than at Obsidian, he said, but assured me that "a significant number of people" are working on the game at Obsidian, including the original Grounded team, and that the project was being led from there.</p>

<p>"I know this is gonna sound corny but sincerely it is a cooperative way of developing things," he said. We, as Obsidian, as the creators of the IP, obviously have a very strong point of view about 'what is Grounded' and what fits, what doesn't. There's some weighting on our side in the same way that when we used to make games for other folks, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> or [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a> 2], there were the IP holders there.</p>
<p>"But Eidos has been empowered a lot and also just brings a lot to the table with regards to their ownership and filling the game, so I would say it's shared. I don't know if we really think about it as who's officially in charge? Like, if you wanted to put a stamp on it, it's Obsidian, because it's our game. But Eidos is just as much of an owner and just as much of a contributor to it. We are just one team. We might be in two different studios but we're the Grounded team. That's how we do it."</p>
<p>Grounded 2 will launch in early access on 29th July, at which point, I'll be able to share fuller thoughts on the game. Note that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-going-anywhere-if-people-still-want-to-play-it-as-grounded-2-gets-ready-to-launch-obsidian-promises-its-not-the-end-of-the-road-for-the-original-game">Grounded 1 will continue to exist even when this game comes out</a>, by the way - Obsidian is a big believer in game preservation and has no plans to sunset that older game. Content updates will stop, but maintenance will continue.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-could-grow-into-a-trilogy-and-there-are-already-ideas-that-could-fill-a-potential-grounded-3]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The return of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> to iOS in the UK is "uncertain", Epic has claimed, as it's unable to bring the Epic Games Store to iOS this year, "if ever".</p>
<p>That's because the CMA, the UK's competition regulator, has "deprioritised store competition entirely", following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">lengthy legal battle between Epic and Apple</a>.</p>
<p>The CMA has today released two roadmaps for possible measures to improve competition in mobile ecosystems for both Apple and Google. However, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/the-cma-s-roadmap-doesn-t-open-the-mobile-app-ecosystem-to-competition-in-the-uk">Epic has claimed in a statement</a> the regulator is "choosing not to prioritise opening the mobile ecosystem to alternative app stores this year".</p>

<p>It continued: "This is a missed opportunity to introduce competition into a currently-monopolised market and unlock economic growth and consumer choice. Four years after concluding that the App Store and Google Play Store are parallel monopolies the CMA has done nothing to allow competing stores.</p>
<p>"A free market requires multiple stores competing to offer consumers the best prices and services. If you don't have competing stores, the one store that is a state-sanctioned monopoly will use its control to extract all the value from the market at the expense of all creators who cannot compete, and consumers who can't choose the best deal among competing stores."</p>
<p>In May this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-finally-back-on-apple-devices-in-us-and-europe">Fortnite finally returned to Apple devices in the US and Europe</a> after a five-year legal battle over store competition.</p>
<p>However, following Brexit, the UK has not been included, so the return of Fortnite won't be until at least next year.</p>

<p>"The CMA also made a vague announcement about allowing developers to steer customers to payment service outside of apps, without referencing the kinds of restrictions, obstructions and junk fees that Apple introduced in Europe to make a mockery of the Digital Markets Act," Epic added.</p>
<p>"Unless Apple and Google are completely blocked from imposing fees and discriminating against apps using out-of-app payment, we can expect years of malicious compliance ahead, and no genuine restoration of market competition."</p>
<p>Epic compared this "bleak news from the United Kingdom" to the stronger pro-competition actions of other regions.</p>
<p>"We hope the CMA will use its consultation process to re-examine these weak roadmap decisions and bring the benefits of genuine app store and payments competition to British consumers," it said.</p>

Not by a long shot, truth be told. And returning to the game for this <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a> edition (that's the last time I'm typing that out), I was a little worried that perhaps I'd gotten a bit excited. A 9?! Surely no.</p>
<p>Anyway. Long story short, and after several raucous hours spent refamiliarising myself with the core board-gaming aspects involved here...well, 2024 me was 100% right. Jamboree is absolutely excellent stuff, provided what you're looking for is fun, frantic, family-friendly entertainment that's full of surprises and activities to get everyone involved. Honestly, these Nintendo board game nights do be getting competitive lately.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157453/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For those who haven't yet played the game, there's a ton of content to dig into here, which helps justify the beefy Switch 2 price tag, whilst for those who're upgrading from the OG game, I reckon you're easily getting your money's worth for what is a highly entertaining addition to the core package.</p>
<p>So, let's start off with a brief recap of Super Mario Party Jamboree for those who've yet to play it. With a core party experience that's the best it's ever been in the series, this is a delightful thing to stick on of an evening with a bunch of pals or family members. The rules to the core board game are simple dice-based fare that anyone can follow, and the new Jamboree Buddy characters who pop out to aid you from time to time are a fun addition that kids love.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:172345 @ 1753277922 -->
<p>Rounds can be a little long, running up to around 90 minutes, but I stand by my opinion that they actually feel super quick when you're playing, as Nintendo has done a good job of keeping the momentum going with clever boards, minigames, and random aspects that keep everyone in with a fighting chance to the end. The final rounds of a match up the ante just enough to ensure you end on a high for the most part as well.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/super-mario-party-jamboree-all-boards-list-and-how-to-unlock">seven boards to play on</a>, most of which have moving parts such as trains and race cars to take into account, and extras such as Bowser's Kaboom squad (excellent), Kooplathon (messy, but still excellent) and a few other throwaway modes, you've got yourself a proper party to be getting on with.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157451/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are plenty of options for younger players to get involved, too, and you can even set handicaps to give kids - or anyone else who wants it - a boosted start in terms of points. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/super-mario-party-jamboree-all-minigames-list">minigames</a> in the base game are uniformly excellent, with a really nice mix of activities and game types that can be filtered, so you get to drop any you're not keen on. With local and online co-op and multiplayer, and a bunch of other modes thrown in for good measure, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/super-mario-party-jamboree">my review verdict of "best Mario Party yet"</a> holds true.</p>
<p>With this Jamboree TV addition for Switch 2, the changes to the vanilla game start as soon as you boot up, with a choice of the original or Jamboree TV to be made first of all. Jumping into the base game, nothing has changed, right down to — it seems — the crispness of the textures and resolution, as this older mode is slightly blurrier and not as slick as the newer addition. Which is a bit surprising, but does hammer home that this new content is a properly separate thing.</p>
<p>Digging into Jamboree TV itself, then, essentially it utilises the new features of the Switch 2 console (the camera, mic, and mouse, to be specific) to deliver a bunch of new game types housed in a flashy TV show format, which allows for new forms of silly fun.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157448/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Honestly, some of the biggest laughs I've had so far have come from just pulling faces and watching my kid's expressions as they appear out of green pipes in a studio full of Mushroom Kingdom folk. It's highly amusing, even before the actual minigames get started, and it's a superior way to present the party overall, to the extent I hope Nintendo stick with it going forward.</p>
<p>Of course, playing a minigame, especially if it's decent, is enjoyable enough as it is, but seeing your face above your chosen Nintendo avatar, seeing the reactions of your fellow players as they win, lose, or come a cropper really does add to the fun. It's not gonna be the same with randoms online, to be fair, but it's an exquisite thing when playing with your nearest and dearest, and that's what the Big N is really aiming at.</p>
<p>In terms of presentation, Jamboree TV gives a nice uplift to the resolution, clarity, and sharpness of image. The whole thing feels super-smooth and responsive in both docked and handheld modes, and I'm sure there are new volumetric lighting and reflection elements added across the boards here as it all looks much fancier than I remember, with reflective floors and all sorts of futuristic things like that.</p>

<p>Getting started with your Switch 2 camera (which I wasn't looking forward to because I'm lazy that way) is actually a breeze. Simply have it plugged in whilst the game is running and it'll whizz you and any other players through a quick setup which shows off how clever the new tech is - well, at least to me. Sit all your players within the frame of your single console camera and each detected face gets a little coloured circle which can be used to zoom and set everyone's face position individually. You don't even have to be sitting close to one another, particularly.</p>
<p>It's very quick and easy to get sorted, and the game then separates you out so that your faces can be used in interesting ways, such as recording and holding highlights and other things of this nature, all to give it a TV-show feel. I can imagine for people with long distances between family members, this could be a really great way to make things feel more involved when playing online. Which is nice!</p>
<p>Onto the new minigames, then, and there are a whole bunch of Mouse Mode and microphone-based activities to dig into. The mic stuff, which is made up of things like a rhythm game where you clap to the icons instead of the usual pushing of buttons, alongside some 'shouting games' (a new genre I just invented) — where you make loud noises to raise and lower a balloon, charge a car's turn boost, and so on — are fun, and even more fun when you realise you can say anything and don't have to stick to the words they use in-game.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157454/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, and I'm truly shocked to be saying this, it's actually the Mouse Mode stuff that's the real draw.</p>
<p>I totally didn't expect to enjoy using the mouse for minigames. It seemed like something that was going to really bother me, but as it turns out the likes of air hockey, bomb throwing, a mail sorting game, dominos, one of those electric-current type maze deals...they are, by and large, really good - and exactly the sort of thing that gets you laughing, especially when all your silly big faces are on the screen at the same time.</p>
<p>Is it going to revolutionise gaming? No, it is not, but I am having a great time anyway. These new ways of playing are fun, and they give you around 20 new games to add to an already huge collection from the OG release.</p>

<p>More interestingly in the long run, perhaps, are the new ways to play that are also included for Mario Party in Jamboree TV mode. Here you can choose from new Tag Team and Frenzy rulesets. Frenzy makes for shorter matches that get to the face-off and final run excitement quicker, whilst also adding lots more duels and ways to lose and gain coins quickly. Tag Team adds 'Together Dice' and 'Rally Spaces' alongside a few other wrinkles that see pairs collect and share coins, stars and items as they attempt to best another duo. It's all good stuff that serves to add plenty more life to an already jam-packed experience.</p>
<p>Apart from this (yes there's more!) you also get a Carnival Coaster mode which serves as a light-gun style shooter that's decent, and even better with a pal so that you can shoot out either side of your coaster cabin. You also have Bowser Live, which gives you a balancing game, coin collecting, and some very silly bits where you have to shout compliments at Bowser since it's his own evil version of the main Jamboree TV event. Again, it's all very throwaway, but also very fun, thanks to that camera and Joy-Con tech that nails both sound and motion inputs really well.</p>

<p>So, Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV (I copy and pasted), overall, is a fantastic addition to an already cracking party game. The price may be a little steep for new players, but this really is a huge package of family good times with all of this new stuff added. Still not quite the measure of a perfect 10/10 (although it's very, very close), this bumper package is easily the best Mario Party game Nintendo has given us thus far, and one of the most effortless ways to have a great time with family and friends on Switch 2.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV gives an already fantastic party game a huge shot in the arm, with a bunch of brilliant Mouse Mode and mic-based games that also allow you to see your big silly face as you play. It's all very knockabout, very easy to use, and very easy to enjoy.</p>
<p>With a huge base game packing seven boards and a whole bunch of modes, and the Switch 2's new tech adding to the fun in meaningful ways, this is a thoroughly delightful and totally family-friendly way to party Mushroom Kingdom-style.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-ps5-software-beta-makes-multi-device-dualsense-switching-easier.1250865/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a new PS5 system software update beta, and if you like to use your DualSense controller across other devices besides your console, then you're in luck.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the beta will start rolling out tomorrow. The main feature being introduced in this update is the ability to pair your DualSense with multiple devices, making it easier to switch between them whenever you like.</p>

<p>At the moment, if you want to switch from using your DualSense on your PS5 to using it on a PC, for instance, you need to pair the controller with the new machine every time you want to swap, but when the new update lands, that won't be the case anymore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-software-update-beta-dualsense-close-up.jpg?itok=rrVWxFet 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-software-update-beta-dualsense-close-up.jpg?itok=rXL7004g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you like to use your DualSense on other devices, the new PS5 system software beta is for you.</figcaption></figure><p>The new update will allow you to register your DualSense with up to four compatible devices at once, and all you need to do in order to switch from one device to another is press the PlayStation button and one of the face buttons.</p>

<p>Once you've assigned a device to one of the face buttons, switching to that device will show a different number of player indicator lights on your controller, corresponding to the device you have connected. It's that simple!</p>

<p>Of course, you can also continue to use your DualSense via wired USB connection if your device supports it as well, but it's nice to know that switching between wireless connections will get easier.</p>

<p>As well as the new DualSense switching feature, Sony has also revealed a new Power Saver feature as part of its Road to Zero <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/gm_en.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">environmental plan</a>. It won't be live in this update, but when it does arrive, you'll be able to cut performance in certain PS5 games in order to reduce power consumption.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-system-software-update-beta-console.jpg?itok=PFnruA7N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-system-software-update-beta-console.jpg?itok=Kf1MJb58 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS5 is getting a new Power Saver feature in future.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't yet know which games will support this feature, nor do we know when it'll land, but with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow">many</a>&nbsp;potentially&nbsp;demanding <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-ps5-version-late-2025" rel="nofollow">games</a> on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">horizon</a> in terms of performance, it's probably better for Power Saver to land sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>In any case, the new PS5 system software beta begins rolling out in certain territories tomorrow. We don't know when the full release is coming yet, so stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>Resident Evil is lurching back into theaters next year in a new film by Barbarian and Weapons director Zach Cregger. In an interview, Cregger spoke about how he grew up playing the Resident Evil games, and how that love for the Capcom franchise has guided his vision for this new film adaptation of it.</p><p>"I played all of the games. I played Resident Evil 4 a hundred times through. I'm obsessed with it. And so, I just want to tell a story that feels like it's honoring the experience you get when you play the games," Cregger said to <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/resident-evil-reboot-movie-zach-cregger-tease-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComicBook</a>. "I haven't seen the movies; that's just not my thing. But the games are my thing. That's just a playground I just love--I think the movie is going to rip."</p><p>All but one of the previous live-action Resident Evil films were directed by Paul WS Anderson. They were very loose adaptations of the games, remixing ideas from them with original storylines centered around Milla Jovovich's character of Alice. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-movie-director-says-hes-expecting-online-hate-and-heres-why/1100-6533133/" data-ref-id="1100-6533133">Cregger doesn't want to be slavishly obedient</a> to the lore of the games, but as he explained in a separate interview earlier this month, he isn't planning to break "any major rules" of the franchise with his spin on it. Overall, the director says that he just wants to "tell a story that just feels authentic to the experience you get when you play the games."</p><p>In the video game department, the next Resident Evil game is scheduled to be released in February 2026. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/" data-ref-id="1100-6532378">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> will see players travel back to the ruins of Raccoon City for a new survival-horror experience, and it'll be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. A mobile spin-off game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-newly-revealed-resident-evil-game-is-not-what-youd-expect/1100-6532940/" data-ref-id="1100-6532940">Resident Evil: Survival Unit</a> is also in development, and Cregger's Resident Evil film is targeting a September 18 release date next year.</p>
