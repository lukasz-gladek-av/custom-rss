<p>I love 4X games. I've tried other strategy game genres, but frankly, they don't stick if they're not first and foremost 4X games—at the heart of it, it must be about exploring, expanding, exploiting, and yes, exterminating.</p>
<p>I suspect that the first 4X game most people played was some entry in the Civilization franchise—though certainly, a select few played precursors dating back to text-based games in the 1970s.</p>
<p>But for me, the title that kicked off my obsession was <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fmaster_of_orion_1_2"><em>Master of Orion II</em></a> (<em>MOO2</em>)—a game that has you develop and build up planets across a simple galaxy map, researching speculative future technologies, and ultimately wiping out your opponents and claiming dominion over the known universe. (There are other victory conditions too, but that one is the most fun.)</p>
<p>There is something satisfying about making a couple thousand small choices that all add up to that galaxy map gradually changing color in your favor until the final cut scene plays, declaring you the true Master of Orion.</p>
<p>The games I love the most are the ones where you make decisions that compound over many, many hours to a long-term payoff. I'll take that over games with bite-sized, contained challenges and short play times any day. The deeper and longer the experience, the better the payoff can be. To me, that's ultimately what makes 4X games great. <em>MOO2</em> is no exception.</p>

<h2>Nostalgic but flawed</h2>
<p>That said, it's not a perfect game. It benefited from the lessons it could learn from more than a decade of 4X games before it, and its designers were clearly thinking about how to make it balanced and fun.</p>
<p>They just missed the mark sometimes. For example, a big part of the game is choosing perks that customize your empire from before the first turn. One of those perks is called "Creative," which allows you to learn multiple technologies at once rather than one at a time. It's pretty hard to imagine anyone consciously declining to choose that perk unless they're looking to make things a lot harder for themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-yoshi-touch-and-go">Last week</a>, we matched up a pair of covers for everyone's favourite dino, as we looked at a duo of designs for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/yoshi_touch_and_go">Yoshi Touch &amp; Go</a>. There's no polite way to put this: it was a blowout. The colourful North American and European design walked away with a staggering win, taking 83% of the vote and leaving the simplistic Japanese variant with the remaining 17%. <em>Yikes</em>.</p>
<p>This time, hot off the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">The New World of Steam</a>'s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam-has-been-delayed-until-2026">delay</a>, we're taking a look at the <em>last</em> Layton game to see the light of day: the catchily-titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/laytons_mystery_journey_katrielle_and_the_millionaires_conspiracy_-_deluxe_edition">Layton's Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires' Conspiracy - Deluxe Edition</a>. It's not the greatest Layton mystery by a long shot, but if we had known how long it would be until we got another series entry, perhaps we would have looked at it a little more fondly.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wtshmi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>
</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Well, let's do exactly that today, shall we? There are two covers to choose from this time, in a classic duel between East and West. So, let's get into it...</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:93248 @ 1759062435 -->
<h2>Europe / North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="809205d30a0c4"><a title="Layton's Mystery Journey - EU/NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/809205d30a0c4/laytons-mystery-journey-euna.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123265-laytons-mystery-journey-katrielle-and-the-millionaires-conspiracy-deluxe-edition">Level-5/LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Western box art borrows a lot from the DS/3DS Layton games, as far as formatting is concerned. Our titular hero stands centre stage, looking puzzled, while several of the in-game head-scratchers float around her. The brown background and frankly unruly title don't do much to draw the eye, but you've got to respect a bit of design cohesion — even if it's not quite as dramatic as some of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/04/poll-box-art-brawl-professor-layton-and-the-curious-village">earlier series entries</a>.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="38648b0f9c5d1"><a title="Layton's Mystery Journey - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38648b0f9c5d1/laytons-mystery-journey-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123265-laytons-mystery-journey-katrielle-and-the-millionaires-conspiracy-deluxe-edition">Level-5/LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now this is a swing in a different direction! Instead of following the puzzle focus of the West, the Japanese design instead puts its main ensemble front and centre. We like the dramatic poses that everyone seems to be striking, and Sherl slotting in around the corner logo is a nice touch.</p>
<p>There's not nearly enough top hats on display, though. Shame...</p>

<p>Here's everything announced</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Mojang aired its second major <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> Live broadcast of 2025 this weekend, and it was once again packed with all sorts of announcements and reveals. If you didn't catch it, here's the full rundown:</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>
</nav>
<h3 id="new-drop-the-copper-age-out-30th-september-2025">New Drop - The Copper Age (Out 30th September 2025)</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Many of you have already been testing features of this drop that changes up early-game tool and weapon progression, introduces the copper golem, shows off powered shelves (including the cheeky ways you’ve been using them), and more!</p>
<p>Even more exciting, you’ll be playing this game drop in just a few days. The Copper Age releases on September 30th. Prepare to download!</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:184677 @ 1759058722 -->
<h3 id="happy-ghast-music-video">Happy Ghast - Music Video</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>"Our last drop, Chase the Skies, brought loads of great features to Minecraft and the happy ghast continues to be a community favorite. We created a short video to celebrate just how adorable it really is."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="dragon-ball-z-dlc-is-coming-soon-to-minecraft">Dragon Ball Z DLC is "coming soon" to Minecraft</h3>
<figure data-uuid="cd0e1f120db7d"><a title="Minecraft" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cd0e1f120db7d/minecraft.large.jpg"></a></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>"You’ll be powering up Kamehamehas and throwing down Spirit Bombs in this new DLC – all about Dragon Ball Z! It will be releasing later this year, though a free Super Saiyan hair character creator item is available to download right now! This DLC has everything you can imagine (so long as you’re thinking about Dragon Ball-Z stuff) so check back soon for more details and have your Dragon Ball wish granted!"</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="new-underwater-mob-the-nautilus">New Underwater Mob - The Nautilus</h3>
<figure data-uuid="9a899ebbb2f8a"><a title="Minecraft" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a899ebbb2f8a/minecraft.large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The Nautilus (part of the "<a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/unveiling-mounts-of-mayhem">Mounts of Mayhem</a>" drop coming later this year) is the new underwater mob and makes it easier to build underwater. You can also tame it, ride it, and equip it with armour. Additionally, there's Zombie Nautilus with Drowned riding the new mob.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We introduce the nautilus, a rideable underwater mob that will have you exploring the depths like never before! You can even build from it, like our old friend the happy ghast, and deck it out in colorful armor. Deep sea exploration is still dangerous, but the new “Breath of the Nautilus” effect (which pauses your breath meter), as well as your increased maneuverability, will make things a bit less daunting."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="new-weapon-the-spear">New Weapon - The Spear</h3>

<p>Another "<a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/unveiling-mounts-of-mayhem">Mounts of Mayhem</a>" update will add spear and Zombie Horses (with spears). Here's a bit more about this new weapon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The spear – our first tiered weapon in quite some time. “Tiered” means you can craft it out of different materials, and each one will act in a slightly different way...You can jab with it or use the charge attack. But watch your timing - hold the charge attack for too long and your attacks will lose attributes and effectiveness. Just as exciting is the way that the spear’s damage is affected by your movement speed. Go faster (for example on a mount) and you’ll hit even harder!</p>

<p>60fps was an option, but the priority was stability</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Koei Tecmo and developer Omega Force have confirmed the upcoming Switch 2 release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> will run at a fixed but "stable" 30fps.</p>
<p>The game's director Tomohiko Sho shared this information with Famitsu this week, while explaining the reasoning behind this decision. The team could have hit 60fps, but there would have been a reduced number of soldiers, and the priority was to provide a stable experience.</p>
<p>Here's the translation (via RPG Site):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Switch 2 version will be fixed to 30 fps, and we are developing it with a priority on stable operations. It's good hardware, and if we reduced the number of soldiers to about the same amount as prior Warriors series entries, we could have gotten it running at 60 fps. Since this game will show a few thousands of characters, I think it would be better if you can play here with a stable 30 fps."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If we hear any developments or updates about the performance of this title on the Switch 2 ahead of its January 2026 launch, we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>This follows Koei Tecmo announcing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-3-complete-edition-remastered">Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered</a> for the Switch 2 and Switch earlier this week. It will be coming to both platforms in March 2026.</p>

            <p>
I think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/q-up">Q-UP</a> might be gaslighting me. It most certainly is a real video game, I played it myself. And yet it presents an entirely different vision of reality where it is the coin flipping eSport of choice. The worst part is that it nearly convinced me that such a reality is a pretty good one. Perhaps even more than half!
</p>
<p>
Here's the strange lowdown. Q-UP is the latest game from Universal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paperclips">Paperclips</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/babble-royale">Babble Royale</a> designer Frank Lantz through his family-run studio Everybody House Games. In it, you flip a coin, which the game describes as being the fairest of games because it is always a 50/50 chance that you will win. There are two teams, Q-Side, and Up-Side. Imagine you're on Q-Side for a moment, and the coin lands Q-Side up. It does that two more times and you've won, a first to three type deal. That's the game! And also it's not the game at all.
</p>
<p>
Q-UP is coated from head to toe in the aesthetics of something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>. There are different heroes you can choose from with different skills that affect how much XP you earn, which is what the actual game is. You are trying to game the game so that you get as much XP as possible, whether you lose the coin flip or not, mixing and matching these skills so that they react with one another based on the results of the flip, or even just when the flip happens itself.
</p>
<p>
You can really rack up some XP too! I somehow managed to get over 200,000 points in one round, going up an entire rank in the game's demo, and let me tell you, the rush I felt was unlike anything any game that Q-UP is satirizing has given me before. I truly mostly don't care for games like Overwatch, the shooting just doesn't appeal to me and I don't like being called slurs by children even on a good day. But a game where I can just cut all of that out and get straight to the heart of it all, which is making number go up? That's a thing of beauty.
</p>
<p>
You can also genuinely play this game online, seemingly with strangers or your own friends. If that's not your bag there's a single-player option too.
</p>
<p>
Even in just its demo, Q-UP is a fascinating deconstruction of what makes eSports works, and also where it fails. Sometimes you'll have a match where you lose three flips in a row, and you'll get an email from the developer apologising for getting it wrong, offering you some currency to make up for it. Other times you'll spend 50 gold on the chance of pulling a literal whale, with the game outright telling you it's a 0% chance. And you'll do it multiple times anyway just to check.
</p><p>
Subtle, Q-UP is not, but it is genuinely fun, and somehow manages to capture that "one more game" quality that the best eSport games have. There's no release date for it just yet, though you can give it a go yourself by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3730790/QUP/">checking out the demo on Steam</a>.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
I am genuinely unsure if MiHoYo are capable of making a game that doesn't heavily borrow from a different game you probably already love at this point in time. Denying The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's influence on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> is like denying the sky is blue! Only recently was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-new-honkai-game-on-the-way-with-characters-from-star-rail-and-impact-3rd-and-it-sure-does-look-like-a-pokemon-clone">Honkai: Nexus Anima</a> revealed, a game that takes Pokemon and shoves it into a blender with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/auto-chess">Auto Chess</a>. And now there is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/petit-planet">Petit Planet</a>, a game I can only describe as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a> but if it was in space, I guess.
</p>
<p>
There are a few differences between the Nintendo classic and MiHoYo's borderline wholesale ripoff. For one, the animal people feel much more akin to fursonas than just anthropomorphic animals. And there's the fact that, rather than living on an island like in AC: New Horizons, you live on tiny planets, of which there are a number you can visit.

<p>
It looks like there's a lot of customisation options too, from different clothes, to houses that can be built and interiors that can be designed. You can also visit other players' islands, go fishing, grow vegetables. Honestly, it's a bit hard to figure out just how different Petit Planet is from Animal Crossing aside from aesthetics. Which kind of begs the question, why does this even exist?
</p><p>
Well, the likeliest answer is that Animal Crossing: New Horizons was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52269671">removed from sale in China</a> following in-game protests performed by people in Hong Kong. That means there's a wide open market for a big budget game like that! For the rest of us, it looks like just more of the same thing you already like, but with a higher chance of getting more updates than New Horizons did. Congratulations to those of you that think games that don't need infinite updates should get them anyway!
</p>
<p>
In any case, if you are still curious about the game, and want to see if it truly is just an Animal Crossing clone, you can sign-up to beta test the game <a href="https://planet.hoyoverse.com/en-us/home">here</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> fans who missed out on Steelbook pre-orders despite ordering early are slamming U.S. retailer GameStop and speaking out against opportunist scalpers.</p>
<p>Players were tempted to pre-order the physical edition of Silent Hill f ahead of time by the "free" addition of a striking Steelbook case for orders placed with Amazon in the UK, and GameStop in the U.S. </p>
<p>However, as orders began arriving across the States this week and fans stopped by stores to pick up their freebie, it became clear that GameStop did not have nearly enough Steelbook cases to satisfy demand.</p>

<p>"Is anyone else having trouble trying to acquire their Silent Hill f steelbook?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1nqcfsc/silent_hill_steel_book/">asked</a> one customer. "Preordered from GameStop months ago and went today just an hour after opening and they’ve run out of all four steel boxes they had in stock. All four. Called every GameStop in a 50 mile radius and NONE other store received ANY shipment of steel boxes at all."</p>
<p>"Everyone is getting the shaft," someone <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1nqcfsc/comment/ng5r3tv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">responded</a>. "Stores that even got allocation were at like 10% or less compared to their pre-order number."</p>

</span></p><p>"I went to a GameStop earlier today as they opened, and they only got one," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1nqcfsc/comment/ng5yx7p/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">commented</a> someone else. "And I was the second guy in line. Supposedly, they should get another shipment. But it's really stupid that there is a shortage of Steelbooks, and on top of that, online preorders require you to go in store to pick up the Steelbook. I wish Amazon US or Best Buy had the Steelbook, 'cause at least they would ship it with the game. I guess I'll check in and see if they ever get more in the upcoming weeks."</p>
<p>Other players claimed GameStop employees confirmed to them that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1nq9uc3/got_my_steelbook_just_now_i_was_second_in_line/">each store received only a handful of Steelbook cases</a> irrespective of how many pre-orders the stores logged, with some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1nqiluq/comment/ng75noi/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">saying</a> their local store "didn't even get a single Steelbook…"</p>
<p>"I work at GameStop. We got a total of nine Steelbooks… for 30+ preorders," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1npotdn/comment/ng0ta87/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">explained</a> another commenter.</p>
<p>If this all sounds very familiar, that's because it is. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-game-pre-order-customers-receive-copies-but-for-wrong-edition">When Silent Hill 2 Remake pre-orders began shipping in the UK in October 2024</a>, GAME customers similarly received their game without the steelbook sweetener they'd hoped to get when placing their orders, and it took several weeks for GAME to fulfil delayed shipments. This time around, however, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-silent-hill-f-pre-orders-feature-an-exclusive-steelbook-in-the-uk">Konami partnered with Amazon UK to distribute the Steelbook pre-order bonus</a>, which seems to have been more successful this time around.</p><p>What's particularly galling for some fans, however, is the number of Steelbook cases that have made it onto <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=silent+hill+f+steelbook&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4624852.m570.l1313">online auction sites like eBay</a>. Despite being given away for free, the collectible case is being auctioned for anywhere from $30 to $205, both with and without the game bundled alongside it.</p>
<p>In a thread entitled "people ruin everything" with hundreds of upvotes, one fan wrote: "What [is] really disappointed me even more was going on eBay just to see what resellers were up charging for the cases, ruining it for other people by being greedy. I know [the] Silent Hill franchise ha[s] always been expensive, I’ve gotten my fair share of games over the years, but for people to sell a case for more than market value is sickening."</p>
<p>With most retailers advertising the freebie as available "while stocks last", however, there's very little customers can do, as demonstrated by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1nr11xe/regarding_steelbook/">this email response</a> from GameStop customer care, who told one player that "even with online pre-orders, the Steelbook must be claimed in-store" and "these items are extremely limited and available only while supplies last."</p>
<p>We'll reach out to GameStop and update as/when we hear back from the retailer.</p>

            <p>
Have you, like me, been unable to get <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@joemamagod/video/7541963643601112334?_r=1&amp;_t=ZN-9059pfG1vGw">that one TikTok sound</a> out of your head that mixes Anri's iconic anthem I Can't Stop The Loneliness with the screams of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight's</a> very own Hornet ever since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> came out? It's a surprisingly good combo, but it also serves as an unintended reminder for something: these particular screams of Hornet's are nowhere to be found in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a>. You know, the classics, like "SHAW," and "Adino!" not to mention the unforgettable "Hegale!" So of course there's a mod for that.
</p>
<p>
For whatever reason, Team Cherry decided to opt for Hornet taking a quieter approach to her attacks and special abilities compared to the boss version of her you fight against in the original Hollow Knight. I can only assume that's because spending upwards of 20 hours getting to just the default ending of the game would surely result in "SHAW" getting a bit grating for some people. That doesn't mean folks haven't been missing these sounds though, and coming in to save the day is modder Nai, who made a mod simply titled "<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/158?tab=description">HK Hornet Voice Restored</a>."
</p>
<p>
As you can probably guess, this mod replaces the sounds she makes using her silks skills with the sounds she emits in Hollow Knight as a boss (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/essential-silksong-mod-rights-team-cherrys-greatest-wrong-by-giving-hornet-her-iconic-hollow-knight-voice-lines-including-and-especially-shaw/">GamesRadar</a>). It's obviously quite a simple mod, though I am quite charmed by it. Sometimes sequels receive such tiny, most inconsequential changes that actually mean a lot or stick out to the people that played the original, so it's always fun to see how people adapt to them.
</p>
<p>
And then sometimes people <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stupid-sexy-hollow-knight-silksong-mods-for-hornet-horndogs-have-begun-to-hit-the-nexus-im-sorry-to-say">just want to be horny about the bug girl</a>. Go figure!

            <p>
It's been no secret that Remedy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> landed like a piece of haddock at the fishmongers. This shouldn't necessarily be a complete surprise, after all this is their first attempt at a live service game that's all them (they also helped to make CrossfireX, and that didn't go very well either). Still, to Remedy's credit they've also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-are-still-backing-fbc-firebreak-despite-a-slow-steam-launch-confirming-its-next-major-update-for-september">committed to bring changes to the game</a>, and those changes are coming in the form of a big update titled Breakpoint next week.
</p>
<p>
Moving swiftly along from the fact that this update's name feels like a make or break point for FBC: Firebreak, Breakpoint is set to arrive next week on September 29th. There is some new stuff that's coming with this update, but the main point of it is multiple system overhauls and quality-of-life improvements. I mean, Remedy literally said one of its goals with this update is to "Improve everything about the FBC: Firebreak experience." That's a tall order!
</p>
<p>
One of the big issues with the game is that onboarding just… didn't really work. Many found it a bit difficult to parse, with systems not getting enough explanations. Now, right at the start of the game there's an "Orientation" tutorial level that comes with a voiceover and tips to get you acquainted with the basics. You'll find some new job overview videos to better understand the game's different Crises too.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of the Crises, these work a bit differently now too. There's now a Crisis Board, replacing the game's job selection screen, which refreshes every 30 minutes, and you can choose specific Crises to play too. Remedy explains that each Crisis is "currently a curated version of one of the existing five (six with the update) Jobs with randomized rewards, objectives, and length." There's also a new Crisis to play through, based around that mold you might remember from Control. Nasty stuff, but more to do is always good.
</p><p>
The game's economy and progression has been changed too, namely that you keep any gear, guns, or perks you've unlocked. On top of that there are three currencies to be found, and any currency you currently have will be split evenly between these three.
</p>
<p>
In terms of what's next, Remedy says the next major update is coming in late November, which they're currently calling "Rogue Protocol." That one will have cross-platform voice chat, as well as a new game mode. After that, the next big update won't be until March 2026.
</p>
<p>
Who knows whether this update will breathe enough life back into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> or not, but at least Remedy is giving it a good go. You can read about all of the changes and additions <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/530984095140809426?l=english">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo’s first-party <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> can’t be beaten when it comes to its breadth of features and comfort. But at $89.99, let’s be real, it’s way too expensive for most people. Thankfully, a controller I’ve been testing recently, which is nearly as good despite lacking a 3.5mm audio jack, is currently on sale for $40 less. The <strong>EasySMX S10</strong>, as it’s called, is available for $50.39 from <a href="https://www.easysmx.com/products/easysmx-s10-gaming-controller-for-switch-2-tmr-sticks-hd-rumble-motion-control">EasySMX</a> with code <strong>GETS10</strong>.</p><p>The S10 is comfortable to use for long gaming sessions, and it has features that aren’t commonly built into third-party gamepads, including amiibo support and rumble that feels like it’s in the same ballpark as Nintendo’s HD rumble. It can also remotely wake the Nintendo Switch 2, not just the original Switch, from standby.</p><p>The S10 would be easier to recommend than Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro Controller even if they were the same price, since EasySMX’s model features accurate, power-efficient TMR joysticks, plus some satisfyingly clicky buttons and triggers (note: these are divisive, you might not like them as much as I do). But at $40 less, you don’t need to feel bad about getting this instead of Nintendo’s official gamepad. Take that leftover money and treat yourself to something nice instead.</p><p>If you’re an Android user looking for an unobtrusive Bluetooth tracker for your wallet, Ugreen just launched the <strong>FineTrack Slim Smart G</strong>. It’s just 1.7mm thick (approximately the thickness of two credit cards), letting it to sit next to your other cards without sticking out, and its built-in battery can last for up to five years. For its launch, Ugreen has knocked $2 off the $25.99 tracker, dropping it to $23.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-FineTrack-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Ultra-Slim/dp/B0FBWBDB1Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>.</p><p>The downside is that it can’t be charged, so you’ll need to dispose of it and buy a new tracker once those five years are up. That stinks, but its specs mean it should provide a pretty good five years of service. It features a built-in 80db alarm to help you find it via Google’s Find Hub network, after all, along with IP68 protection against dust and water. Just keep in mind that, if it’s submerged, you won’t be able to track it.</p><p>Now through October 5th, OnePlus has a few back-to-college deals up its sleeve that everyone can enjoy, whether you’re a student or not. The one that caught my eye is the 43mm <strong>OnePlus Watch 3</strong>, which is available for $269.99 ($30 off) from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FDK2QHGH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://onepluscom.pxf.io/c/482924/916678/12532?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fus%2Fbuy-oneplus-watch-3-43mm" rel="sponsored">OnePlus</a> (with coupon code <strong>HARVEST</strong>). The Wear OS 5-equipped smartwatch has gone on sale before, but after a nearly month-long period when it wasn’t discounted, it’s returned to its second-best price to date.</p><p>If you’re shopping for an Android watch, we recommend including OnePlus’ latest wearable on your shortlist. Outside of Samsung’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/715171/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review-smartwatch-wearos-antioxidant-gemini">recent Galaxy Watch 8 series</a>, the OnePlus Watch 3 is one of the newest models available. It offers a better value than its predecessor, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24132998/one-plus-watch-2-review-smartwatches-wearables">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, with updated software, a rotating crown, an enhanced GPS antenna, and a suite of new health features.</p><div><p id="other-deals-we-loved-from-this-week"><h2>Other deals we loved from this week</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Nintendo’s tappable <strong>amiibos</strong> are an expensive hobby, as most figures for the Switch and Switch 2 usually cost between $15 and $40 each.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But Village ran so well, the team got to porting.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">At the most recent Nintendo Direct, Nintendo fans were blessed with the news that not one, not two, but three modern Resident Evil games would be coming to Nintendo Switch 2: Village, Requiem, and Biohazard. But according to Requiem's developers, this wasn't always the plan. In fact, the team didn't originally plan to bring anything to the Switch 2 at all.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to me at Tokyo Game Show, producer Masato Kumazawa explains the story of how the Nintendo Switch 2 ended up with the three most modern Resident Evil games on their way to the system:</p><blockquote>The Switch 2 hadn't been announced when we started planning this game [Requiem], so of course it wasn't in the original plan. When the Switch 2 was announced we were able to start testing developing games for it, and we thought it would be great if we could bring the Resident Evil series to this platform. We started off with internally porting Resident Evil: Village to see if it would work well on the hardware, and it looked really great, so that gave us the confidence to add a Switch 2 version of Reqiuem to the plans, and that led us to the recent announcement where we confirmed not only Reqiuem was coming, but 7 and 8 would also be coming to Nintendo Switch 2 at the same time.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no surprise that Kumazawa is gassing up the Switch 2 port of his own game, but I played a brief section of Resident Evil: Requiem at Tokyo Game Show in handheld mode on the platform and...yeah, it looks pretty good! I asked him as a follow-up if there was anything unique about the Switch 2 version of the game, and his response that no, there isn't, "in a good way." It's just Requiem, on the Switch 2, able to be taken on the go. And though my sampling of this experience was brief, I'm optimistic from that short demo that Kumazawa's not just all talk here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We previewed Resident Evil: Requiem just last month, and you can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-hands-on-preview">read our impressions of what we've seen so far right here</a>.

And to eager Resident Evil fans, me, and many of my coworkers, it seemed obvious that we were finally going to get a new trailer revealing Leon's official precense in the game, as a playable character or otherwise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that's not what happened. We did see a new trailer, but no Leon. And a preview build available at TGS, which I went hands-on with after my interview, was similarly bereft of Leon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When I brought up the strangeness of my expectations and the resulting Leon Kennedy drought to Nakanishi and Kumazawa, they just laughed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We will take on board this feedback," Kumazawa said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-shows-fresh-look-at-grace-ashcrofts-backstory-but-wheres-leon">Fan clamor for Leon has been going on for months now,</a> ever since the game's first trailer appeared to contain multiple teases for, at minimum, a Leon appearance. But rumors have since grown, with some suggesting Leon might show up in the game as a secondary playable protagonist alongside newcomer Grace Ashcroft. Nakanishi and Kumazawa have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">attempted to brush those rumors aside</a>, saying that Kennedy is a poor match for Reqiuem's less action-heavy tone, but the fervor has persisted anyway, and the two are stopping short of saying outright that we won't get to control him at all, even for just a little bit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given all this discussion, I asked the pair if they had any concerns that all the Leon nonsense was distracting from their attempt to position Grace as the game's star. But they're not worried. "We're always happy that people are interested in the game enough to speculate so much," Kumazawa said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If, then, the pair are so insistent that Grace is the new face of this Resident Evil story, could Reqiuem server as a sort of passing-of-the-torch between old and new Resident Evil? Not quite, Kumazawa says.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Although we don't have firm plans for the future storylines of later titles in the series, I still think passing the torch is probably going a bit too far, because we're not just going to wipe the slate clean completely in terms of the series lore and history. But at the same time I don't want to always have to just go back to the well of existing characters to create new games, which was part of the motivation to introduce Grace."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We previewed Resident Evil: Requiem just last month, and you can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-hands-on-preview">read our impressions of what we've seen so far right here</a>.

            <p>
Heart Machine have had a busy year. It was only in January that they launched <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a> into early access, a surprise follow-up to their beloved indie action RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a>. That launch didn't go amazingly due to a myriad of reasons, and even now the game hasn't completely managed to find its footing yet. And then there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/possessors">Possessor(s)</a>, their search action (not <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">Metroidvania</a>) game that at long last has a release date!
</p>
<p>
That date is quite soon, too: November 11th, less than two months away. This date came with a new little gameplay overview trailer, showing off some of the tools the game's protagonist will be able to use on her journey. I'm quite into the concept behind them, they're all just things you're likely to find left behind in a ruined city; a computer mouse, an electric guitar, a pair of sunglasses, all usable in combat that's apparently partially inspired by games like Smash Bros.
</p>

</p>

<p>
The overall concept is a tantalising one too. You play as Luca, a teenage girl caught up in the mess of a quarantined city whose body becomes so damaged she's forced to let a demon named Rhem in to fix it. This city is in ruins because of some experiments conducted by an evil corporation (the evil being a bit moot there because when isn't a corporation evil), with other demons having possessed everyday household objects.
</p><p>
Possessor(s) marks a bit of a departure for Heart Machine having transitioned to a 2D, sidescrolling plane. There's certainly the hallmarks of the studio with its fresh concept and killer art direction, I'm just hoping they've managed to pull off a hit given how Hyper Light Breaker has been put through the ringer. We'll find out in a couple of months!
