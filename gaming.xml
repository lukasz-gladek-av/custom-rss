<p>In a <a href="https://www.liquidswords.com/news/liquid-swords-announces-proposed-workforce-reduction-amid-business-challenges" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on the official Liquid Swords website, the studio says the layoffs are part of "an effort to scale back operations and adapt to current business conditions", which is becoming an increasingly common refrain across the industry.</p>

<p>Liquid Swords goes on to say that the layoffs will go towards ensuring the studio's "long-term sustainability" as it continues to work on its debut title, so it sounds as though that game - whatever it may be - hasn't been canceled, at the very least.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/liquid-swords-layoffs-just-cause-4.jpg?itok=OpWO8Crq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/liquid-swords-layoffs-just-cause-4.jpg?itok=FsS_BBOJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Liquid Swords founder Christofer Sundberg created the&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>Sundberg says that his mission with Liquid Swords is to "build a studio redefining game development with a small, expert-driven team and a sustainable business model", and that "shifting market conditions" forced him to "part ways with talented individuals".</p>

<p>Despite this, Sundberg says he and Liquid Swords remain "committed to [their] vision" for the debut game and that work on the project will continue.</p>

<p>The game has yet to be announced, but Liquid Swords says it's "confident that this extremely unfortunate setback will not prevent it from realizing its original ambition" for the title. Here's hoping that we get an announcement for it at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Liquid Swords was originally founded <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avalanche-studios-founder-announces-new-studio-liquid-swords" rel="nofollow">back in 2020</a>. Helmed by Sundberg, the studio also includes alumni from franchises like&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Payday</em>.</p>

<p>It's not just NetEase studios, either; other smaller indie outfits are closing their doors or cancelling projects too, including the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closed-down" rel="nofollow">Casey Hudson's Humanoid Origin</a>&nbsp;and Dr. Disrespect's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-shutdown-dr-disrespect" rel="nofollow">former studio Midnight Society</a>, among many others.</p>

<p>Split Fiction encourages co-op, and adding cross-platform play would facilitate this wonderfully. Hazelight Studios has a sterling reputation for letting you play its games with friends, and crossplay would make exploring Split Fiction‚Äôs vibrant and volatile world a pal-friendly pleasure.</p>



<p>Gaming‚Äôs interconnectivity has changed for the better in the last few years. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where more games have crossplay and cross-platform integration than those that don‚Äôt. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>‚Äòs co-op-centric ideology encourages players to join together as the game has to be played with another player.</p>



<p>You can play Split Fiction together on the same console, but let‚Äôs see if crossplay is enabled.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-split-fiction-have-crossplay-or-cross-platform">Does Split Fiction Have Crossplay or Cross-Platform?</h2>

<p><strong>Split Fiction includes complete crossplay and cross-platform features‚Äîallowing you to enjoy the co-op romp with another player playing on a different format.</strong></p>



<p>In layman‚Äôs terms, if you want to play Split Fiction and you have a PS5, but your friend is on Xbox Series X, crossplay allows you to join forces, despite playing on different consoles. The same goes if you‚Äôre on PC and your buddy is on PC, and so forth.</p>



<p>The news comes courtesy of <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/ea-originals-discussion-en/announcement--faq-split-fiction%E2%84%A2---launching-march-6-2025---pre-order-now/5037251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Split Fiction‚Äôs official FAQ</a>. Under the ‚Äú<strong>Will the game be available to play online?</strong>‚Äù question, the answer succinctly states ‚ÄúYou can play the game online with cross-play enabled.‚Äù You don‚Äôt need to worry about <em>how </em>you own Split Fiction or owning two copies!</p>



<h2 id="h-does-split-fiction-have-friend-s-pass">Does Split Fiction Have Friend‚Äôs Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Hazelight Studios brings back the Friend‚Äôs Pass scheme for Split Fiction, allowing one person to own the game and invite another player to enjoy the title for free.</strong></p>



<p>Friend‚Äôs Pass is also available for the developer‚Äôs other titles: A Way Out and It Takes Two. Both are acclaimed co-op games, and Friend‚Äôs Pass ensures you can play with another player without you both needing a copy of the title.</p>



<p>You‚Äôd think this might affect sales, but quite the opposite. A Way Out has reportedly sold over nine million copies and counting.</p>



<div><article><p><span>A Way Out has now sold more than 9 million units! üí•

The development was a wild ride and the game was already a success back when it released. But even then, we never dared to dream of THIS many people playing our game! üòç

With that said, we will continue to look back at‚Ä¶ </span></p></article></div>



<p>Whereas It Takes Two went one better in every way. Not only did it scoop multiple Game of the Year awards in 2021, but it‚Äôs also sold a staggering 20+ million copies!</p>



<div><article><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ItTakesTwo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ItTakesTwo</a><span> HAS SOLD OVER 20 MILLION!!!

You‚Äôre the best fans in the world, how you have embraced our game is blowing our minds! ‚ù§Ô∏è

We‚Äôre so grateful to every one of the millions upon millions who have enjoyed their time with Cody and May üòç </span></p></article></div>



<p>Split Fiction looks to be another winner for Hazelight Studios. It has Friend‚Äôs Pass‚Äîmeaning only one of you needs to own it‚Äîand looks to recapture the magic of its predecessors.</p>



<hr>



<p>So, Split Fiction has crossplay and cross-platform compatibility and has Friend‚Äôs Pass. It‚Äôs a win-win all around, and Split Fiction should be in the GOTY conversation come the end of 2025. Or do you disagree? Offer your thoughts if you feel different.</p>

            <p>We're just a day away from the launch of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, the new game from the team behind the first two <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> games, following a lengthy development and an unusual delay into 2025.
</p>
<p>Video games often skirt the launch of rivals to avoid launch date clashes on the release calendar, but the situation was more unique for Lost Records' team, in that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-life-is-strange-team-delays-new-game-to-avoid-new-lis-launch-date">the clash it wanted to avoid was for the latest entry in the series it initially founded</a>. 
</p>
<p>In this interview (conducted all the way back at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> last year!) I ask Life is Strange and now Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage's creative director Michel Koch about the game's postponement (before its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-delays-second-half-of-lost-records-bloom-rage-for-optimisation-and-refinement">concluding half's further delay</a>), the thinking behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-creators-lost-records-launches-in-two-parts">its split into two episodes</a>, and where the series - if successful - could go next, now Life is Strange is being handled elsewhere.</p>

</figure>
<p>
<strong>Life is Strange was always a multi-part series, though more recent entries developed after you guys' left the franchise have been standalone - what was the thinking behind splitting Bloom &amp; Rage, and why did you decide on launching in two halves?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Michel Koch:</strong> I noticed that I'm not invested as much in Netflix shows, I binge them and then forget them very quickly sometimes. And then I was watching some TV shows on Apple TV and HBO, where they are sticking to weekly releases, and I found that I was investing way more. And we were thinking, we made some good episodic games, why not still go for at least a part of that? </p>
<p>It also makes a lot of sense for the story. You know, the game is called Bloom &amp; Rage, so Tape 1 will be Bloom, and Tape 2 will be Rage. The game's past takes place over the summer of 1995, so Tape 1 is July, and Tape 2 is August. And there is an event - there is something that happens at the end of Tape 1 that makes sense to stop the game there and to reflect a bit, to just let the player take their time. To maybe play something else, wait a bit, think about what happened, and then go back to Tape 2, hopefully even more invested in the story, because you have had some time to reflect on what happened, and maybe talked with your friends or to other people online.
</p>
<p>
<strong>So the split was decided later on?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Koch:</strong> We decided around two years ago, it was not right at the beginning, at conception, but we decided to split it so it makes sense for the story, for editing, pacing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Another big decision was the delay to 2025, to avoid launching against Life is Strange: Double Exposure. What made your mind up about needing to hold off? Were you sad to see Life is Strange plant its release date flag in the ground first?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Koch:</strong> There are not many narrative games with like, double A or high-quality. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a> is one, Lost Records is another. We thought, as players, I would love that the games are not coming at exactly the same time, as I want to play both. And for us as developers, it also gives us a bit more breathing room to polish things better.
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Don't Nod</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>One of the similarities between Life is Strange and Lost Records seems to be some kind of supernatural element to the game, which we can see in the trailer. There's some purple glowing light in the forest, but we don't yet know what. How far are you going to take the magic, or magic realism?</strong></p><p>
<strong>Koch:</strong> Magical realism is definitely important in our previous games, and is important also again here. As you saw in the trailers, the characters see something in the woods that we are hinting at. But we're still telling a story about a group of friends that is anchored in reality. We want magic to be a catalyst, to be something that makes things have higher stakes, and it will be more and more present as the game advances to the end. But it's more like the magic realism will bring more tension to the group, and to what's happening around some antagonists we cannot talk about yet. If you watch a show like Twin Peaks, this is the kind of magical realism we are going for, rather than full magic. I wouldn't expect some full sci-fi supernatural, high stakes power, or anything that's too major.
</p>
<p>
<strong>So you're not getting into the midichlorians of it all?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Koch:</strong> [Joking] Maybe we should change that... No, of course not. I think we never did in our previous games either. We are building this universe, so it doesn't mean that we don't know about it, what it is. It's a brand new IP that we are working on, it's the first game in that IP - and that's a good thing, even if it's both frightening and very liberating to be able to do that. But with the team, with the writers, we are also building this game knowing that we can come back to universe. We can come back to some characters, to some plot points, to some other threads within this world, and definitely the magic is part of that, as something we can revisit. So we know what it is about, but we don't want to make it too central to the story itself, because it's really the story of this group of four friends.
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Don't Nod</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
<strong>So the plan is that these characters can come back? Or... some of them can?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Koch:</strong> Yes, though the thing is we are still telling a full story with this game, we really want to make sure that the players have their whole character arc and journey, and that whatever blend of endings they get in the past and in the present is a full tale. But we are definitely starting to know how we could have the characters come back, what other stories we could tell, what side stories we could work around  in this universe. It will also depend on the player reception, of course, and we love that we have the opportunity to also look at which characters players are loving the most. What can come back to and add to the world? 
</p>
<p>
I love the work of Stephen King, and what he does in The Dark Tower, where he does feature characters from some of his other books. And I'm not saying that we are doing that, but it's a major highlight that he did, and it's some of the idea that we could try to be able to build our foundations and make sure that we can.
</p>
<p>
<strong>I look forward to your Stephen King self-insert. Or maybe leave that to David Cage.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Koch:</strong> [laughs] We are still making, again, a game about teenagers, but this time, we are really making a game about the adults remembering when they were teenagers. And we really wanted to push that. A lot of times the adults comment on what you're doing, and it helped us to have that contrast between what the 90s were - the flaws of the time, where something that we said back then, we wouldn't say today - and the adults are able to comment about that.

<strong>As with Life is Strange, I guess it's again about balancing you making a game about teenagers as an adult, and also not feeling like you're talking down to anyone.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Koch:</strong> It is a balance, and it's something we've adjusted a lot. We have this younger designer who joined us who's played the game and provided good feedback. She's said 'oh, this is very Boomer-like, maybe you should remove it'. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>But maybe sometimes you want a bit of Boomer, to show these now-adults are from a different generation. </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Koch:</strong> Yeah, it's cool, it's a challenge but it's really interesting to try to blend both generations in, and make it interesting for both.

<p>Liquid Swords, the video game studio founded by Avalanche Studios founder Christofer Sunberg, has announced its plans to hold layoffs at the company.</p>



<p>The announcement was made via a post on the <a href="https://www.liquidswords.com/news/liquid-swords-announces-proposed-workforce-reduction-amid-business-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studio‚Äôs website</a>.</p>



<p>According to the announcement, the decision was made after an ‚Äúevaluation of Liquid Swords‚Äô financial situation and the present challenges of the video game industry.‚Äù It was added that the moves are being done to ‚Äúensure the studio‚Äôs long-term sustainability‚Äù.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-exclusive-10-10-games-employees-offered-no-severance-layoffs-happened-while-on-holiday-and-more">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/1010-games-employees-offered-no-severance-laid-off-while-on-holiday-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXCLUSIVE: 10:10 Games Employees Offered No Severance, Layoffs Happened While On Holiday, And More</a></h6>



<p>‚ÄúI promised our employees and shareholders success and to build a studio redefining game development with a small, expert-driven team and a sustainable work model,‚Äù Sunberg said. ‚ÄúWhile we achieved much of this, shifting market conditions prevented us from succeeding within our timeframe. As a result, we must part ways with talented individuals who have been instrumental in our journey. This is incredibly difficult, but we remain committed to our vision and will continue to work on our IP and first game with a dedicated team.‚Äù</p>



<p>There was no mention of the number of people being let go nor how many people remain with the company. Insider Gaming has reached out to Liquid Swords for clarification after this round of layoffs.</p>



<p>Sundberg added that the studio ‚Äúremains focused‚Äù on its vision of ‚Äúsimplifying the game development process to create exceptional gaming experiences for players.‚Äù</p>



<p>Liquid Swords is currently working on its first game, which is described as ‚Äúa narrative-driven, open-world, hardboiled AAA revenge story‚Äù that is developed in Unreal Engine 5. No other details on the game are known.</p>



<p>In 2025, there have been <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 1,000 estimated jobs</a> lost due to layoffs a cross 30 companies. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-two-weeks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has announced that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has hit another huge sales milestone, and the game hasn't even been on general release for two weeks yet.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1891487776421638643" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X earlier today, the studio announced that its realistic medieval RPG has passed the two million sales mark, calling the achievement a "triumph" and thanking players who contributed to the game's sales.</p>

<p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>passing the two million mark probably won't come as a surprise to you if you've been following its progress. After all, the game passed a million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">on its launch day</a>, and parent company Embracer Group announced sales were nearing two million <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-embracer" rel="nofollow">just last week</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-marriage.jpg?itok=sduZLym2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-marriage.jpg?itok=dmp3uDfR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>has passed the two million sales mark.</figcaption></figure><p>As a reminder, the original&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>took <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-six-million" rel="nofollow">six years to pass the six million mark</a>, eventually reaching eight million <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">by November last year</a>.</p>

<p>While there is, of course, no guarantee that the sequel will continue the momentum it's currently gathered, there's every chance that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>will pass the six million point in a fraction of the time it took its predecessor to do so.</p>

<p>It looks like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-rumors-director" rel="nofollow">those wild rumors about the game's content</a>, which director&nbsp;Daniel V√°vra shot down prior to&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>'s release, have done absolutely nothing to dull its edge when it comes to popularity.</p>

<p>Lest you worry that the RPG is slowing down now that it's finally out there in the wild, you can think again.&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">has a roadmap in place</a> for the future, and it promises tons of new stuff for the game. Not only that, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-mod-support" rel="nofollow">official mod support via Steamworks</a> is also on the way.</p>




<p>In case you're not up to speed,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is a medieval RPG created by Czech studio Warhorse.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor, the game eschews overt fantasy elements in favor of historical accuracy and realism. It takes place in early 15th-century Bohemia and sees protagonist Henry of Skalitz once again navigating a perilous world of political intrigue.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9n4w31hsmvvd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Our Ashley <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-review-deliciously-executed-revenge" rel="nofollow">gave the game a glowing review</a>, praising its huge variety of activities and "outstanding" visual design.</p>

Companion characters who feel the need to comment at the end of every battle, but say nothing of interest or worth, and then say it over and over and <em>over</em> again. Maybe it could not be a thing?</p><p>I <em>love</em>&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>, I‚Äôve been so fortunate to have had code for a couple of weeks before its release, but no deadline to finish it by‚Äîthis has allowed me to really sink into it, to explore its sprawling Living Lands at my own pace, never pressured to reach a story beat. I spent the 25 to 30 hours the game is supposed to last reaching just its midpoint, and am still in no hurry. I suppose you could argue that I should be slightly more motivated to speed up given the scale and danger of the Dreamscourge, but I‚Äôm not able to live in denial of its spread being entirely beholden to my advancing the plot. The plague can wait, because I just saw what might be a hidden cave entrance and it could end up being a whole other dungeon to explore.</p><p>The catch is, I‚Äôve survived a <em>lot</em> of battles, big and small, primarily skirmishes with Xaurips or spiders who are hanging out in the next valley I‚Äôm poking my nose into, defiantly fought entirely with my bow and arrow. And every single time, every single one of them, one of my two companions feels the need to comment on it. But each appears equipped with only two or three different things to say. So dear God, I‚Äôve heard them all so many bloody times.</p><p>‚ÄúAnother glorious battle!‚Äù bellows Kai, my constant companion (I can no more leave him in camp than I could when he was in his Garrus incarnation in <em>Mass Effect</em>), following our killing a bunch of halfwits who couldn‚Äôt be talked out of trying to kill us. No, Kai, no it wasn‚Äôt. It was ignominious at best, and more realistically, fairly grotesque. His cheering in delight after I‚Äôve been forced to slaughter some dumb-dumbs rebels who wouldn‚Äôt listen to calm reason makes me think there‚Äôs something really very wrong with him.</p><figure id="" data-id="276e820ccd0e9bcf568831e79f0b56c4" data-recommend-id="image://276e820ccd0e9bcf568831e79f0b56c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some very pretty fireworks during a boos fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Some very pretty fireworks during a boos fight." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="276e820ccd0e9bcf568831e79f0b56c4" data-recommend-id="image://276e820ccd0e9bcf568831e79f0b56c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some very pretty fireworks during a boos fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Far worse occurred with another companion after a significant story event that I shall not spoil. Let‚Äôs put it this way: everything she‚Äôs known and loved has just been destroyed, she‚Äôs distraught, and seconds later, on stumbling into a group of sentient toadstools or the like, she‚Äôs straight back to happily cheering me on and celebrating wins.</p><p>Or how about one companion discovered later on who, <em>every single time</em> she uses her ‚Äúdispel‚Äù ability, says the same two things. ‚ÄúWhat, like it‚Äôs hard?‚Äù and ‚ÄúChild‚Äôs play.‚Äù Both things. Every time. And neither of them makes <em>any</em> sense in context.</p><figure id="" data-id="531e3d97358421b5f26800921aa10599" data-recommend-id="image://531e3d97358421b5f26800921aa10599" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="My character staring down at the rocky wilderness of the Living Lands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="My character staring down at the rocky wilderness of the Living Lands." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="531e3d97358421b5f26800921aa10599" data-recommend-id="image://531e3d97358421b5f26800921aa10599" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="My character staring down at the rocky wilderness of the Living Lands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Avowed</em> deserves so much better than this! The game has fantastic writing throughout, with a really lovely group of chums to chat to, and banter between them all in camp is a real treat to stand still and listen to. So why, for the love of all things <em>why</em>, does each only have three things they say at the end of every fight?!</p><p>Given the verbose nature of Obsidian and BioWare‚Äôs RPGs, and how the voice actors must be spending days and days in the recording studio performing their billions of lines, why can‚Äôt they each just have a couple of dozen different post-fight lines to drop? It‚Äôd add, what, ten minutes to the recording time? And it‚Äôs not exactly a Herculean writing task. Watch, I‚Äôll do some now:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>‚ÄúPhew, glad we were able to put that lot down so quickly.‚Äù</li><li>‚ÄúHey, I think you clipped my ear with one of your shots that time!‚Äù</li><li>‚ÄúHa! They really thought they could beat us, didn‚Äôt they?‚Äù</li><li>‚ÄúI told my parents it was worth spending so much time practicing with this bow.‚Äù</li><li>‚ÄúWell, if they weren‚Äôt all dead, I think they‚Äôd have to admit they were impressed.‚Äù</li></ul><p>That was a minute‚Äôs work, and no, none of them is particularly good, but then nor is any line any companion has ever said in any game in the same circumstances. They‚Äôre certainly up there with Marius telling me that he‚Äôs pulled his shoulder for the 786th time.</p><p>All of them would be deeply annoying the second time they were spoken, so you write 20, 30 of them per character, and have them tick off so they don‚Äôt repeat until they‚Äôve all been said. Done. Problem solved. I fixed a 30-year-old bane of RPGs, and I don‚Äôt even know how to use C++.</p><figure id="" data-id="6bce73ba6768622ada8eb2bc7a982d1b" data-recommend-id="image://6bce73ba6768622ada8eb2bc7a982d1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Giatta saying the unimprovable words, 'You irredeemable fucking swine...'" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Giatta saying the unimprovable words, 'You irredeemable fucking swine...'" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6bce73ba6768622ada8eb2bc7a982d1b" data-recommend-id="image://6bce73ba6768622ada8eb2bc7a982d1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Giatta saying the unimprovable words, 'You irredeemable fucking swine...'" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There‚Äôs an even easier solution. Hold on tight. Don‚Äôt have them say anything at all! Nothing needs to be said! I just killed seven skeletons that were stood by that rock, because I wanted to go past that rock. It wasn‚Äôt a battle about which operas will be written, it was just a bit of busywork in a video game. It requires no comment. Silence does perfectly.</p><p>Heck, I‚Äôll compromise! I‚Äôm that decent. How about they only say their silly lines after a named boss fight? There are plenty of those in <em>Avowed</em>, and they tend to feel like a more major event, even if they‚Äôre just ticking off a bounty. When I‚Äôve won one of those, I feel like I‚Äôve at least achieved something, so sure, let Kai declare it a glorious battle. Give him his moment.</p><p>This is absolutely not an <em>Avowed</em> issue, but an RPG games issue. But that doesn‚Äôt let it off the hook. Obsidian, when you make the inevitably (and deeply desired) <em>Avowed 2</em>, please, <em>please</em>, could you be the team to lead the way on changing this? Because the choice is doing this, or I will somehow arrange for your friends and families to respond, ‚ÄúGreat work, you really ate some mouthfuls‚Äù every single time you have a meal for the rest of your lives.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/counter-strike-2-hits-highest-player-count-since-2023.1111392/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-player-count<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve's first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>has hit its highest player count since May 2023, and it isn't really clear why that's happened.</p>

<p><em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-surprise-releases-counter-strike-2" rel="nofollow">surprise-released in September 2023</a>, essentially serving as both a sequel to&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&nbsp;</em>and a major update for that game as well. In May that year, when it was still&nbsp;<em>Global Offensive</em>, the game hit its all-time Steam player count high of 1,818,773 (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">per SteamDB</a>).</p>

<p>This weekend, again according to SteamDB's numbers (with thanks to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/counter-strike-2/counter-strike-2-hits-massive-new-player-count-record-but-no-one-really-knows-why-3133997/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dexerto</a>),&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>managed to hit a concurrent player count of 1,741,837, representing the game's highest player numbers since the Steam launch of both <i>Global Offensive&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>itself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/counter-strike-2-concurrent-player-count-shooting.jpg?itok=jLhzaDON 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/counter-strike-2-concurrent-player-count-shooting.jpg?itok=-sLiONym 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Counter-Strike 2</em>'s player numbers have reached a recent high, and it's not clear why.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>'s numbers (which were originally those of&nbsp;<em>Global Offensive</em>, lest we forget) have been trending upwards since 2012, and that the game has routinely been playing host to over a million players per day since 2022.</p>

<p>Still, there weren't any major&nbsp;<em>CS2&nbsp;</em>esports tournaments over the weekend, and as far as I know, no major&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>content creators have done anything particularly noteworthy over the past few days either.</p>

<p>It's entirely possible that&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>'s numbers have simply hit this high as part of the aforementioned general trend upwards for the game, but it's still interesting (and no doubt encouraging for Valve, given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-600m-revenue-report" rel="nofollow">how much the shooter rakes in</a>) to see figures like this for the game.</p>

<p>Will&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>manage to eclipse its all-time player high within the next few weeks? If the player count continues to rise, then it's pretty much an inevitability, which can only mean more skin sales for Valve. Hooray, I guess!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/counter-strike-2-concurrent-player-count-barrels.jpg?itok=6BWGNT17 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/counter-strike-2-concurrent-player-count-barrels.jpg?itok=KKveFkqD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>makes big money for Valve.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're still in the dark about&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, it's a multiplayer first-person shooter that pits teams of terrorists against their counter-terrorist foes.</p>

<p>The game essentially plays the same as its predecessor; it's a reflex-based FPS with a focus on observation, quick thinking, and objective-based gameplay (unless you're playing in deathmatch, in which case it's a chaotic free-for-all).</p>

<p>When it made the switch to&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, Valve's shooter got itself a new Source 2-based coat of paint, as well as new server architecture, updated maps, and more.</p>

<p><em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">for free on PC via Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>Among the dorkiest aspects of Bethesda's winningly dorky <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> is the persuasion wheel minigame - also known as Persuasion Pie, also known as the Wheedlin' Roundabout, also known as the Dartboard of Indoctrination. (Maybe not so much the last two.) This saw you choosing methods of gaining NPC affection from a disc with quadrants labelled "Admire", "Joke", "Coerce" and "Boast", each of which elicits a different response previewed by the NPC's gurnishly changing expression. </p>
<p>You have to choose all four options at least once per round, and the underlying "pie" rotates every time you pick one. The underlying segments are partially filled in to show how much they'll affect the NPC's opinion, for better or worse. The idea, then is to match responses that have a positive effect to the largest chunks of pie, by picking them in the right order. If you think all that sounds incredibly overwrought and laborious, then you are clearly not Don't Nod Montreal's Colin McInerney or one of the other hosts of Wheeljam 2025, a game creation jam dedicated to Bethesda's ole Tart Of Cajolement. Here is a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>The jam runs from Thursday, March 13th to Thursday, March 20th, the 19th anniversary of Oblivion's 2006 launch. Oblivion aside, it takes inspiration from Bass Reeves Can't Die, a game concepted by Strange Scaffold boss Xalavier Nelson Jr, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/colin.how/post/3lehstucgq225">created by McInerney</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69Ukg2BqIk0">promoted/discussed</a> by Youtuber Julian "Noodle" Morley.</p>
<p>"Feel free to iterate on the original persuasion-puzzle concept or abstract your wheel into something entirely new!" <a href="https://itch.io/jam/wheeljam">explains the jam page on Itch.io</a>. "If your wheel is recognizably derived from the Oblivion wheel in any way shape or form, it is fair game."</p>
<p>Entry is free, and the hosts have considerately put together some Unreal, Godot and Unity Engine templates for people to work from. They're also offering prizes in the shape of 3D-printed Oblivion Persuasion Models. From the Itch page: "They spin! And have magnets! Maybe I'll put your names and the categories on the back of the wheel? I dunno! I didn't think that far ahead!"</p>
<p>There are several prize categories. Under "Hotwheels", we file developers who "spend an exorbitant amount of time juicing your wheel, making custom graphics for it, and making it buttery smooth". Under "Reinvent The Wheel", we find those who "use the wheel in a way that even the most seasoned game designers couldn't possibly fathom". And under "Put The We In Wheel", we find developers who "somehow found a way to have multiple wheels".</p>
<p>I'm quite fond of Oblivion's Brainwashing Pizza. I'd love to see another developer randomly revive it as an in-game item - perhaps Kojima can be pie-suaded to build it into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>. I also adore gamejams run by sickos who are obsessed with extremely specific features or mechanics from many decades ago. I'll be keeping one eye on this while the other remains peeled for news of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">long-rumoured Oblivion remake</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Warhorse Studios has announced that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has sold two million units in its first two weeks.</p>



<p>The announcement was made on the developers X (formerly Twitter) page, where the developers said ‚ÄúA toast to you all for making #KCD2 a triumph!‚Äù</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 hit its highest concurrent player count on Steam last week at 256,206 players, far surpassing the original game that released in 2018.</p>



<p>On its success, Embracer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-ceo-says-teams-need-to-have-the-resources-to-make-games-after-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CEO Lars Wingefors praised the games success</a> and said its a ‚Äúreminder‚Äù to the company about creating ‚Äúgreat products‚Äù.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWhen you have right teams, this trust benefits everyone, including gamers, employees and shareholders. I am convinced that we will remain among the industry leaders in our core business verticals in the future.‚Äù</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming‚Äôs official review</a>, Grant Taylor-Hill called Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 a ‚Äúmasterpiece‚Äù that was tough to ‚Äúfind one major fault‚Äù with.</p>



<p>‚ÄúKingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is beautiful in every aspect,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs deeply authentic and riddled with emotion and catharsis, and the way the story comes together is just perfection.‚Äù</p>



<p>Last week, it was announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modding-coming-to-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhorse Studios will be bringing mod support to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>. </p>



<p>‚ÄúBohemia is about to get even more exciting,‚Äù&nbsp;they said. ‚ÄúOfficial modding support is coming to [Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2] on Steamworks.‚Äù But as for when mod support will be released, remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launched on February 4, 2025 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>



<p>Have you give Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 a go?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Days Gone Remastered can be grabbed through a $10 upgrade if you already own the game digitally or physically; however, if you own the game from PlayStation Plus, you are not eligible for this offer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1iok0hw/days_gone_remastered_game_redemptions_via_ps_plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStationPlus</a> subreddit, the Days Gone Remastered‚Äôs fine print clearly states that ‚ÄúGame redemptions via PlayStation Plus are not eligible for upgrade‚Äù. PS Plus players must pay $49.99 to play the Days Gone Remastered, whereas digital or disc copy owners can upgrade for only $10. Many players in the subreddit have stated that they would happily upgrade for the earlier price, but now that they have to buy the whole game, they aren‚Äôt interested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During PlayStation‚Äôs State of Play event, Bend Studio announced that Days Gone Remastered will be released on April 25, 2025. The remastered version has been built for the PS5 and supports Tempest 3D Audio, VRR, DualSense‚Äôs haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers. The game also features improved graphical fidelity and better frame rates for the quality and performance modes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Days Gone Remastered includes new modes and features: Horde Assault, a survival arcade mode; Permadeath mode; Speedrun mode; enhanced Photo mode; and new accessibility features. The new features can also be accessed on PC by purchasing the Broken Road DLC, which costs $10.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the director of Days Gone <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slammed Bend Studio</a> for not protecting the game‚Äôs legacy in Astro Bot ads.

Blizzard‚Äôs game, according to the current narrative, is dwindling as NetEase‚Äôs Marvel Rivals gobbles up its players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/overwatch-2-director-welcomes-competition-from-marvel-rivals-as-the-team-have-never-really-had-another-game-thats-so-similar-to-the-one-that-weve-created/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a>, Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller discussed the new reality Blizzard finds itself in, with Marvel Rivals now out in the wild and attracting tens of millions of players.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Overwatch 2 Perks</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're obviously in a new competitive landscape that I think, for Overwatch, we've never really been in before, to this extent where there's another game that's so similar to the one that we've created," Keller said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You‚Äôd think this would be a bad thing for Overwatch, then, but Keller called the situation ‚Äúexciting,‚Äù and even said it was ‚Äúreally great‚Äù to see Marvel Rivals take ideas established by Overwatch in a ‚Äúdifferent direction.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Keller admitted Marvel Rivals‚Äô success had forced a change in attitude within Blizzard when it comes to Overwatch 2, saying: ‚Äúthis is no longer about playing it safe."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reveals-radical-overhaul-of-overwatch-2-including-return-of-loot-boxes-perks-and-third-person-mode">Blizzard has announced radical changes coming to Overwatch 2 in 2025</a>. While the roadmap ahead includes much of what you'd expect to see in terms of new content, the core gameplay itself will see a seismic shift, including the additions of hero perks and the return of loot boxes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes will be on Overwatch 2 to see if these changes spark a resurgence in interest. We're now nearly nine years out from the debut of Overwatch in 2016, and two-and-a-half from the launch of Overwatch 2. And while Blizzard does not make Overwatch player numbers public, we can see concurrent player numbers on Steam are as low as they‚Äôve ever been since Overwatch 2 launched on Valve‚Äôs platform in 2023, with a 37,046 concurrent player peak over the last 24 hours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals, meanwhile, remains a top 10 most-played game on Steam, with a 310,287 concurrent player peak over the last 24 hours.</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch 2 still has a ‚Äòmostly negative‚Äô user review rating on Steam. Indeed, in August 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-becomes-worst-user-reviewed-game-on-steam-ever-even-as-tens-of-thousands-turn-up-to-play">Overwatch 2 became the worst user-reviewed game on Steam ever</a>. Most of the negative reviews focused on monetization after Blizzard was heavily-criticised for forcing its premium predecessor to update into a free-to-play sequel, rendering the original Overwatch unplayable, back in 2022. Overwatch 2 subsequently endured a number of controversies including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-pve-hero-mode-canceled-a-difficult-choice"><u>the cancellation of its long-awaited PvE Hero mode</u></a> ‚Äî the one feature, players said, that justified the sequel's existence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has loads more on Marvel Rivals, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-says-theyre-not-trolling-dataminers-wed-rather-spend-our-time-developing-the-game">the developer's clarification on datamining</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-developer-is-open-to-potential-future-release-on-nintendo-switch-2">thoughts on the possibility of a Nintendo Switch 2 version</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It‚Äôs the characters that are our vehicles down these cinematic roads paved in broken hearts, therapeutic laughs, and unnecessarily life-threatening stunts by Tom Cruise. The greatest characters in cinema history stay with us because they‚Äôre so well-written and acted that we can see ourselves having a drink with them, or dating them, or, in the case of most of Wes Anderson‚Äôs best characters, we just want to watch them, in all their colorful eccentricity, live in this world. </p><p>Anderson is one of the greatest filmmakers ever, and that‚Äôs in no small part because he‚Äôs created characters we find simultaneously surreal and relatable, even if we don‚Äôt understand why. Why do we admire people like <em>Bottle Rocket</em>‚Äôs Dignan (Owen Wilson), who refuse to accept reality, even when it‚Äôs slapping them in the face? Why do we sometimes cling to a version of ourselves that no longer exists like Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) in <em>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</em>? Anderson knows why, and he tells us through these unforgettable characters.<br></p><p>Before the acclaimed director releases his 12th film,&nbsp;<em>The Phoenician Scheme, </em>let‚Äôs revisit the characters that have defined his legacy and enriched our lives. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="842776bfa1b0e5abba050da15b65c67e" data-recommend-id="image://842776bfa1b0e5abba050da15b65c67e" data-format="jpg" data-width="736" data-height="690" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dignan deep in thought" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dignan deep in thought" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="842776bfa1b0e5abba050da15b65c67e" data-recommend-id="image://842776bfa1b0e5abba050da15b65c67e" data-format="jpg" data-width="736" data-height="690" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dignan deep in thought" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>We should all strive for the long-term optimism that Dignan (Owen Wilson), the protagonist of Anderson‚Äôs first feature film <em>Bottle Rocket</em>, has in his life‚Äôs blueprint. However, we probably shouldn‚Äôt base a 75-year plan on stumbling up the underworld ladder of criminality. Still, Dignan‚Äôs absurdist exaggeration of relatable human emotions‚Äîlike the fear of mediocrity and the yearning for purpose‚Äîbecame an Anderson trademark that has endeared his characters to us for decades.</p><p>While Dignan isn‚Äôt as fleshed out as Anderson‚Äôs later characters, the depth of his delusion shifts from comedic to cautionary in the film‚Äôs final moments. As he sits in prison, his last words‚Äî‚ÄúThey‚Äôll never catch me, man. ‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm fucking innocent.‚Äù‚Äîperfectly encapsulate his unwavering belief in his own fantasy. Even in comedy, Anderson creates characters who can tickle our funny bone while simultaneously breaking our hearts.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="748aceecf10d39ba1b7352d50f1dc5fa" data-recommend-id="image://748aceecf10d39ba1b7352d50f1dc5fa" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1372" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Steve Zissou giving orders" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Steve Zissou giving orders" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="748aceecf10d39ba1b7352d50f1dc5fa" data-recommend-id="image://748aceecf10d39ba1b7352d50f1dc5fa" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1372" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Steve Zissou giving orders" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) embodies the tragicomic grandeur that defines Wes Anderson‚Äôs best characters‚Äîa man clinging to his past glory while barely holding his personal life together. His quest to kill the jaguar shark that ate his best friend is less about science and more about proving he still matters, making lines like ‚ÄúWhat would be the scientific purpose of killing it?‚Äù both hilarious and heartbreaking. His slow-motion strut through his boat&nbsp;the Belafonte, set to David Bowie‚Äôs ‚ÄúQueen Bitch,‚Äù paints him as a man desperate to maintain his legend, even as the world moves on without him.</p><p>Yet in the film‚Äôs most vulnerable moment, when he finally sees the shark, his whisper‚Äî‚ÄúI wonder if it remembers me‚Äù‚Äîturns his vengeance into bittersweet acceptance. Murray brings Zissou to life with a perfect balance of deadpan humor and quiet melancholy, delivering every line with the kind of effortless charisma that makes him both absurd and deeply human. Whether he‚Äôs sulking in his wetsuit or rallying his dysfunctional crew, Murray‚Äôs presence makes Zissou more than just a parody of washed-up adventurers‚Äîhe makes him unforgettable.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d5f360f90834166666fca199e7bf334f" data-recommend-id="image://d5f360f90834166666fca199e7bf334f" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="400" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Max Fischer teaching" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Max Fischer teaching" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d5f360f90834166666fca199e7bf334f" data-recommend-id="image://d5f360f90834166666fca199e7bf334f" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="400" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Max Fischer teaching" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is the blueprint for so many of Wes Anderson‚Äôs best characters‚Äîan overconfident dreamer, equal parts genius and disaster, whose ambition far outweighs his ability. He strides through <em>Rushmore</em> as if he owns it, despite being one of the worst students in the school, and his belief in his own brilliance is so unshakable that even when he‚Äôs failing, he‚Äôs still convinced he‚Äôs winning. His line, ‚ÄúI saved Latin. What did you ever do?‚Äù perfectly captures the delusional self-importance that makes him both hilarious and strangely inspiring. Like Steve Zissou or M. Gustave after him, Max isn‚Äôt just chasing success‚Äîhe‚Äôs crafting his own legend, whether through his impossible aquarium project or his wildly over-the-top Vietnam War play, <em>Heaven and Hell</em>. </p><p>But Anderson‚Äôs best characters aren‚Äôt just cartoons; they‚Äôre flawed, deeply human figures hiding real pain beneath their quirks. Max‚Äôs heartbreak over Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), his crumbling friendship with Herman Blume (Bill Murray), and his desperation to matter in a world that keeps telling him he doesn‚Äôt, make him one of Anderson‚Äôs most enduring protagonists. And yet, by the end, as he orchestrates one last grand production‚Äînot a play, but a reconciliation‚Äîhe learns that sometimes the grandest gestures aren‚Äôt about proving your worth, but about making peace. As ‚ÄúOoh La La‚Äù by The Faces plays and he takes Miss Cross‚Äôs hand for a quiet dance, Max joins the legacy of Anderson‚Äôs most unforgettable characters‚Äîan outsider, a dreamer, and a legend in his own mind, but one we can‚Äôt help but root for.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="918816496f2f6da12cc2568d662665b4" data-recommend-id="image://918816496f2f6da12cc2568d662665b4" data-format="png" data-width="1240" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Augie Steenbeck looking out quizzically " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Augie Steenbeck looking out quizzically " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Universal</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="918816496f2f6da12cc2568d662665b4" data-recommend-id="image://918816496f2f6da12cc2568d662665b4" data-format="png" data-width="1240" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Augie Steenbeck looking out quizzically " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Augie Steenbeck (Jason Schwartzman) might be the most emotionally stranded character Wes Anderson has ever created‚Äîan expert at capturing the world through his camera but completely incapable of being present in his own life. When his wife dies, he doesn‚Äôt tell his children for three weeks, waiting until they‚Äôre quite literally stranded in the middle of nowhere before finally dropping the news with all the warmth of a weather report. </p><p>‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in the Tupperware,‚Äù he says flatly, holding up the ashes as if they‚Äôre just another piece of luggage. But Augie‚Äôs grief isn‚Äôt loud or theatrical‚Äîit‚Äôs buried so deep beneath his deadpan demeanor that even he doesn‚Äôt seem to recognize it. He moves through <em>Asteroid City</em> like a man rehearsing for a role he‚Äôs forgotten how to play, leaning on the safety of his routine and keeping everything‚Äîhis emotions, his children, even himself‚Äîat arm‚Äôs length. </p><p>His moments with Midge Campbell (Scarlett Johansson) offer a glimpse of something raw, something unscripted, particularly their quiet, stunning exchange through the motel window, where she tells him to ‚Äújust feel it‚Äù and he admits, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how.‚Äù But Augie‚Äôs real breaking point comes not in the world of <em>Asteroid City</em>, but in the black-and-white void of the meta-play‚Äôs production, when he steps outside of himself entirely and asks the director, ‚ÄúAm I doing it right?‚Äù It‚Äôs the most vulnerable thing he could possibly say‚Äînot just about the performance, but about everything. About grieving. About parenting. About simply existing. And somehow, that single moment‚Äîsimple, direct, heartbreaking‚Äîcements Augie as one of Anderson‚Äôs most painfully real characters.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="70c2936e87e0903dea664b0d1ed6e5a0" data-recommend-id="image://70c2936e87e0903dea664b0d1ed6e5a0" data-format="webp" data-width="800" data-height="439" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Francis Whitman figuring himself out" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Francis Whitman figuring himself out" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fox Searchlight Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="70c2936e87e0903dea664b0d1ed6e5a0" data-recommend-id="image://70c2936e87e0903dea664b0d1ed6e5a0" data-format="webp" data-width="800" data-height="439" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Francis Whitman figuring himself out" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Francis Whitman (Owen Wilson) is the kind of guy who hands his brothers laminated itineraries for their own emotional healing, as if a tight schedule and a few sacred temples will magically fix everything that‚Äôs broken between them. After nearly dying in a motorcycle accident, he rounds up his estranged brothers for a ‚Äúspiritual journey‚Äù across India, but his idea of enlightenment is less about self-discovery and more about tightly scheduled temple visits and laminated trip plans. ‚ÄúI want us to be completely open with each other,‚Äù he declares, before dictating exactly how they should feel and what they should say.</p><p>His face, half-covered in bandages, is a perfect visual metaphor for the wounds he refuses to acknowledge. But beneath the forced optimism and suffocating leadership, Francis is drowning in unresolved trauma, haunted by a father who left him nothing but matching luggage and a mother who abandoned them entirely. His breaking point comes in a moment as ridiculous as it is raw‚Äîstanding on a hilltop, screaming, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get a drink and talk it over!‚Äù as if healing can be scheduled like a pit stop. It‚Äôs only when he finally lets go‚Äîliterally, dropping his father‚Äôs suitcases in the film‚Äôs final moments‚Äîthat he begins to understand that some baggage is too heavy to carry forever. </p><p>Francis may never find the spiritual awakening he set out for, but in that quiet surrender, he embodies one of Anderson‚Äôs most enduring themes‚Äîthe illusion of control in the face of grief‚Äîand cements himself as a pivotal figure in Anderson‚Äôs legacy of characters who mask deep emotional wounds with carefully curated exteriors.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ac011c440fec4f1b32c695bbac4a7229" data-recommend-id="image://ac011c440fec4f1b32c695bbac4a7229" data-format="jpg" data-width="2027" data-height="1140" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="M.

Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) <em>was</em> the hotel. Like so many of Anderson‚Äôs best characters, he is both a figure of control and a man completely out of his depth, clinging to a version of the world that no longer exists. He operates with impeccable charm and rigid etiquette, convinced that poetry, perfume, and perfect manners can hold back the tides of war and betrayal. But beneath the carefully curated exterior lies something deeper‚Äîa man terrified of irrelevance, desperate to preserve beauty in a world that seems intent on erasing it. </p><p>He fits perfectly in Anderson‚Äôs lineage of complicated men, from Royal Tenenbaum‚Äôs self-mythologizing to Steve Zissou‚Äôs delusional grandiosity‚Äîcharacters who perform their own importance even as their carefully built identities begin to crumble. What makes Gustave unforgettable is not just his refinement but his defiance, the quiet tragedy of someone who refuses to accept that the rules have changed. And yet, through the memory of Zero (Tony Revolori), he lingers‚Äîan echo of lost grandeur, as fragile and fleeting as the hotel itself.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="31010470ab37881d54319fba727e63cf" data-recommend-id="image://31010470ab37881d54319fba727e63cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="759" data-height="500" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arthur Howitzer Jr looking unimpressed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Arthur Howitzer Jr looking unimpressed" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Searchlight Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31010470ab37881d54319fba727e63cf" data-recommend-id="image://31010470ab37881d54319fba727e63cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="759" data-height="500" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arthur Howitzer Jr looking unimpressed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>No one could create a character like Arthur Howitzer Jr. (Bill Murray) but Wes Anderson. He‚Äôs a<strong>&nbsp;</strong>man of quiet authority, deep sentimentality, and an unshakable devotion to a world that‚Äôs slipping away.  Howitzer is a figure who holds chaos together with a firm but gentle touch. He enforces a hilariously strict no-crying policy, yet he is the first to see the humanity in the stories his writers bring him, shaping their sprawling eccentricities into something refined. </p><p>Beneath his gruff pragmatism lies something deeply sentimental‚Äîhe‚Äôs an editor who truly believes in the beauty of storytelling, even as the paper itself fades into memory. Bill Murray‚Äôs performance here is his best in any  Anderson movie (he‚Äôs been in ten), a masterclass in understated warmth and dry wit, embodying the weary but devoted editor with effortless charm. With just a raised eyebrow, a clipped piece of advice‚Äî‚ÄùJust try to make it sound like you wrote it that way on purpose‚Äù‚Äîor a quiet, knowing glance, he gives Howitzer the gruff yet deeply sentimental presence that makes him feel like the soul of the newsroom.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f7d1a6a7e0d5a276d15982d56e32c241" data-recommend-id="image://f7d1a6a7e0d5a276d15982d56e32c241" data-format="webp" data-width="800" data-height="440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Richie Tenenbaum getting ready" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Richie Tenenbaum getting ready" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7d1a6a7e0d5a276d15982d56e32c241" data-recommend-id="image://f7d1a6a7e0d5a276d15982d56e32c241" data-format="webp" data-width="800" data-height="440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Richie Tenenbaum getting ready" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There‚Äôs a certain kind of sadness that runs through Wes Anderson‚Äôs films‚Äîa deep, unspoken melancholy beneath the symmetry and pastel palettes‚Äîand no character embodies it more fully than Richie Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson). Among Anderson‚Äôs pantheon of emotionally stunted geniuses, misguided visionaries, and lost souls, Richie stands out as perhaps the purest example of quiet, unshakable heartbreak. </p><p>Richie barely speaks his pain aloud, instead carrying it in his hunched posture, his constant sunglasses, his resigned half-smiles. He is a man who once had a place in the world‚Äîgraceful, adored, effortlessly talented‚Äîbut now drifts outside of it, undone by love he can never fully have and a family he doesn‚Äôt know how to reconnect with. </p><p>What makes Richie one of Anderson‚Äôs greatest creations isn‚Äôt just his sadness but his underlying tenderness; he has the softest heart of any of Anderson‚Äôs tragic figures, and while others spiral into narcissism or self-indulgence, Richie‚Äôs pain is private, restrained, and deeply human. In a world of characters chasing lost potential, he is the one who seems to know, deep down, that it‚Äôs already gone‚Äîand yet, somehow, he still holds onto the smallest hope that something beautiful remains.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a69be0c611a4da7c0165026b3d0c656c" data-recommend-id="image://a69be0c611a4da7c0165026b3d0c656c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1030" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mr. Fox looking out optimistically" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mr. Fox looking out optimistically" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Fox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a69be0c611a4da7c0165026b3d0c656c" data-recommend-id="image://a69be0c611a4da7c0165026b3d0c656c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1030" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mr. Fox looking out optimistically" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There‚Äôs a restless energy to Mr. Fox (George Clooney) that makes him one of Wes Anderson‚Äôs most compelling characters‚Äîa rogue caught between the wild animal he was born to be and the domesticated family man he‚Äôs trying to become. He is, at heart, a creature of impulse, forever chasing the next thrill, whether it‚Äôs stealing chickens or outwitting farmers, even as the consequences pile up around him. </p><p>What makes him so fascinating isn‚Äôt just his charm or cleverness but the underlying insecurity that drives him; he longs to be exceptional, to be remembered, to be <em>more</em> than just another fox scratching out an ordinary existence. And yet, beneath the bravado, there‚Äôs an ache of self-awareness‚Äîhe knows, deep down, that his recklessness puts everything he loves at risk, that his need to prove himself is as much a flaw as it is a gift. </p><p>In a world of neatly arranged stop-motion frames, he is a burst of chaos, a contradiction, a character whose triumphs always come with a cost. And yet, like all of Anderson‚Äôs best creations, he is impossible not to root for, because no matter how many mistakes he makes, no matter how much he loses, he never stops reaching for something greater‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs just one last, perfectly executed heist.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="32d75e64e15aa0b864d4a81029147328" data-recommend-id="image://32d75e64e15aa0b864d4a81029147328" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chief looking excited " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chief looking excited " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Searchlight Picutres</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32d75e64e15aa0b864d4a81029147328" data-recommend-id="image://32d75e64e15aa0b864d4a81029147328" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chief looking excited " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It‚Äôs almost absurdly funny that the same actor who played Walter White, the ruthless and calculating kingpin of&nbsp;<em>Breaking Bad</em>, can also deliver a deeply heartfelt and compelling performance as a grumpy, stray dog in a Wes Anderson stop-motion film. There‚Äôs a rawness to Chief (Bryan Cranston) that sets him apart from the other dogs in <em>Isle of Dogs</em>‚Äîa scrappy stray who wears his independence like armor, convinced he‚Äôs better off alone. </p><p>Unlike the pampered house pets exiled to Trash Island, Chief has never known human affection, and he resents the very idea of servitude. But what makes him one of Wes Anderson‚Äôs best characters isn‚Äôt just his toughness or his bite‚Äîit‚Äôs the slow, reluctant unraveling of his defenses. Beneath the gruff exterior, there‚Äôs a deep, unspoken longing to belong, a flicker of uncertainty that grows as he bonds with Atari, the boy who sees past his snarls to something gentler underneath. </p><p>His transformation‚Äîfrom a cynical loner to a loyal protector‚Äîis one of Anderson‚Äôs most quietly affecting arcs, proving that even the most hardened creatures can find their place in the world. And in a film filled with symmetrical beauty and precision, Chief remains a glorious contradiction: a creature of instinct wrestling with the unfamiliar weight of love.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="751c7789e627cad8f0d8acc1af5c4104" data-recommend-id="image://751c7789e627cad8f0d8acc1af5c4104" data-format="jpg" data-width="640" data-height="347" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sam (left) and Suzy (right) sitting together " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sam (left) and Suzy (right) sitting together " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Focus Features</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="751c7789e627cad8f0d8acc1af5c4104" data-recommend-id="image://751c7789e627cad8f0d8acc1af5c4104" data-format="jpg" data-width="640" data-height="347" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sam (left) and Suzy (right) sitting together " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It may be hard to accept that Wes Anderson, a filmmaker known for his intricately damaged adults‚Äîmen burdened by lost love, fathers drowning in regret‚Äîcrafted his most affecting characters in two 12-year-olds who run away from home with a cat, a suitcase, and a record player. But, it‚Äôs true. Sam and Suzy (Jared Gilman &amp; Kara Hayward) in <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em> aren‚Äôt just kids playing house; they‚Äôre two souls who, despite their age, understand each other in a way the adults around them never could. </p><p>Sam, an orphan and outcast among his peers, is pragmatic and fiercely loyal, while Suzy, with her sharp gaze and stolen library books, carries the quiet rage of someone who feels fundamentally unseen. Together, they create a world of their own, a secret island refuge where they can exist without judgment. But what makes them Anderson‚Äôs best characters isn‚Äôt just their rebellious adventure‚Äîit‚Äôs the earnestness of their love, the way they approach life with the sincerity that only children can. </p><p>In a world of emotionally stunted grown-ups, Sam and Suzy are the only ones brave enough to demand something more: a life where they are understood, where they belong. And that‚Äôs what makes their story, despite its pastel whimsy, the most profoundly human one Anderson has ever told.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler is undergoing some rather quick development, as the solid implementation seen in a recent game isn't based on the latest version of the upscaler.</p>
<p>As reported on the<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-games-with-ps5-pro-enhancements.1026072/post-135898977" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ResetERA forums</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a>, the second entry in the series released earlier this month, uses the upscaler's 9.60 version. While the high version number, by itself, suggests that PSSR has been undergoing plenty of development, as we previously only heard of much lower version numbers, a known developer on the ResetERA forums <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-games-with-ps5-pro-enhancements.1026072/post-135903003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that version 9.60 isn't the upscaler's latest version, although they couldn't add more on the matter for the time being before checking if something changed in NDAs regarding the upscaler.</p>
<p>A few days earlier, the aforementioned developer also revealed some <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-games-with-ps5-pro-enhancements.1026072/post-135644619" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interesting information</a> on the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler which suggests that already available older games powered by Unreal Engine 4 may not support the upscaler beyond the initial version. According to the developer, UE4, by default, only supports the initial PSSR version, and with official support from Epic on the engine's updates not being available anymore, developers need to backport snippets of Unreal Engine 5 code to use newer SDKs and thus never versions of the PSSR more upscale. This is the reason some <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-playstation-5-pro-new-patch-updates-pssr-to-latest-version-improves-image-quality/">patches</a> took time to implement more recent versions of the upscaler, and why some games may never get support for them, as this backporting of UE5 code requires time that some development teams may not have.</p>
<p>The PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler is only one of the many features that define the PlayStation 5 Pro. You can learn more about the system in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-release-date-revealed-for-july.1111335/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bushiroad Games and Arc System Works have announced the release date for upcoming anime fighter&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact</em>, which will serve as the first major fighting game adaptation of the popular manga and anime.</p>

<p>As revealed during this weekend's Evo event,&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>will launch on July 17th. When it does, you'll be able to play it on PC, PS5, and Switch. No release has been announced for Xbox.</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunter-x-hunter-fighting-game-announced-at-jump-festa" rel="nofollow">announced in December 2023</a>,&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>was originally scheduled for a 2024 release, but in September, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-delayed-rollback-netcode" rel="nofollow">it was delayed</a> in order to allow the developers to add rollback netcode to the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-release-date-fight.jpg?itok=LTE_vL72 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-release-date-fight.jpg?itok=KYgsXwlR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>is locked in for a July launch.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering what rollback netcode is, it's essentially tech that improves the quality of an online fighting game experience.</p>

<p>The long explanation is very technical, but in short, rollback netcode "rolls back" the state of the game if it detects a delay, but retains your own inputs, which makes online fights feel much more smooth.</p>

<p>Rollback netcode has been implemented in a number of hugely successful fighting games, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-fighterz-rollback-netcode-ps5-xbox" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em></a>, Capcom's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-rollback-netcode-will-be-better-open-worlds-detailed" rel="nofollow"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a>, and Bandai Namco's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/will-tekken-8-have-crossplay-and-rollback-netcode-katsuhiro-harada-responds" rel="nofollow"><em>Tekken 8</em></a>, as well as <i>Nen x Impact&nbsp;</i>publisher Arc System Works' own&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/guity-gear-strive-beta-impressions" rel="nofollow"><em>Guilty Gear Strive</em></a>.</p>

<p>In short, while a delay to&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>was unfortunate, it was put into effect so the developers could make it a more satisfying online experience, which it's hard to complain about.</p>




<p><em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>is the first "full-fledged" fighting game to be based on the manga and anime series. It's a 3v3 battler in which you can play as a range of characters from the manga, including Gon, Hisoka, and Killua, among others.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check the game out when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456420/HUNTERxHUNTER_NENxIMPACT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10007325" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and Nintendo Switch on July 17th.</p>

But it‚Äôs vital to remember there <em>are</em> live-service games that are still raking it in. One of the most impressive success stories is Ubisoft‚Äôs <em>Rainbow 6 Siege</em>, which ten years on from release is due to reveal a major update which is being claimed as ‚Äúa new era.‚Äù</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196299" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="385" data-playlist="196299,195734,195189" data-current="196299"><div><p>You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21849.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Rainbow Six Siege X</em>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/1yyppDElemqVlUXSVif55M&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/1yyppDElemqVlUXSVif55M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is described by Ubisoft</a></span> as ‚Äúthe biggest transformation in the game‚Äôs history,‚Äù with the obvious aim to refresh the aging multiplayer game for the foreseeable future. This will involve new game modes, ‚Äúdeepened tactical gameplay,‚Äù and most likely a significant graphical tidying up. The ambiguity here is because, in the tiresome way of modern life, this is all based on a teaser for a teaser, the announcement that there‚Äôs to be The Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase on March 13. It‚Äôs to be a live event, taking place in Atlanta, Georgia, but obviously will be streamed online <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via the game‚Äôs Twitch channel</a></span>.</p><p><em>Siege</em> first launched in 2015, and was a flabby <em>Counter-Strike-</em>me-do, with poor sales. Ubisoft cannily switched to the live-service model, and over the next few years persisted with the game, reinventing it with free DLC, until it had become something enormously loved, and hugely successful. Yes indeed, it‚Äôs hard to imagine, but instead of just junking years of work and hundreds of millions of dollars spent, developers instead worked incredibly hard to bring the game to the point of massive popularity. Bewildering.</p><p>Ten years on, it looks like Ubisoft is taking a big gamble, and meddling with the format. All changes bring the threat of a core player-base‚Äôs fury, but it looks like the goal with the showcase is to ease everyone in to the second decade of the game‚Äôs existence with careful explanation. (There will always be those who would prefer their favorite game wither and die than ever evolve or advance, but they need to shhhhhhhh.)</p><p>Here‚Äôs a thought: The brief information about the changes mentions ‚Äúdeepened tactical gameplay,‚Äù and I can‚Äôt help wondering if there might be a desire to return to <em>Rainbow Six</em>‚Äôs roots. When the first game came out in 1998, it was wholly different to the <em>R6</em> people know today. Most significantly, you didn‚Äôt control a single character, but rather an entire squad. Those first few games were about <em>planning‚Äî</em>you we given detailed briefings about what your team needed to achieve, and then you strategized your approach all before ever showing up. Played best, the bit with soldiers running around was just the unfolding of pre-determined plans, with on-the-fly improvisation if something went wrong.</p><p>It‚Äôd be fascinating if <em>Siege</em> were to think about adding modes that re-evoked the series‚Äô original spirit.</p><p>We‚Äôll find out what Ubisoft are actually up to in just under a month.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The modders have perfectly captured Goku SSJ4 Daima‚Äôs essence in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Former Activision-Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, widely regarded as one of the worst CEOs in gaming, believes someone else deserves that title in a textbook case of the pot calling the kettle black.</p>
<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grit podcast</a>, the former Activision Blizzard CEO and former EA chief creative officer Bing Gordon revealed that they used to consider former EA and Unity CEO John Riccitiello as the worst CEO in the video game industry. At Activision, they thought that he was so bad that they hoped he would continue to be CEO so that they wouldn't have to worry about EA, and Activision would have paid for Riccitiello to be the EA CEO forever. Quite a statement, considering everything that happened at the publisher during Kotick's long tenure, which included prolonged workplace harassment, of which he was reportedly aware for years, that led to <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-california-lawsuit-discrimination-harassment/">a lawsuit in California.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="#229 Bobby Kotick, former CEO of Activision Blizzard; and Bing Gordon, Advisor at Kleiner Perkins" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D2urSgcuyyo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bobby Kotick has been Activision Blizzard's CEO for over two decades, sitting at the head of the publisher since he took over in 1991. He stayed as CEO for <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-kotick-depart/">a few weeks</a> after Microsoft's acquisition of the publisher finally went through as per Phil Spencer's request, and finally stepped down on January 1st, 2024. He has always been regarded by many as the actual worst CEO in gaming, although the former EA and Unity CEO could give him a run for his money, as Riccitiello has been involved in a multitude of anti-consumer controversies, including attempting back in late 2023 to introduce <a href="https://wccftech.com/unity-suffers-huge-backlash-for-runtime-fee-based-on-installs-then-rushes-to-clarify-some-points/">a runtime fee for the Unity engine</a> which would essentially charge developer per install. The backlash was so severe that Riccitiello had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-steps-down-following-runtime-fee-fiasco/">step down as CEO of the company </a>shortly after the whole fiasco.</p>

A Hara-Kiri finisher, first introduced in 2004‚Äôs Mortal Kombat: Deception, sees the defeated player cause their own death with a self-Fatality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What‚Äôs interesting here is that InfiniteNightZ found Hara-Kiri animations for recently released DLC characters, such as Ghostface, adding credence to the speculation that they will be added to Mortal Kombat 1 in a future update rather than left on the cutting room floor. ‚ÄúAfter seeing that they're adding it to the downloaded roster now, I think it's highly possible,‚Äù <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1iqzfw2/harakiri_exit_animations_liu_kang_conan/md4dth1/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InfiniteNightZ said</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">InfiniteNightZ then suggested the Hara-Kiri animations could arrive as Quitalities, given that‚Äôs how they‚Äôre referenced in the game‚Äôs code. Quitalities are quick-fire finishers that trigger when a player quits a multiplayer match, and have been in previous games in the series. ‚ÄúThey are listed as Quitalities, there's still hope,‚Äù <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1iqzfw2/harakiri_exit_animations_liu_kang_conan/md5ippu/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InfiniteNightZ said of the animations</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">High-profile Mortal Kombat 1 dataminer Interloko found additional Hara-Kiri animations, after InfiniteNightZ‚Äôs find was made public.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">‚Äî Interloko (@interloko) <a href="https://twitter.com/interloko/status/1891241739215671554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this may all amount to nothing, and it‚Äôs worth noting that neither NetherRealm nor publisher Warner Bros. Games has announced Quitalities for Mortal Kombat 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat 1 recently enjoyed a resurgence with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-mortal-kombat-1-community-is-working-together-to-try-to-figure-out-how-to-fight-floyd-but-the-exact-process-remains-a-mystery-for-now">the addition of a secret fight with Floyd</a>, the pink ninja, and the community-driven effort to work out his unlock conditions. Meanwhile, Mortal Kombat 1 fans have<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-chief-ed-boon-teases-t-1000-fatality-and-future-dlc"><u> the T-1000 guest character to look forward to</u></a>, and potentially more DLC to come, although NetherRealm has yet to confirm that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
