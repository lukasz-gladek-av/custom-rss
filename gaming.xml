            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/who-is-emio-nintendo-tease-new-switch-horror-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo are either teasing a new horror game for Nintendo Switch, or taking one of the more unusual directions for a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> reveal, with the release of a creepy new teaser trailer:</p>
<p><iframe title="Emio" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hq_NGMM2FWE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So who, or what, is Emio? Well, per <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/07/nintendo-releases-mysterious-emio-teaser-trailer">Gematsu</a>, the trailer in Japan is titled “The Smiling Man”, while US and EU regional accounts have titled it “Emio”, though that doesn’t really answer the question.</p>
<p>The Japanese video also links to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/emio/index.html">this teaser website</a>.</p>
<p>So… who wants some baseless speculation?</p>

<p>There’s obviously some jokes to be made that Nintendo could be taking a very PlayStation 2 direction for the reveal of their next console:</p>
<p><iframe title="PlayStation 2 advert: Welcome To The Third Space | 2000 | #20YearsOfPlay" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Laf9vpJMDjA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alternatively, this is a gritty reboot of the Luigi’s Mansion series, despite the popularity of the games with their original family friendly form of spookiness.</p>
<p>But we’d put our money on something completely different. Nintendo doesn’t have the greatest history with horror games themselves, with just a few notable exceptions. It was really during the Nintendo GameCube era that the Japanese company tried to shake off the reputation as being exclusively about kids and family friendly games. During that time Nintendo published Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem by Silicon Knights (who shut down in 2014), and penned the exclusivity deal with Capcom for the GameCube exclusivity of the Resident Evil, Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil 4.</p>
<p>All of that is to say, this is definitely <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/02/capcom-confirms-the-next-resident-evil-is-coming-from-resident-evil-7-director/">Resident Evil 9</a> and it’s a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive.</p>
<p>Or maybe not.</p>
<p>I don’t know.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/once-human-review-bomb-prompts-publisher-to-address-privacy-concerns.923784/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/once-human-review-bomb-privacy-netease-response<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Once Human</em>, a new post-apocalyptic free-to-play game, is being review-bombed by concerned players over what they perceive to be an overly invasive privacy policy, prompting a response from publisher NetEase.</p>
<p>A quick look at the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam review page</a> shows an abundance of negative reviews, many of them pointing to the game's privacy policy (although some are simply criticizing the game's mechanics and content).</p>
<p>One user <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/dShmoni/recommended/2139460/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">describes</a> what they see as the "over-collection of personal information" and "security risks", while another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971480044/recommended/2139460/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> they "nope[d] the hell out and exited" after reading&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>'s terms of service.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/once-human-privacy-concerns-review-bomb-bow.jpg?itok=RrAzHdie 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/once-human-privacy-concerns-review-bomb-bow.jpg?itok=Ze-XNoMi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Post-apocalyptic survival game&nbsp;<em>Once Human&nbsp;</em>is racking up a lot of negative reviews right now.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/news/update/20240710/40780_1166424.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new FAQ</a> on&nbsp;the official&nbsp;<em>Once Human&nbsp;</em>website, publisher NetEase responds to players' concerns by describing how it uses the data it collects and attempting to allay fears regarding the collection of unnecessary information.</p>
<p>NetEase says it "only collect[s] and use[s] personal data according to specific purposes". For instance, the studio says it would only "collect government-issued IDs" if local laws required it to, pointing to prize distribution, the need to identify a user's parent for consent, or if a user "wishes to correct their age information".</p>
<p>The publisher also clarifies that the "Chinese named program" running in the background of&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>&nbsp;is a WebView Helper, which "supports WebView page rendering" within the game.</p>
<p>Lastly, NetEase says that it's not necessary to download the NetEase Launcher if you're playing <em>Once Human</em> on Steam or the Epic Store, although it is needed if you've downloaded the game through NetEase's official website.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/once-human-privacy-concerns-review-bomb-monument.jpg?itok=YVId16_v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/once-human-privacy-concerns-review-bomb-monument.jpg?itok=Rgx_3yYe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>NetEase has attempted to quell&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>&nbsp;privacy concerns.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether or not NetEase's assurances do anything to allay users' fears about privacy remains to be seen, but it's not the only weirdness surrounding&nbsp;<em>Once Human&nbsp;</em>right now.</p>
<p>Yesterday, just before&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>'s launch, NetEase revealed that players would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/once-human-faq-one-character">only be able to create a single character per account at launch</a>, with multi-character creation support arriving sometime in August.</p>
<p>However, after players criticized this decision, NetEase almost immediately reversed it, announcing yesterday that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139460/view/4230650600759863513" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multi-character creation was now possible</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure why NetEase decided to restrict character creation in the first place. In the aforementioned FAQ, the studio says this decision was made "due to technical issues", but the fact that it was so easy to reverse casts an uneasy light on the whole matter.</p>
<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>&nbsp;is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and mobile devices, assuming that you can stomach its privacy policy.</p>

            <p>Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka wants to know why the hell Sonic Team haven’t made their own Sonic The Hedgehog <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> yet. He sounds positively hysterical about it, hopping mad, which you know, mate, you’ve been running the show since 2008. You’ve been working on Sonic games since <em>1994</em>. I too yearn to bound through the Star Post portal and into a world where Sonic has to min-max his trainers and do companion quests for Big The Cat. The spinning ball of spines is in your court, Iizuka-san. The people of Mobius are ready. Mario has had that genre all to himself for long enough.</p><!--more-->
<p>Iizuka made these innocent remarks during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNeWQbiawnk">a Good Vibes Gaming interview</a> at a Sonic x Shadow Generations preview event - this being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/keanu-reeves-to-play-shadow-in-the-sonic-3-movie-as-sega-announce-the-year-of-shadow">the year of Shadow</a>. They were subsequently pounced upon by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-team-head-wants-to-make-a-sonic-rpg-before-he-retires-from-sega">Eurogamer</a>’s Ed Nightingale, who notes that Sonic Team have worked on RPGs in the past, such as Phantasy Star Universe, and as such, have no excuses save boring commercial ones.</p>
<p>"Personally, I really like role-playing games," he said. "The RPG game format is a lot of fun and I've even thought to myself you know, for the past 30 years we haven't done a Sonic RPG. And I'm questioning myself. Why haven't we done a Sonic RPG in all this time? How have we gotten to 30 years with no RPGs?!" </p>
<p>"So I'd like to hopefully work on a Sonic RPG at some point before I retire from Sega,” Iizuka went on. “But you know, that's just a dream right now. There are no concrete plans at this point." Again, Mr Iizuka, I must loom sinisterly and remind you that you are the head of Sonic Team. Make those plans concrete. Yes, I know it’s more complicated than this, I know <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-cancel-hyenas-and-several-unannounced-games-due-to-covid-era-losses">Sega aren’t in the mood for passion projects at the moment</a>, but come now - the only extant official Sonic RPG is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Chronicles%3A_The_Dark_Brotherhood">a third-party project for Nintendo DS</a>, which I’m not allowed to write about or Graham will break my knees.</p>
<p>I want a Sonic Team-made Sonic RPG for exactly two reasons: I think it might be great, and I think it might be awful. Sonic games have a habit of veering in either direction, especially those released after 2001, but perhaps those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-mania">Mania</a> people fancy another bite of the apple. Either way, it’s an entertaining prospect. Gotta go fast? No Sonic, you gotta go after Tails has his turn, and also, you’re out of mana, so no spin-dash for you. It’s just as well that we have <a href="https://ethybb8-games.itch.io/sonic-rpg">Itch.io developers to fill the gap</a>.</p>

NBA Legend Vince Carter will be the cover star for the chunky NBA 2K25 Hall of Fame Edition.</p><p>Ball Over Everything is the slogan for NBA 2K25, which puts an NBA and WNBA player on the same cover for the first time ever. Tatum called his appearance on the cover "humbling" even after winning the NBA Championship with the Boston Celtics, while back-to-back WNBA champion, two-time WNBA Most Valuable Player, and six-time WNBA All-Star Wilson said her appearance is a testament to the women's league's growth.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>NBA 2K25 Covers and First Look</h3></div></output><p>"Being featured on the NBA 2K25 cover is a big moment for me and a testament to the ever-growing fandom of the WNBA," she said. "Seeing more and more WNBA athletes scanned into NBA 2K25 to best capture the style and confidence of the league has been empowering, and I can't wait for fans to experience it in-game."</p><p>NBA 2K25 promises the usual MyCAREER and MyTEAM modes on all platforms, though PS5 and Xbox Series X and S, and PC players will gain access to additional features too. This includes "a sixth era in MyNBA, a more compact and interactive City, the chance to cement their G.O.A.T. status in The W," and cross-play.</p><p>The Standard Edition of NBA 2K25 has Tatum on the cover and costs $69.99 on all platforms except Nintendo Switch, where it's available for $59.99. The WNBA Edition is a GameStop exclusive and is a repackaged version of the PS5 and Xbox Series X and S physical editions with Wilson on the cover, available for $69.99.</p><p>The All-Star Edition has both aforementioned athletes on the front, costs $99.99, and comes with 100,000 VC; MyTEAM content including 10 Player Cards (and three above 89 OVR), 3 Diamond Shoe Cards, 3 Takeover Boost, and 1 Amethyst Coach Card; and MyCAREER content including 150 Skill Boosts, 75 Gatorade Boosts, the Jayson Tatum Cover Jersey, Jayson Tatum Electric Skateboard Skin, and a 2K25 Cover Stars Design T-Shirt.</p><p>Finally, the Hall of Fame Edition has Carter on the front is available with limited availability until September 8 for $149.9 for all platforms except the Nintendo Switch. It includes everything included in the All-Star Edition plus a MyCAREER Vince Carter Cover Jersey, a Season 1 Pro Pass with four upfront Pro Pass rewards, and a 12 month subscription to the real world NBA League Pass.</p><p>NBA 2K is the only mainline basketball franchise available but has faced criticism over its intrinsic microtransactions and in recent years over its forced open world elements. NBA 2K25 appears to be addressing one of those complaints with the "more compact and interactive city" on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC.</p><p>In our 6/10 review of the last game, IGN said: "NBA 2K24 scores big with gameplay, but its microtransaction tactics feel like a costly turnover."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

		<p>Time travelling first person VR puzzle adventure <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wanderer-the-fragments-of-fate">Wanderer: The Fragments of Fate</a> has been delayed again to 31st October 2024. The VR remake will be coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PSVR 2</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 2 and 3</a>, and SteamVR, and there’s a new trailer delving into some of the characters and time periods you’ll run through:</p>
<p><iframe title="Wanderer: The Fragments of Fate  | Icons &amp; Eras Deep Dive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PEeE922BMXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A remake of the 2022 game Wanderer – a bit odd, but Mighty Eyes clearly felt that there was more they could do with the same core – The Fragments of Fate blends together first person exploration and combat with time-travelling puzzles and possibilities, throwing you (as Asher Newman) into a quest to save the world.</p>
<p>The trailer shows how Boston in 2061 has been turned into a flooded swamp, where you’ll have to fight past bandits to reach Asher’s grandfather’s apartment with a quirky looking watch that will become your time travel AI buddy.&nbsp;Like Quantum Leap, each time jump with thrust you into another person’s body, the first jump putting you in the boots of Neil Armstrong in 1969, though with the moon landing having gone rather wrong. From there you’ll reach an ancient Mayan landscape in the 1500s.</p>
<p>Wanderer: The Fragments of Fate will sometimes have you explore the same locations in different time periods, or the same place and time as different people. Naturally, your actions will alter time and change what you see from different angles.</p>

<p>The game was announced for PSVR 2 back in February with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/23/zombie-army-vr-the-wizards-wanderer-the-fragments-of-fate-and-more-announced-for-psvr-2/">a much more action oriented trip to WW2</a>, grabbing guns out of your inventory, it shows the breadth and variety of what Wanderer: The Fragments of Fate will offer. At that point, the game was set for a 27th June release, but developer Mighty Eyes has now twice pushed the launch back, first to September, and now to 31st October 2024.</p>
<p>As a remake, Mighty Eyes has also decided to offer a 20% discount to owners of Wanderer from PlayStation VR and SteamVR.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-co-op-hit-we-were-here-forever-passes-one-million-sales.923739/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/we-were-here-forever-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Total Mayhem Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>We Were Here Forever&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a million since the game's launch all the way back in May 2022.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/WeWereHereGame/status/1810916968624508959" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the developer celebrates the new milestone, pledging to "continue making awesome games for you &amp; for more Explorers to join us along the way".</p>
<p>As <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/bramvanlith?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted by PR exec Bram van Lith</a>, who's worked with Total Mayhem on a number of&nbsp;<em>We Were Here&nbsp;</em>games, this marks the third game in the&nbsp;<em>We Were Here&nbsp;</em>series to cross the million mark, which is pretty impressive for a humble little series of indie co-op puzzlers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/we-were-here-forever-sales-snow.jpg?itok=vLut_iqB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/we-were-here-forever-sales-snow.jpg?itok=xXY9UERo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We Were Here Forever&nbsp;</em>is the third game in the series to break a million sales.</figcaption></figure><p>Technically, van Lith doesn't say which other two games in the series crossed the million barrier, but it's likely that the other two are&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/we-were-here-too-review-cooperation-required">We Were Here Too</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chilly-co-op-adventure-we-were-here-together-launches-october-10th"><em>We Were Here Together</em></a>.</p>
<p>The first game in the series,&nbsp;<em>We Were Here</em>, is free, and the latest,&nbsp;<em>We Were Here Expeditions: The FriendShip</em>, was given away for free for the first month or so of its release, so the sales figures are unlikely to apply to those games (although it's not impossible).</p>
<p>As of October last year, however, the entire series had <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/the-we-were-here-franchise-gave-away" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sold a combined total of almost five million units</a>, so it's generally been a very successful run indeed for Total Mayhem. Here's hoping the next game, whatever it turns out to be, continues this hot streak.</p>

<p><em>Forever&nbsp;</em>sees players teaming up to explore a castle in order to solve puzzles and hopefully escape. Puzzles are designed around co-op, and since both players have limited information, there's no split-screen co-op mode; instead, you'll use walkie-talkies to communicate with your partner remotely.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/10/price-increases-and-new-tiers-are-coming-to-xbox-game-pass<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Starting today, Xbox Game Pass will be experiencing some changes which includes redefining of certain tiers. And later this year, there will be a handful of price increases for various tiers. Here's the exact text as it is presented on <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/game-pass-updates-july-2024">Microsoft's website</a>.</p>



<p>The new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>PC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but that tier will still include Day One releases.</p>

<p>All of these price changes will be reflected starting on September 12.</p>

<p>Price changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating. What do you think of the change? Do you plan on maintaining your subscription? Or is it time to cancel?</p>

			<p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim continues to be an impressive game even over ten years since its original launch, mostly thanks to the work of modders who have improved gameplay mechanics and visuals considerably over the years.</p>
<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dreams</a> shared today a new video showcasing how the fifth entry in the series by Bethesda can look in 2024 with a vast selection of mods, over 3100 mods, including the Complete RT shader by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/NiceGuy147" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NiceGuy</a>, an advanced screen space ray tracing shader that lets users add global illumination with effects like Diffuse Illumination and Specular Reflection, ambient occlusion, and glossy reflections to any game.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K60] Skyrim Ultra Modded graphics 3100+Mods - Wunduniik Modlist with Complete Raytracing" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y1NZ1O3csXw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With Bethesda hard at work on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-officially-in-early-development-but-you-wont-hear-any-more-about-it-for-some-time/">sixth entry in the series</a>, it is unlikely we are going to see a proper The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim remake that will take advantage of modern technology to present the game's world like never before. The game, however, is already in a better spot than when it was released, as it was remastered back in 2016 with the Special Edition, which includes the base game, all of the expansions, remastered art and effects, volumetric god rays, dynamic depth of field, screen-space reflections, and more. Another version of the game, the Anniversary Edition, was launched in 2021 to celebrate the game's 10th anniversary with new content and some gameplay tweaks.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Xbox 360 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

That’s next year! Having already waited well over two years, another five months feels too much. But at least we now have something tangible to look forward to.</p><p>For those unfamiliar with the show, it follows a group of workers that are part of a “severance program,” that separates a person’s work memories from their life outside of the office, the two resulting personalities dubbed innies and outies. </p><p>The show heavily depicts the life of the innies to be one filled with constant workplace abuse, and centers around both the innies and outies fighting to gain a better life. Season 1 wrapped up with a lot of cliffhangers about the future of the severance program and the workers who are a part of it, but the season 2 teaser puts them right back in the office. With all the memory shenanigans, it’s possible season 2 could pick up with characters having no memory of the final moments of the first season. </p><p>Hopefully musician SZA is happy to know when she can watch the second season, even if it isn’t “right the fuck now” as she had begged for in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.complex.com/music/a/tracewilliamcowen/sza-ben-stiller-severance-season-two?d_id=7623969&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.complex.com/music/a/tracewilliamcowen/sza-ben-stiller-severance-season-two?d_id=7623969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media post this May</a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/vr-pvp-shooter-frenzies-announced-for-psvr-2-meta-quest-by-ndreams/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>VR specialists at nDreams and developer Near Light have revealed Frenzies, a new virtual reality multiplayer shooter that embraces chaos and showing off in the combat arena. Frenzies is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PSVR 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest</a>.</p>
<p>A closed alpha test will kick off on 18th July on Quest – sign up via the game’s <a href="https://discord.gg/frenziesvr">Discord</a> – with more details on the game to come in the months ahead.</p>
<p><iframe title="FRENZIES ANNOUNCE TRAILER | nDREAMS | META QUEST &amp; PS VR2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Lw4S8zu9kw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Frenzies will look to build upon the rich pedigree of precision FPS gunplay found within games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/19/fracked-review-psvr-shooter/">Fracked</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/29/synapse-review-psvr2/">Synapse</a> by nDreams, though Frenzies is in development by their 2022 acuisition, Shooty Fruity developer Near Light.</p>
<p>What Frenzies hopes to capture is the chaotic PvP gameplay that has made games like Gorilla Tag so popular in VR. Making that happen is a ‘lucky dip’ gameplay format, so the lobbies of 12 players shift between different maps, game mode types that create and break up alliances, and swapping to and from free-for-all and team play. Fast and fluid VR movement will combine with ziplines and grabbing onto cover to hide behind. At the end of it, your performances across five rounds will determine the winner.</p>

<p>However, it’s not just about winning, because you’ll want to look good doing it. Character models are all in hooded onesies with LED displays for faces, and you’ll naturally be able to customise your look, but then there’s all the free movement and posing of VR available to you for when you want to showboat and muck around. The 1:1 motion tracking and things like finger tracking on PSVR 2’s Sense controllers will allow for more varied gestures, and the trailer shows off moments where a player is captured and then… well, it’d be much more gruesome if they weren’t stylised characters, so it’s best not to think about it too much.</p>
<p>Near Light head of studio Paul Mottram on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/10/ps-vr2-frenzies-revealed-new-metro-awakening-gameplay-details-wanderer-the-fragments-of-fate-in-depth-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog</a>, “Right from when we first started working on Frenzies, we wanted it to have a real sense of fun. We didn’t want to create a straight-faced, military sim and instead took our inspiration from bombastic arena shooter classics such as Quake and Unreal Tournament. We felt that by taking the essence of those games and sprinkling in a dose of unpredictability, we’d landed on something that’s easy to play, challenging to master and leaves you with a big grin on your face every time. We think that there’s something for everyone in Frenzies and even experienced VR shooter fans will have their skills tested in new ways.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nba-2k25-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K has announced the&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>release date, as well as the cover stars you can expect to see on the various different editions of the game. What's more, there's some good news for PC players this year as well.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/ball-over-everything-nbar-2k25-features-nba-champion-jayson-tatum-two-time-wnba-mvp-aja-wilson-and-hall-of-fame-legend-vince-carter-as-cover-athletes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on its official website</a>, 2K confirms that the&nbsp;release date for&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>is September 6th, and that you'll be able to play it across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p>
<p>The game's cover stars will be Jayson Tatum, who'll be appearing on&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25</em>'s Standard Edition cover art; A'ja Wilson, who's the cover athlete for the All-Star and WNBA Editions; and Vince Carter, who's gracing the cover of the Hall of Fame Edition.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nba-2k25-release-date-cover-athletes.jpg?itok=H3FR1mI7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nba-2k25-release-date-cover-athletes.jpg?itok=TxSWobq1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here are your three&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>cover athletes.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're an&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K&nbsp;</em>PC player, you'll likely be aware of the series' history of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-nba-2k24-gameplay-trailer">releasing the last-gen versions of the game</a> on PC, but that practice apparently ends with&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25</em>.</p>
<p>According to the aforementioned announcement post, the PC version of the game will be the "New-Gen" version this year, meaning it'll be equivalent to the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions rather than the PS4 and Xbox One versions.</p>
<p>That means you can expect the vaunted ProPLAY system in the PC version this time around, as well as modes like The W, which allows you to compete in the WNBA, and The City, an open-world hub with sidequests and other distractions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, crossplay still isn't supported between PC and current-gen consoles, it seems. 2K says crossplay "will only be available on New-Gen consoles", so it sounds like the PC version isn't included.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nba-2k25-release-date-cover-athletes-box-art.jpg?itok=XqoYkyKH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nba-2k25-release-date-cover-athletes-box-art.jpg?itok=pcVHFLgQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>will have several different box art styles to choose from.</figcaption></figure><p>2K has yet to reveal the first&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>gameplay footage, but we do know the game will feature "a more compact and interactive" version of the City, as well as "the franchise's most true-to-life basketball experience yet".</p>
<p><em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox on September 6th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Described as “the company responsible for the licensing business of ‘<em>Palworld</em>’,” the purpose is (prepare for corporate bollocks) “accelerating the multifaceted global development of <em>Palworld</em> and its further expansion!” In other words, plushies and shit.</p><p>It is, if anything, an incredibly slow response to the enormous success of the game, that back in January saw an eye-watering 2.1 million people playing the game at once, making it the second-most popular game on Steam, <em>ever</em>. </p><p>Six months on, that number is now a tremendously more modest 90k, but still an impressive tail at a point where most games have faded into the background. Of course, there’s a good chance the slowness of this reaction could have been influenced by the then-presumed need to prepare for Nintendo’s notoriously furious lawyers. However, half a year later, there’s not been a peep, with Pocketpair confirming as much to former <em>Kotaku</em> EiC Stephen Totilo’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/palworld-pocketpair-takuro-mizobe-interview?utm_source=publication-search&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/palworld-pocketpair-takuro-mizobe-interview?utm_source=publication-search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game File newsletter</a></span>. Presumably this created enough confidence that the game was in the clear, such that console rival Sony would be prepared to get involved, albeit through an entirely different arm of the company.</p><p>And yet, well, we can all pretend that <em>Palworld</em> isn’t unbelievably obviously copying famous Pokémon, but <em>come on</em>.

They will be available “later on.”</p><p>It’s going to be interesting. I genuinely don’t understand how Nintendo will be able to continue sitting on its hands should Palworld Entertainment start selling a Bristla plushie on a store shelf next to one of Pokémon’s Bellossom. Or Jormuntide alongside Gyarados. Let alone the most infamous Grizzbolt and the near-identical Electabuzz.

<p>Riot Games has canceled a 2D fighting game that was similar to Super Smash Bros, according to a new report from <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-smash-melee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mikhail Klimentov</a>.</p>



<p>Known internally as “Pool Party”, the game was to be set in the League of Legends universe, and was being worked on by about “70-80 employees”. The game was canceled in May.</p>



<p>“Riot Games saw an opportunity to build and support the game’s esports scene — unlike Nintendo, which is notoriously hands-off and even hostile toward the Smash competitive ecosystem,” the report reads.</p>



<p>Klimentov’s sources said that the game’s cancelation happened because of a “reassessment of consumer appetite for a Smash competitor.” He added that Riot was “spooked” by the apparent failure of MultiVersus.</p>



<p>Pool Party was originally slated to be a “hardcore fighting game” before the game’s scope was changed to include party elements and a more casual feel. The report states that the changes had “frustrated” people on the project.</p>



<p>In a statement given to Klimentov, Riot senior communication director Joe Hixson said, “We always have a number of projects in various phases of R&amp;D, and spinning projects up and down happens multiple times a year.”</p>



<p>As far as the employees working on the game, at least half were moved to other projects within the company while others were looking to be moved to other projects or had left the company.</p>



<p>The development of Pool Part had no impact on Riot’s other fighting game 2XKO, the 2v2 fighting game scheduled for release in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-a-hot-topic-as-microsoft-hikes-xbox-game-pass-prices<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a hot topic in the wake of Microsoft announcing it will increase the price of Xbox Game Pass and introduce a new standard tier which doesn't include day one releases.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-appears-to-be-getting-another-price-hike">Microsoft announced on July 9, 2024 that it's raising the price of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate worldwide</a> and specifically from $16.99 to $19.99 a month in the U.S. Price changes go into effect for new members on July 10, 2024 and for existing members on September 12, 2024.</p><p>The more basic $10.99 Xbox Game Pass Console tier is "soon" being replaced with Xbox Game Pass Standard too — a $14.99 option which doesn't include the beloved day one release feature, "specific entries to the Game Pass Ultimate library," access to EA Play, Xbox Cloud Gaming, perks, Quests, and discounts on games in the Game Pass library.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-and-game-pass-are-about-to-get-a-little-more-expensive">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate was last increased in price in 2023</a>, from $14.99 to $16.99, meaning paying $14.99 a month for Xbox Game Pass therefore nets users significantly less than it did just one year ago, with Microsoft essentially removing day one titles, EA Play, cloud gaming, and free perks from the service in that time.</p><p>But it's the lack of day one titles on the soon standard tier which has some fans most upset, especially as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-with-xbox-game-pass">Call of Duty will finally appear as an Xbox Game Pass title with 2024's Black Ops 6</a> following <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-69-billion-activision-blizzard-buyout-imminent-after-stock-halted-and-uk-clears-deal">Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>.</p><p>Microsoft has been accused of lying about the status of Black Ops 6 on Xbox Game Pass, as in May 2024 the company confirmed it as a day one title and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-insists-it-wont-lock-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-behind-a-new-game-pass-tier-at-launch">made no indication players wouldn't be able to access it on their current subscriptions</a>.</p><p>"Upon launch, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be playable on Xbox and PC for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Xbox Game Pass for Console members," Microsoft said at the time.</p><p>This is true, however. Microsoft said Black Ops 6 will be available on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Xbox Game Pass Console. But it didn't say the first two would see a price increase worldwide or that the final, cheapest tier would be made obsolete.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Catalog</h3><p>This is the complete list of all Xbox Game Pass games. Log in to copy games, make your own rankings, or mark what games you're playing or have completed. Sort by "Recently Added" to see the newest additions to the catalog.</p></div><p>Microsoft couldn't even guarantee games like Black Ops 6 would come to Xbox Game Pass Standard eventually. These titles "may be added to the library at a future date," it said.</p><p>So the implication at the time that Black Ops 6 would be available through the $10.99 a month subscription is no longer true unless you're subscribed to that tier already, as new customers can't sign up for it. Instead of that $10.99, the cheapest Game Pass tier through which Xbox console players can now access Black Ops 6 is the bumped up Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, at $19.99 a month.</p><p>Fans are therefore a little frustrated, with many saying they plan to cancel their Xbox Game Pass subscriptions once their current run ends.</p><p>"No no, we're not changing Game Pass, we're not doing a price increase, putting Black Ops 6 on Game Pass hasn't change Game Pass pricing," mocked <a href="https://x.com/CODWarfareForum/status/1810926357913710862" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@CODWarfareForum</a> on X/Twitter. "Two months later: Oh yeah we lied again, we're increasing Game Pass subs and we're changing the tiers."</p><p>"Xbox Game Pass prices set to increase by 25%, just in time for the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 release," said <a href="https://x.com/GNGNewsCOD/status/1810908318098981232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@GNGNewsCOD</a>. "Xbox Game Pass's new pricing is basically the 'Call of Duty day one tax' and it's getting seriously wild how expensive subscriptions are become for both PlayStation and Xbox," added <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1810835932406276319" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@SynthPotato</a>. "It's now official despite previous reassurances the standard version of Xbox Game Pass will not include day one titles like the next Call of Duty, Doom, or Indiana Jones," said <a href="https://x.com/oliver_drk/status/1810811331861241886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@oliver_drk</a>.</p><p>Others said they expected the release of Black Ops 6 to bump up Game Pass prices, though they're not necessarily happy about it. "Makes too much sense... incoming COD," said SnatcherHunter on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/windows-central-xbox-game-pass-is-getting-major-changes-new-%E2%80%98standard%E2%80%99-tier-option-for-new-members-with-no-day-one-games-price-increases.923187/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>. "Day one COD doesn't sound so good now," said ChEmIcAl_KeEn on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1dzedib/game_pass_ultimate_price_increase_coming_might_be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>.</p><p>"I thought this would happen in September before Call of Duty. The monthly costs are adding up," said <a href="https://x.com/Otikage/status/1810872072853213288" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Otikag</a><a href="https://x.com/Otikage/status/1810872072853213288" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">e</a> on X/Twitter. "Price increase was expected though, all those studios to cater for. I am sure the price is just gonna keep going up with more acquisitions."</p><p>Rumors around a spike have circulated since May 2024, essentially since Microsoft announced Black Ops 6 would be coming as a day one title. The price rise also comes after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">Microsoft shut down entire studios</a> including Hi-Fi Rush and Ghostwire Tokyo developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

But apparently, there's something spooky on the horizon, judging by Nintendo's creepy new teaser. It tells us nothing about the game--not even its title. But it does pose a single question: Who is Emio?</p><p>We're assuming that Emio is the man in the trench coat with a paper bag over his head that has a hand-drawn face on it. Nintendo isn't exactly known for its Mature-rated horror games, but that's what this appears to be unless Luigi's Mansion 4 is taking a very dark turn.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Emio - Nintendo Switch Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Emio does have a listing <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/emio/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Nintendo's home page</a>, which is also lacking in details. What it does reveal is that the smiling man's expressions can change. And as unsettling as his current look is, one of Emio's alternate expressions is even more sinister.</p><p>Now that the teaser is out, Nintendo will presumably clue fans in soon enough. But as far as first impressions go, Emio feels very unsettling and unlike the vast majority of the publisher's titles. Regardless, it would be intriguing to see Nintendo take a stab at a M-rated horror game, if that's what Emio turns out to be.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-in-progress/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Following the chaotic and potentially world-ending events of both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/24/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-review/">Endwalker</a> and its successive updates, Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail promises new adventures in Tural that have a more laid back, summer holiday tone to them. The past week has seen me dive into a little bit of everything that this grand new expansion offers, already racing up to around level 96, for anyone keeping count.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV: DAWNTRAIL Full Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgiuQwzB6aU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Narratively, Dawntrail follows the Warrior of Light in their objective to aid Wuk Lumat in the rite of succession for what is essentially the throne of Tural, a nation to the west of Sharlayan. This rite comes with challenges aplenty, but also brings with it returning characters we all love, new characters to fall in love with, and – even by the point I’m at in the story – enough twists to round out a decent mystery novel.</p>


<p>The thing I want to strongly stress early on is the relaxed nature of this new story arc overall. This is essentially starting an entirely new tale for the world of Final Fantasy XIV, so it has a slower pace than previously. I’m personally loving the lower stakes at play here, but those coming into this expecting another Shadowbringers will be greatly disappointed. However, Wuk Lamat herself is incredible and I won’t hear anything opposing that view.</p>
<p>By and large, you’ll be running around Tural helping out various NPCs with various returning gameplay mechanics while exploring, such as following folks without them noticing. As and when you get into a scrape with enemies, the combat is much the same as before, though with all of the existing Jobs having been tweaked in small or severe ways. Thankfully my precious White Mage has been changed very little, but your go-to favourite might have had a bigger overhaul.</p>


<p><span data-contrast="auto">Then there’s the new Jobs – Pictomancer and Viper. I’ve not been able to spend a great deal of time with either of them, but in my early impressions they feel like completely different ends of the spectrum from one another. Viper is the smooth-brained, push buttons and see swishes accompanied by big numbers one, while Pictomancer is the galaxy-brained one with odd rotations and really long explanations for every ability. Both, however, are amazing additions and I’m looking forward to playing around more with them.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To test out these changes and new Jobs though, we have a bevy of new dungeons and trials, which once again you can tackle with a group of NPCs or – <em>gasp</em> – with other people. These, so far, have been a huge step up in challenge, with some very interesting mechanics to contend with. I can’t claim to be a perfect player of the game by any means, but some of these instances have truly tested my knowledge of my Jobs and their abilities in the game, so more of this please, Yoshi-P.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Visually as well, there has been a significant step up with Dawntrail, especially with the addition of a widespread graphical update with the 7.0 patch. This has made several changes to lighting, textures and character models that will be immediately noticeable to any long-time players of the game. This graphical update has then been leveraged wonderfully in the areas I have visited with some of the most beautiful vistas that have ever been in the game. What’s more, the team know how good this looks, otherwise I cannot explain the reason for the amount of close-up shots of the beautifully upgraded faces in cutscenes.</span></p>

<p>One area that’s business as usual, in the best possible way, is with Soken’s work on the sound design. Every track in this soundtrack is incredible, especially the song playing in Tuliyollal during the day, which has absolute no right going that hard. Oddly, I love the battle theme in the field this time around too, which I haven’t since A Realm Reborn, but that might say more about me than anything.</p>
<p>So far, Dawntrail is an incredible expansion to an already stellar game. Its slower pace and lower stakes create a calmer and more fun atmosphere to explore, but the increased challenge of the combat instances balance that calmness out with frenetic (and panicked) action. The new Jobs are great additions and the changes to previous Jobs (that I’ve seen so far) haven’t broken anything substantial. It might not be the absolute pinnacle of the Final Fantasy XIV experience, but it’s a joy to behold.</p>
<p>Now, onto the next dungeon I go.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-sony-deal<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has announced that it has signed a deal with Sony, as well as the company's subsidiary Aniplex, in order to expand open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>beyond the realm of video games.</p>
<p>The joint venture between Pocketpair and Sony was announced via <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1810850865764589587" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter) earlier today</a>. It bears the imaginative name of Palworld Entertainment, and it's been established for "the purpose of accelerating the multifaceted global development of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and its further expansion". That's a mouthful.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1810850911939678235" rel="noopener" target="_blank">followup message</a>, Pocketpair reveals that the first fruits of its Aniplex partnership are already on the way; soon,&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>merchandise will be up for grabs on the <a href="https://store.aniplexusa.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official Aniplex site</a>, although the studios haven't revealed what kind of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>merch you can look forward to yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-sony-deal-workers.jpg?itok=2b9ymmAe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-sony-deal-workers.jpg?itok=AthdS92y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You're about to see a whole lot more of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't yet know exactly what the deal between Pocketpair and Sony will yield, but given that Aniplex is involved, it's safe to assume we'll be getting some sort of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>anime or animated adaptation.</p>
<p>Technically, Pocketpair's deal is with Sony Music Japan, but it's worth noting that Sony Music does have its fingers in some gaming pies; Aniplex publishes the mobile game&nbsp;<em>Fate/Grand Order</em>, as well as games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-sweep-the-board-gameplay">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Sweep the Board</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/danganronpa-creators-new-game-risking-lives">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a>&nbsp;</em>in Japan.</p>
<p>As such, a partnership with Sony Music doesn't necessarily mean we're in for&nbsp;<em>Palworld: The Album</em>, as much as I'd pay to hear that.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that although no official&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>PS5 version has been announced, it looks that much more likely now thanks to this deal with Sony.</p>

<p>The game launched back in January and quickly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet">gained immense popularity</a>, rocketing up the Steam charts in the weeks after its release. Developer Pocketpair has also released a number of updates for&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/massive-palworld-update-sakurajima">new Pals, a new island, and more</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and it's also available on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. If you're a Game Pass subscriber, you'll be pleased to know it's included with your subscription.</p>

            <p>
A new VR multiplayer game has been announced by nDreams, the developer of Synapse, coming to PSVR 2 and Meta Quest. 
</p>
<p>
Frenzies is an arena multiplayer shooter with gameplay similar to Synapse, split into unpredictable five-round matches with names like Red Light, Green Light and Glitter Pig - it's unclear exactly what that one's about.
</p>
<p>
Round types are both solo and team-based for an unpredictable experience (as the name suggests), all while wearing Squid Game-esque onesies with customisable masks.

<p>

The game has been developed by Near Light, an nDreams Studio. 
</p>
<p>
"The last thing you can accuse Frenzies of is being boring," said Paul Mottram, head of
studio, Near Light. "Taking inspiration from classics like Quake and Unreal Tournament, we
wanted to inject some unpredictable excitement back into the genre while retaining what
makes VR shooters so special. We think Frenzies nails that sweet spot."
</p>
<p>
A closed alpha for the game will begin later this month - you can register interest in <a href="https://discord.com/invite/frenziesVR">the game's discord community</a>.
</p>
<p>
Synapse released last year to critical acclaim, with our Ian Higton describing the game as "some of the best VR blasting out there" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/synapse-a-pure-power-fantasy-that-epitomises-everything-great-about-virtual-reality">Synapse review</a>.

</p>
<p>
Eurogamer also spoke with voice actors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jennifer-hale-and-david-hayter-on-voice-acting-for-vr-reuniting-for-synapse-and-shrivelled-snake">Jennifer Hale and David Hayter on their roles in Synapse</a> and reuniting after working together on Metal Gear Solid.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-reveals-trailer-for-m-rated-game-teases-creepy-%E2%80%98emio%E2%80%99.923643/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-reveals-trailer-for-m-rated-game-teases-creepy-emio/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Nintendo released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbhwwG-QvGQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new cinematic trailer</a> today, teasing an apparent horror game with an M-rating from the ESRB, featuring the mysterious “Emio.”</p>



<p>The trailer is very brief and doesn’t include any details about the plot or release window. Instead, it only features grainy cinematic footage of a man standing in the dark, wearing a paper bag with a smiley-face on it. </p>



<p>The trailer description has no other information either, simply inviting fans to ask, “who is Emio?” with a corresponding hashtag. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This off-brand approach for Nintendo’s Emio trailer both surprised and delighted many fans. It’s unclear if the cinematic nature of the teaser relates to the gameplay itself, possibly hinting at the interactive movie genre. </p>



<p>Most recently, Nintendo held a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive direct showcase</a> in June 2024. It featured 40 minutes of new games and updates that will release in the second half of 2024. That included games with a variety of budgets like Farmagia and The New Denpa Man.</p>



<p>Since today’s new M-rated game didn’t make an appearance during that event, it may not launch anytime this year. </p>



<p>If it arrives in 2025, it may even wait to launch on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Switch successor</a>. But this is only speculation, and Nintendo has not confirmed anything about the Emio game’s release date. Nintendo also recently revealed its plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-says-it-is-working-to-stop-leaks-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prevent gaming leaks</a>, so fans might have to wait for something official to hear more.</p>
