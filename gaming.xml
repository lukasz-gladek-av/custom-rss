			<p>Today, developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have released a new trailer for the highly anticipated game Elden Ring: Nightreign. The video is dedicated to the Ironeye class, one of the classes players will be able to pick while in the game.</p>
<p>According to the official brief, the ethos of the Ironeye is to strike from afar with ranged attacks and deadly precision. They start with a bow and specialize in dexterity-based weapons. The class brings damage and utility to parties brave enough to sojourn into Limveld. Experienced players will also recognize the usefulness of ranged attacks - being able to revive downed party members from a distance during a run can make the difference between surviving the night and not living to see another day. While the Ironeye starts with ranged attacks and has ranged Ultimates, like all Nightfarers, they can use any weapon they discover during a run.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN | Ironeye Character Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2wQ4uE_TPdE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There will be four more classes (or Nightfarers, as they are described in the game) in Elden Ring: Nightreign:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wylder - A balanced all-rounder, effective both in speed and attack power.</li>
<li>Guardian - A tank with heavy attacks and increased damage resistance.</li>
<li>Duchess - A nimble hero with quick attacks and a strong evasive ability.</li>
<li>Recluse - A caster with ranged magical abilities and a healing-based skill</li>
</ul>
<p>These Nightfarers still have to get their dedicated trailers, though. This is likely to happen in short order, given that the game is less than two months away from its planned May 30 launch date.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checking out Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> during the recent Closed Beta Test, Wccftech's Francesco De Meo was eager to play more:</p>
<p><em>FromSoftware isn't just combining its trademark gameplay mechanics with co-op and roguelike mechanics, it is doing so masterfully to deliver an experience that has a lot of potential and could really shine with some tweaks based on the feedback from these pre-release tests.</em></p>
<p>In less than eight weeks, we'll know if FromSoftware can deliver another hit even in a spin-off game dedicated to multiplayer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dock-chipset-4k-support/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Doom and gloom settled on Nintendo Switch 2 fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/developers-say-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-dont-offer-4k-output/">yesterday</a> when it was revealed that the system's devkits don't support 4K resolution outputs. However, there's a good indication that this won't be the case, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4194#post-1702829">Famiiboards forums member Serif</a> provided some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jozskd/the_switch_2_dock_uses_a_realtek_rtd2175ncg/">additional details</a> about the dock's Realtek RTD2175N-CG chipset. Information on this precise model cannot be found online, but the closest model, the RTDN2173 chipset, which is likely a predecessor to the Nintendo Switch 2 dock's chipset, supports DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI HDCP 2.2/1.4 and HDR, as well as video resolutions from 720p up to 8K60Hz, so the dock will be able to output 4K resolution, although it remains to be seen if 4K resolution will be supported by games. Still, even if 4K resolution output is only limited to the system's UI, it will still be a massive improvement over the original Switch, whose interface looks terrible on large 4K screens.</p>
<p>Even without the unlikely lack of 4K resolution support, the Nintendo Switch 2 is setting up to be a massive upgrade over the original system. The console's controllers will also receive some significant upgrades, as the new Pro Controller will likely feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-upgrade-dev-kits/">a headphone jack</a>, suggesting better voice chat support for the new system as well. Thankfully, it won't be long until we finally learn everything there is to know about the Nintendo Switch 2 and how much it will actually be an improvement over its predecessor, as the console will finally be fully unveiled tomorrow, April 2nd.</p>

<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct almost upon us, details about the upcoming console’s Pro Controller have surfaced online.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-upgrades-nbsp">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller Upgrades&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4192#post-1701204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famiboards</a> (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/nintendo-switch-2-unofficial-name/227778/news/fcc-filing-could-indicate-a-possible-upgrade-for-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), FCC Filings for the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller have been revealed, providing an idea about the new upgrades for this device. The filing has been listed for ‘BEE-008’, a controller with both Bluetooth and NFC. Interestingly, the filing suggests that Nintendo could finally add a headphone jack to their Pro Controller for Switch 2.&nbsp;Moreover, the controller should feature a new battery, too.</p>



<p>The community has long requested a headphone jack for the Pro Controllers. When the console is docked, wired audio is impossible unless you are glued to the TV. However, with the upcoming console finally introducing voice chat for the platform, a headphone jack for the Pro Controller seems more likely. We will have to wait for the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event tomorrow to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct-last/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will last one hour</a> and explain everything we need to know about the upcoming console. It will be followed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-gameplay-showcase-dates-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Treehouse: Live</a>, featuring hands-on gameplay for Switch 2 games.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Compulsion Games is ready to bring the world South of Midnight. Its release date comes several years after its announcement, and the developer is preparing everyone for its debut by showcasing start times for its normal and Early Access launches.</p>



<p>If We Happy Few is anything to go by, then we already know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/south-of-midnight-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight</a> is a can’t-miss adventure. Xbox shares Compulsion Games’ affinity for the weird and wonderful, and this is the first project under the Xbox banner. South of Midnight looks like a mature and realized vision, and its release date can’t come soon enough for some. </p>



<p>If you’re after the earliest possible start time, you’ve come to the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-south-of-midnight-release-date">South of Midnight Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Magical and mysterious. Credit to Compulsion Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>April 8 is the confirmed South of Midnight release date, and it’s one of the month’s biggest games.</strong></p>



<p>South of Midnight—at the time of writing—hasn’t been subjected to a delay. It’s had little-to-no controversy and got a lot of hype ahead of its launch. It’s available to Xbox Series X|S and PC users, so let’s see if being available on these platforms helps its sales.</p>



<p>Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-south-of-midnight-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight being on Xbox Game Pass</a> is sure to go in its favor.</p>



<h2 id="h-south-of-midnight-start-times">South of Midnight Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>Expect South of Midnight to launch and get underway at 9 AM PDT / 11 AM CDT / 12 PM EDT / 5 PM BST.</strong></p>



<p>Again, this is for the official launch date. South of Midnight’s release has several editions to consider, so depending on which one you opt for, there’s a chance you’re entitled to Early Access—giving you an earlier start time.</p>



<h2 id="h-south-of-midnight-early-access-start-times">South of Midnight Early Access Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>The Premium and Premium Upgrade Editions come with five days of South of Midnight Early Access.</strong></p>

The Ironeye joins other Nightfarers like the magic-specializing Recluse, the grapple-shot-wielding Wylder, the nimble assassin-like Duchess, and the tank-oriented Guardian for a total of five playable classes revealed in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-trailer-news-everything-we-know/2900-6095/" data-ref-id="2900-6095">Elden Ring Nightreign so far</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Many players got to go hands-on with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-network-test-included-over-30-billion-lost-runes/1100-6530467/" data-ref-id="1100-6530467">Elden Ring Nightreign in February as part of a network test</a>, only for it to be plagued by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-apologizes-for-elden-ring-nightreign-test-server-problems/1100-6529508/" data-ref-id="1100-6529508">server issues that From Software later apologized for</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-explores-exciting-and-unexpected-new-ground-for-from-software/1100-6529377/" data-ref-id="1100-6529377">Elden Ring Nightreign preview</a>, Tamoor Hussain said that the battle royale-inspired nature of Nightreign at first seems like From Software is chasing multiplayer trends but in reality aligns with many of the design principles the studio is known for, calling it "very much a From Software game."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/remaster-experts-nightdive-studios-stand-ready-to-take-on-remastering-ps3-and-xbox-360-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nightdive-studios-very-well-suited-for-hexen-and-heretic-remasters-lead-engine-dev-says/">Nightdive Studios</a> has made it their bread-and-butter to be the team you want remaking and remastering older games. If there's any game you loved when you were a kid that's currently trapped on aging hardware and not easily playable on modern machines, Nightdive is the team you'd want remastering that game.</p>
<p>So far, Nightdive has remastered and remade a number of classics, including its excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/system-shock-remake-shodan-establishes-dominance/">System Shock Remake</a>, The Thing Remastered, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nightdive-announces-turok-3-shadow-of-oblivion-remaster-for-pc-ps5-ps4-switch-and-xbox-one/">Turok</a> franchise, and Star Wars: Dark Forces Remastered, to name a few. The studio has no intention of sticking to games from a certain era, though, and it is looking to take on games from the seventh generation consoles, namely PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 games.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/we-stand-ready-nightdive-says-it-wants-to-start-remastering-xbox-360-and-ps3-era-games/">VGC</a><span>, Larry Kuperman, director of business development at Nightdive Studios, said, "<em>We stand ready</em>," on the subject of remastering and remaking seventh-gen games. However, both Kuperman and Stephen Kick, chief executive officer at Nightdive</span>, added that there are plenty of considerations for remastering seventh-gen games.</p>
<p>"<em>I would begin asking a couple of questions,</em>" said Kuperman. "<em>Was it Xbox 360 exclusive, or was there a PC version out too? Because that also changes things, the little preservation that’s available. Do we have source code? If so, what’s the quality of the source code? How about the assets? Those are the kinds of considerations that we have there. That being said, there were some really good games that came out in that era that shouldn’t be lost.</em>"</p>
<p>Kick then used the 2008 first-person shooter Haze as an example of a game that he and the team at Nightdive believe should be remastered.</p>
<p>"<em>To your point, though, with a game like Haze – let’s say hypothetically we had access to that, and that was our big title for 2028, right? – We would go to the original designers, and we would say: ‘It didn’t do as well as you had hoped, I’m sure you’ve had a lot of time to ruminate and to think about what you would have done differently.</em>"</p>
<p>Kick added that, specifically with Nightdive's remaster of System Shock 2, speaking to the original developers solved many of the issues they were working on, as they could hear directly from the original creators what steps Nightdive should take to properly recreate the original vision.</p>
<p>When it comes to remastering seventh-gen games, the big hang-up has never been games that were available on Xbox 360 or PC in that era. The PlayStation 3's unique CELL architecture has been the infamous roadblock that's kept plenty of PS3-exclusive titles landlocked on Sony's old grill-looking console.</p>
<p>Despite the challenge, Kick is certain that Nightdive is up to the task.</p>
<p><em>"I think that architecture – I mean, I remember the talk when the system was first released, of how difficult it was for developers to ‘get’ it – and that’s a big problem with backwards compatibility [...] So yeah, if we get to that – or I should say when – we get to the PS3 era games, it will be a challenge that we have to face. But I think that we’ve had enough experience to where we can do a serviceable job on a PS3 remaster."</em></p>
<p>Kuperman also added that part of Nightdive's advantage is their internal engine, which has helped them remaster and remake games from multiple eras of consoles. Hopefully, it turns out to be the ace up Nightdive's sleeve to make them the go-to studio for bringing PS3 games into the modern gaming landscape.</p>

                <p>From the original PlayStation through to the PS5 Pro, graphics have always played a key role in marketing that console. Former Sony president Shuhei Yoshida thinks that it might be time for Sony to start focusing on other aspects of video games so that Sony can become popular in a "broader" sense.</p><p>"Up until now, PlayStation's DNA has been driven by values ​​such as 'cutting-edge graphics' that have continued since [Ken] Kutaragi-san's time," Yoshida said to <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/series/rt/2001814.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AV Watch</a> (via a translation by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1906929110980653479" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Genki</a>). "Users have also expected that from PlayStation games. However, it's about time we have to reconsider that. Of course, I think it's necessary to provide the very best--in terms of graphics quality--to those who want it. But, in order to continue to be popular with users in a broad sense, we naturally have to change our way of thinking."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="75915187" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

for photorealistic visuals in several of its biggest games. While games like last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/astro-bot-review-fly-me-to-the-moon/1900-6418277/" data-ref-id="1900-6418277">Astro Bot</a> are an exception to the rule, Sony generally tends to favor a degree of realism with its exclusives. Meanwhile, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick believes that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-boss-believes-games-with-live-action-like-visuals-may-arrive-sooner-than-you-think/1100-6530498/" data-ref-id="1100-6530498">games with live-action-like visuals</a> aren't far away from being realized.</p><p>There are downsides to this, as games striving for realism can look dated after a few years and the cost to produce them has grown enormously. Former Sony executive Shawn Layden has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-aaa-game-development-/1100-6478908/">the AAA video game space is unsustainable due in part to rising development costs</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/">Sony is aiming to speed up its game-development process</a> with AI and machine-learning initiatives.</p><p>Interestingly, Naughty Dog co-founder Andy Gavin recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-founder-reveals-budgets-of-original-games-and-why-they-sold-to-sony/1100-6528634/">revealed the reason why the studio sold itself to Sony</a> back in 2001 was due to rising development costs. As Gavin explained, Naughty Dog spent about $100,000 to develop 1992's Rings of Power, $1.6 million on the first Crash Bandicoot game released in 1996, and $1.6 million on Jak and Daxter in 2001.</p>

                <p>For several years, former Donkey Kong and Pac-Man champion Billy Mitchell's biggest battles shifted from arcade expos to courtrooms over allegations that he cheated on some of his championship runs. Now, Mitchell has emerged victorious in an Australian court against Karl Jobst, a YouTube artist who allegedly defamed Mitchell.</p><p>Jobst has accused Mitchell of cheating numerous times, including his contention <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-donkey-kong-record-holder-billy-mitchell-accused-of-cheating-yet-again/1100-6511134/" data-ref-id="1100-6511134">that Mitchell used an 8-way joystick for Donkey Kong</a> in his record-breaking runs. Via <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/01/donkey-kong-champion-billy-mitchell-wins-defamation-case-australia-youtuber-karl-jobst-ntwnfb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a>, that allegation paled in comparison to Jobst's since-retracted assertion that Mitchell drove another YouTube artist, Apollo Legend, to suicide following his legal settlement with the former champ.</p><p>Jobst's defense in court argued that Mitchell has a reputation for cheating and for suing people who made those accusations. The judge agreed with that characterization of Mitchell, but ruled that Jobst's videos had "severely damaged Mitchell's reputation and caused distress."</p><p>Following the judge's ruling, Jobst must now pay $350,000 plus interest to Mitchell. When Mitchell brought the case to the court, he asked for $400,000 in damages and $50,000 in aggravated damages.</p><p>Mitchell had previously sued Twin Galaxies to force the organization to restore his high scores.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/apothecary-diaries-frog-scene</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i%E2%80%99m-apothecary-diaries-pilled-and-the-frog-scene-made-me-worse.1151184/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/apothecary-diaries-frog-scene<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Apothecary Diaries</em> is a fantastic anime that does something rare for new seasonal shows: Adults can watch it without feeling embarrassed. It respects your intelligence by not spoon-feeding you answers as you suss out the culprits in both its weekly and long-form murder mysteries. It features a fully-realized cast of attractive characters and is a captivating soap opera-flavored political drama.</p><p>While the show premiered in the autumn of 2023, I'd foolishly let it languish in my backlog. I've since corrected this error thanks to online chatter for its second season and the hype around the anime adapting a scene from a light novel that manga readers simply referred to as "the frog scene." The cryptic allure of something called "the frog scene" putting a relatively quiet fandom in such a tizzy piqued my interest enough to get caught up on the anime in time to witness its spectacle.</p><p>As someone who spent their teenage years on Tumblr hyper-fixating over anime ship GIF sets, it's my duty to put you on to the absurd brilliance of the scene. But before I get into why an amphibian had me gnawing on the bars of my enclosure, let me give a brief rundown of the show and why I dig it.&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Apothecary Diaries </em>is best described as a historical series that takes the same comfy drama cadence of shows like <em>House </em>while weaving a palpable will-they-won't-they romance between its leads, like Dana Scully and Fox Mulder in <em>The X Files </em>or Patrick Jane and Teresa Lisbon in <em>The Mentalist</em> (for my fellow "Jisbon" heads out there). The series follows Maomao, a young apothecary forced to work as a servant girl in the Emperor's palace after being kidnapped by bandits. Maomao prides herself on pragmatism, hiding her ability to read so she doesn't attract attention to whatever bullshit the bourgeois are up to. Maomao's also <a href="https://youtu.be/2WysADlv-hQ?si=UGBbYNNP6XGxd1OJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a freak when it comes to poisons</a>, testing all kinds of concoctions on herself to the point of developing an immunity to most of them and disfiguring her arm testing different allergic reactions.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Maomao Loses It | The Apothecary Diaries" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sEAPQEtaTuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>She's able to stay under the radar until a beautiful eunuch named Jinshi witnesses her covertly solve a string of political poisonings that were believed to be a curse plaguing children born of the Emperor's harem of courtesans. In what might be the epitome of begrudgingly becoming important at work, Jinshi appoints Maomao as the lady-in-waiting to the Emperor's favorite concubine as a poison taster and resident Columbo to the castle's stream of politically motivated poisonings.&nbsp;</p><p>Until now, the medical mystery interspersed with the hierarchical drama of the Emperor's concubines, whom the show treats with the same reverence as the feuding houses of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, was what enamored me about the anime rather than its romance. My tune has been forever changed after seeing the frog scene, and now I'm on the verge of strip-mining the fandom for a nugget of information about future "Jinmao" moments.&nbsp;</p><p>In the short time I've been a Jinmao shipper, I've discovered I'm a creature whose brain can only make happy chemicals from watching a man yearn for a woman desperately trying not to be put in a situation. For two seasons, I've witnessed Jinshi try (and fail) to weaponize his bishi wiles against Maomao, <a href="https://youtu.be/-UnlbOn_1fA?si=csi2c56SaIdZ_rJT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gawk at her wearing makeup</a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://youtu.be/NnQ2mA6Kxsg?si=nK311u89H1zW9h06" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stammer over an indirect kiss</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/5ARIu7grF8A?si=f5i1gcKswOex7AzH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly crash out</a> at the possibility of her striking up a tryst with someone else. All the while, Maomao is oblivious to his pining. To her, he's <a href="https://youtu.be/zz_U3xSawTk?si=5VRYsNaBuPrSvQ2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">objectively a beautiful man</a> who the gods made a eunuch to <a href="https://youtu.be/3f8td30TzZ0?si=QTuwoA2AK0HJeBos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prevent all-out war amongst the women</a> in the imperial palace over breaking off a piece of him for themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Add that to the mix of the show, by nature of its title, following Maomao's perspective and being an unreliable narrator. Some characters, like her estranged father, are initially portrayed as downright evil until the show gives him texture outside of her bias against them. For the most part, Maomao's perceptive deductions of people's characters are on the money. However, Maomao only wants to know as much information as necessary for survival in the imperial palace. This brings us to the anatomy of <em>The Apothecary Diaries</em>' frog scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Spoilers for that.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Maomao Falls on Jinshi | The Apothecary Diaries Season 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P6kd-cHggPA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The frog scene is so cliché that it's <em>almost </em>silly to obsess over. Jinshi and Maomao fall off a cliff into a ravine. Jinshi gives her mouth-to-mouth to resuscitate her in a cave under a waterfall. They strip down to avoid hypothermia and stand on top of each other to climb out of a chasm near the opposite end of the cave. When a leaping frog startles Maomao, she loses her balance, and they topple on each other. When Maomao moves to get off Jinshi, he holds her close, placing them in a compromising face-to-face position. Picking up from the previous episode's cliffhanger ending, Maomao's hand brushes against what she believes to be the frog when she readjusts herself off Jinshi. Jinshi tells her to move her hand away, reflexively prompting her to clasp even harder for whatever reason. The dominoes quickly fall in Maomao's head as she pieces together that she's been grabbing his junk—something he shouldn't have anymore—and that Jinshi isn't a eunuch.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Is That a Frog in Your Pocket? | The Apothecary Diaries Season 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0FMchxI2ltk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Before Jinshi confesses his true identity (a mystery the show, despite Maomao, telegraphed episodes into the first season), Maomao cuts him off, saying she must've crushed a frog. This leads to a funny back and forth where Jinshi ricochets from taking offense to feeling oddly complimented by her saying it must've been "a fairly large frog" before culminating in him asking her if she wants to check herself. He lifts her leg, and the two almost kiss before they're interrupted by a rescue party. I apologize for not recognizing that <em>The Apothecary Diaries</em> was operating on this level of romance novella in tandem with its political drama, because now I'm obsessed with this ship.</p><p>Fans—myself included—are so beside ourselves at what amounts to a two-episode-long dick joke pushing our ship to the next level that there are posts scientifically breaking down the average size of a frog to Maomao's proportions and <a href="https://twitter.com/dailykusuriya/status/1905642890606366927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reverse engineering Jinshi's size on Twitter</a>. I've never seen this level of innovation in any fandom I've frequented, and, unlike Maomao, I'd like to learn more. It's taken everything within my power not to call upon the wisdom of folks who've read the light novels and manga to tease other watershed moments that await me in their budding relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>On a deeper level, the moments sandwiched around the frog scene have me in awe of the engaging character writing in <em>The Apothecary Diaries</em>. In a world where every other scene involves a buxom supermodel of a concubine and aesthetic beauty is king, Maomao routinely disparages her appearance. When Maomao strips down to her underwear before Jinshi, she apologizes, saying she'll hide her frail frame as best she can. A slight remark, sure, but it also smacks of her viewing herself as a lowly, unattractive commoner whose appearance anyone of higher social ranking (even a eunuch like Jinshi) would find ugly. Meanwhile, viewers are given a front-row seat to Jinshi's perspective and his awe of her.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, Jinshi, who only views his beauty as a weapon to leverage for political means not yet made clear in the anime, is routinely disarmed by how Maomao is more concerned with the wellbeing of the human underneath his facade by checking his temperature and not fainting into a useless puddle at the sight of him being shirtless. The added cherry on top of this episode is Maomao explicitly spelling out that she <a href="https://twitter.com/dailykusuriya/status/1905670019855405331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perceives Jinshi as a person</a> and not an object to gawk at or some political figure worth smooching up to. This watershed moment development in Jinmao's Shakespearean tale of forbidden romance is all thanks to a frog that hopped in a hole. I, for one, salute the green quadrupedal icon for its service.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gdc-awards-deck-nine-laid-off-developers-life-is-strange-double-exposure"><h3>Deck Nine Takes Back GDC Award From Laid-Off Devs After Failing To Send Anyone To Accept It</h3></a><p>"I keep thinking about all of the opportunities that were denied to us because of our exclusion"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-severance-season-two-review"><h3>Severance Season Two Stuck The Landing</h3></a><p>With big tech trying to automate everything, Severance just keeps feeling more and more relevant</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/den-of-wolves-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview-back-on-that-heist-biz/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the main reasons Wccftech was on-site for GDC 2025 this year was to take part in the first hands-on play sessions for 10 Chambers' upcoming cooperative cyberpunk heist title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/den-of-wolves-qa-10-chambers-goes-back-to-heist-roots-with-a-sci-fi-espionage-flavor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Den of Wolves</a>. First revealed at The Game Awards 2023, Ulf Andersson made his directorial debut with the new studio founded from the ashes of his days designing PAYDAY and PAYDAY 2.</p>
<p>Den of Wolves takes the neo-futuristic approach where corporations are more than people and instead run the world. While you won't see Weyland-Yutani or Arasaka Corp logos on city streets, the sentiment is still very much the same with the megacorps that make up Den of Wolves' setting. As mentioned in my first impressions piece on Den of Wolves, the setting 10 Chambers is working with is a corporate haven known as Midway City, sheltered out in the mid-Pacific that operates outside jurisdictional waters or AI intranets. It's here that a new form of data transmission emerges right out of Johnny Mneumonic's playbook: human brains as cold storage.</p>
<p>Of course, it's quite difficult to convey the concept of brain-jacking and stealing secrets from someone's mind in a two-mission preview, but 10 Chambers gave a decent amount of onboarding to get into the flow of the heists. The first mission began with a smaller prep mission to get in and extract some key items for the larger heist. This played out across a small cluster of individual rooms linked together by closed vault doors where teammates need to regroup back before jumping into the next segmented room. It's a formulaic approach that 10 Chambers designed into the core gameplay loop of the studio's previous game (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gtfo-cooperate-or-die-trying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTFO</a>) that may feel like more of an homage to their previous title than something necessary to crack open some vaults. On the bright side, these discrete rooms do reset the enemy alarms, so players can attempt once more to go for a stealthy approach after getting into an accidental gunfight.</p>
<p>This mini-mission in Den of Wolves resulted in some half-dozen rooms with shorter encounters with a handful of guards and armed combatants on our way to gather some loot bags and head to an elevator for extraction under a constant stream of ever-respawning enemies. It's here that I learned the hard way that these prep missions are an all-or-nothing solution, and all four team members needed to walk out alive for the mission progress to count and what we've picked up to carry over. Sadly, I was the first to go down after foolishly trying to make a break for it and grabbing another loot bag on the way out. I had to lie idly by and watch as groups of five or more guards would spawn one at a time and fill the hallway with bullets, thus preventing my team from making a safe extraction, even if down a member.</p>
<p>Our second mission in Den of Wolves certainly went smoothly by comparison. It was a by-the-numbers vault-busting mission to start with the prep phase letting us swap out our primary and secondary weapons as well as choose an additional equipment tool, like a turret or deployable shield. No glimpse at the character or deeper customization options, so I was limited to the one mask and outfit on hand that were pre-selected for me. Given the sheer number of mask options in the first two PAYDAY titles, I do expect Den of Wolves to bring in a wide range of customization options to incentivize players to keep coming back for heists.</p>
<p><iframe title="Den of Wolves Pre-Alpha Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TGYfx7vKpRA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Our team split up into groups of two, each taking one-half of the bank vaults on each side, drilling through a number of vaults to find the sacks of loot we'd then pile up at a massive glass window that would prove to be our one way out. There were a few security guards throughout with more coming in at a drip feed as we made our way to the second part of the mission: diving into our target's brain to gather some crucial data stored in their human brain.</p>
<p>This segment is where Den of Wolves morphs into something I wasn't expecting. In the middle of gunfights, suddenly, our team would be pulled into the mind of the target and forced to run through a 3D parkour gauntlet where reality would rotate on a whim and force our entire squad to endure a running challenge to jump and scramble all the way to an exit point. In those moments, only one of the squad would need to actually be successful, but I wouldn't want to rely on just one person to clear it every time. After a successful dive, we'd be pulled right back into the firefight as if nothing had happened and proceed on as normal with the heist before getting pulled back in another one or two times before extracting all the information we needed from the target's brain.</p>
<p>Coming from GTFO, Den of Wolves feels much more in line with the difficulty curve that heist enjoyers would come to expect from the genre. There are still some obvious growing pains for 10 Chambers to overcome, from creating an enemy AI that's more responsive to flanking maneuvers to gunplay that feels more impactful in each shot. But for those looking for their next heist fix to play with friends online, Ulf Andersson and his team already have a good feel for what their next big move will be. Den of Wolves is currently slated as a PC exclusive without a release date in sight.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/den-of-wolves-preview-welcome-to-machine</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/den-of-wolves-preview-welcome-to-the-machine.1151166/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/den-of-wolves-preview-welcome-to-machine<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a little over a year since we last checked in with 10 Chambers, creators of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/gtfo-rundown-80-preview-youre-already-dead" rel="nofollow"><em>GTFO</em></a>. While we’ve been away, they’ve been hard at work on their next project – <em>Den of Wolves</em>, an all-new co-op shooter that calls back to the studio’s heist game roots when their founders worked on projects like the original <em>Payday</em>.</p>

<p>While <em>Den of Wolves</em> was announced towards the end of 2023, we’re only now just getting to see how it’s shaped up in the time since then. 10 Chambers has called it the game they “must make”, and all of this is coming together through gameplay, its themes, and design philosophies.</p>

<p><em>Den of Wolves</em> is set in a dystopian near-future place called Midway City – one controlled by corporations, and where the player will work as a criminal for hire as they engage in industrial espionage, sabotage, and assassinations to help rival companies.</p>

<p>Much of <em>Den of Wolves</em> centers on traditional first-person gunplay, but there’s also an all-new mechanic called “Dive”, which lets players hack into human neural networks with unique gameplay elements.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-012.jpg?itok=zngtdmHW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-012.jpg?itok=7Nls8EfT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With a focus on strategic planning in play, <em>Den of Wolves</em> blends stealth and action in a way we haven’t quite seen before.</p>

<p>We were able to preview some select missions from <em>Den of Wolves</em>, which still doesn’t have a release date, but will be available on Early Access when it launches in the future. That said, the preview was largely focused on two missions that helped draw up a picture of what players can look forward to in the full release.</p>

<p>For the first part, four of us gathered up together, meeting in a traditional load-out screen where you select weapons and what kind of tools you want to use for the mission. There’s a selection of guns, knives, and other supplies like shields – the latter especially will come in handy later.</p>

<p>So with weapons in hand, the first smaller mission we attempted involved getting some supplies, and a drone that will be important at some point in the future.</p>

<p>A lot of the level design here feels like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/gtfo-review" rel="nofollow"><em>GTFO</em></a> – you’ll go in, take out stationed enemies with stealth or force, and then meet up at scanning points to continue. There are also vaults that can be opened using drill tools, and it’s important to keep an eye on these because they do need to be repaired once in a while as they go.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-001.jpg?itok=M8ELpEMj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-001.jpg?itok=RwOsTElr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The co-op nature of these missions comes into focus here too because you’ll want to coordinate what everyone is doing – especially when there’s some enemies that can detect you with proximity, or when you’re in the middle of scanning and there’s a rush of enemies, you’ll need to take them out efficiently.</p>

<p>Once we’d obtained the drone, it was on to the next, bigger mission we’d get to see in <em>Den of Wolves</em>. For this we actually took a step back in the real world and planned out this mission on a scale map to work out how each of us was going to work during the heist.</p>

<p>Our first idea was to split up. The mission would have us find a set of three keys randomly inside three different vaults. Then we’d meet up and blast some windows out for an eventual escape, whilst also fighting off enemies and then getting to the whole Dive portion of the game.</p>

<p>We gave it a go, and after getting into the vault building through some nefarious means, we executed the plan. Two of us took the upstairs floor, and two of us went to the floor below. While we were starting to collect our keys, however, we came under fire, and the team ended up regrouping but ultimately dying and failing the mission because we weren’t equipped well enough.</p>

<p>But <em>Den of Wolves</em> encourages trying again, so that we did, and this time we decided to go around to each vault as the whole lot of us, break down those vaults and get the keys quickly. We also grabbed enough shields in the load-out screen to get us through some tough firefights.</p>

This neural link counts down three separate times, and all four of us are seemingly transported into a virtual world where the goal is to get to the end.</p>

<p>It’s not as easy as going from point A to point B, however. The gravity is abnormal, and perspective can change after a single jump. There’s platforming too, and it can get tricky to time with all of that considered.</p>

<p>There is a bit of leniency, though, as only one person needs to scan in at the end of the map. There is a countdown, so you can’t stay in there forever.</p>

<p>It’s all fairly hectic and again, it’s why communicating with your team can be the difference between success and failure. We did manage to complete the mission, and it really did feel like the perfect taste of what’s to come in <em>Den of Wolves</em>.</p>

<p>For those looking for a deep co-op challenge or just want to have fun with some heist gameplay, it’s certainly one to watch, whenever it gets around to releasing.</p>

                <p>Bandai Namco has announced that Pac-Man on mobile will shut down on May 30, but players can continue playing the game until the closure date.</p><p>The shutdown notice came from within the Pac-Man game itself as well as both the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pac-man/id293778748" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.namcobandaigames.pacmantournaments&amp;hl=en_US" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play Store</a>. It stated that in-app purchases will no longer be available after April 1. This version of the game contains the original 8-bit classic arcade experience, as well as original mazes in Story Mode. There are also limited-time themed events that reward players with exclusive skins through Adventure Mode.</p><p>It's notable that this version of the game, simply titled Pac-Man with no subtitle or additional branding, is shutting down, as 2025 marks the series' 45th anniversary. However, Bandai Namco is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/namco-is-celebrating-pac-mans-45th-anniversary-with-live-events-museum-exhibits-and-more/1100-6529868/" data-ref-id="1100-6529868">celebrating the anniversary in other ways</a>. Seattle's Museum of Pop Culture is hosting a special Pac-Man display from April 30-June 4, along with a themed event on May 10. From May 18-September 28, the Great Park Gallery in Irvine, California is also going to host a Pac-Man retrospective exhibition.</p><p>Club America will also offer limited-run Pac-Man-branded soccer jerseys, and Bandai Namco is partnering up with retailers like Walmart to launch new Pac-Man toys, apparel, and accessories.</p><p>Finally, the edgy and dark platformer spin-off, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-labyrinth-brings-its-pac-man-metroidvania-adventure-to-nintendo-switch-in-july/1100-6530419/" data-ref-id="1100-6530419">Shadow Labyrinth</a>, is launching on July 18 for PC, PS5, Switch, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p>A new playable character in FromSoftware's forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has been revealed.</p>
<p>In the network test, only four Nightfarers were available to players, but the latest pre-order push shows Ironeye for the first time.</p>
<p>Ironeye looks to be a ranger, or sniper, class who shoots enemies with a bow. Particularly cool is the ability to shoot arrows while in the air after leaping off walls with the game's new parkour system.</p>

<p>While Ironeye's core abilities are unknown, the video reveal does include the character charging a shot that fires through a number of enemies at once followed by a wave of energy.</p>
<p>It looks like Ironeye can free aim with the bow, as well as backstab enemies by firing arrows at close range from behind.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign will have eight Nightfarers in total, representing different player classes. The network test had the all-rounder Wylder, the tanky Guardian, the magic-wielding Recluse, and the rogue-like Duchess.</p>

<p>Ironeye should compliment the group nicely with ranged attacks, though builds can certainly change depending on the randomised weapons found throughout each run.</p>
<p>It's unknown who the remaining three Nightfarers will be, though perhaps a Faith character of some sort is a fair bet. I'd love to see a Wretch too.</p>
<p>The network test for Nightreign took place last month and allowed players to try out the three-player co-op game's roguelike three-day cycle.</p> <div>

<p>Last week, publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-players-were-really-struggling-to-complete-the-network-test">Bandai Namco released some statistics that showed players appeared to be struggling</a> to beat the big boss Nightlord: Gladius, Beast of Night, was defeated only 58,615 times.</p>
<p>Ahead of the network test, I was able to go hands-on with the game and came away very impressed by its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">new twists on familiar Elden Ring gameplay</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fall-guys-ranked-knockout<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mediatonic has officially added a&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>Ranked Knockout mode to its wacky 3D platformer, and while that might sound a bit like an April Fools' joke, make no mistake; the ranked mode is very real.</p>

<p>The new mode was revealed in <a href="https://www.fallguys.com/en-US/news/fall-guys-ranked-knockout" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>website earlier today. It might sound like a ranked mode for a game as silly and light-hearted as&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2025-gaming-roundup" rel="nofollow">a gag</a>, but I headed into the game earlier to check, and it's absolutely a real mode you can try out right now.</p>

<p>In the post, Mediatonic confirms there are eight ranks to rise through in Ranked Knockout: Rookie, Contender, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Ace, Star, and Superstar. You'll begin as a Rookie, and the better you perform in each round, the more you'll climb the ranked ladder.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fall-guys-ranked-knockout-platforming.jpg?itok=LA9tIkqQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fall-guys-ranked-knockout-platforming.jpg?itok=aOJnNUxa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>Ranked Knockout is very real, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>Like other competitive games,&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>will divide its ranked play into seasons, or Cycles. Each Cycle will last eight weeks, and at the conclusion of the Cycle, you'll get rewards based on your performance.</p>

<p>If you belong to one of the first four ranks, you can't lose points, but once you get into Gold, subpar performance will see points deducted from your overall score, meaning you'll be demoted and have to work your way back up again.</p>

<p>Getting into the upper echelons will reward you with a special Emoticon, and if you get to the top two Star or Superstar ranks, you'll get a Supreme Idol Costume to show everyone else just how great you are at&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>.</p>




<p>Ranks will, of course, be reset every eight weeks, and Mediatonic says it's "on the lookout for any suspicious behavior" when it comes to cheating. Not only that, but matchmaking will be "fair" and will "place you against players as close to your current rank as possible".</p>

<p>You can check out Ranked Knockout right now in&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>, which is free to play on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/fall-guys" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fall-guys/9pmxh5249dg5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fall-guys-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

The release date announcement came as part of a Cinemacon presentation, which included the first footage from the film. Unfortunately, I can’t show you that because it was not released to the public. However, Sony did release a few still images from the trailer that don’t tell us much that we didn’t already know, but they’re still pretty to look at.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b158a613f8ed7bbaa2cdcb4323542c5a" data-recommend-id="image://b158a613f8ed7bbaa2cdcb4323542c5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="858" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Miles hangs upside down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Miles hangs upside down." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b158a613f8ed7bbaa2cdcb4323542c5a" data-recommend-id="image://b158a613f8ed7bbaa2cdcb4323542c5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="858" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Miles hangs upside down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first image is the most simple.

Jobst said the following in a May 2021 video about Mitchell:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> He also sued YouTuber Apollo Legend for $1,000,000. I haven’t spoken about this publicly but this lawsuit ultimately ended with Apollo giving in and settling with Mitchell. He was forced to remove all his videos about Mitchell’s cheating and paid him a large sum of money. This left him deeply in debt, which required him to find extra work, but with his ongoing health issues this was all too much of a burden and he ultimately took his own life. Not that Billy Mitchell would ever care, though. In fact, when Billy Mitchell thought Apollo died earlier he expressed joy at the thought. The lawsuit against Apollo was just as frivolous as the rest and Apollo definitely would have won in court, but again he was extremely ill and couldn’t handle the ongoing stress.</p></blockquote><p>It has since been revealed that no money changed hands as part of Mitchell’s settlement with Smith. The YouTuber was forced to remove several videos about the cheating saga, but only had to pay potential damages if he published on the subject again. Jobst ended up retracting the claim about Smith going into debt as a result of the settlement, but the court found that Jobst’s ongoing behavior around the topic continued contributing to reputational harm against Mitchell. (The former world champion <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/billy-mitchell-donkey-kong-cheating-doctor-twin-1849511774&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/billy-mitchell-donkey-kong-cheating-doctor-twin-1849511774">previously claimed his doctor would no longer see him</a></span> on account of the cheating accusations.)</p><p>The judge in the defamation case, Ken Barlow, concluded the following:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Mr. Jobst defamed Mr. Mitchell by making all the imputations that Mr. Mitchell alleged; (b) Mr. Mitchell has suffered significant personal and reputational harm as a consequence; (c) although he had the previous reputations alleged by Mr. Jobst, and the defamatory video raised other substantially true contextual imputations about him, Mr. Mitchell suffered substantially more personal and reputational harm as a consequence of Mr. Jobst’s imputations about which Mr. Mitchell complains; (d) Mr. Jobst’s conduct since the first publication of the video, including during this proceeding, has been aggravating and has caused additional personal hurt and reputational damage to Mr. Mitchell.</p></blockquote><p>As a result, Jobst has been ordered to pay the former <em>Donkey Kong</em> champion $300,000 in non-economic damages, $50,000 in aggravated damages, and over $40,000 in interest, which amounts to roughly $275,000 in U.S. dollars. “Nothing like the smell of victory in the evening air,” Mitchell <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/BillyPacman/status/1906918050705862943&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/BillyPacman/status/1906918050705862943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X</a></span>. “Billy Mitchell always has a plan.

From that point on unfortunately there was really nothing that could have saved me. I will now obviously consider my options.  I know many of you will be upset with this and I am sorry for that. Thank you again for all the support I have received and I will endeavor to work as hard as I can to repay all that you are owed.”</p><p>A <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/f/karl-jobst-legal-defence-fund&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/karl-jobst-legal-defence-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gofundme campaign</a></span> to pay for Jobst’s defense after a second lawsuit from Mitchell had been filed against him raised over $200,000 AUD. “Last year, Billy Mitchell, star of <em>The King of Kong</em> and proven video game cheater, sued me for defamation,” reads the description. “These lawsuits are unhinged and it is highly likely Billy will ultimately lose, but until we go to trial it requires a lot of money to deal with. I would appreciate any help that you are able to provide, as this affects not only me but my family as well. Obviously it’s bad enough to attack me when I’ve done nothing wrong, but to injure them as well takes things to another level.” </p><p>But some now feel the way Jobst repeatedly talked about the lawsuit on his YouTube channel, including one video titled “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUdKSLjwZTo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUdKSLjwZTo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheater Billy Mitchell Just Keeps Losing</a></span>,” misled viewers into thinking the trial was primarily about the cheating allegations. The videos include comments of people donating to his channel specifically over Smith’s death. “There are a lot of lies being spread that I falsely claimed Billy sued me because I said he cheated,” Jobst <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/karljobstgaming/status/1906936348189290503&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/karljobstgaming/status/1906936348189290503" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> continued on X</a></span> after losing the lawsuit. “I never claimed this, I only claimed it was relevant as part of my defense.”</p><p>He added that his total legal fees “are well over $600k,” and that he hadn’t used the court case to try to drum up donations.  “But the criticism that I should have been more transparent is valid and I’m sorry,” he added. “Truthfully I didn’t want to repeat or mention any claims regarding Apollo Legend because it may have jeopardized my defense.  I never intentionally lied regarding Apollo Legend either. I relied on incorrect information from multiple sources. I retracted the statements once I confirmed it was inaccurate but apparently it was not sufficient.”</p><p>. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-id-tech-8-ray-tracing-vitualized-geometry/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is setting out to be one of the most visually impressive games launching this year, as the latest iteration of id Software's proprietary engine has fully embraced cutting-edge technology to deliver a complex game world at high performance.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VawgKaIfbg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysis</a> shared today, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a first look at what the id Tech 8 engine delivers in the new entry in the series. While the demo that media played did not feature path tracing, it did feature regular ray tracing, which included ray-traced reflections like in DOOM Eternal and ray-traced global illumination in the vein of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle,</a> which is powered by the same engine.</p>
<p>Both work extremely well. The Siege map, for example, features a lot of reflective surfaces, which wasn't entirely expected, given the change to a more naturalistic environment over past entries in the series. This change also makes ray-traced global illumination shine, delivering more accurate lighting through vast spaces lit almost entirely with natural light sources like fire and the sun. Additionally, the emphasis on dynamic objects and the removal of baked lighting makes said objects blend more seamlessly into the environment, resulting in a more pleasing visual experience.</p>
<p>Besides ray tracing features and the robust physics simulation DOOM: The Dark Ages features, the game also seems to feature a virtualized geometry system similar to Unreal Engine 5's Nanite. While this couldn't be confirmed at the time, the behavior of some visual elements, such as the absence of LOD swapping, heavily suggests this system is being used. Targeting 60 FPS with this virtualized geometry system in place together with high enemy numbers on screen, the ray-traced lighting and reflections, and the physics simulation show the amazing potential of the id Tech 8 engine. What remains to be seen is how it will actually deliver all this on consoles, but id Software has already proved in the past to have the technical chops to deliver solid experiences on all sorts of hardware.</p>

Sam Riegel is the GM for <a href="https://critrole.com/wildemount-wildlings/" rel="nofollow">Wildmount Wildlings</a>, a new adventure following Veth, Yasha, and Beau as they attempt to help some troubled campers earn some badges.</p>

<p>Ahead of the shows release on <strong>April 3rd</strong>, 10th, and 17th at <strong>6pm Pacific</strong> I got to sit down with the GM and Camp Director Sam Riegel to hear what it was like to bring his home game back to the public, where this game picks up, and what level of "rules lite, entertainment heavy" gameplay we can expect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"That's what the Wildmount Wildlings is, it's a camp"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To give a brief recap of what led to the Wildmount Wildlings Riegel explained "In Campaign 2 of Critical Role Nott The Brave/Veth Brennato retired from adventuring to open a summer camp for adventuring kids. Ever since then she's been running this camp with her family."</p>

<p>Riegel explained that he's been using Veth's post-campaign story to run a game of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>D&amp;D</em></a> at home for his children and their friends as they're campers. "They all play campers, and they learn stuff and go on adventures. Sometimes on weekend breaks they go off and explore Wildemount and it's been a lot of fun".</p>

<p>I asked him about what decision led to bringing a part of Exandria that he's taken home and made himself back to the public's eye with this mini-series. The answer came in two parts "Everything we've ever done at Critical Role starts from a place of us wanting to have fun, and us playing games". He referenced the origins of Critical Role and how <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a49b5305-f71e-4b04-a989-6db6823aa8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story" rel="nofollow">Vox Machina</a> began as a home game between friends. "It just felt natural to take some of the fun that I've been having at home and put it up on Beacon, and Twitch, and YouTube for our fans to see."</p>

<p>The second part of his answer referencing the business side of Critical Role as he stated "also we're between campaigns right now, we finished Campaign 3 and frankly we need stuff to put on on Thursday night and Marisha (Ray) has been amazing at programming some really great one-shots and mini-series and specials that have been airing and this just felt like a good one to throw up there and it's within our world and it's a different take on our content and we thought it would be really fun"</p>

<h2>Where in time is Wildmount Wildlings?</h2>

<p>"Right at the end of Campaign 3 Yasha and Beau were talking about what they were going to do next and I think they mentioned something about taking some time off, maybe visiting Veth at her camp, or at least taking some time off to explore and so Wildmount Wildlings, our little 3-episode series, picks up right after the events of Campaign 3 and Yasha and Beau are going to come to the camp, partly for vacation, but partly to check out what it's like to hang out with kids"</p>

<p>This did lead to a question about Yasha and Beau's other current objective, to figure out if they want to adopt a child yet, when asked if we'd be seeing them consider adopting one of these campers Riegel explained "Beau and Yasha have been debating whether to have kids, or if they're ready to be parents"</p>

<p>"I think this little three shot is a way for them to figure out where they are in their life, if they're ready for kids, what kind of parents they would be, and to work out some stuff with each other." Riegel compared it to the real life conversations that many couples have to go through when they're growing up together</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This will be [Beau and Yasha's] opportunity to have that conversation and for the audience to get a glimpse at it"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowing that this session was taking place after the level 20 party of The Mighty Nein took on the Weave Mind on Ruidus I did ask about how the party balance worked between seasoned adventurers and literal children.</p>

<p>"The kids are all level 1, all the kids in the O.L.G.A Cabin (Oops, Let's Go Again) are outcasts. They're underperforming kids, they need a little extra help. Beau and Yasha are being brought in to give them a little bit of tough love, almost like a scared straight program to whip them into shape so that they can advance up a level"</p>

<p>"Beau and Yasha are terribly overpowered, and could mop the floor with these kids, however Veth as a good counsellor and also Sam Riegel as a decent GM comes up with ways to nerf them so that they are a little bit less powerful"</p>

<h2>Building A World With A Childs Eye</h2>

<p>Riegel explained that when this idea was first drafted there were early thoughts to have kids be the players, "we quickly decided that that wasn't a good idea because our channel is very dirty, we have a lot of adult themes." Instead though the adventure, including monsters that the party will face, were created with the input of Riegel's children and their friends that are part of his homegame.</p>

<p>"We had these brainstorming sessions with these kids where they came up with monsters, encounters, traps, NPCs that Beau and Yasha and the campers are going to meet. Not only did we have this pitch session but you're actually going to get to see those pitch sessions."</p>

<p>When asking for clarification if those sessions would be Beacon exclusive Riegel clarified "I believe they're going to be part of the episodes. You're going to see at the beginning of each episode kids coming up with the encounters for each episode. Later when you see the monster you'll know exactly where it's coming from"</p>

<p>Moving on to talk about the cast of campers for this season – Eden Riegel (<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2b75fcbb-a1e5-4678-ad54-cccd2ebfde56" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Crash Bandicoot 4</em></a>), Aleks Le (<em>Solo Leveling</em>), Brennan Lee Mulligan (<em>EXU: Calamity, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b6ff64e2-0570-485e-860b-402771d3faf6" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/we-chat-dimension-20-burrows-end-generational-trauma-and-environmental" rel="nofollow">Dimension 20</a></em>), Libe Barer (<em>Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur, Sneaky Pete</em>) – I asked about how it was having family at the table.</p>

<p>"I've been wanting to get Eden involved in one of our shows for years now and schedules haven't aligned. But because this is my game I get to do what I want. Eden has not played a lot of <em>D&amp;D</em>, in fact this is the second time she ever played. The first time was a week earlier when she came over to my house and I taught her how to play"</p>

<p>Riegel explained that aside from Brennan Lee Mulligan, who has obviously played a lot of <em>D&amp;D</em> and TTRPGs, all of the other campers are very very new to tabletop roleplaying games. "They've either only played once, or not at all."</p>

<p>"It worked great. As level 1 campers at a camp where they're supposed to be learning about their powers it works great that they don't really know what they're doing. It fit in beautifully."</p>

<p>Riegel explained that Mulligan being an "expert in all things tabletop roleplaying" his character was able to help the other campers along.</p>

<h2>Who Are The Campers?</h2>

<p>I didn't get too much information about the campers of the O.L.G.A cabin but Riegel was able to share that "they're all between the ages of 14-16, they're all the lowest rank at the camp which is called Dainty Feet." He didn't want to spoil their introductions but that they're newly coming into their powers.</p>

<p>He referenced mages having trouble casting their spells, a rogue who isn't good at stealing or attacking."Over the course of these three episodes they sort of figure it out, or at least try to."</p>

<p>Talking about the ranks at cap Riegel began to explain that by obtaining these badges they'll work to achieve the Three Below rank.</p>

<p>Riegel talked further about the world of Wildmount Wildlings that he's build up. "For the home game I have the campgrounds set, there's different areas of the camp that I identify that the players know about that they can go to."</p>

<p>"I developed camp counsellors, other camp cabins, other campers who my kids have met, and definitely spots around the campground that they either need to avoid or that they can go interact with."</p>

<p>Listing off some of these locations Riegel told me about "the 'Do Not Hike' trail, the Hubbub Hub where they meet for camp meetings, the Gross which is the cafeteria and Phyllis the Centaur lunch lady, Salmon Lake which has no salmon in it, it's just a disgusting lake that's the color of salmon."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"There's all kinds of spots that my kids are familiar with and now our audience and these campers will also be familiar with too"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the show they also had artwork developed to better define the look of the setting, a camp map, and new creations. One of these was a curfew creature that "is so adorable and weird and so I'm going to bring that into the home game."</p>

<h2>A setting for your own home games</h2>

<p>Riegel's hope for Wildmount Wildlings, a setting that he created for his kids, is that "people watch these episodes and can maybe set their own home game for their kids in this camp. It would be so cool if other people around the world were playing set in this weird camp that my kids play in"</p>

<p>Before we hit our time limit I wanted to know what Riegel really wanted to make sure the audience knew coming into this three-parter. "I hope it's going to be a fun time, as many people know who have watched me GM before, I'm Rules Lite and Entertainment Heavy. You'll see me flounder a bit as I try to remember rules, and I even turn to Brennan Lee Mulligan a few times and ask him to help me"</p>

<p>"We had a lot of fun, this series is done out of love, it's done out of family, and it really celebrates being a kid, being who you are, and just Wilding out"</p>
