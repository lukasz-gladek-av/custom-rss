<p>First up, Firaxis says it's made some tweaks to the Geographic Society victory condition, improving "how this victory feels and plays". It should no longer be quite as easy to "breeze through this path when no other players are aiming for this victory".</p>

<p>Changes to this effect include Explorer units costing more, fewer Exploration Age artifacts spawning per continent, and the ability to study Natural Wonders for Artifacts, plus more.</p>

On the PC side, these changes include improvements to the game's AI and various systems, as well as improvements for its UI.</p>

<p>Console changes are also pretty extensive, with many smaller changes to UI, gameplay systems, and more. You can check out the full patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.1.0 <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p>Whether or not this is enough to placate players who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players" rel="nofollow">still feel angry</a> about&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>'s launch remains to be seen. Last month, Firaxis <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-ui-problems-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">promised to address</a> players' common criticisms of the game, so let's hope the UI improvements in this update are a good start, at least.</p>

<p>The first half of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>'s inaugural paid DLC pack has gone live as part of this update as well, and it includes a new Leader, two new Civilizations, and new Natural Wonders. Again, though, you will have to pay to enjoy that stuff.</p>




<p><em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>is the latest mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>series of turn-based strategy games. It includes a new Age system to more clearly demarcate time periods, as well as changes to city-building, diplomacy, and more.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 has a new Sid Meier's game update that makes changes to Sid Meier's user interface, leader AI, Age mechanics, Mementos and naval unit handling. Developers Firaxis have also stirred in a free bonus Natural Wonder, Sid Meier's Bermuda Triangle.</p>
<p>Leaving aside for the moment the on-going arguments about whether (Sid Meier's - OK, enough of that now) Civilization 7 is an unambiguous low point for the series, or yet another flawed 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim that will find its feet via post-launch updates, I love the idea of a Bermuda Triangle just popping up in my simulation, like a black hole spawning in my fridge. I hope it works as in legends about the real-life Bermuda Triangle (or in the previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization 6</a>), with whole armies and fleets getting swallowed up in transit and/or scattered across the globe at random.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Formally titled Update 1.1.0, the patch is reportedly based on “community suggestions and feedback”. It’s live today and – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/upcoming-civilization-vii-expansion-release-dates-seemingly-leaked-by-nintendo">as rumoured last week</a> - accompanies the first part of the paid Crossroads Of The World DLC Collection, which features a new leader, Ada Lovelace, the new civs Great Britain (in the Modern Age) and Carthage (in Antiquity), and a Natural Wonder pack with four more Natural Wonders: Machapuchare, Mount Fuji, Vihren, and Vinicunca.
</p>
<p>
The developers had planned to launch Civilization 7’s first in-game Event, Natural Wonder Battle, alongside the update, but “events are now being postponed to a later update to allow us more time to prioritize quality-of-life improvements for players worldwide”. 
</p>
<p>
Here’s a PR-supplied highlights reel for Update 1.1.0. 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- New Natural Wonder to discover: Bermuda Triangle (free to all players)
</p>
<p>
- Additional UI adjustments, polish, and addressing of reported issues
</p>
<p>
- Significant changes to the Modern Age's Cultural Legacy Path and Victory; AI leaders will also be better at completing a Cultural Victory (so expect fewer Explorer Unit stacks!)
</p>
<p>
- Now able to convert Holy Cities in the Exploration Age. Note that when players create their own Missionary Units, they will always follow the player’s chosen Religion
</p>
<p>
- Naval Units will be able to disperse Coastal Independent Powers
</p>
<p>
- Balance pass on several Mementos
</p>
<p>
- Refinements to the Army Unpacking action
</p>
<p>
- Addressing reported issues with multiplayer and adding friends with a 2K Account
</p>
<p>
- For console players: all prior updates from Update 1.0.1 Patches 1, 2, and 3 will be implemented, in addition to the items noted above
</p></blockquote>
<p>
There’s another Civ 7 patcheroo on the way on 25th March, called Update 1.1.1. It introduces Mount Everest as a free Natural Wonder, adds quick move functionality, and tinkers further with the AI, amongst other things. It's timed to accompany the second half of the aforesaid Crossroads Of The World DLC, which adds another new leader, Simón Bolívar, together with Nepal (Modern Age) and Bulgaria (Exploration Age). Here’s a breakdown in advance:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Additional UI improvements and refinements; specifics will be shared later with the Update 1.1.1 Notes. Note: Ongoing improvements to the User Interface continues to be a top priority for the development team. The updates being introduced on March 25 are just one part of a much larger plan that aims to improve the UI over the next several months. 
</p>
<p>
- Scouting and Settling improvements for AI, including less aggressive “forward” settling by AI
</p>
<p>
- Adding Quick Move functionality
</p>
<p>
- Adding the ability to customize the names of Commanders and Cities
</p>
<p>
- Renaming the existing maps to be "Start Position: Balanced," which will be the default Start Position setting for multiplayer games
</p>
<p>
- Adding a new Start Position of "Standard," where the landforms on maps are less predictable, closer to how map generation works in Civ VI
</p>
<p>
- Adding an optional Restart button that rerolls the player’s map generation now that these less predictable start positions are possible
</p>
<p>
- New Natural Wonder: Mount Everest (free to all players)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In our fashionably late <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">Civilization 7 review</a>, Actual Game Designer Greg Costikyan concluded that “despite its flaws, Civilization 7 sustains that “one more turn!” desire to plow through history and see what happens next.” I am certainly interested to see what happens next with Civ 7. Going by site stats, you are all very intrigued by it, despite some cogent and withering assessments of its failings.

                <p>Capcom's Monster Hunter Wilds launched on February 28 and became a smashing success out of the gate, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-becomes-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-in-just-3-days/1100-6529838/" data-ref-id="1100-6529838">selling 8 million copies in three days to become Capcom's fastest-selling game ever</a>. The launch hasn't gone entirely smoothly, though, as players have reported a number of issues. The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/060" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds website</a> lists off some of what's been fixed so far, and there have been many changes.</p><p>Some of the issues that have been fixed so far include the fix for the "Grill a Meal" and "Ingredient Center" features not working properly, along with a fix for tutorials being repeatedly shown at the Smithy. Capcom also fixed an issue that could cause the game to force-quit and addressed an issue where the weapon equipment skill would be mistakenly activated when using a mantle.</p><div tabindex="0"

                <p dir="ltr">Today marks the 25th anniversary of PS2, the best-selling video game console of all time. Sony released the home system in Japan on March 4, 2000, and one Redditor flew over to Tokyo at that time to buy one.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1j395wt/25_years_ago_i_flew_to_japan_to_buy_a_playstation/" rel="nofollow ">On Reddit</a>, user YomReddit shared a post with four pictures showing his adventure to Akihabara in 2000 to pick up a PS2 at launch. The Redditor added that they waited 26 hours in line outside a Tokyo store to grab the Sony system. Previously, YomReddit celebrated the console's 20-year anniversary in a similar manner <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fd96pg/on_this_day_20_years_ago_i_queued_for_26_hours_in/" rel="nofollow ">on Reddit</a>. In the comments, the Redditor noted they were from England and played Japanese games since the PS2 was region-locked.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS2 was originally unveiled at the Tokyo Game Show in September 1999, according to <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/playstation-history/2000-ps2-psp/">the PlayStation website</a>. A couple of the first games showcased for the system included Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec (though it wasn't named this at the time) and Eternal Ring, developed by Elden Ring studio From Software.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS2 didn't launch in North America until October 26, 2000, while the European release was even later on November 24, 2000. Worldwide launches were not common for consoles or games at that time. Ultimately, over 160 million PS2 systems were sold globally, a record that still stands today. Nintendo DS ended its lifecycle with more than 154 million units sold, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-nintendo-platforms-of-all-time-and-how-many-units-they-sold/2900-5124/" data-ref-id="2900-5124">Switch sits at 150 million consoles sold</a>, so Nintendo's hybrid system still has a chance to topple the PS2.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-30th-anniversary-kicks-off-with-nostalgic-ps5-themes-and-the-cranberries/1100-6528157/" data-ref-id="1100-6528157">Sony has also been celebrating PlayStation's 30th anniversary</a> recently. For instance, PS5 users got a PS2 theme along with other PlayStation menu looks for a limited time. The original PlayStation launched in Japan on December 3, 1994, with the North American release happening on September 9, 1995.</p>

<p>In general, Firaxis has sought to address <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/firaxis-highlights-three-areas-theyll-improve-civilization-7-after-mixed-launch-reviews/">some of the main complaints that players of the game have had</a>, with the UI having come in for a lot of stick at launch. This is the first step for UI improvements that will continue with Update 1.1.1 later this month and through to further updates. For this update there’s things like fixing unit tooltips to remain within screen bounds, making scrollbars work when scrolling with a wheel, updates to the Leader Attribute Menu, and lots of other small tweaks to generally try and improve the UI.</p>
<p>There’s also AI improvements, so they’re able to better aim for a Cultural Victory – these have been overhauled for the Modern Age in general – a balance pass on Mementos, and fixes for converting Holy Cities in the Exploration Age.</p>
<p>Free for all players is the new Natural Wonder to discover, the Bermuda Triangle.</p>

<p>Here’s the PC patch notes for Civilization 7 Update 1.1.0 – <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/">head here for console</a>:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>

</ul>
<p><b>Memento Text Updates</b></p>
<ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-hellraiser-chapter-leaving<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Behaviour Interactive has announced that&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>will soon lose one of its killers in the form of Pinhead, the iconic Cenobite villain from Clive Barker's horror movie&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser</em>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/news/hellraiser-last-chance-sale/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Behaviour says that since&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>is a live service game, it's prone to "unexpected changes", and that the loss of the game's <i>Hellraiser&nbsp;</i>Chapter, which includes Pinhead and a number of other items, is one such change.</p>

<p>You'll no longer be able to purchase Pinhead or any of the associated cosmetics starting from April 4th at 11am Eastern (that's 8am Pacific and around 4pm GMT).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-cenobite-leaving-outfits.jpg?itok=Z5Ma8QpS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-cenobite-leaving-outfits.jpg?itok=NYXhfBd1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s Pinhead and his associated cosmetics will be leaving the game next month.</figcaption></figure><p>If you already happen to own the Cenobite Chapter, you'll still be able to access and play as Pinhead, and you'll also still retain access to your cosmetics and perks.</p>

<p>However, if you don't already own the Chapter, Pinhead's associated perks will be released to the general perk pool and will undergo a name change, with associated charms and achievements also being updated to reflect said change.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time characters from a major horror franchise have departed&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>; back in 2021, the Demogorgon and other&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things&nbsp;</em>characters were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-stranger-things-sale-has-big-discounts-for-crossover-characters" rel="nofollow">removed from the game's store</a>.</p>

<p>Two years later, Behaviour <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/news/stranger-things-chapter-returns/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reintroduced</a>&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things&nbsp;</em>characters and cosmetics to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>, so hey - maybe there's hope for Pinhead and the Chatterer yet. Let's hope so.</p>




<p>Pinhead isn't leaving&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>until April, so if you do happen to want to pick up his Chapter and you haven't already done so, Behaviour is holding a sale right now that slashes 50% off the game's&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser</em>&nbsp;stuff.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dead-by-daylight/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dead-by-daylight/C0N22P73QZ60" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dead-by-daylight-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoqx2H_OcaYrd24HMgTDhi2LLQdMszh3cFkDbcHxt5hYtWgwxlEU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and the Cenobite Chapter is still available until April 4th across all of these platforms as well.</p>

<p>"4090 performance at $549."</p>
<p>That’s what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/TFxntB61jvs?si=MUT1U0gNSmHFRw0T&amp;t=1402">said</a> of the GeForce RTX 5070 when he announced the card at CES in January. Thanks to AI, this new midrange GPU would be able to match the frame rates of what had been the fastest consumer GPU that had previously existed for around one-third the price.</p>
<p>Let's dispel that notion up front. No, the GeForce RTX 5070 is not as fast as an RTX 4090, not without some very creative comparing of non-comparable numbers. Per usual for the 50-series, Nvidia is leaning on its AI-generated interpolated frames for the bulk of its claimed performance improvements. In terms of actual rendering speed, the 5070 isn’t even as fast as a 4080 or a 4070 Ti. It’s barely faster than last year’s 4070 Super, and it has disproportionately higher power usage.</p>


<p>For all that, it's still not necessarily a <em>bad</em> card—it's a little faster than the $599 4070 Super at the same $549 price that Nvidia used for the RTX 4070. It still represents Nvidia's minimum viable 4K GPU, once you factor in DLSS upscaling, and it’s well suited for people with 1440p monitors.</p>
<p>But it's a hard card to get excited about, and unlike every other 50-series GPU released so far, it actually has to compete against something—AMD's new Radeon RX 9070 series. I can't talk in detail about how these cards all stack up until later this week, but suffice it to say that Nvidia could use something a bit more impressive than the RTX 5070 at this price.</p>

<p>The 5070's CUDA core count falls right in between the RTX 4070 and the 4070 Super's, where the 5080 and 5070 Ti both included small increases from their previous-generation counterparts. To boost speeds over the 4070 Super, this means Nvidia is leaning on architectural improvements in Blackwell, the memory bandwidth increase from GDDR7 (a fairly significant 33 percent increase), and increased GPU clock speeds (the memory switch and clock speed boosts likely explain the higher power consumption).</p>

<p>The 5070 gives you 12GB of memory, which still clears that crucial “more than 8GB” bar you’ll want for higher-than-1080p resolutions and ultra-quality textures, though as time goes on, it may be more limiting at 4K if that’s a resolution you’re hoping to hit with this card.</p>
<p>The number that sticks out in a bad way is the power consumption—a maximum of 250 W under load, 30 W more than the old 4070 Super. The 5070 series is still far more power-efficient than older cards like the RTX 3070 or 3080, but efficiency is no longer as much of an advantage for the 5070 as it was for the 4070 series.</p>

<p>We reviewed the Founders Edition of the card provided by Nvidia, and it uses a different two-slot design than the much larger, much more powerful RTX 5090 and 5080 cards. It's the same physical size as the 4070 and 4060 Founders Edition cards, but with an updated power connector that's set at an angle instead of sticking out directly from the top of the card. Nvidia has updated the cooler design, too, moving both fans to the same side of the card rather than placing one on each side.</p>

      The RTX 5070 runs a bit warmer than other cards we've tested recently.

  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>Whether it's because of the updated cooler or the higher power consumption or both, the 5070 actually runs hotter than any other card in our current round of testing, including (by a few degrees) the 5090. The card runs a bit loud under load—that's not a scientific measurement, but I noticed it more than I did when testing either the 5090 Founders Edition or the 4070-series Founders Editions. It's something to keep an eye on for any smaller or lower-end 5070 cards from partners that use smaller double-fan cooler designs, though we doubt it will be an issue for the triple-fan monstrosities.</p>

<h3>Testbed notes</h3>

<p>Our testbed is the same as it's been since we updated it for the RTX 5090 review—a Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the heart of the build to minimize the likelihood that CPU performance will cap any of our GPUs' frame rates.</p>
<p>We've tested the 5070 at 4K and 1440p. Cards in this $500 to $600 price range tend to be a better fit for a 1440p high-refresh-rate gaming monitor, especially if you're hoping to play without DLSS or other upscaling technologies available.</p>
<p>But if you play older or lighter games, if you don't mind upscalers, and if you can turn down a few settings, hitting 60 frames per second at 4K is often within the realm of possibility. It's certainly the least I would spend if I was hoping to play on a 4K monitor.</p>
<h2>Performance and power</h2>


<p>The 5070 usually represents a mid-single-digit performance increase over the 4070 Super despite having fewer CUDA cores. It's about 20 percent faster than the RTX 4070—a comparison Nvidia would probably prefer, since the 5070 is technically replacing the 4070 at $549 and not the 4070 Super at $599. But the launch MSRPs for the 50-series have been mostly imaginary so far due to a combination of supply, demand, and people buying cards just so they can resell them for more money. We'd assume the same will hold true for the RTX 5070 until proven otherwise.</p>

<p>There were a couple of exceptions in our suite that performed strangely no matter how many times we re-tested them or how many times we tried clearing our shader cache or reinstalling drivers, and one game that benefitted from an outsized increase. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> in Ultra mode with ray-tracing disabled showed a larger improvement than the other games we tested—24 percent faster than the 4070 Super, and 72 percent faster than the 4070. It was an outlier, but some games may benefit more than others.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p><em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em> and&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>in Overdrive mode with DLSS turned off both gave abnormally low or otherwise strange numbers—we've presented those here for the sake of transparency, and we've communicated our findings to Nvidia, but we'd take these with a grain of salt when comparing results. <em>Horizon</em> seems to have some kind of issue with DLSS frame generation regardless of GPU, with low frame rates and odd visual artifacts across all the GeForce cards we've tested with recent drivers.</p>

    <p><span>4K benchmarks with DLSS/FSR upscaling and single frame-generation enabled.</span>
                </p>
  </div>

<p>On the AMD side, we can't compare the 5070 directly to the RX 9070 series yet, but it's worth noting that the 5070 outperforms the old RX 7900 GRE by a small but consistent amount in our benchmarks without ray-tracing effects (the gap in ray-traced games is larger because of AMD's typical performance deficit in these games).</p>
<p>AMD says that the $549 RX 9070 and $599 9070 XT should be 21 percent and 42 percent faster (respectively) than the RX 7900 GRE on average. That could spell trouble for the 5070, but it remains to be seen whether AMD has fixed its ray-tracing performance problems and how much the cards' power efficiency has improved.</p>


<p>We ran our 1440p benchmarks on the GeForce RTX 3070, too, to give a bit more context for upgraders. The 5070 is usually between 40 and 70 percent faster than the 3070 here, a card that will find itself more and more limited by its 8GB of RAM as time goes on. The 5070 is still a good upgrade from the 3070; it's just not all <em>that</em> much better of an upgrade than what you could get from a 4070 Super a year ago. As usual, the older your card is, the better the upgrade will feel, even if the generation-over-generation improvement is small.</p>

      </figure>

<p>In exchange for five or six percent better performance, the 5070 uses 13.5 percent more power under load than the 4070 Super did. Nvidia was so far ahead of AMD and the RTX 30-series on efficiency with the RTX 40-series GPUs that one relatively inefficient upgrade cycle doesn't really wreck things, but we do generally like to see power consumption either increase proportionally with performance or for performance to increase more than power consumption does.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Improving efficiency was always going to be tough for the 50-series, since the Blackwell GPU dies are manufactured using a 4nm TSMC process similar to what Nvidia used for the Ada Lovelace GPU dies for the 40-series. But the 5070 ends up slightly worse on this metric than the other 50-series cards.</p>
<h3>Frame generation comparisons and caveats</h3>

<p>When you turn frame generation on, you can see the source of Jensen Huang's "4090 performance for $549" performance claim. The 5070 with DLSS Multi-Frame Generation (MFG) enabled in 4x mode has a similar average frame rate in&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> compared to the RTX 4090 with the old Frame Generation mode enabled (now labeled "2x" in games that support MFG). That's because the 5070 is capable of generating three AI-interpolated frames for every rendered frame, rather than one.</p>
<p>But the 5070 (and, when they arrive, the 5060 series) demonstrates the limits of FG and MFG more than the other 50-series cards do. With MFG enabled,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> can hit over 80 frames per second on average with the Overdrive preset enabled. That sounds pretty good! Until you consider that the base frame rate (with DLSS upscaling enabled, but not any frame generation) is closer to 20 frames per second. With a base frame rate this low, user input will feel sluggish, and visual artifacts are plainly visible when objects are in motion.</p>
<p>DLSS MFG can still have its uses—the 5070 can push some pretty high frame rates at 1440p, and MFG could help you take better advantage of a 240 Hz or 360 Hz 1440p monitor than you could without MFG enabled. But it remains a relatively niche technology that's useful under certain circumstances, not the broad cure-all for mediocre performance that Nvidia's charts imply it is.</p>

<h2>It could be better, or at least cheaper</h2>

<p>The GeForce RTX 4070 and 4070 Super were some of the best values in Nvidia's lineup last generation, offering the same performance as high-end 30-series cards and outstanding power efficiency for a little less money than you'd spend on an RTX 3080 or 3090.</p>

<p>Now that it's here, it's hard to classify the RTX 5070 as anything other than a disappointment. It's just barely, by the skin of its figurative teeth, faster than the 4070 Super for the same $549 MSRP as the regular 4070. This technically makes it an improvement, along with support for multi-frame generation. But this nearly imperceptible performance improvement comes with a 13.5 percent increase in power consumption under load, which seems like a bad trade-off any way you cut it.</p>
<p>The RTX 5070 feels like the kind of product you make when you're not particularly worried about what your competition is doing. The&nbsp;<em>entire</em> 50-series has sort of felt like that so far, between the astronomically high price of the RTX 5090 and the so-so performance improvements for the 5080 and 5070 Ti.&nbsp;But it's different for the RTX 5070 because AMD actually has an answer for it coming soon.</p>
<p>AMD's RX 7600, 7700, and 7800 GPUs may not have been smash-hit sales successes for its last generation, but stiffer competition at and under $600 did help pull Nvidia's pricing down to earth a bit. Soon we'll know whether the RX 9070 series will exert a similar pull—or if it can actually manage to wrest some market share back from Nvidia after years of trending in the wrong direction.</p>
<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Great 1440p performance—and can stretch to 4K with the right settings</li>
<li>Same price as the old RX 4070 and a little cheaper than the 4070 Super (in theory)</li>
<li>Compact design that should fit in just about any case</li>
<li>Reasonably power-efficient when compared to older RTX 30-series or Radeon cards</li>
<li>DLSS Multi-Frame Generation is a situationally useful technology</li>
<li>Wide ecosystem support for DLSS, CUDA, and other Nvidia software features</li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Higher power consumption for not that much better performance</li>
<li>A few odd performance results that will hopefully be ironed out by driver and/or game updates</li>
<li>Founders Edition runs a bit hot</li>
<li>12GB of RAM feels stingy</li>
</ul>
<h3>The ugly</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia's grandiose apples-to-oranges performance comparisons</li>
<li>Availability remains a big question mark</li>
</ul>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">While the genre isn't as prolific as it once was, beat-'em-ups still tend to follow in the mold of Final Fight and Streets of Rage: You're a muscle-bound mayor or a martial arts expert or occasionally a mutated turtle, and you roam the streets left-to-right beating up punks and punching trash cans to find turkey dinners. Absolum, the latest from veteran studios behind Streets of Rage 4, promises a fresh roguelike twist alongside an inventive original fantasy setting, and the result is a remarkable blend of influences and mechanics that left me wanting more.</p><p dir="ltr">Absolum is the first original franchise from Dotemu and its co-developers, Guard Crush Games and Supamonk, and it's immediately clear that the studios have thought deeply about how to breathe new life into the classic formula. While you do still move from left to right taking on bands of assorted enemies as you go, the newly-coined "rogue 'em up" variation means you're expected to fail out of levels and progressively build up your strength, all while discovering branching paths and quests. Imagine Golden Axe meets Dead Cells.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvI172bkKDk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YvI172bkKDk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Golden Axe comparison extends to the setting, which is refreshingly fantastical for this genre. Absolum takes place in the world of Talamh, where a magical catastrophe has led to an imperial crackdown on all sources of magic and wizards who wield it. The Sun King Azra is on a brutal campaign to conquer every magical land and snuff out the practice. You're part of a small band of resistance fighters following a mysterious and ethereal mystic Mother who uses a forbidden form of magic. While many fantasy stories can get bogged down in too many proper nouns, the little I've seen so far strikes just the right balance of introducing a few fantasy concepts to pique curiosity without overwhelming the player with loads of lore.</p><p dir="ltr">In my limited preview session, I was able to fight through hordes of Azra goons in a few starting areas, as two of the four characters: Galandra, an agile and acrobatic swordfighter, or Karl, a stout dwarf who lands blows with his fists up-close and a blunderbuss at range. The two fit nicely into their fantasy archetypes--Galandra as a lithe elf that strikes like lightning and Karl as a hearty dwarf who plants himself in the ground--as well as offering some nice differentiation in the gameplay. I found myself gravitating toward Galandra, enjoying every moment I would dash towards enemies to unleash a flurry of melee attacks before finishing with a flip-kick flourish. But that's not to say Karl was any less fun to play, since his gun/melee combo makes him a very versatile fighter. And in moments of interstitial dialogue, the two refer to one another like found family, clueing the audience to a sense of closeness to their tight-knit rebel group.</p><p dir="ltr">Both characters look great, thanks to a hand-drawn art style with chunky inked lines that Dotemu says was inspired by French comic books. The dark fantasy setting also makes excellent use of lighting, from the effects of your spellcasting matriarch to the eerie red glow of enemy soldiers' helmets. This is fantasy, but it carries its own distinct look from traditional swords-and-sandals epics, at times looking almost like a blend of fantasy and sci-fi aesthetics. And the enemies themselves are often beautifully expressive, from goofy little goblins to menacing imperial elites.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps best of all, the roguelike elements blend so seamlessly into a beat-'em-up framework that it's a wonder this hasn't already become a trend. Dotemu says the RPG elements and branching paths are to reward replaying levels, since it recognized from its previous work that beat-'em-up fans like to play through over and over.</p><p dir="ltr">I only got a small taste of that from my limited time with the game, but that slice showed enormous potential. While failing out of a stage in a traditional beat-'em-up can be frustrating--or worse, a silly anachronism that prompts you to insert more quarters--in Absolum it's an opportunity. You can go back to base camp, invest in permanent upgrades, change your loadout, talk with your companions and other rebels to flesh out the story, and then try again.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453664-absolum_screenshot_3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453664" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453664-absolum_screenshot_3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453664"></a><figcaption>Galandra and Karl fight a servant of Azra</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453664-absolum_screenshot_3.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453654-absolum_screenshot_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453655-absolum_screenshot_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453656-absolum_screenshot_3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453657-absolum_screenshot_4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453658-absolum_screenshot_5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453659-absolum_screenshot_6.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453660-absolum_screenshot_7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453661-absolum_screenshot_8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453662-absolum_screenshot_9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453663-absolum_screenshot_10.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453654,1300-4453655,1300-4453656,1300-4453657,1300-4453658,1300-4453659,1300-4453660,1300-4453661,1300-4453662,1300-4453663" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453654-absolum_screenshot_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453655-absolum_screenshot_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453656-absolum_screenshot_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453657-absolum_screenshot_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453658-absolum_screenshot_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453659-absolum_screenshot_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453660-absolum_screenshot_7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453661-absolum_screenshot_8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453662-absolum_screenshot_9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4453663-absolum_screenshot_10.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453654-absolum_screenshot_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453655-absolum_screenshot_2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453656-absolum_screenshot_3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453657-absolum_screenshot_4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453658-absolum_screenshot_5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453659-absolum_screenshot_6.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453660-absolum_screenshot_7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453661-absolum_screenshot_8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453662-absolum_screenshot_9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4453663-absolum_screenshot_10.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Those permanent loadouts let you customize broad aspects of your character like equipping particular special moves, such as a Rising Dragon for Galandra that tosses enemies into the air. Then, exploring the world lets you bind temporary, run-only "rituals" that augment you with, for example, a static shock effect on your combo attack. Successfully clearing a room will often reward you with currency to spend back at camp or rituals to boost your abilities now. The roguelike mechanics help every run feel rewarding and impactful, making progress toward strengthening your character instead of simply challenging you to get good.</p><p dir="ltr">Absolum looks to be an inventive blend of game genres, gameplay mechanics, and settings and inspirations. It all just fits together so neatly that its disparate parts feel made for each other. Based on my time so far, I'm eager to play more and to learn more about the world and its characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Absolum is coming to PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/split-fiction-review-everything-everywhere<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I think at this point it’s safe to say that Hazelight Studios (who are still hot off their recent success of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/go-on-co-op-journey-with-it-takes-two" rel="nofollow"><em>It Takes Two</em></a>) is the king of the co-op genre, and that couldn’t be any more evident than my time with their latest adventure, <em>Split Fiction</em>.</p>

<p>It’s a game that has pretty much anything you can think of, and some things I’ve never seen in a game before. It’s a massive achievement across multiple genres packed into one, and it’s something that became perfectly clear the longer I played the game.</p>

<p>But I didn’t always feel that way, and those feelings changed after my<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/split-fiction-preview-double-vision" rel="nofollow"> initial preview</a>, as well as with the full version of <em>Split Fiction</em>. As someone who generally isn’t too keen on co-op games, this one has me changing my tune.</p>

<p>From the start, <em>Split Fiction</em> doesn’t mince words. The story kicks off with its two main characters, Mio and Zoe – two writers down on their luck and looking to get their work published. They’ve both hit it off with a company known as Rader Publishing, who promises to bring their creations to life.</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to the pair, that means literally. As they get wrapped up in a simulation of their stories, Mio tries to back out, but as she resists, she’s thrown into Zoe’s simulation, which then kicks off the rest of the story.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction_20250224192832.jpg?itok=SUDgYB7Y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction_20250224192832.jpg?itok=Z1dzibpL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
In some ways, it's a race to get out, as Zoe and Mio will have to work together to leave their respective stories – the bulk of which involves living them and chasing after a glitch in the system in hopes of returning to the real world.</p>

<p>Without giving away much in the way of spoilers, the overarching story is fairly straightforward – ironically, that part isn’t really anything to write home about since it’s the main vehicle for Mio and Zoe. They’re the stars here, and it’s their character development and eventual growth that is the highlight of <em>Split Fiction’</em>s narrative.</p>

<p>It’s certainly a lot more emotional and heavier than I expected, but their individual stories hit in a way that’s both touching and round out what is otherwise a fun adventure.</p>

<p>The actual adventure, or gameplay part of<em> Split Fiction</em> is essentially a non-stop 20-hour thrill ride that will have you doing all manner of mechanics and traversal paired with your co-op partner for the full duration of it across sci-fi and fantasy worlds.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction_20250224202758.jpg?itok=52-Jk0Mv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction_20250224202758.jpg?itok=1odEu3Nk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br><em>Split Fiction</em> covers such a wide range of genres, it’s beyond impressive what the team has pulled off here. And again, it’s something I didn’t fully grasp until I played the entire game. There are platformers, shooters, puzzles, adventure, farm life, role-playing, and even a dancing quest with rhythm mechanics.</p>

<p>On top of that, Zoe and Mio aren’t just doing the same thing the whole time. They each get their own individual abilities in each level. For example, in one of the sci-fi levels called Neon Revenge, Zoe is equipped with a whip that can grab objects, while Mio has a gravity-changing sword. Both characters will have to work in tandem to get across each area in the level.</p>

<p>Another example is a level known as Isolation and has Mio in control of a pinball machine, while Zoe takes the role of a ball that must escape a fast-paced boss encounter. It’s all very well fleshed out, and the capacity for replaying <em>Split Fiction</em> extends well past its initial run-through with these two different styles at play.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction</em> has eight main levels, and some 12 different optional side stories to help mix things up between Zoe and Mio’s sci-fi and fantasy adventures. I found the side stories a nice break from the action, especially in Mio’s levels.</p>

<p>They’re all markedly different, but they’ve got some fun ideas like riding on land sharks, exploring a world filled with birthday sweets, and even a wacky game show.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction_20250301174349.jpg?itok=-odICPX- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction_20250301174349.jpg?itok=6pnOhyLj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
While the gameplay shines throughout <em>Split Fiction</em>, it’s not always smooth sailing. The difficulty curve can ratchet up unexpectedly, and some controls, particularly with vehicles, can feel clunky and cumbersome. I also felt like some of the main levels do go a bit overlong, but your mileage may vary on that experience.</p>

<p>That said, I found that the reliance on my co-op partner added to this challenge, and there was often a lot of trial and error involved as the game doesn’t offer much in the way of hints or how to work things out. It’s a proper old-school experience in that way, but at least when Zoe or Mio die, they can come back right away.</p>

<p>In fact, that part of <em>Split Fiction</em> is very forgiving, and there’s a lot of accessibility options to ease the experience as well. In addition to the usual button prompts, you can swap them around, modify camera rotation, reduce enemy damage, and even enable an option to skip to the next checkpoint should a particular puzzle be too challenging.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it feels safe to say that the challenge is part of what makes <em>Split Fiction</em> feel like a rewarding experience. There were quite a few segments where I ended up dying or failing, but it was still in good fun to get back up and try it again.</p>

<p>Sure, it can get frustrating, but the feeling of success is sure hard to beat.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction_20250225180206.jpg?itok=KILWLnvF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction_20250225180206.jpg?itok=iNNP2are 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
On the visual side of things, <em>Split Fiction</em> has a clean, stylized look that suits both its sci-fi and fantasy aesthetics. There are a lot of bright colors that really stand out, and there’s a defined contrast between the two types of levels.</p>

<p>Performance, even when playing online on PlayStation 5, felt very smooth, and connecting with my co-op friend was easy enough. There will also be a feature at launch that will let you share the game with any of your friends, even if they don’t have a copy. This feature was unavailable during my review time.</p>

<h2><em>Split Fiction</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>After 20 hours, I can safely say that <em>Split Fiction</em> is a wonder of a game, and I still can’t get over just how much is packed in there. Not only that, but the Hazelight team has pulled it off flawlessly.</p>

<p>Gameplay is smooth across all levels, it looks and runs great, and – most importantly – it’s fun to play. While there are a few clunky mechanics here and there, the very breadth of everything <em>Split Fiction</em> has to offer more than makes up for those shortcomings.</p>

<p>The narrative as well – sure, the vehicle for it is rather simple, but the core friendship of Zoe and Mio is worth experiencing. I’m glad I got to spend time with them, and I look forward to seeing what crazy ideas Hazelight comes up with next.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/623660/split-fiction-review-hazelight-studios-it-takes-two<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24319677/split-fiction-hazelight-studios-trailer-date-josef-fares"><em>Split Fiction</em></a>, the new game from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22344923/it-takes-two-review-ps5-ps4-xbox-one-series-x-pc"><em>It Takes Two</em></a> developer Hazelight Studios, doesn’t do anything particularly new. The game is a straightforward co-op adventure that strings together disparate sci-fi and fantasy games like links on a chain. If you bundled together the sci-fi and fantasy sections as separate entities, they wouldn’t form a cohesive experience in either gameplay or story. And the overarching narrative that connects them all is a pretty heavy-handed (though necessary, in today’s climate) parable about the rapaciousness of generative AI tools and the creative bankruptcy of the executives that develop them.</p><p>Nevertheless, there’s an ironic genius in <em>Split Fiction</em> precisely because it takes so many little gameplay elements that I’ve seen and done before and executes them with a brilliance and polish I have not. </p><p>In <em>Split Fiction</em>, you and a partner play as Zoe and Mio, two people who have come to the curiously named Rader Corporation under the auspices of getting their stories published. But — <em>gasp! — </em>instead of getting paid, they get trapped in a machine designed to extract people’s creative ideas. After mishaps and shenanigans, Zoe and Mio are forced to work their way through virtual simulations of each other’s stories in hopes of stopping Rader’s plan to “own” all stories to exploit for profit forever. It’s about as subtle as a brick to the face, but what do you expect from the studio run by the guy who said, “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22826987/josef-fares-hazelight-studios-it-takes-two-game-of-the-year">Fuck the Oscars</a>”?</p><p><em>Split Fiction</em> is an obligate co-op game. For this review, my husband Travis and I hopped between Mio’s futuristic cities and Zoe’s fantastical kingdoms like walking through the cars of a passenger train. In each section, we got a new set of powers designed to work only in that particular world. </p><p>For one level themed around shapeshifting, I had the power to turn into a magical ape and an otter, while Travis could transform into a fairy or a Groot-like tree creature. We had to use our different forms with their different abilities in tandem to navigate the world. My ape form smashed obstacles that impeded our path, while Travis’ Groot form manipulated the environment to create new paths forward. </p><p>In one of the sci-fi sections, I… wait, I actually don’t remember. Let me go look.</p><p>Oh, yeah. I got a sword that slashed enemies and also functioned as a kind of personal gravity manipulator while Travis toyed around with a whip that pulled enemies and other objects toward him. In that memory lapse lies my one complaint with the game: the moment-to-moment gameplay dissolves in your mind like so much cotton candy. </p><p>Mario’s powers in <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>, like the elephant power-up or the drill hat, were so distinct and unique that they carved out their own place in my memory of the game. There’s a reason people can recall <em>Titanfall 2</em>’s Effect and Cause or <em>Halo 2</em>’s Gravemind levels by name. <em>Split Fiction</em> has none of that. Yes, it’s fun in the moment and is an immensely enjoyable experience overall, but the things you do in it and the story it tells are so generic they’re immediately forgettable. Travis and I finished <em>Split Fiction</em> in 12 hours stretched across daily play sessions over the last week. And though we rolled credits just yesterday, neither of us could recall with any certainty any of the powers we had in the first five hours of the game.</p><p>But, honestly, that’s okay because it’s not the gameplay itself that makes <em>Split Fiction</em> as enjoyable as it is; it’s the co-op experience. Most co-op games we’ve played aren’t true cooperative experiences, and we wind up playing a game separately together. But <em>Split Fiction</em> is strict as hell, requiring precise communication and execution while being forgiving enough that players at different skill levels (say, parent and child) can still play together.</p><p>Our favorite moment in the whole game was where he and I essentially played two-player pinball. We navigated the level — I controlled the paddles and launcher, he controlled the ball — while a boss chased us. We had to give each other directions about what paddle I had to flick or precisely when he had to jump while outrunning a murderous robot, where one mistake or missed timing would result in death. There’s something so good about talking with your partner through a high-stakes task. Cliche as it sounds, it felt like our minds and bodies had melded together like the Jaeger pilots in <em>Pacific Rim</em>. It was honestly kinda sexy.</p><p>It was also really fun how our character choices mapped exactly to our personalities. I chose Mio, the sci-fi writer, while Travis was Zoe, the fantasy girl. Like Zoe, my husband doesn’t care for sci-fi, but his lockscreen and desktop background are an ever-rotating gallery of old-school high-fantasy art. Meanwhile I, like Mio, get annoyed with my husband and Zoe’s indefatigable cheerfulness and can watch <em>Interstellar,</em> <em>Sunshine</em>, and <em>Event Horizon </em>on repeat. It was really cute.</p><p>While <em>Split Fiction</em>’s story is largely forgettable, we both enjoyed its telling. The game is littered with references to so many other games, and it was fun pointing them out. I’m a big sap, so I enjoyed seeing my husband get excited about a reference he caught. I got such a kick when he recognized the legally distinct <em>Halo 2</em> section or started happily shouting, “It’s <em>Battletoads</em>!” during a boss fight. I’ll also say the game’s final boss fight had the innovation I had hoped to see more of throughout the game itself. I won’t spoil the specifics because it’s a nice little parting gift to players, but it was a trippy, exciting sequence that played hell on our visual perception.</p><p>Since we played <em>It Takes Two</em> together, we were looking forward to <em>Split Fiction</em> also having little minigame breaks in the middle of the narrative. <em>Split Fiction</em>’s version of that were side stories where Zoe and Mio would pop out of the main story to have a short adventure in another world. Travis’ favorite was a creepy-cute <em>Fall Guy</em>s-inspired level where we played as anthropomorphic teeth, while mine involved sketches of characters progressing through a story where all the action was being drawn in real time by a giant pencil.</p><p>We loved <em>Split Fiction</em> because, along with its predecessor <em>It Takes Two</em>, it’s the only modern game my husband and I can play together that doesn’t leave us wanting to kill each other. The gameplay was simple but required a level of cooperation that was deeply satisfying to pull off. It’s a cotton-candy ass game, and I won’t be able to tell you a specific thing about it in a week other than it’s fun, but that’s fine. We like cotton candy because it tastes good, not because eating it is a particularly memorable experience.</p><p><sub><em>Split Fiction </em>launches March 6th on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It’s never going to be finished like you’d want. <em>Ultimate General: American Revolution </em>marks the end of the line for the small wargame studio built around former Total War modder Nick “DarthMod” Thomadis. They had an incredibly promising debut with <em>Ultimate General: Gettysburg</em>, still one of the most beautiful and replayable casual wargames ever made, but never went back to the “single battle” style of wargame and pursued larger, theoretically more replayable dynamic campaigns. <em>American Revolution </em>was far and away the most ambitious attempt on these lines yet, and perhaps that ambition played a role in the fact that Thomadis and other senior leadership left the studio and wrapped up work on <em>American Revolution </em>after its hastened exit from Early Access on Steam.&nbsp;</p><p>As you might expect, Steam reviews are deeply negative, both from players who feel ripped-off by the semi-unfinished state of the game and from those who think the series’ developers were let down by their publisher. Those reviews might be overly harsh: <em>Ultimate General: American Revolution </em>is good enough to be heartbreaking, an enormously fun and flawed toy that suggests Game-Labs was improbably on the right track.</p><figure></figure><p><em>American Revolution</em> has a strategic layer that owes a lot to Longbow Games’ <em>Hegemony </em>series, a terrific real-time ancient warfare strategy game where your ability to see what was happening around your empire&nbsp; depended on your line of sight, and you were often racing to-and-fro to drive off raids and expand into rivals’ territory. The other point of reference, one that is almost directly quoted in the interface, is <em>Hearts of Iron</em>’s model of territorial development and military production. The art style on the strategic map is consistent with the bright, museum display-style maps that the series used in both its Civil War outings. When armies move into proximity there, you get the option of letting them whittle each other down in a slow-paced simulated battle, or intervening at any point to fight a tactical battle.</p><p>The connection between the strategic layer and the tactical battles is handled excellently here. If units have been campaigning for days in difficult countryside, you will find they enter the battle exhausted and depleted by sickness and injury. If they are fresh off another battle, they will be low on ammunition. Once a unit is out of ammo, the game assumes soldiers are able to scrounge rounds from the battlefield, meaning that they can still shoot but at a vastly slower rate that leaves them sitting ducks in a firefight. The battlefields are also huge, so while the game recycles a lot of them, battles play out very differently depending on where units start and when reinforcements arrive (based on their location on the strategic map when the battle begins.</p><figure></figure><p>This has the foundations of a very good game about the American Revolution: the backbone of the Americans’ forces at the start of the game are militia who are plentiful enough but untrained and out-of-shape. They can form a credible battle line but they can’t hold against a charge, and they can’t maneuver much without being completely exhausted by the effort. The game does a great job of giving you the kinds of battles that gave Washington such fits early in the war, where the Americans would hold a strong position and then come completely undone when pressed by British regulars. Further, the colonists don’t have an armaments industry to speak of at the start of the war and their infantry carry civilian muskets into battle, which don’t shoot as far, aren’t designed for quick loading or fitting a bayonet. Small quantities of military-grade weapons are available on the marketplace, so you can give your best troops something like parity with the British, and American victories usually yield them a supply of Brown Bess muskets and precious cannons, but it takes a while before the Americans can build good weapons in sufficient quantity to have something like a professional army. </p>

This latest release, with its marriage of fantasy and science fiction, still feels as fresh and inventive as <em>It Takes Two </em>and <em>A Way Out </em>did for their time, which is all the more impressive considering that the studio has been releasing these co-op adventures now for the better part of a decade.</p><p><em>Split Fiction </em>follows two aspiring writers: Mio, a broody science fiction author, and Zoe, a bubbly fantasy lover. The two could not be more diametrically opposed, but they only have to suffer each other’s presence for a day as they meet at the offices of Rader Publishing, each hoping to secure a deal for her books. However, when the corporation asks that they enter a virtual simulation of their own stories, Mio is rightfully suspicious and tries to fight her way out, before she is accidentally forced into Zoe’s simulation and the entire system goes haywire. Now, with both writers’ stories intertwined, Mio and Zoe must break out of the simulation by finding glitches scattered throughout, all while trying to survive in hostile fictional environments of their own creation.</p><p><strong>Order <em>Split Fiction:</em></strong> <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Split-Fiction-Standard-Steam-Online/dp/B0DV7MGWS3?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;th=1" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0DV7MGWS3" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/fwy569cafn57s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/fwy569cafn57s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://cdkeys.pxf.io/c/379647/1566025/18216?subId1=KT&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdkeys.com%2Fsplit-fiction-pc-steam&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://cdkeys.pxf.io/c/379647/1566025/18216?subId1=KT&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdkeys.com%2Fsplit-fiction-pc-steam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDKeys</a></span></p><figure id="" data-id="267fc980cbfab71fd650a0beb30223bd" data-recommend-id="image://267fc980cbfab71fd650a0beb30223bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mio and Zoe sitting on a bench with dragons on their backs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mio and Zoe sitting on a bench with dragons on their backs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="267fc980cbfab71fd650a0beb30223bd" data-recommend-id="image://267fc980cbfab71fd650a0beb30223bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mio and Zoe sitting on a bench with dragons on their backs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On its face, <em>Split Fiction</em>’s swapping back and forth between science fiction levels and vast fantasy worlds is novel, but not groundbreaking.

Right now, AI machine learning algorithms are being trained to steal from creatives and present the garbage they churn out as original works, while the people poised to profit from them use notions of leveling the creative playing field to justify the plagiarism these tools depend on. Even if director Josef Fares seems hesitant to call it the core theme of the game, choosing instead to focus on the friendship between the two women <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-preview-josef-fares-ai-hazelight-co-op-1851765494&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-preview-josef-fares-ai-hazelight-co-op-1851765494">in interviews</a></span>, I’d say the most compelling thing about <em>Split Fiction</em> is the cathartic act of artistic reclamation.</p><p>The game<em> </em>spends plenty of time delving into why Mio writes violent sci-fi and Zoe delves into escapist fantasy, and fighting through their stories means confronting all the internal baggage that those worlds have tied to them in their writers’ imaginations. So often we talk about how AI technology steals from artists, writers, and actors as a crime against their livelihoods. While that’s an important part of it, what I loved most about <em>Split Fiction </em>was that it illustrates how generative slop also robs the work of its human meaning. Yeah, Rader’s machines can probably generate an amorphous science fiction story faster and cheaper than the one Mio writes, but if it’s not fueled by her past and all the trauma she’s gone through, it’s just capital C Content to be bought and consumed. And yeah, the stories my co-op partner and I played through aren’t going to be winning any literary awards, but they were made by a person with hopes, dreams, and things to say. Fighting our way through those stories to save them from being devoured by some rich asshole’s machine gives them meaning, even if they’re not that interesting on their own.</p><figure id="" data-id="0f3c1f97ff208c24bf8b5edecf39aa25" data-recommend-id="image://0f3c1f97ff208c24bf8b5edecf39aa25" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bullet hell section in Split Fiction." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A bullet hell section in Split Fiction." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f3c1f97ff208c24bf8b5edecf39aa25" data-recommend-id="image://0f3c1f97ff208c24bf8b5edecf39aa25" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bullet hell section in Split Fiction." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Using Mio and Zoe’s stories as a basis, <em>Split Fiction </em>riffs on similar design ideas as <em>It Takes Two</em>. Each level shifts between genres and also has a core cooperative loop that requires you and your co-op partner to coordinate. As the game shifts between fantasy and sci-fi, every level leans into a different subgenre and that means even any two sci-fi levels will play entirely differently. <em>Split Fiction </em>is bursting at the seams with fun and challenging ideas that blend video game genres as much as literary ones. I know plenty of people played<em> It Takes Two</em> with partners who were less familiar with video games and generally managed fine; <em>Split Fiction</em> takes on so many different gaming genres that it may at first seem tougher to handle for those less versed in games, but its design goes to great lengths to keep things approachable, even for those who have never played the kinds of games it’s referencing.</p><p>There are levels based on rhythm games and old-school run-and-guns like <em>Metal Slug</em>, as well as sequences involving high-speed bike chases, puzzle-solving on dragonback, and even some out-of-pocket side stories I won’t spoil here. What ties it all together is a clear attention to intuitive design that makes it easy to transition from one tightly crafted space to another and pick up on new mechanics unlike anything you’ve played up to that point. The game seamlessly escalates between teaching you a new mechanic and then communicating new ways it can be used within a level, and the way it throws new tools and problems your way is consistently surprising. Communication between both players is an important part of <em>Split Fiction</em>, but because there’s such clarity to how levels are designed, there were long stretches in which my partner and I could get through tricky cooperative maneuvers without even speaking.</p><figure id="" data-id="94f63eb3669de4836d707745a2927d0d" data-recommend-id="image://94f63eb3669de4836d707745a2927d0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Split Fiction screenshot shows Mio driving a motorcycle and Zoe using a phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Split Fiction screenshot shows Mio driving a motorcycle and Zoe using a phone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="94f63eb3669de4836d707745a2927d0d" data-recommend-id="image://94f63eb3669de4836d707745a2927d0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Split Fiction screenshot shows Mio driving a motorcycle and Zoe using a phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So many standout moments in <em>Split Fiction</em> had me and my partner hootin’ and hollerin’ as we took on whatever Hazelight threw at us. The game’s willingness to get silly, both in between the edgy sci-fi stories and fantasy epics and sometimes in the midst of them, was a constant pleasant surprise. I was already enjoying <em>Split Fiction</em>, but the moment it clicked with me was in one of Mio’s science fiction stories in which I was driving a motorcycle through a cyberpunk city while my partner, on the back of the bike, was attempting to disengage its self-destruct order on a smartphone, a process which included realistic captcha puzzles and various other annoying things our phones ask us to do on the way to being useful. It was in that segment that I knew <em>Split Fiction </em>would keep us on our toes and we would never know what to expect.</p><p>Several of these surprising and silly segments happen during side stories, which are optional vignettes from the subconscious of the writers dating back as far as their early memories of writing childish nonsense in elementary school. They might see a dentist appointment turned into a straight-up horror story, or make a whole puzzle-platformer out of pigs launching themselves with rainbow-powered farts. <em>Split Fiction</em> could have stuck to its sci-fi and fantasy levels and still been an excellent game, but I loved the way it illustrated that storytelling doesn’t just start when you’re putting pen to paper intending to be published. A creative person is often imagining stories from a young age, and if a machine is going to rip those stories out of someone’s mind, why would it only pull from the ones they intended to put into a book?</p><p>The one part of the game that I won’t spoil but have to sing the praises of is the final level. Throughout <em>Split Fiction</em>, I was curious how the game would spotlight both its heroes and their stories equally in its finale, and the way Hazelight goes about wrapping up the game is, without exaggeration, one of the most impressive video game sequences I’ve ever played. The studio was straight up just showing off at this point, and I’m kinda mad I’ll never experience it for the first time again. That’s the kind of feeling you can’t scrap from a creative person’s brain and sell as slop. <em>Split Fiction</em> is a culmination of the design ideas the studio has been working with since <em>A Way Out</em>, and it kinda feels like Hazelight threw everything it had at a wall, and it all stuck. It’s a tribute to several video games and to genre fiction, but also to the creative process itself. Fares may think people and AI <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ai-game-development-split-fictions-josef-fares-says-developers-should-work-with-and-not-against-technology/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ai-game-development-split-fictions-josef-fares-says-developers-should-work-with-and-not-against-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">should co-exist in creative fields</a></span>, but when you’re already making games this inventive, do they have to?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-assassins-creed-shadows-pre-order-bonuses-editions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has gone with a different approach for pre-order bonuses and editions. It could be a beneficial move to help the latest sequel succeed, and we’ve got the latest on every AC Shadows edition and how to claim pre-order bonuses.</p>



<p>Ubisoft isn’t shy about having multiple editions for one of its AAA releases. This is evident with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> having several different editions to choose. In a positive move, Ubisoft has ditched the title’s Season Pass and is offering planned post-launch content for free—to an extent.</p>



<p>This is likely part of the reason why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-preorders-in-line-with-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows pre-orders are strong</a>. So let’s catch you up on every AC Shadows edition and all pre-order bonuses.</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-pre-order-bonuses">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Pre-Order Bonuses</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s free. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Every edition of Assassin’s Creed Shadows has two pre-order bonuses: The Claws of Awaji of DLC and the Thrown to the Dogs Quest.</strong></p>



<p>To be clear, if you pre-order <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/shadows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, you get both pieces of content for free. Thrown to the Dogs is a typical AC quest found in the game, whereas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-expansion-claws-of-awaji/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Claws of Awaji is a DLC with 10+ hours of new content</a>. The first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay trailer</a> is very promising, and if you’re looking to maximize your Assassin’s Creed Shadows experience, it might be worth pre-ordering early.</p>



<p>If you don’t, The Claws of Awaji DLC will be released at a later on as a standalone purchase. There is no Season Pass for Shadows, making it the first AC release in a long time to skip the popular business move.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-assassin-s-creed-shadows-editions-amp-prices">Every Assassin’s Creed Shadows Editions &amp; Prices</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Decisions, decisions. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>

            <p>Firaxis has released its <a href="https://newsroom-uk.2k.com/resources/civ-vii-dev-roadmap-feb-2025">development roadmap</a> for Civilization 7, promising UI updates and more refinements starting from today.</p>
<p>The first update, 1.1.0, is available now and adds a new natural wonder - Bermuda Triangle - as well as "additional UI updates and polish". A further update, 1.1.1, will arrive on 25th March with another natural wonder - Mount Everest - and more UI polish.</p>
<p>Following the strategy game's early access release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firaxis-acknowledges-civilization-7-issues-fixes-incoming">Firaxis acknowledged issues with the game</a> as highlighted by its "passionate community" and identified key areas of focus.</p>

<p>The biggest priority was UI: "We need some time to digest all of your feedback, but some areas that we're already looking into include making UI interactions more intuitive, improving map readability, fixing areas of polish like formatting, and more," the developer previously explained.</p>
<p>The two March updates, as well as another in April and beyond, all promise to make UI improvements, which should appease players.</p>
<p>Update 1.2.0 will arrive in April, adding multiplayer teams functionality, new resource types, and a "one more turn" option in the Modern Age.</p>
<p>Modding tools will also be added in a future update, along with additional map sizes, AI improvements and - you guessed it - additional UI updates.</p>

<p>"We will support Civilization 7 for years to come, and your feedback remains critical in helping us grow and build the future of Civ," Firaxis said in its previous post.</p>
<p>Civilization 7 released in full on 11th February. "A competent entry with some poorly executed ideas and a striking lack of personality," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">Civ 7 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
