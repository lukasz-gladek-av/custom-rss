			<p>New details on CD Projekt Red's mysterious Project Hadar emerged online today thanks to a new job ad discovered online.</p>



<p>As spotted by<a href="https://tech4gamers.com/cdpr-project-hadar-action-rpg-melee-combat/"> Tech4Gamers</a>, CD Projekt Red is looking to hire a Senior Gameplay Designer specifically for the development of Project Hadar, a new IP from the studio, with at least 5 years of experience in the RPG/action titles with melee-oriented combat, suggesting the game will have a major focus on close range combat. The rest of the required qualifications don't reveal anything new about this game, such as experience in working with Unreal Engine 4 and Unreal Engine 5, as the studio announced a while back that Epic's engine would power its future projects.</p>



<p>Project Hadar is only one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-3-witcher-projects-new-ip-in-development-cd-projekt-red/">many projects</a> in development at CD Projekt Red, which include a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, currently known as Project Orion, and the next entry in The Witcher series, The Witcher 4. Revealed last year during The Game Awards show, the next entry in the series, which will star Ciri in place of Geralt of Rivia, is being made with a console-first approach and will take<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-dev-wants-to-take-full-advantage-of-the-generational-shift-since-the-witcher-3-tech-demos-village-npc-density-was-based-on-novigrad/"> full advantage of the generational shift </a>since The Witcher 3. How this will be achieved remains to be seen, but if the tech demo shown <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">last month</a> is of any indication, it definitely looks like CD Projekt Red will have no trouble surpassing anything it has released so far.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, VShojo, the VTuber talent agency that claims to put "talent first," came under fire as its biggest talent, Ironmouse, alleged that the company had failed to pay her a "significant sum" of money, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twitchs-biggest-vtuber-quits-agency-alleging-missing-charity-funds-of-over-500000/1100-6533329/" data-ref-id="1100-6533329">failing to donate</a> more than $515,000 that she had raised for the Immune Deficiency Foundation. Now, after a mass exodus of its talent that saw VShojo without a single remaining VTuber on its books, the CEO has admitted to spending those funds to try to keep the company afloat.</p><p>In a statement posted to the <a href="https://x.com/VShojo/status/1948442574722924778" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VShojo X account </a>on July 24, CEO Justin Ignacio has admitted that he has "mismanaged the company into the situation you're all witnessing." Ignacio goes on to confirm that VShojo has been facing financial difficulties in recent months, and that despite raising "around $11 million" to pursue a "talent-first" approach, the company eventually ran out of money. Ignacio says that "some of the money was raised in connection with talent activity," and claims that he later learned that it was intended for a charitable initiative. He continues, "We were working hard to raise additional investment capital to cover our costs, and I firmly believed, based on the information available to us, that we would be able to do so and cover all our expenses. We were unsuccessful in our fundraising efforts."</p><p>However, <a href="https://t.co/TJZBz8jga5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">users on X</a> have pointed out <a href="https://t.co/sxmoBNqh8G" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">several instances</a> where Ignacio acknowledged Ironmouse's charity streams at the time, and allege that he did not "later learn" this fact at all, but was aware for the duration of VShojo's struggles. As a response to the situation, <a href="https://x.com/RimaEvenstar/status/1948526128391721036" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitch has removed the "GunRun" global emote</a> that was dedicated to Ignacio.</p><p>As Ignacio confirmed that "VShojo is shutting down," some former talents are taking this as a sign that the nondisclosure agreements that they signed are no longer valid. Several VTubers have spoken out and alleged that the company had "<a href="https://x.com/Veibae/status/1948509619543822703" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">predatory contracts</a>," and claiming that they are owed merch and sponsorship funds from "<a href="https://t.co/NyQZbKvso1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">years ago</a>."</p><p>In line with discovering that the funds she raised had not been donated to the Immune Deficiency Foundation, Ironmouse launched her own <a href="https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tiltify campaign</a> to raise money for the charity. At the time of writing, it has surpassed $1.25 million raised in just three days.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> developer Build A Rocket Boy has delayed its previously announced Hitman mission, as it continues to issue fixes to the game.</p>
<p>In a new post, Build A Rocket Boy apologised that its Hitman crossover mission with publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> would no longer be releasing in July as once planned. Rather, the studio has moved this release back to an unspecified date down the line. "We look forward to delivering this exciting crossover when the time is right and will provide further updates as soon as we're able," it wrote.</p>
<p>What Build A Rocket Boy does have planned for the coming months, though, is two more updates promising yet more performance improvements. In August, the studio will also introduce skippable cutscenes.</p>

<p>"It's been just over a month since MindsEye launched, and we're grateful for your support and detailed feedback," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1m8ykoy/july_update_from_the_studio/">the team wrote on reddit</a>. "Your input is shaping our ongoing efforts to enhance the game."</p>
<p>Since this post has gone live, many on the game's Discord are now lamenting the lack of a clear roadmap for MindsEye and content in general.</p>
<p>"Confirmation that Hitman is delayed is good and all, but there's no substantial content or really anything to bring people back until after September," a user wrote. "What's the point of the premium pass or getting a deluxe edition if we don't get the promised content," one user added (to which another replied with simply: "Cash grabbing punks.")</p>
<p>Another commenter on the MindsEye Discord wrote: "Of course, we do want the game to get fixed. But what we also need is content, or else there is literally no point continuing to try and fix stuff." Someone even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">suggested Build A Rocket Boy take a leaf out of Splitgate 2's book</a>, and rerelease MindsEye in an 'early access' state.</p>
<p>"As a console player, there is literally no reason to return to this game," yet another user on the MindsEye Discord wrote.</p>
<p>These sentiments are echoed on the MindsEye reddit. "I want more MindsEye  missions to be added. Community and developer made ones as promised. As well as the essential fixes needed for free roam. Different playable characters, driveable vehicles, time of day, etc," reads one reply to Build A Rocket Boy's latest update.</p>
<p>Others are just annoyed that in its update post, the studio hasn't really said anything of any real importance. "This update doesn't say anything meaningful at all, are you kidding?" reads a reply.</p>

<p>MindsEye released earlier this year, however it wasn't the smoothest of launches. Many found themselves presented with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">distorting character bugs and stuttering issues when they booted up the game</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to its release, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">CEO of Build a Rocket Boy suggested negative reviews had been paid for</a>, though MindsEye's publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-publisher-doesnt-believe-negative-comments-were-paid-for-despite-developer-suggesting-otherwise">did not share this belief</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-review">Eurogamer's review of MindsEye</a>, writer Rick Lane said: "Although it shows some early promise, MindsEye is sunk by a ridiculous story, inconsistent writing, poorly designed mission scenarios, and utterly atrocious combat." We awarded it one star.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseyes-hitman-crossover-mission-delayed-leaving-its-community-starving-for-content]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/early-digital-sales-data-from-newzoo-shows-toby-fox%E2%80%99s-deltarune-topping-nintendo-switch-2-sales-charts-in-select-markets.1253313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a> has published a <a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/nintendo-switch-2-launch-what-early-digital-data-reveals-for-third-party-games">new report</a> looking at the data from early digital sales on the Nintendo Switch 2, as Newzoo's product manager, Max Otten, tried to get an early answer to the question of whether the Switch 2 is a viable ecosystem for third-party developers and publishers.</p>



<p>Otten looked at digital sales data for June 2025 from six major markets, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Germany, and France, and saw that three out of the top five games by units sold on the Nintendo Switch 2 were third-party titles. At the top of them all? Toby Fox's long-awaited Undertale follow-up, Deltarune.</p>



<p>Deltarune doing well isn't the biggest surprise, considering that <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-rematch-newzoo-june-2025/">a week ago</a>, Newzoo reported that it had made it into the top-20 games by revenue for June 2025. However, that knowledge doesn't exactly wear off the shock of seeing it over top of Mario Kart World, though this is where it's important to remember that the sales data Newzoo is pulling from does <strong>not</strong> include physical sales. In the US alone, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-us-history/">82% of people who bought a Switch 2 also bought Mario Kart World in a physical forma</a>t, so it makes sense that the digital sales aren't as chart-topping as you might expect.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Though perhaps the most surprising aspect of Newzoo's report is seeing Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour in second place behind Deltarune, and ahead of Mario Kart World in third. Otten's guess at what happened here, while accurately calling Welcome Tour "<em>essentially a tech demo</em>" in the same breath, is that the combination of its "<em>low price and lack of launch-window exclusives likely helped drive</em> <em>sales</em>."</p>



<p>Rounding out the rest of the top five is Minecraft in the number four spot, and No Man's Sky in the number five spot, and once again, at least one of those games is not the third-party title you'd expect. Minecraft isn't a surprise, but No Man's Sky is, at least slightly, when considering that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37qmdfn2k">Cyberpunk 2077</a> on Switch 2 has been one of the standout third-party releases so far, at least in the US.</p>



<p>That top five changes slightly when Otten looks at which games that were exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2 had the biggest revenue share, with Mario Kart World in its expected top spot, followed by Fantasy Life I in second, Cyberpunk 2077 in third, No Man's Sky in fourth and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour in fifth, making it once again a three-to-two third-party games majority.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo</figcaption></figure>



<p>In fact, the only top five Otten shows in his report, where the majority of games listed are first-party Nintendo titles, is the list of top five titles by monthly active users for June 2025. Mario Kart World, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons take first, third, fourth, and fifth place on that list, respectively. Fortnite is the only third-party entry in the number two spot.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo</figcaption></figure>



<p>All this said, Otten closes his report by saying that "<em>While first-party titles command overall sales leadership, there are clear pockets of spending on third-party content—especially for games that are well-optimized, offer genre diversity, or present new experiences to the platform."</em></p>



<p>He adds that "<em>early data shows glimmers of promise for third-party titles at launch, and players are showing up for enhanced ports, narrative games, and non-traditional Switch genres.</em>"</p>



<p>We'll learn more about how viable the Nintendo Switch 2 ecosystem is for third-party titles the deeper into the console's life we go. Only looking at first-month sales in select major markets and sticking with digital sales is nowhere close to the whole picture. But Otten has shown how even new third-party titles can find chart-topping success. It'll be interesting to see what else is able to top the charts in the coming months. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher tinyBuild and developer Hypnohead have announced that their roguelite kingdom-builder&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>has hit a major sales milestone within its first four days on release.</p>

<p><em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>was released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-king-is-watching-release-date" rel="nofollow">on Monday this week</a>, and according to a <a href="https://x.com/TKIWGame/status/1948672902137811139" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official X (formerly Twitter) account, it's already hit the 100,000 sales mark. That puts it in good company, alongside the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pioneers-of-pagonia-100k-sales" rel="nofollow">Pioneers of Pagonia</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-sales-surpass-100k-copies-in-first-week" rel="nofollow">beaver colony sim&nbsp;<em>Timberborn</em></a>.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Hypnohead and tinyBuild <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2753900/view/542237641778661281" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that free content updates are in the works for&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching</em>, with features like mid-run saves being "actively work[ed] on", according to the two studios.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-king-is-watching-sales-100k-colony.jpg?itok=9k9uY5oa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-king-is-watching-sales-100k-colony.jpg?itok=D-9_d71p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>has reached an impressive sales figure in just four days.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching</em>, it's a roguelite kingdom-builder in which you must construct and maintain your kingdom, but with a unique twist (which the title has probably already given away).</p>

<p>As the king, you must actively watch areas of your kingdom you want to progress; if you don't, they will fall to "laziness" and "chaos", as the Steam page says, but watching them will result in progress "thriv[ing]".</p>

<p>You'll have to balance which parts of your kingdom you most want to succeed. Do you want to emphasize resource production, for instance, or defense to make sure your kingdom won't be caught unawares?</p>

<p>As you play, you'll gain upgrades that will allow you to watch more of your kingdom at once, and you'll also need to make decisions about where you want to invest the resources you've gathered in order to make your kingdom the best it can be.</p>




<p>Since this is a roguelite, you'll also have to deal with unique events that can significantly change the outcome of a run. Each run will allow you to unlock new abilities to help your kingdom thrive in future.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753900/The_King_is_Watching/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, where it's currently on sale for $13.49 or your local equivalent (although that's with a 10% discount).</p>

Still, our main focus was to make interaction with the game feel seamless—so players never have to think about how to play while they’re playing.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s promised duo mode is finally on the way, and will be added to the game next week.</p>
<p>From 30th July, a two-player mode will be available in patch 1.02, alongside some UI improvements and more Relics filtering options.</p>
<p>The mode was announced in a new trailer, which you can see below.</p>

<p>Despite being primarily a three-player co-operative game, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> spin-off has been criticised by players - in part because the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">included solo play was too tough</a>, and in part because a two-player option wasn't included.</p>
<p>Previous patches have re-balanced the solo mode, while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">two-player mode was promised at the start of June</a>. Now it's finally on the way.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-sold-over-5-million-copies-while-shadow-the-the-erdtree-makes-it-past-10-million-at-last">FromSoftware announced Elden Ring Nightreign has sold over 5m copies</a> since its release at the end of May.</p>
<p>Further, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree has sold 10m copies, meaning around a third of players have dived into the expansion.</p>
<p>FromSoftware has continued to update Nightreign with the rotating Everdark Sovereigns.

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-for-further-polish</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-for-further-polish.1253265/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>With just a month to go before the game's planned release, the Dying Light: The Beast team has announced a delay.</p>
<p>"It has always been our goal to make Dying Light: The Beast the best Dying Light game we've ever released," <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-moves">Techland wrote in an update</a>, stating that to "honour" this promise it would be delaying the release until 19th September. This will allow the team to add some extra polish before the zombie shooter gets released into the wild.</p>
<p>"We've been carefully listening to what you've been saying - whether through playtests, the recent preview coverage and in comments," the Dying Light: The Beast developer continued. "With just four additional weeks, we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great."</p>
<p>This extra time will see Techland making some adjustments to cutscene and player animations, as well as finetuning the balance of gameplay elements. It also aims to make the game's UI clearer.</p>
<p>"We know this might be disappointing to some fans, and we understand," Techaland said "Dying Light: The Beast is the culmination of everything we've learned in more than a decade of the series, and this experience has shown us how important the first impression is."</p>
<p>We got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-is-a-new-18-hour-standalone-game-that-began-life-as-dlc">first look at Dying Light: The Beast during Gamescom last year</a>, when Techland revealed this release initially started out as DLC. "But after two years of work, its size and scope has changed so much that it evolved into a standalone, self-contained experience," the studio wrote at the time. "To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human">Dying Light 2 Stay Human</a> Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC."</p>
<p>Then, last month, the studio announced an August release date (which has obviously now changed). At this time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-is-coming-out-on-25-august-revealed-at-summer-game-fest">Techland also released a new trailer</a>, featuring new gameplay, along with a variety of chases and parkour - a key feature in Dying Light games.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-studio-techland-cancels-two-in-development-games-clarifies-no-staff-reductions">it was reported Techland had cancelled two in-development games</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-for-further-polish]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-patapon-1-2-replay-switch-a-pleasing-return-for-some-psp-charmers.1253253/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Patapon 1+2 Replay Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157593/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Ever since I was a kid stomping his feet to pop songs in <strong>Dance Dance Revolution</strong> and getting pep talks from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/parappa_the_rapper">PaRappa the Rapper</a> about how I gotta believe, I’ve been a fan of rhythm games. And while I love popular juggernauts in the genre like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/guitar_hero_5">Guitar Hero</a>, I’ll always prefer something with more originality than just simply holding down a button, such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/theatrhythm_final_fantasy_curtain_call">Final Fantasy Theatrhythm</a>.</p>
<p>Cue <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon</a>, a quirky blend of rhythm and strategy originality released exclusively on Sony’s PSP and now out on other platforms thanks to Bandai Namco. You play as a god to the charming Smurf-esque creatures and use drums to direct them during missions. Your controller buttons correspond to a rhythmic phrase. Want them to move forward? That’s easy! <em>Pata pata pata pon!</em> Need to attack? No problem; just hit ‘em with a <em>pon pon pata pon</em> combo. Keep the beat going and you’ll enter into a Fever, which increases your attack and defence.</p>
<figure><a title="Patapon 1+2 Replay Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157586/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s a novel concept for a game. You’re completely detached from the Patapon who worship you because you’re viewed as a god. It’s by far more preferable to having an actual in-game avatar because it easily lets you slip into your role as the Patapons’ saviour. You can’t help but grow attached to the Patapons themselves. They’re just lil’ eyeball guys! In a lot of ways, it reminds me of the connection you form with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pikmin_1">Pikmin</a>. You <em>want</em> to protect your Patapon because they’re yours.</p>
<p>The gameplay is largely simplistic but that’s not necessarily a detriment. In fact, the game works better because of its simplicity, especially when it comes to the general gameplay loop.</p>
<p>You’ll be doing a lot of grinding missions over and over to collect Ka-Ching and other materials that let you create stronger Patapon units, of which there’s a decent variety, from spear throwers to archers.</p>
<p>That grind might sound annoying but the missions in both games are bite-sized little morsels, so you aren’t locking yourself into 10-minute missions or anything worse. I suspect this is because both games were originally on the PSP and it was better for the missions to be quick and snappy rather than long and drawn out. Regardless, it works in each game’s favour.</p>
<figure><a title="Patapon 1+2 Replay Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157585/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But don’t go into Patapon expecting a Guitar Hero clone. Patapon utilises rhythm, but personally, I’m hesitant to call it a rhythm game. It’s more of a strategy game that uses rhythm than a rhythm game with strategy elements.</p>
<p>That also means you shouldn’t go in expecting a toe-tapping soundtrack. Patapon’s usage of rhythm doesn’t necessarily make for good music to listen to. You may only be playing percussion but Drum Hero this ain’t.</p>
<p>There are issues, however. For starters, you can’t pause the game, which is frankly ridiculous in 2025. You can work around this by pressing the Home button rather than a pause button, but it’s still ridiculous. And I can’t count the number of times I was so close to entering Fever mode only to screw up by being the tiniest bit off beat. Sometimes it seems like you have enough space to attack only to realise you need to keep marching forward.</p>
<figure><a title="Patapon 1+2 Replay Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157594/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And worse, it’s very easy to throw off your sense of rhythm when it comes to things like boosting your defence. You can chalk it up to being a skill issue but while you can alter the button-press delay in options, you can’t test your changes out without going into a mission and then exiting it, which is incredibly frustrating and time-consuming.</p>
<p>One thing that can’t be complained about is the aesthetic of the games. There’s an almost moving comic book-like quality to these little eyeball monsters. They’re absolutely adorable to look at, and it’s fun watching them follow your commands in battle by throwing spears or cutting up enemies. And the backdrops in the missions are absolutely beautiful, with crisp shades of reds, yellows, blues, and more. Patapon oozes style in spades and its aesthetic is its biggest strength, even over the gameplay’s.</p>
<p>Patapon is fun to play in docked but I’d argue that it feels best in handheld mode, harkening back to its earlier PSP days. There’s just something about plugging in your headphones and chilling on the couch while sending your Patapon army into battle. The performance is largely the same between docked and handheld, so you won’t be missing out either way.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Patapon 1+2 Replay is a real blast from the past and more than proves why this series was such a hit for Sony. It’s simple to play, but if you dig deeper you’ll find that there’s a real meaty game here. The rhythm-based controls make it unlike any strategy game you’ve ever played before. There are some small frustrations, but generally it succeeds in what it tries to do.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/last-epoch-developer-eleventh-hour-games-acquired-by-krafton.1253250/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Eleventh Hour Games, the developer and publisher of hack-and-slash action RPG&nbsp;<em>Last Epoch</em>, has announced that it's been acquired by&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton for an undisclosed sum.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/a-new-chapter-for-eleventh-hour-games/78482" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Last Epoch&nbsp;</em>forum, Eleventh Hour founder Judd Cobler, also known as moxjet200, says Krafton was the right choice for his studio because the publisher "shares [Eleventh Hour's] passion for the ARPG genre".</p>

<p>Cobler says the partnership between Eleventh Hour and Krafton will give his studio "the opportunity and resources to execute on [its] goal of creating the very best ARPG in the genre", which is a lofty goal indeed given just how much <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-changes-grinding-gear" rel="nofollow">competition</a> there is in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-4-roadmap-2025" rel="nofollow">space</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/last-epoch-eleventh-hour-games-krafton-purchase-beam.jpg?itok=fMd3ZiI2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/last-epoch-eleventh-hour-games-krafton-purchase-beam.jpg?itok=arPPcM7g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Last Epoch&nbsp;</em>developer Eleventh Hour Games has been purchased by Krafton.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Cobler, he spoke to "dozens of strategics and potential partners" before settling on Krafton, having decided that the partnership will guide Eleventh Hour through "some of the largest upcoming challenges [it will] face as a studio".</p>

<p>This is far from the first acquisition Krafton has made in recent years. Back in August last year, the publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">acquired Tango Gameworks and its&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>IP</a>&nbsp;following its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">shutdown at the hands of Microsoft</a> (which, in retrospect, would seemingly prove to be the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">start of a pattern</a> for the tech giant).</p>

<p>Prior to that, Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-ascent-developer-neon-giant" rel="nofollow">snapped up&nbsp;<em>The Ascent&nbsp;</em>studio Neon Giant</a> in 2022, which itself followed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-owner-krafton-buys-subnautica-dev-unknown-worlds" rel="nofollow">purchase of&nbsp;<em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>developer Unknown Worlds</a> the year prior.</p>

<p>The latter would prove to be a somewhat poisoned chalice for Krafton; earlier this month, the publisher fired the former heads and founders of Unknown Worlds, prompting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-charlie-cleveland-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">a lawsuit</a>&nbsp;in which said founders alleged their ousting (and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow"><em>Subnautica 2</em>'s delay</a>) was part of a plot to avoid paying employees a sizable bonus.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-2-krafton-unknown-worlds-last-epoch.jpg?itok=Es2mWZNo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-2-krafton-unknown-worlds-last-epoch.jpg?itok=sd_v0HTC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton's other acquisitions include&nbsp;<em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>studio Unknown Worlds.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly how Krafton's acquisition will affect Eleventh Hour, well, Cobler says it won't, really. He <a href="https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/a-new-chapter-for-eleventh-hour-games/78482/4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> his studio will remain a subsidiary under Krafton and won't be merged into the publisher; in fact, new staff will be hired soon, apparently.</p>

More than 150 previews were published this week from journalists and content creators and their response was universally positive. We’re blushing about quotes like “nailbiting survival <a title="Genres > Horror [665 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>,” “absolute blast,” “project with a soul,” and being called a “standout game of 2025.” It proved the gut feeling that we had already—we’re making a very special, fun game.</p><p>It also proved that the <em>Dying Light</em> community is the best. The preview coverage has been viewed by millions of players who looked at every detail of the game with laser focus eyes, highlighting, discussing and getting excited about thousands of details. We’re spending time effortlessly, reading and collecting your feedback and opinions and making sure that your voice is heard and we know exactly what’s important for you.</p><p>It has always been our goal to make <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> the best <em>Dying Light</em> game we’ve ever released. To honor this promise, we’ve made the decision to move the release date to September 19, 2025 to allow for extra polishing work.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>We understand that this may be disappointing, but our experience has shown how important the first impression is. With just four additional weeks, we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great. Areas we want to improve include finetuning the balance of gameplay elements, looking into clarity of UI, increasing the quality of physics, as well as tweaking cutscenes and player animations further as well as adding last little details.</p><p>We’ll keep you busy this summer with regular updates from the studio and a playable demo at Gamescom in Hall 6. Starting next week, we’ll also share an update on the game’s gore and you’ll meet our good friend Bober the Beaver again.</p><p>We’re almost there so please bear with us for the remaining eight weeks—we can’t wait until you finally unleash the Beast on September 19.</p><p>With the best regards from the entire team at Techland,<br>The Developers of <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em></p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-to-september-19]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Have you been waiting to hear any news of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/" data-ref-id="5000-465595">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> recently? Well, you might be in luck because the upcoming game has recently been given an age rating, suggesting that it may be getting a release date pretty soon.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/with-release-news-expected-soon-metroid-prime-4-has-been-rated/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, a listing for Metroid Prime 4 has gone up on South Korea's <a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?914b326d87c6070f0760b092a83d753ca6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">classification board</a> where it is currently rated for "ages 12 and up" due to mild violence. The content of the listing itself doesn't reveal much else about the content of the game, but the filing does suggest that Metroid Prime 4 is indeed closing in on the finish line and could still stand to release later this year, where it's being pegged as a holiday release at the moment.</p><p>Additionally, VGC reports that the listing comes around the same time that it's been hearing of an imminent Nintendo Direct, where it is believed that a formal release date will finally be provided.</p><p>It's been a long road for Metroid Prime 4. Initially announced at E3 in 2017, the game has changed developers and undergone at least one reboot before being re-announced with the subtitle Beyond back in 2024. Since then, there's been a steady drip of information, including the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-facing-18-years-of-expectations/1100-6530584/" data-ref-id="1100-6530584">first hands-on previews</a> earlier this year, as well as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-out-now-poster-spotted-in-london/1100-6532578/" data-ref-id="1100-6532578">bizarre advertisement</a> in the London Underground that falsely claimed the game was "out now."</p><p>Now, Metroid Prime 4 seems likely to launch by the end of 2025 on both the Nintendo Switch, which it was first announced for, and its successor, the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Metroid Prime 4 has been a <em>long</em> time coming, so many fans are scrambling for any sliver of information they can get. As always, a rating doesn't mean anything, so try to keep your expectations in-check.</p>
<p>But, as we mentioned above, the timing also lines up with those Nintendo Direct rumours, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">NateTheHate reiterating that one is still coming this month</a>. Since then, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/with-release-news-expected-soon-metroid-prime-4-has-been-rated/">VGC</a> has also said that reports of a Direct "match up" with what the outlet has also heard.</p>
<p>With next week being the final week of July, will we see a Direct? And, will Metroid Prime 4: Beyond get a release date? Time will tell. That <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-switch-2-ad-claims-metroid-prime-4-is-out-now">London Underground poster blunder</a> got us all a bit <em>too</em> excited...</p>

                <p>Just a day after release, publisher 505 Games has released a new update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers/" data-ref-id="5000-538251">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> that addresses several performance issues, fixes some bugs, and grants missing preorder bonuses. Alongside the fixes, all players will receive the game's original soundtrack DLC as a form of apology.</p><p>The patch notes detail the addition of a manual toggle for low latency mode, which is now no longer enabled by default, as well as VRAM optimization for lower-end GPUs. 505 Games says it has also fixed an issue where the game may crash immediately after the company logo during startup. It has also resolved a stuttering issue during finisher animations.</p>

<p>Other updates on the way include New Game Plus mode, which will be available starting July 29. Selecting this mode will reset your story and objective board progression, but you'll get to keep all of the skills, gear, and knowledge ranks you've earned, as well as your Hideout progression. You won't have to sit through tutorials on your playthrough, as you can fast-forward to the end of the prologue chapters.</p><p>The level cap is being increased from 60 to 80 for all players, and new Mastery ranks, Knowledge Skill ranks, and upgrades for all Hideout buildings--including new upgrades for Heiji's Forge--are on the way. Several big quality-of-life upgrades will arrive in a September update, before the Claws of Awaji expansion goes live. Here's a closer look at what's on the horizon:</p><ul><li>Once you synchronise all viewpoints in a region, the fog will completely lift</li><li>The ability to skip time-of-day, jumping ahead to dusk or dawn</li><li>A new Forge upgrade level to reach Mythic--from Epic--and Artifact--from Legendary--equipment rarities</li><li>Hideout updates and upgrades.</li><li>Uncapped framerate for cutscenes on PC</li><li>Additional "goodies" that might be familiar to long-time series fans</li><li>Further bug fixes and stability improvements</li></ul><p>In related news, Ubisoft recently announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-hits-5-million-players-2-billion-stealth-kills/1100-6533351/" data-ref-id="1100-6533351">Assassin's Creed Shadows has crossed the 5 million players mark</a>, and the company teased that it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints" rel="nofollow ">could arrive on new platforms in the future</a>.

            <p>He plays Mister Fantastic in The Fantastic Four: First Steps, but can Pedro Pascal actually <em>play </em>Mister Fantastic? Well, when it comes to Marvel Rivals, no not really.</p>
<p>The cast of Fantastic Four: First Steps recently got to take their Marvel Rival's counterparts out for a spin. Joining Pascal was Vanessa Kirby (Sue Storm/Invisible Woman), Ebon Moss-Bachrach (Ben Grimm/The Thing) and Joseph Quinn (Human Torch), who all played NetEase's shooter with YouTuber LoserFruit.</p>
<p>It is fair to say though, that none of the actors were especially skilled when it came to negotiating the controls, with Pascal looking very much out of his depth (at one point he asks if there are "console classes" people could take part in).</p>

<p>But, one moment from this entire Marvel Rival's experience that has particularly captured attention, though, is the cast's reaction to Invisible Woman's Malice skin, which leaves very little to the imagination. "Thank you," Kirby immediately reacts with a snap of the fingers. "This is my favourite bit of her as well." She then makes allusions to a yet-to-be-greenlit sequel.</p>
<p>Her three companions, though, well they all looked rather surprised by the scantily clad image presented to them on the screen, which sees Sue dressed in what looks like quite a skimpy bikini bottom complete with a spikely-adorned top half. 

Pascal soon regained some composure, and simply said: "Costume designer, take note."

</p><p>This clip was shared by the Marvel Rivals social media account, and the cast's reaction has since gone somewhat viral. So, what do you think about Pascal and co's gaming endeavours?</p> <div>

<p>Back in February, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">Marvel Rivals had amassed over 40 million players since its launch</a>. Despite this success, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">laid off an unspecified number of the Marvel Rivals development team</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Following this, the Marvel Rivals publisher said the layoffs were a "difficult decision" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-publisher-netease-responds-to-shocking-layoffs-claims-they-were-to-optimise-development-efficiency">made to "optimise development efficiency" for the game</a>.</p>

		<p>Another week is in the books, and we’re just a month away from Gamescom, so I’ve spent a good bit of time cleaving through emails and trying to put a sensible schedule together for previews and hands ons. Still some more to do on that front, but my calendar is pretty packed…</p>
<p>But enough about that, because with the cooler, wetter, windier weather, it’s been a good time for a game like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/21/le-mans-ultimate-v1-0-can-fill-my-endurance-racing-void-this-summer/">Le Mans Ultimate</a> to come out, luring me to put on my fancy hat to check out a game dedicated to one of my favourite sports. It’s pretty darned good!</p>
<p>With a poorly baby in the house, <strong>Nic</strong> hasn’t played much this week, but did give the new Pokémon puzzle game a quick try –&nbsp;“It’s not worth downloading…” So let’s move swiftly on to <strong>Jason</strong>, who’s been playing an awful lot of the “basically perfect” Monster Train 2, but has also jumped back into Final Fantasy XV after losing his enjoyment for Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

<p>It’s been a busy old week for <strong>Steve</strong>, as usual, and he’s been playing an unholy mix of Hellclock, Once Upon a Puppet, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/25/s-p-l-i-t-review-hacking-horror/">s.p.l.i.t</a>, while also having another two indie horror games on his forthcoming review list. We can also add in the Chibi-Robo spiritual successor Misc. A Tiny Tale, the classic CRPG A Necromancer’s Tale and a certain 2D Ninja platformer. It’s lucky it’s not term time right now!</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc’s</strong> week has been filled with Neverwinter Nights 2 Remaster and Peglin for review, but he’s also been playing Death Stranding, Civ VI, Smash Bros Ultimate, Animal Crossing New Horizons, Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope, and Breath of the Wild.</p>

<p>Having been able to sneak a preview of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/24/ea-sports-fc-26-preview-hands-on-the-new-authentic-and-competitive-gameplay-modes/">EA Sports FC 26</a>, <strong>Aran</strong> has also had Birdigo and Atomic Owl on the go for review. It’s a rather different sci-fi zombie and horror future for <strong>Tuffcub</strong>, though, who’s been reviewing Killing Floor 3, and sinking back into The Callisto Protocol: “I think I’m on the last boss battle I’ve kinda enjoyed the whole thing. However I never ever, ever, ever, ever want to see a character stand on a platform only to have it give way under the so they are separated from their partner, ever again. The game does it about ten times!”</p>
<p>While he’d been looking forward to playing it, <strong>Ade</strong> was thoroughly underwhelmed by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/23/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review/">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> –&nbsp;“Maybe I’m just all soulsliked out?” –&nbsp;so it’s good that he’s been able to move swiftly along to Achilles Survivor for review, which offers an Ancient Greece twist to the Vampire Survivors formula.</p>
<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> been continuing his car combat quest with Twisted Metal World Tour, where he grabbed the platinum trophy. “It’s a shame the genre has been left behind – Sony’s Destruction All-Stars was a fun time even if it had some glaring flaws.” He’s also been playing Wildgate, which has a rough onboarding, but which he’s enjoying for its spaceship extraction shooter shenanigans.</p>

<p>And we come to <strong>Dom</strong> to wrap things up, and he’s been playing a mix of Donkey Kong Bananza, Wild Hearts S and the recklessly titled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/23/super-mario-party-jamboree-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review/">Super Mario Party Jamboree – Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a>. There’s also been some CarX Street, and some real life chess, which I assume means he dressed up as a bishop, went to a field, and moved diagonally when someone told him to.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played?</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Trails Beyond the Horizon</em>, the latest game in the long-running JRPG series' Calvard arc, has finally received a Western release date, and it won't be too long before you can check this one out.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Trails Beyond the Horizon&nbsp;</em>(or, to give it its full title,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon</em>) will be arriving across PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch consoles on January 15th.</p>

<p>The game will follow on from the previous titles in the Calvard arc, namely&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-release-date" rel="nofollow">Trails through Daybreak</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-through-daybreak-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">its sequel</a>. You'll play as three protagonists with intertwining stories:&nbsp;<em>Trails of Cold Steel</em>'s Rean Schwarzer,&nbsp;<em>Daybreak</em>'s Van Arkride, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-heroes-trails-in-sky-3rd" rel="nofollow"><em>Trails in the Sky the 3rd</em></a>'s Kevin Graham.</p>

Rean, Kevin, and Van are drawn into intrigue when Marduk invites them to "co-operate in a high-tech training exercise", setting them on a "collision course with the secrets that lay at the very core of Zemuria".</p>

<p>The game will feature an adapted and enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak</em>'s battle system, allowing you to swap between the action-based Field Battle mode and the more strategic Command Battle system.</p>

<p>New features include the ability to slow time with the Z.O.C. system, boosting your damage and allowing for devastating chain attacks, as well as new Shard Commands to grant your party "a range of benefits during battle".</p>

<p>You can check out the release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Trails Beyond the Horizon&nbsp;</em>right here. It gives a sense of what you can expect from the game's climactic narrative.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Techland has announced that upcoming zombie sandbox parkour-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>has been delayed by a few weeks in order to ensure additional polish.</p>

<p>While the game was originally intended to launch on August 22nd, Techland now says it needs extra time "to make&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>the best&nbsp;<em>Dying Light&nbsp;</em>game [it's] ever released", which is why the latest title in the series will now be launching on September 19th.</p>

<p>Techland says it understands the delay "may be disappointing", but that its "experience has shown how important the first impression is", and that four extra weeks of development will help the studio "address final details that make all the difference between good and great".</p>

<p>Additionally, Techland will be releasing more information about&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>regularly until September, so if you're disappointed you won't be able to play the game in August, the new reveals should tide you over.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>, it's a standalone followup to 2022's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human" rel="nofollow"><em>Dying Light 2: Stay Human</em></a>&nbsp;in which you'll once again take on the mantle of Kyle Crane, the protagonist of the original&nbsp;<em>Dying Light</em>.</p>

<p>The game was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/turns-out-dying-light-the-beast-started-out-as-leaked-dying-light-2-dlc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">originally intended</a> to be a DLC expansion for&nbsp;<em>Dying Light 2</em>, but after plot details for that DLC were leaked by hackers in 2023, Techland decided to turn&nbsp;<em>The Beast&nbsp;</em>into a full standalone followup instead.</p>
