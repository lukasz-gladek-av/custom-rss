The game is called <em>DC Forever</em>, a brand new deckbuilding game by Wizkids; not to be confused with the <em>DC Deckbuilding Game: Forever Evil</em> by Cryptozoic Entertainment. This deckbuilder stands out thanks to a unique asymmetrical twist.</p>

<p>According to its <a href="https://shop.wizkids.com/products/dc-forever">store page</a>, <em>DC Forever</em> is a competitive fast-paced deckbuilding game. One player takes command of different DC comic superheroes (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, etc.) while the other plays as the rogues (Lex Luthor, The Joker, Cheetah, etc.).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dc-forever-joker-card-artwork.jpg?itok=3Ebq7oJ3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dc-forever-joker-card-artwork.jpg?itok=JwwZhVMK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>What makes <em>DC Forever</em> different from other deckbuilders like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ascension-legends-brings-back-beloved-deckbuilding-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Ascension</em></a> are its asymmetrical elements. When the game starts, both players choose a handful of characters. Each character in the game has a deck of cards which you can buy from when building your deck. These characters also provide powerful cards to your deck from the beginning.</p>
<p>This is different from most deckbuilding games where both players select cards from a single completely random shop. The game has eighteen different characters, which can lead to many potential strategies and synergies. Adding to the variety are twelve different location cards, which move the action from Gotham to Metropolis to Atlantis.</p>
<p>Lastly, winning a game of <em>DC Forever</em> does not depend on resources. There are multiple ways to win the game, either fighting your enemies directly or spending time working on your master plan in the margins. The choice is yours.</p>
<p>Each copy of <em>DC Forever</em> will contain the following:</p>
<ul><li>80+ Hero Cards</li>
<li>80+ Rogue Cards</li>
<li>12 Location Cards</li>
<li>8 Unaligned Character Cards</li>
<li>25+ Citizen Tokens</li>
<li>35+ Damage Tokens</li>
<li>6 Activation Tokens</li>
<li>18 Character Standees</li>
</ul><p>The game is being sold at an MSRP $49.99. According to the store listing, copies will be shipped to customers in Q1 of 2025.</p>

It’s a grand fantasy story and an excellent tactical RPG that feels unmatched, even within the franchise to which it belongs. Beyond good gameplay and a fascinating world, what makes<em> Three Houses</em> a modern masterpiece is its cast of characters, each of whom is so phenomenally fleshed out that every single one is likely to be somebody’s favorite. But in recognition of the game’s fifth anniversary, it’s time I declared that one character stands above all the rest: Edelgard von Hresvelg, <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses’</em> greatest triumph.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Buy <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses: </em></strong><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Emblem-Three-Houses-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07DK13HKX/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-five-years-edelgard-switch-1851606712&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B07DK13HKX" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmKDjOaplgN&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmKDjOaplgN" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffire-emblem-three-houses%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffire-emblem-three-houses%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><p>As former <em>Kotaku </em>writer Gita Jackson put it in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-the-kotaku-review-1836675912&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-the-kotaku-review-1836675912">their review</a></span> five years ago, “<em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em> is a game for interesting times.” Those interesting times call for interesting people to inhabit them, all of whom are shaped by the realities in which they live—specifically the impending war over their heads. The “three houses” of the title refer to groups within the game’s central setting of the Garreg Mach Monastery’s Officer’s Academy, one of which you choose to lead at the start of the game. There are the Blue Lions and the Golden Deer, but I am most concerned with the Black Eagles and its seemingly cold-hearted leader, Edelgard.</p><p>Each house leader is the presumptive heir to a given political body within the world of <em>Three Houses</em>. They play as schoolmates and tentative friends, but all exist under the looming shadow that they will likely be enemies when (not if) that impending war does finally begin. Edelgard is the only one of the three who seems to have put any thought into this reality in the game’s first section, which is set during their time at school while a mysterious antagonist known as the Flame Emperor terrorizes the monastery. This can make her an off-putting figure, someone who comes off as calculating and uncaring. As the only female leader, one who, if taken at face-value, could be seen simply as a shallow, bossy woman, it is perhaps unsurprising that the white-haired ruler to be rubbed some people the wrong way. Cut to the game’s big reveal that Edelgard is, in fact, the Flame Emperor, here to overthrow the way of life you and the rest of the game’s cast have been training to preserve. She’s a dangerous, despotic revolutionary that you spend the game’s second section working to defeat. At least, that’s how it goes in all but one timeline.</p><figure id="" data-id="dc970cfbb2b61dbadc346d2c7c97744a" data-recommend-id="image://dc970cfbb2b61dbadc346d2c7c97744a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Edelgard saying &quot;Me?

Doing so begins the Crimson Flower route. Given the cold and shallow demeanor Edelgard presents at the game’s start, it isn’t necessarily something people will stumble on themselves. Even for those who do choose her house, it requires continued persistence to reach the point where she trusts you enough to reveal her secrets. In other routes, the only identity she earns is that of a horrible antagonist that must be stopped at all cost. In Crimson Flower and the Black Eagles route through the game’s first section, she gets to be human.<br></p><p>Referring to the reveal of Edelgard’s identity as the Flame Emperor as a twist feels inaccurate. If you join the Black Eagles and spend time with her it feels almost obvious, as it’s the natural step to take given how Edelgard sees the world of <em>Three Houses</em>. In the first half of the game, you’re presented with story beat after story beat that openly show the medieval fantasy world to be a place bereft with horrible class inequality and ingrained ways of life held up by the church, the very institution you serve. Much of this inequality comes down to Crests, special marks that, over time, have been used to decide nobility. These Crests are hereditary and lead to women born with Crests often being seen as vessels to give birth to men who can pass on the special powers, an issue seen explicitly with Ingrid’s story. These issues, and more personal traumas like the massacre of her entire family, have turned Edelgard into the cold woman we meet at the beginning of the game. But if you accompany her throughout the first half, we see these horrific realities of the world up close. If you pay attention to the world, then Edelgard’s mission isn’t much of a twist. The reasons behind what Xeecee accurately named her “call to arms” in a 2019 article for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/gyzq9y/fire-emblem-revolution-flame-emperor&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/gyzq9y/fire-emblem-revolution-flame-emperor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Vice</em></a></span><em> </em>are all laid bare for you to see.</p><p>As shown in her school time, Edelgard is the only future leader in the world of <em>Three Houses</em> who is concerned with changing the systems in place in order to benefit the people. The other leaders, Dimitri and Claude, are concerned with retaining their—and their kingdoms’— place in the status quo. They may talk about caring about their people, but it’s in an us vs them mindset that fears losing a place in the upper echelons of a world governed by the church. Through Edelgard, <em>Three Houses</em> gives you the rare chance to do something truly revolutionary as a protagonist. It invites you to actually leave the world of the game a better place than when you found it.</p><figure id="" data-id="0948da3e4d4d8fa22a860d9c95e64906" data-recommend-id="image://0948da3e4d4d8fa22a860d9c95e64906" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Edelgard saying &quot;For their sake, I will build a world where such meaningless sacrifice is never again sanctioned.

As emperor, I will change the world. I swear it.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This isn’t a simple thing for Edelgard, either. In many ways she has given up her identity and life in order to pursue change for everyone. Part of the beauty of the Crimson Flower path and leading the Black Eagles during their time at the Officer’s Academy is getting to breathe some humanity back into her after the horrific life she has lived. Again, the downside is that you only see this side of her if you choose to lead the Black Eagles and then follow Edelgard in her revolution. It locks so much of the best writing and character work in the entire game behind so many choices, but in some ways it’s better for it, as it requires you to truly seek it out through your love of Edelgard.<br></p><p>Edelgard remains a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/204445-fire-emblem-three-houses/78883417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/204445-fire-emblem-three-houses/78883417" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">widely hated</a></span> character in <em>Three Houses</em>. She is easily painted as an irredeemable villain who causes mass murder, all for the sake of her own goals. Of course, she isn’t perfect, but the game goes to great lengths to show the cost of revolution is high but necessary. Edelgard is sacrificing her own humanity, and it eats away at her. The revolution is not something she takes lightly, and she even confides in you that she worries the cost will be too high in the end. But holding the systems of oppression in the world of <em>Three Houses</em> accountable is something that must be done, and it will mean change for the better. It shouldn’t be overlooked that it is so easy for a particular subset of players to utterly demonize the female lead (if we consider the house heads as leads, which I think is fair to do). At the end of the day, every character in every route is responsible for a long list of deaths and war crimes, but only one of the house leaders has a distinct moral drive behind every action they take.</p><p>For queer players, her route takes on even more meaning if you choose to be the female protagonist of the game. Edelgard is romanceable regardless of gender and in a story of revolution, in which she is fighting to break down oppressive institutions, reading her as queer just clicks. Building a relationship with Edelgard is the central pillar of understanding the moral imperative to fight alongside her. It also, as I previously mentioned, helps to breathe humanity into her in a world that has worked so hard to tear it out. It sounds cliche, but by giving her love and romancing her, you can make the story of revolution all the more poignant. She is not just fighting for a better world for those around her, but so she can be the truest version of herself without judgment.</p><figure id="" data-id="52b01555275c00be88f0d533431854f9" data-recommend-id="image://52b01555275c00be88f0d533431854f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="718" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Edelgard crying while she hugs female Byleth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Edelgard crying while she hugs female Byleth" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="52b01555275c00be88f0d533431854f9" data-recommend-id="image://52b01555275c00be88f0d533431854f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="718" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Edelgard crying while she hugs female Byleth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To Edelgard’s detriment, Crimson Flower is the shortest route in <em>Three Houses</em>. Yet it packs so much remarkable storytelling into a smaller package than its counterparts. It robs her of a true catharsis, relegating the fruits of her labors to epilogue text. Furthermore, each route that follows a different house leader ends with corruption being rooted out from the world of <em>Three Houses</em>, so in the end, many may wonder why Edelgard’s methods were even necessary or justified. But again, even if the world changes regardless of who you choose, Edelgard is the only ruler who sets out with that change in mind as her singular goal. Her devotion to that mission is also what enlightened the other leaders around her, persuading them to eventually work for some level of change, even in the routes in which she is killed for her crimes.<br></p><p><em>Three Houses</em> is a game you’re encouraged to play through many times in order to see all the different routes and permutations, but at the end of the day, if someone asked me what single route they should play, I would answer Crimson Flower. Edelgard is not right about everything, she is not perfect. She is, however, the most compelling and well-written character in <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em>. She will never deserve the hate she gets. That was true in 2019 and it is true now, five years later. Edelgard Von Hresvelg, you will always be famous.</p><p><strong>Buy <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses: </em></strong><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Emblem-Three-Houses-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07DK13HKX/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-five-years-edelgard-switch-1851606712&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B07DK13HKX" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmKDjOaplgN&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmKDjOaplgN" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffire-emblem-three-houses%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffire-emblem-three-houses%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Indie developer The Behemoth outlined its plans for the future in a recent livestream, and it includes major updates to games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/castle-crashers/" data-ref-id="5000-27643">Castle Crashers</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battleblock-theater/" data-ref-id="5000-42607">BattleBlock Theater</a>, as well as work on a new game that will soon be in the prototype phase.</p><p dir="ltr">Castle Crashers, the side-scrolling beat-em'-up originally released in 2008, will receive a major update on Steam called Painter Boss Paradise, which is the first new content added to the game since the introduction of new playable characters back in 2012. The update will add Steam Workshop support, allowing for players to create their own characters and share them with others. The Behemoth states in its roadmap trailer that creating characters will be as simple as swapping out a single image and then letting the game handle all the hard stuff like animations.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Behemoth Upcoming Updates And Games Roadmap Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For those who don't want to craft a character of their own, there will also be an official new playable character, Paint Junior, who uses their imagination to create art and defeat enemies. Painter Boss Paradise will additionally introduce redrawn models for all of the game's playable characters and weapons, but don't worry: The new models can be toggled on or off in the options menu.</p><p dir="ltr">For the studio's platformer BattleBlock Theater, an update for the Steam version will allow for higher frame rates, support for more controller types, better rendering, and higher audio bitrates for improved sound. The game will be coming to modern consoles as well, something also in the works for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alien-hominid/" data-ref-id="5000-21360">Alien Hominid HD</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alien-hominid-invasion/" data-ref-id="5000-507833">Alien Hominid Invasion</a>, which are currently available on Xbox and PC but will soon be coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 too.</p><p dir="ltr">Not to be left out, The Behemoth's quirky strategy title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pit-people/" data-ref-id="5000-310603">Pit People</a>, will also be receiving some quality-of-life improvements, though specific details were not shared.</p><p dir="ltr">No release dates were given for any of these updates, and no additional information was shared in regards to when The Behemoth's next new game would arrive. In a press release, the developer states that all of the aforementioned updates "will be rolling out while the team looks ahead to prototyping and developing new titles."</p><p dir="ltr">The roadmap served as a way to "address several popular far requests from the past 21 years while establishing a new level of transparency with players," according to the press release. The studio's most-recent projects were Alien Hominid HD and Alien Hominid Invasion, both released in 2023.</p>

            <p>Demos were once a cornerstone of PC gaming and they arguably will be again thanks to events like Steam Next Fest. The latest update to Steam seeks to make those free slices of potential delight easier to find for players, and easier to promote for developers.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Great Steam Demo Update, as <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4155211502162971563">the announcement calls it</a>, makes several changes. Demos will now behave differently in your library: you can add them without immediately installing them; they can now be installed even if you already own the full game; and they can be manually removed from your library, or will be automatically removed when uninstalled.
</p>
<p>Demos can also now have their own separate store page, if a developer so chooses. This allows a developer to explain the demo's contents in more detail, add unique screenshots and trailers, and even allows players to write user reviews of the demo.
</p>
<p>All demos will also now appear in more places around the Steam store, acting more like standalone free games.
</p>
<p>When I started my career twenty years ago, it was my job to make coverdiscs (both CDs and a DVD) filled with demos to be stuck to the front of a PC gaming magazine, and to write about the contents of the demos inside the magazine's pages. I got to watch up-close as those demos grew in filesize, becoming hard to fit even on a DVD, and as their creation grew less and less common. It was a terrible shame.
</p>
<p>I imagine there's still debate over whether or not demos help developers sell their game - and I imagine the answer varies wildly depending on the game, the demo, and whether either are any good. As a player, I have little invested in that debate. For me, demos are an unequivocal good: free, hypothetically fun, and great way to avoid spending money on games I wouldn't like. It's great that they've had such a huge revival and now we get to write about them in events like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/wishlisted-2024">Wishlisted</a>.</p>

As the strike commences, many games currently in development will be affected due to the labor strikes. However, one notable game that will not be affected is Rockstar Games' upcoming open-world game, which is undoubtedly one of next year's most highly anticipated titles: Grand Theft Auto 6. </p><p>First <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta6-voice-actor-strike-saf-aftra-1851606082?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=kotaku" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by Kotaku</a> and independently verified by IGN, Grand Theft Auto 6 is exempt from the video game voice actor strike. Take-Two declined IGN's request for comment. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/26/strike-1721952790030.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>SAG-AFTRA'S video game voice actor strike went into effect at midnight on July 26. | Image Credit: SAG-AFTRA</figcaption></figure></output><p>Additionally, this claim of GTA 6's exemption from the video game voice actors strike can be verified by heading to the SAG-AFTRA database, which includes a search tool allowing SAG-AFTRA members to search for the struck status of video game projects. Below, you can read the message on SAG-AFTRA's website regarding GTA VI's exemption. </p><blockquote>"While not struck, this game is produced by a struck company. If you have been engaged under a daily contract for this game, you can show solidarity with your fellow union members by choosing not to sign new contracts on the game. However, you may work the game and will not be disciplined for doing so." </blockquote><p>GTA 6 is exempt from the video game voice actors strike because games already in production before August 25, 2023, including live service games, are covered by the previous contractual agreement between SAG-AFTRA and gaming companies. However, actors may still choose not to work on the game in solidarity with fellow members and cannot be penalized by employers.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1 Stills</h3></div></output><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-rockstar-officially-unveils-first-trailer-early-after-leak">officially revealed in December 2023</a>. Its first trailer became a mega-hit for Rockstar Games, becoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-has-already-surpassed-grand-theft-auto-5s-reveal-with-more-than-100-million-views">YouTube's most-viewed video game reveal within 24 hours</a>. Set in the modern-day fictionalized version of Florida, players control Lucia and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-protagonist-isnt-played-by-the-last-of-us-star-troy-baker">an unnamed male</a>, who fans theorize is named Jason. </p><p>Upon its initial reveal, Rockstar confirmed that GTA 6 would be released in 2025. However, Take-Two Interactive would narrow that release window in May 2024, when CEO Strauss Zelnick told IGN in an interview that the company was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-take-two-interactive">"highly confident"</a> that GTA would not be delayed, while also revealing the game would be released in Fall 2025 for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. </p><p>While GTA 6 remains technically unaffected by the strikes, that does not mean the gaming industry will feel the effects of this ongoing labor strike.

                <p>Riot's 5v5 hero shooter<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/"> Valorant</a> has now entered open beta on consoles. Anyone playing on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S can join the fun.</p><p dir="ltr">Before the announcement, the only way to play Valorant on console was through a closed beta that players needed to sign up for. In a series of posts made on the<a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1816867027060920540" rel="nofollow "> official Valorant X/Twitter account</a>, the studio explained that console players won't be able to play PC players. However, those on Xbox and PlayStation can join each other's games.</p><p dir="ltr">There'll also be shared cross-progression for PC and console, which will give players full access to everything they've purchased. All progress made towards the battle pass will count towards both platforms. Those who are subscribed to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will automatically unlock all agents. The open beta is currently only available in the United States, Canada, Europe, Brazil, and Japan.</p><p dir="ltr">Bringing Valorant to console did require a lot of work. As an<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/26/valorant-console-open-beta-xbox-series-x-s/" rel="nofollow "> Xbox Wire post</a> explained, the standard way to shoot on PC was hip firing. This didn't translate well when it came to console, so to combat this, Riot created Focus, a new type of shooting mode that acts like hip fire but with reduced sensitivity.</p><p>If you're jumping into Valorant for the first time, check out<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/12-valorant-tips-to-help-you-master-the-competitive-shooter/2900-5546/#1"> our guide, which details everything you need to know about getting the upper hand</a>.</p>

        <p>With hints at what's next for the MS-owned studio</p>

            <p>Double Fine's PsychOdyssey is a 32-part documentary series which charts the creation of 2021 platformer Psychonauts 2, from initial brainstorming sessions to its final release. Or it was - now it's 33 parts, as a new 94-minute episode was just released which looks back at the game, its reception, and the release of the documentary itself.

<p>If you have any interest in video game development at all, you owe it to yourself to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/double-fines-new-documentary-about-making-psychonauts-2-is-a-must-watch">watch the documentary from the beginning</a>. Even if you don't care about development or video games, I think it would be compelling to watch a team of sincere, talented people collaborate to make something complicated and joyful. Its to Double Fine's great credit that the documentary frankly depicts several of the things that went wrong on the project, too, from staff disagreements, departures, crunch, and much more.
</p>
<p>This latest episode looks back on those challenges with the benefit of hindsight, first through a series of post-mortem meetings held at Double Fine after Psychonauts 2's release, and then through the lens of the documentary's release. That includes discussion of some of the doc's most dramatic moments, such as the fallout (and fallings out) that followed the hiring and eventual departure of Psychonauts 2's original project lead.
</p>
<p>Double Fine haven't announced a new game in the three years since Psychonauts 2 was released, and there's some discussion of what might be next from the now Microsoft-owned studio. In broad strokes: a return to smaller games, and a doubling-down on being weird, with the ambition of making the weirdest games on Game Pass. </p>

Those against SBMM argue that since there are ranked playlists, those who want to be matched with players of equal skill can simply play there, leaving the rest of the game's modes open to a more luck-of-the-draw-type of matchmaking experience.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - Official Season 5 Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">From the blog post, it doesn't seem like Call of Duty will ditch SBMM any time soon, largely because the developers have revealed they have solid data on the effects doing so would have on the game. In a test conducted with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 where one group of players played with the current SBMM rules and another group that played under "loosened skill consideration," the developers found that the group playing with a wider skill gap were "more likely to quit matches in progress and did not return to the game at a higher rate than players with unchanged matchmaking."</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also ran another test where skill requirements in matchmaking were actually increased. It had the opposite effect, with players more likely to finish a match, particularly when it came to low-skill players. However, the developer notes that high-skill players were impacted in some negative ways by the stricter skill requirements, and as a result, the changes were not rolled out to the live game.</p><p dir="ltr">"The system strives for team balance, where players are not consistently on the wrong side of blowout matches," the developer states. "Players who frequently experience blowouts are seen to quit matches in progress and the game itself, which negatively impacts the experience for players of all skill levels."</p><p dir="ltr">Should low-skill players leave the game in droves due to being frustrated by blowout matches, it creates an environment where lobbies are largely made up of high-skill players, something the developer states is the case when players go back and play many older Call of Duty titles today.</p><p dir="ltr">"We will always strive to improve our approach to matchmaking to ensure that players of all skill levels are having the best possible experience," the developer states." A healthy player population is good for everyone in the community."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-warzone-and-mw3-season-5-patch-notes/2900-5631/" data-ref-id="2900-5631">Modern Warfare 3 Season 5 just launched, adding new maps, modes, and weapons</a> to the popular FPS, just in time for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-this-month-report/1100-6524827/" data-ref-id="1100-6524827">arrival on Xbox Game Pass</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> releases on October 25 and will be available on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-works-on-game-pass/1100-6524136/" data-ref-id="1100-6524136">launch day for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers</a>.</p>

			<p>Look North World is a pioneering <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-premium-mods-on-consoles-qa-by-2030-time-spent-on-ugc-will-be-way-bigger/">UGC (User Generated Content)</a> game studio and published led by Alexander Seropian, the founder of Bungie and a former executive at Disney have announced that they have managed to raise a total of $4.5M for seed funding. The second round of fundraising for seed funding had contributions from London Venture Partners, Bandai Namco Entertainment, Hasbro, and many more.</p>
<p>Along with the seed funding, Look North World has announced the launch of its Creator Label, a curated program dedicated to supporting and boosting individual creators who build on creative platforms. In total, 15 games are being created with major IP deals, allowing Look North World to invest in accelerating the creation of original games using UGC.</p>
<p>Using the Creator Label, Look North World aims to provide end-to-end support for creators in the UGC gaming sphere. Creators signed to the label will receive guaranteed benefits, such as an advance, long-term ownership of intellectual property, a marketing budget to distribute their contributions, and a team of industry professionals who can help with artistic and technical support.</p>
<p>So far, the first signed content creators to the label are Austin 'TomJank' Rodriguez and Jon 'SightedSloth' Jungemann. TomJank is known for creating Dream Job Tycoon, and SleightedSloth has worked on various tycoon games across the Epic Games Store creation applications.</p>
<p>"Investing in Look North World cements our belief in user-generated content being a core pillar of the future of gaming. As UGC platforms expand and gain market share, talented teams are leveraging them to push boundaries and create diverse, immersive experiences at an unprecedented pace. We invest in people, and Alex and his veteran team are pioneers, notably during previous growth waves of console and mobile. With Look North World they continue to reshape how games are built and published," says Matt Bilbey, Venture Partner at London Venture Partners.</p>
<p>Look North World has a<a href="https://looknorth.world/games" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> selection of games</a> available at the moment, such as Dream Job Tycoon on Fortnite, the Ark Survival Ascended x Power Rangers Cosmetic Pack, Carrera Coast, Outlaw Corral, and Don't Push the Button, which are all available in Fortnite.</p>
<p>"Look North World is a great partner for the Bandai Namco Entertainment 021 Fund, as a company with a foundation of game making know-how and founders who have created blockbusters in traditional games now looking to apply their pedigree and vision to what the new generation of gamers want to play," said Yoyo Yang, Principal of the Bandai Namco Entertainment 021 Fund.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-tarkov-event-wipe-coming/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It’s a matter of weeks until Escape from Tarkov ‘wipes’, with Battlestate Games pushing out that regular platform-wide reset that takes everyone back to level pegging. It’s typically one of the most exciting times to be an Escape from Tarkov player, as it usually goes hand-in-hand with sizeable in-game updates such as new maps, weapons, bosses, and quests.</p>



<p>Today, a new event started in Escape from Tarkov – the type of special event that usually takes place <strong>very close </strong>to a wipe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-is-tarkov-going-to-wipe">When is Tarkov Going to Wipe?</h2>



<p>We don’t know when Escape from Tarkov will wipe next – all we know is that it’s happening at some point in August.</p>



<p>Today, Battlestate Games deployed a new in-game event to take players one step closer to the next wipe. At the core of this event sits free entry to Labs, arguably the toughest Escape from Tarkov map and a haven for skilled PvPers. Once you’ve gained entry to Labs, you’ll need to complete a strange task handed out by Jaeger. He wants you to kill 23 PMCs and 57 Raiders – there’s a hefty prize for doing so, but it’s a pretty massive ask for the less talented players.</p>



<p>This event runs until July 29, and it’s following on from a recent limited-time quest that saw two traders – Prapor and Peacekeeper – pitted against one another. Traditionally, this won’t be the last special event before a wipe arrives. The best indicator of that is a sudden change to the in-game stores and traders, with the prices for everything going down to a single rouble or so and all the trader ‘rep levels’ being boosted to the maximum tier.</p>



<p>That means that you’ll be able to build the best weapons, secure top armour, and go into battles fully loaded – but then typically the game will wipe just days later. </p>



<p>Be prepared – Escape from Tarkov is wiping soon.</p>

But there are some key differences between the PC version and this console port.</p><p>On PC, hip-fire is Valorant's primary shooting mode, and aim-down-sights (ADS) is a secondary, supporting mode. For the console port, Riot created Focus, a new shooting mode that functions much like hip-fire but with reduced sensitivity.</p><p>In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/26/valorant-console-open-beta-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>, Microsoft said Valorant on console lets players shoot from the hip whenever they need speed in moving both their camera and aim (think: peeking around corners and dodging) but with the ability to utilize Focus mode whenever they need to pull off a precise, calibrated headshot.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/26/ae8fccdc-a995-46d7-8d56-41ad4c97c364-160644d4448761a79945-1722010559172.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Valorant on Xbox Series X. Image credit: Microsoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"Some of the Agent abilities have been adapted for the new input controls, and various tunings across the board have all contributed to the team’s number one priority: capturing the dynamic pacing and mechanically expressive feel of the original," Microsoft continued.</p><p>Because of this difference, Valorant does not feature crossplay between PC and console (crossplay <em>is</em> available between PS5 and Xbox Series X and S). "This is primarily due to a focus on maintaining the title’s competitive integrity, given the control changes required to bring the game to console," Microsoft explained.</p><p>There is, however, shared cross-progression across PC and console, which means your inventory carries over. So, if you unlock skins on PC or console, they’ll work across the two. Similarly, battle pass progression carries across both versions.</p><p>The open beta comes ahead of the full console launch, which on Xbox includes bonuses for Game Pass subscribers. In the open beta and the full launch, Game Pass members unlock every Agent released so far, as well as any new additions on day one.
</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In addition to console ports, Riot announced in 2021 that it is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valorant-mobile">working on a mobile version of Valorant</a>. Riot promised that the mobile version would provide "the same competitive Valorant experience" currently available on PC. However, news on this version has been scarce since its initial announcement.</p><p>Last October, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-12/how-influencers-helped-riot-games-turn-valorant-into-a-gen-z-hit?srnd=premium&amp;leadSource=reddit_wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg reported</a> that Valorant had 28 million monthly players, with 70% of the player-base belonging to Gen Z.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valorant-review">our review of Valorant</a>, IGN wrote: "Valorant is a clever tactical hero shooter that's plenty deep and a lot of fun to master."</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

She had died over a thousand times (accounting for both screens), and 35% of her deaths were due to Radahn's gravity attack.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24206836/arranger-puzzle-game-review-netflix-summer-game-fest<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>I first encountered <a href="https://arranger.quest/"><em>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure</em></a> at the Netflix booth during Summer Game Fest. Within moments <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24180304/summer-game-fest-2024-best-games">of settling in with the demo</a>, I was struck by the game’s clarity of conceit and purpose. You’re a little girl named Jemma, who, as she moves across a tiled world of columns and rows, moves objects with her. Puzzle shenanigans involving&nbsp;— if you’ll pardon the pun — <em>arranging</em> objects will undoubtedly ensue.</p><p><em>Arranger </em>is an “Oh... <em>oh</em>!” kind of puzzle game. It is deceptively simple, with clear objectives no more complicated than “use the pressure switch to unlock the door.” But the game’s simplicity of presentation obscures cleverly designed puzzles that tested my spatial awareness to its absolute limit, and I <em>loved</em> every second of it.&nbsp;</p><div><p>That spark of recognition, that eureka moment, is a priceless jolt of excitement that happens early and often</p></div><p>Early in the game, I was in an empty room with a pressure plate and a blocked door. Standing on the plate naturally unblocked the door, but when I moved off the plate, it slammed shut in my face. I tried every which way of <em>arranging</em> (sorry, this is gonna happen a lot) myself, thinking I could quickly hop off the plate and into the open door before it shut —but to no avail. Frustrated, I went back out the way I came thinking I’d missed some key item from an NPC, and by the doorway… there were two potted plants.</p><p>Oh... <em>oh!</em></p><p>Before I entered that room, those potted plants were a throwaway decoration. Coming out, I immediately gleaned their purpose. Playing <em>Arranger</em> feels like the first time a baby discovers that the square block goes into the square hole. That’s not to say the game is too easy; rather, it’s like you can feel yourself learning a new thing in real time. That spark of recognition, that eureka moment, is a priceless jolt of excitement that happens early and often.</p><p>When I’m playing, the click of the tiles as Jemma moves gets slower as I mutter “I think I got this” the closer I get to the objective. I know what has to happen. To beat this centipede boss, I must shove its spiky tail into its eye, but for every tile the tail gets closer, the eye moves a tile away like in a game of <em>Snake.</em> But there are stones in the boss arena, and I can wedge the centipede around the stones and...</p><p>Oh... <em>oh!</em></p><p>As rewarding as those moments are, though, they also work in reverse. The game’s antagonist is an affliction called “the static.” Objects affected by it essentially act as barriers. Jemma can’t move them the way she can other things, so if they’re in her way, she has to figure out a way to go around them. The static also spawns path-blocking monsters that can only be defeated if you push a sword into its space. A lot of <em>Arranger</em>’s puzzles involve moving a sword, Jemma, or mission-critical items around “static’d” objects.</p><div><figcaption><em>Combat in </em>Arranger<em> involves moving swords around and pushing them into enemies.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Furniture &amp; Mattress</cite></p></div><p>In one puzzle, I had to reassemble the pieces of a broken record, rotating the record around and filling each hole. Seemed easy enough. But when Jemma moves, every movable object on the same axis moves with her. So when I pushed in the last piece, another piece on the opposite side popped right out.</p><p>Oh... <em>oh! Shit.</em></p><p>A lot of the game’s puzzles start off just like that, easy right up until the end, when the curveball comes out of nowhere. But believe it or not, those moments felt good, too. With the record puzzle, once I saw that piece pop out, I started giggling. It was a feeling akin to putting your Crocs in “<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/crocs-in-sport-mode">sport mode</a>.” This puzzle was harder than I expected, time to lock in. (And don’t worry, there are settings that let you skip puzzles if they’re too hard, settings to make puzzles harder, and a multiplayer mode that lets a friend move stuff, too.)</p><div><figcaption><em>Locked doors mean nothing to Jemma.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Furniture &amp; Mattress</cite></p></div><p>Though <em>Arranger</em> is a puzzle game, it effectively uses its mechanics to build an interesting world and tell a sweet story. Jemma’s movement ability makes her unique, and she goes on an adventure to find others like her, using her powers for good along the way. When Jemma reaches the end of a row or column, she warps around to the other end. She uses that feature to bust out a teenager trapped in their locked room by strict parents by simply pushing them into the opposite wall. In another area, she saves a town whose inhabitants have become moribund in their homes because they relied too much on communicating via blue mechanical birds.</p><p>Oh... <em>oh! Ha!</em></p><p><em>Arranger</em> is the video game equivalent of a book you’d take with you on a beach vacation — perfect for your Switch, Steam Deck, or tablet. It’s pleasantly short — I’m in the final area, and I’ve played around four to five hours total. If you’re adventurous, you can extend that playtime by completing the optional puzzles scattered throughout. I love this little game unlike anything I’ve played recently.</p><p>To really drive home how charmingly seductive <em>Arranger</em> is, let me leave you with a short story. It was 11PM on a weekday night. I decided to play some <em>Arranger</em> before heading to bed — nothing more than 30–45 minutes tops. When I put down my Switch to check the time, it was 1:51AM. <em>Two hours</em> had passed and I didn’t even feel it. Moreover, I didn’t care. A game hasn’t done that to me, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24202033/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review-capcom">even ones I’ve adored</a>, in recent or distant memory. I felt like a kid again. Give <em>Arranger</em> the chance to do that to you.</p><p><small><em>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure</em> is out now on Switch, PlayStation, PC, and mobile via Netflix.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been an entire year since Remnant II was released, launching worldwide to a fairly positive reception and decent reviews. It’s a great game if you want to experience some mindless, visceral action, facing off against immense and at times grotesque bosses either alone or with friends. There’s also a decent story sitting at the heart of the game, along with some RPG elements and a pretty good loot loop to pursue.</p>



<p>Now that the game’s first anniversary has rolled around, the team at Gunfire Games has announced the impending arrival of the title’s third and final DLC: The Dark Horizon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-most-expansive-dlc">‘The Most Expansive DLC’</h2>



<p>It hasn’t been a bad run for Remnant II, and a year is long enough for players to have soaked up everything the game has to offer. In September 2024, the game’s final DLC will be deployed – The Dark Horizon. It has been penned as the largest DLC the team has created thus far, but Gunfire Games admitted that it has been delayed by a few weeks. The original intention was to have all three DLCs released <strong>inside </strong>of one year.</p>



<p>Here’s what the team said in a statement <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1282100/view/4364635226638976270" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on Steam</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our goal is for The Dark Horizon to be the most expansive DLC for Remnant II. Not only have we packed this DLC full of even more of the Remnant greatness you’ve come to expect, we’re also hard at work on a brand-new game mode that will be free for everyone that we’ll reveal soon along with a new progression system.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The ‘brand-new game mode’ is being kept under wraps for now, but it’s likely the most considerable addition to the game that’ll be ushered in with The Dark Horizon. The team didn’t confirm a date for the release of The Dark Horizon, but given that the window is September, there won’t be all that long to wait.</p>
