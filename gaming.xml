            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/borderlands-4-and-mafia-the-old-country-trailers-will-both-be-at-the-game-awards/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Two of 2K Games’ biggest upcoming titles will have new trailers released during The Game Awards 2024 this week, with both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> to feature among the many, many, many game trailers and announcements.</p>
<p>The Mafia <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1866165956134707406">social media</a> account kept things pretty tame, just saying “See you at [The Game Awards].” A full game reveal is expected for the game, which is due to launch in 2025 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>


<p>It was a lot more… verbose from Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford though, who <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1866164877665919396">eagerly chirped</a>, “It’s happening, you guys! I will be at The Game Awards with a new trailer for Borderlands 4. I can’t wait!”</p>
<p>He continued, “Yes, there is GAME PLAY in the trailer! Also, in addition to a lot of in-game footage, I will share a sick, never-before-seen original cinematic sequence depicting a moment that occurs about half way between the end of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> and the beginning of Borderlands 4. I AM EXCITE!”</p>
<p>I think he’s pretty hyped? It’s difficult to tell.</p>

<p>This should hopefully get the franchise and studio back on track, though. Borderlands 3 was a big success for the studio in 2019, followed up a few years later with the well received spin-off <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/30/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-review/">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</a>, but the company itself has gone through some turbulent times. It was acquired by Embracer in 2021, who decided to balloon it in size by adding sub-studios, bolstering a publishing arm and stuffing it with acquired IP… before the financial house of cards started to teeter and they were <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/11/report-embracer-groups-exploring-sale-of-gearbox-entertainment/">forced to try and sell off divisions</a>. That led to Gearbox being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/embracer-sells-off-gearbox-to-take-two-for-460-million/">acquired by Take-Two</a> earlier this year, which made the most sense since the Borderlands IP had remained tied to 2K Games publishing label anyway.</p>
<p>Through all of this there was the 9 year production of the Borderlands movie, which ended up just being a massive folly, vanity project and waste of money. At least it gave Cate Blanchett something to do after going a little stir crazy during the 2020-21 lockdowns.</p>
<p>The Game Awards 2024 will be marking the show’s 10th anniversary, as Geoff Keighley launched a replacement to the Spike Video Game Awards in 2014. It will be a late one for UK and Europe, the show starting at a hospitable 7:30PM ET / 4:30PM PT for the US, but 12:30AM GMT in the UK. And that’s not even the main show, but rather the “opening act”.</p>
<p>If I were you, I’d just catch up on things the day after.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/epic-games-users-refunds-are-being-issued-by-the-ftc-following-settlement-of-fortnite-case/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The United States Federal Trade Commission started issuing refunds to consumers impacted by Epic Games' practices in Fortnite, which led to unwanted purchases of perks, emotes, and other in-game elements.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ftc-starts-issuing-refunds-to-epic-games-users-following-settlement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry</a>, the FTC confirmed that it is sending its first batch of payments to impacted users, totaling 629,344, half of them in checks and the other in PayPal transfers. The remaining payments will be sent at a later date. The average payment is around $114.</p>
<p>This first batch of refunds for Epic Games users is being set as part of a settlement reached back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-to-pay-520m-to-the-ftc-as-settlement-over-fortnite-privacy-case/">December 2022</a>. The FTC charged the publisher with deploying shady tactics to drive unwanted purchases of virtual currency in Fortnite to purchase outfits, perks, and emotes. For this violation, Epic Games had to pay $245 million in fines, which the FTC is using to issue the refunds that started making their way to impacted users today.</p>
<p>This isn't the only violation Epic Games was fined for by the Federal Trade Commission. The Fortnite publisher was also charged with violating the COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), collecting information from children under 13 who played the popular battle royale game without verifiable consent from a parent and making parents jump through hoops to have their children's data deleted, an issue that has <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-ftc-settlement-and-moving-beyond-long-standing-industry-practices?sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long been addressed</a>. This violation cost Epic Games $275 million, bringing the total fine to $520 million.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ewcf-club-partner-program-expansion/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ewcf-club-partner-program-to-award-%E2%80%98six-figure-funding%E2%80%99-to-40-esports-organisations.1056564/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ewcf-club-partner-program-expansion/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been revealed by the Esports World Cup Foundation that the EWCF Club Partner Program applications for 2025 are now open – and that the scheme has been massively bolstered. The EWCF Club Partner Program will now invest $20 million into organisations, and this year, the scheme has been expanded to cover 40 members, up from 30 last year.</p>



<p>The top eight teams from the EWC’s Club Championship automatically score an invite, but the remaining 32 slots are up for grabs now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prestigious-program">Prestigious Program</h2>



<p>The EWCF Club Partner Program isn’t open to <strong>every organisation</strong>. Some prerequisites must be met by applicants, including having a high level of fan engagement and ‘creative excellence’. </p>



<p>Here’s the spiel from <a href="https://esportsworldcup.com/en/clubprogram" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the press release</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The EWCF Club Partner Program 2025 will focus on Clubs around the world that show high levels of fan engagement and creative excellence. Through this partnership, the EWCF and the participating Clubs will jointly invest to tell the EWC 2025 stories. Partnered Clubs are expected to have an established track record of elite competitive performance across multiple games, as well as a substantial social media presence with the ability to engage and grow a global fanbase. </p>



<p>Participating Clubs will be able to access the Program funding by engaging their fanbase with their brands throughout the esports year – so fans can follow storylines leading up to the Esports World Cup, watching tournaments online and experiencing live matches during the season.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>All participating clubs will receive a six-figure sum to help grow their organisation ahead of the Esports World Cup 2025. If the participants see immense success as part of the EWCF Club Partner Program, they’ll receive additional funding. It was stressed that being a member of the scheme <strong>doesn’t </strong>grant instant qualification into next year’s Esports World Cup, though.</p>



<p>Per the terms of the application process, organisations have until the 10th of January to get their forms filled out. </p>



<p>In a statement, Faisal bin Homran, the CPO of the EWCF, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The EWCF Club Partner Program represents a significant step forward in our ongoing mission to foster a thriving ecosystem for esports Clubs worldwide while unlocking opportunities for organizations from some of the world’s fastest-growing esports markets, like China. </p>



<p>Through this program, we enable partnered Clubs to attract fans with engaging content beyond the games, showcasing the personalities and talent of players, alongside their origin stories, while also developing their Clubs’ brands as fan-favorite powerhouses in esports entertainment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marvel Rivals developers, Netease, have just released the game’s first post-launch update, version 20241210. The new patch brings some hero balancing changes, map and game mode fixes and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-general-changes-nbsp">General Changes&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>The Marvel Rivals version <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1866393674554527800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">20241210</a> update introduces a fix for lag and significant crosshair deviation while playing highlights and recordings. Saving highlights will no longer cause the game to crash.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Players observed that heroes equipped with costumes were not visible when joining a quick match as a replacement; this issue has been fixed. Additionally, mission progress on the Season Event screen will be displayed correctly after the latest Marvel Rivals update.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Moreover, fixes related to textual errors, relatively common crash issues, and game freezing have also been released; more will be added in a future update.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-maps-and-game-mode-changes">Maps and Game Mode Changes</h2>



<ul>
<li>Clipping or becoming stuck during special collisions in specific maps, such as Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven and Klyntar: Symbiotic Surface, have been mainly fixed. However, some areas are still affected, and the developers will continue to work on fixing these problems.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The new Marvel Rivals update also introduces fixes for foggy areas of the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Hall of Djalia and the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Birnin T’Challa. These places will not have fog disappear from Hela and Storm’s perspectives after the new patch. Also, enemies and teammates will be able to see the effects of Joyful Splash when Jeff the Land Shark is revived while in the fog.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Regarding Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven—Frozen Airfield, players will observe that lighting no longer behaves abnormally when a player is knocked out near a target area. Also, disconnecting and reconnecting during matches will not cause the desynchronisation of some doors.&nbsp;</li>



<li>There are several fixes for Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven – Eldritch Monument. Adam Warlock’s ultimate will no longer lead to teammates being revived and stuck beneath the terrain when the target area ascends or descends. In the exact location, if Thor and Loki were revived through Hela’s team-up ability, they would not get stuck under the terrain.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Moreover, the Marvel Rivals update also ships characters from getting stuck under the terrain when Jeff the Land Shark uses his Ultimate while ascending or descending. In the same situation, Winter Soldier’s Ultimate will no longer lose damage if it’s right on the target.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Coming to Competitive mode changes, the new Marvel Rivals patch will display the vehicle range when switching between rounds. Also, when you reach the third round, Competitive Convoy or Convergence Heroes will not carry over their Ultimate Energy from the second round.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-hero-changes-nbsp">Hero Changes&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>When players equipped the Deadpool &amp; Wolverine costume for Wolverine, they observed that no ability voice lines instead of Undying Animal would play. This update fixes this issue. Also, Star Lord Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3’s MVP animation does not have sound effects on the result screen, but it has been fixed.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The Marvel Rivals patch also fixes Iron Fist’s voice lines not playing when using pings. Regarding Black Widow, the description of her ADS sensitivity has been fixed. Also, she will recover energy as intended in every situation.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Coming to the last bit of Heroes changes in the new Marvel Rivals update, Captain America’s Ultimate wouldn’t end as intended in specific extreme situations; this problem has been fixed. Now for the most significant change: Doctor Strange’s portals were causing terrain KOs, which restored the character’s ultimate energy. After the new patch, the portals’ terrain KO attribution was disabled as a temporary fix. A proper fix will be ruled out to restore this attribution in a later update.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-pc-and-console-changes-nbsp">PC and Console Changes&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>Players would observe memory leaks and blurry models on PCs when using FSR 3 frame generation technology to improve the resolution. The new Marvel Rivals update will fix this issue.&nbsp;</li>



<li>For consoles, players observed that restarting the game when wearing the PlayStation bundle’s Scarlet Spider costume would cause the outfit to not display correctly. This issue has also been fixed.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>This morning, Amazon Studios and Games Workshop finalised a deal that was cooking for an entire year. The completion of this deal means that Amazon Studios now has exclusive rights to any movies or television shows set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe – and per a follow-up update from Games Workshop, there are <strong>multiple </strong>productions in the pipeline.</p>



<p>The news was also shared on social media by Henry Cavill, who has been aligned with a Warhammer 40,000 project for the longest time. He’ll be producing and starring in a series of his own, giving him another outlet through which to explore a passion he’s tracked for 30 years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-signed-sealed-and-delivered">Signed, Sealed, and Delivered</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/c2ngqfgb/major-update-on-amazon-studios-warhammer-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an update</a> posted by the Warhammer team, it was confirmed that multiple projects are on the 40,000 roadmap:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s official – Games Workshop and Amazon Studios have finalised their deal – the creative guidelines are nailed down, and we’re all set to bring Warhammer to the screen.</p>



<p>But what does that actually mean?</p>



<p>Well, it means we now have synopsis and ordering for the stories we’re going to tell… yep, we said&nbsp;<em>stories</em>! It might have taken a year but it was a year well spent! And what fun – sifting through the enormity of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, debating characters, story arcs and the thematic grit that underpins it all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In <a href="https://investor.games-workshop.com/news-posts/agreementwithamazonforfilmsandtelevisionseries101224" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the legal release</a>, it was stated that Amazon also has the option to license rights in the Warhammer Fantasy universe <strong>following the release </strong>of any Warhammer 40,000 production – so this deal could eventually run much deeper.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the team at Games Workshop and Amazon Studios stressed that it’ll be many years before production surfaces in full. What has been dubbed as ‘Project One’ is only just preparing to enter the scripting stage, so there’s still a long time left to wait before the fruits of this deal are realised.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Production processes in respect of films and television series may take a number of years.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What do you want to see appear as part of this deal? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Games Workshop and Amazon Studios have now officially finalised their plans to bring Warhammer 40K to film and TV screens.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-reportedly-set-to-star-in-a-warhammer-40k-series-at-amazon">companies have long been in discussion</a>, with actor and Warhammer superfan Henry Cavill set to star and executive produce thanks to his "lore expertise".</p>
<p>Now we have an official statement, with Games Workshop offering Amazon the exclusive rights to both films and television series, as well as merchandising rights.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://investor.games-workshop.com/news-posts/agreementwithamazonforfilmsandtelevisionseries101224">legal notice</a> adds: "Production processes in respect of films and television series may take a number of years."</p>
<p>However, a more <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/c2ngqfgb/major-update-on-amazon-studios-warhammer-stories/">casual statement to the community</a> notes that multiple "stories" are planned, with synopsis and ordering finalised. The first project is "about to go into development proper" - the script is next on the agenda.</p>
<p>"Of course, as with all carefully crafted things, this all takes time... and trust us when we say, everyone involved is las-focused on getting it all just right," reads the statement.</p>
<p>Cavill also shared the news on Instagram, together with his own "pilgrimage" back to the model shop where he bought his first Warhammer models.</p>
<p>"My incredible team and I, alongside the brilliant minds at Games Workshop, have been working away in concept rooms, breaking down approaches to the enormity and magnificence of the Warhammer world," he wrote in the post.</p>
<p>"Together, we've been sifting through the plethora of incredible characters and poring over old tomes and texts. Our combined efforts have led us to a fantastic place to start our Universe, which has been agreed upon by those up on high at both Amazon and Games Workshop. That starting place shall, for now, remain a secret. Watch this space, though - more to come in time!"</p>

<p>This won't be the first time the companies work together, though, as there's a Warhammer 40K episode in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-episodes-of-amazons-secret-level-anthology-hints-at-a-rich-visual-picknmix-but-is-that-enough">Amazon's forthcoming Secret Level series</a>.</p>
<p>To celebrate the series, Warhammer 40K: Space Marine is one of a handful of games available for free through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prime-gaming-gets-second-batch-of-december-titles-to-celebrate-secret-levels-arrival">Amazon Prime Gaming this December</a>.</p>
<p>Its sequel, released earlier this year, was hugely successful, becoming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/space-marine-2-most-successful-steam-launch-for-warhammer-40k-series">most successful Steam launch for the Warhammer 40K series</a>.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saber-ceos-supposed-comments-raise-eyebrows-for-saying-games-should-be-about-glory-kills-not-imposing-morals">comments supposedly from the CEO of developer Saber Interactive</a> raised eyebrows for stating that games should be about "glory kills" instead of "imposing morals on gamers".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s what he said at the time:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Witcher 4 has been announced. I can't say anything about it. What we know is that Geralt will be part of the game, we just don't know how much, and the game won't focus on Geralt. So it's not about him this time. We don't know who it's about. I'm excited to find out. I want to know! I have not seen any script yet — I mean, I couldn't tell you if I did. This is the thing, so I could be lying through my teeth. But I'm not. Or am I?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt had long made clear that Geralt's saga had come to an end, meaning a new protagonist was fully expected for Polaris, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-stars-geralt-of-rivia-but-not-as-the-main-character">this was the first confirmation he'd be in the next game at all</a> — and fueled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witcher-4-story-fan-theories-ciri-vesemir"><u>some rampant fan theories</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Only a single teaser image, below, has otherwise been revealed for The Witcher 4, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-dev-confirms-teaser-is-a-brand-new-witcher-school">but it was enough to suggest Ciri will be the protagonist this time around</a>. What's considered the "true" ending of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, thanks to its story being continued in canon comics, sees her become a witcher herself.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/23/untitled-2-1648052443071.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Witcher 4 teaser image. Image credit: CD Projekt.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But now, Cockle has revealed those comments raised a few eyebrows at The Witcher developer CD Projekt, and he now insists he has no idea if Geralt is in The Witcher 4, or who the main character is — although he admits that a non-disclosure agreement would force him to lie about it if he did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I did go online and I said something about this and then I got slapped by CD Projekt,” Cockle said. “I don't know how true it is. I went off a rumor. I thought I'd seen somebody from CD Projekt say that Geralt will be in Witcher 4 but he won't be the main character. And I don't actually know if that's true now because they came back and they went, ‘We haven't put anything out there, don't say anything.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So the truth is, the answer to your question is, I don't know what it's going to be. I have ideas. I thought I had an idea what it was. And then I was kind of basically told, ‘We haven't told anybody what it is, so where you got that information we don't know.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it might be from a really really old statement that somebody who no longer works for CD Projekt actually put out about three years ago. So Witcher 4 is a complete mystery to me. I actually don't know.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in the interview, Cockle said Ciri as protagonist in The Witcher 4 would make sense, pointing to her ability to travel between worlds. He also reveals that years ago he spoke with someone at CD Projekt about what a future Witcher video game might look like, and discussed a Witcher origin story, among other ideas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, though, Cockle is keeping his cards close to his chest here. “The truth is I can’t answer the question because I’ve signed an NDA,” he said. “So even if I did know, I’d have to lie to you.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/10/gettyimages-1356685274-1733820615489.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Doug Cockle insists The Witcher 4 is a mystery to him.

			<p>Yesterday, Croatian game developer Croteam announced The Talos Principle: Reawakened, an Unreal Engine 5 remaster of the first entry in the adventure franchise. A substantial visual upgrade is the first thing you'll notice, but there's a lot more, according to the studio.</p>
<p>Reawakened includes the <a href="https://wccftech.com/talos-principle-dlc-road-gehenna-announcned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Road to Gehenna expansion</a> and adds a brand new chapter called In the Beginning. Croteam says the new content explores the Simulation's origins and the challenges of its first test, adding new layers to the game's philosophical and narrative depth. Moreover, the developer will release a puzzle editor with The Talos Principle: Reawakened to empower&nbsp;modders to build unique worlds and challenges for the whole community.</p>

			<p>Once again we find ourselves in the world of retro-tinged horror, with 2024 being especially productive for developers exploring this style of horror. Among Ashes is the latest to enter the conversation as one of the best examples of the genre.</p>
<p><iframe title="Among Ashes - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFBzqIK4Q9g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The recent trend towards PS1-era aesthetics is partly repeated here, but the unique selling point for Among Ashes is that it actually contains multiple different perspectives and game types within its four or five hour playtime. You begin by sitting at an in-game PC playing a horror-themed Doom clone before being interrupted by a friend on an instant messaging service that is deliberately designed to look like it’s ripped straight out of the early 2000s. This is an interesting choice of period setting and one that brought me right back to my undergraduate days. Your friend sends you a link to a creepy pasta style forum post about a supposedly haunted game mysteriously released by a solo developer. That game within a game, Night Call, becomes the main focus of your time.</p>


<p>Here you play as a police officer called to investigate strange noises coming from the Stoker house but soon upon arriving your partner is attacked by a zombie and things start to take a turn for the horrific.</p>
<p>Night Call takes on the PS1 blocky graphics and deliberately wooden voice acting of early survival horror, but relocates the traditional American setting to a distinctly British country house. The setting reminded me of the cult classic Clive Barker’s Undying at times, an influence that is replicated through the demonic enemies that plague your time exploring the ubiquitous mysterious mansion.</p>


<p>Navigating the house is done via a first person perspective which suits the 2000s PC setting. At first you’ll have to fend off enemies with a simple police baton (UK police not generally being armed with firearms) but you can use this to defend and block most incoming damage. As the game progresses you’ll find the usual pair of a pistol and shotgun, but ammo is relatively scarce a lot of the time and best saved for the occasional forced encounter. The main enemies you face can only be put down for a short time anyway so it is best to save your bullets.</p>
<p>Alongside the basic but era-appropriate combat you’ll have to solve a number of logic and environmental puzzles to get keys and venture deeper into the mansion. Some of these involve breaking the fourth wall of the game and looking up details on the in-game web browser or messaging your friend. One particular standout sees you having to complete a retro top down game within the game within the game in real Inception fashion, whilst another section involves being chased around a cave system by a terrifying instakill enemy.</p>
<p>The sheer variety of game styles and approaches here ensures that you always have something new to enjoy and nothing ever gets the chance to outstay its welcome. Perhaps the main exception here is that aforementioned cave chase which involved some quite counter-intuitive signposting in its pre-release build. I also encountered one or two minor bugs that were a little frustrating but the devs have been busily updating the game ready for release so these should be squashed.</p>

<p>So, Among Ashes features a number of meta-levels and games within games throughout but the framing narrative also becomes a game of its own. As you push deeper into the retro joys of Night Call, strange things start to happen in the real world of the game and you begin to suspect that the game is trying to communicate with you. Without spoiling anything, I can confirm that the different strands of the game do pull together as the game comes to a close and the result is a nicely balanced mixture of different realities.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Among Ashes is a great addition to this already stellar year of indie horror. It doesn’t quite reach the highs of titles like Hollowbody, but is an enjoyable dose of horror nostalgia that pulls together a range of approaches to create an identity that feels fresh and unique.	</p></div>

			<p>Rocksteady has <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-4-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that support for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will end in January 2025 with the release of Season 4's Episode 8. That's not surprising in the least, since the game was a massive flop in terms of sales (it <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-revenue-decline-suicide-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost</a> publisher Warner Bros. Games a 41% decrease in Q2 2024 revenue) and critical reception. Here on Wccftech, reviewer Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> it 5 out of 10 at launch:</p>
<p><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has a sprinkling of that classic Rocksteady charm, delivering polished visuals, fluid traversal and combat, and some snappy repartee, but the whole experience is bogged down by dreary, repetitive mission design, empty live service elements, and a feel-bad story that’s mean-spirited to the point of feeling oddly resentful. Perhaps most damning, not even the thing promised in the game’s title – fighting and dispatching the Justice League – ends up being particularly fun or memorable. Those who really want to see what becomes of the Arkhamverse may not be able to resist picking this up, but I suggest waiting for a steep discount before subjecting yourself to this tedious team-up.</em></p>
<p>Those steep discounts have arrived, though. For the recently ended Steam Autumn sale, the game was 95% off. Now it's back at full price, but there will likely be another large discount with the Holiday sale that starts in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Rocksteady also improved Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League in various ways throughout the past year, keeping the full announced plan of four post-launch seasons, which introduced new maps and playable characters: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-gets-season-1-roadmap-joker-coming-on-march-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joker</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-season-2-is-out-next-week-will-add-mrs-freeze-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mrs. Freeze</a>, Lawless, and now Deathstroke, who was added with today's update. Deathstroke features a close-range, melee combat playstyle powered by his sword. This is complemented by the following firearms: Assault Rifles, Shotguns, and Sniper Rifles.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/M04_Mayhem_10-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The new seasonal episode also introduces a new medieval-like Elseworld inspired by DC's Dark Knights of Steel comic book series. Last but certainly not least, the new update adds the long-awaited Offline Mode, allowing players to experience all content released for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League without an Internet connection. However, all online features will also remain available for the time being, so co-op play is still going to be an option.</p>
<p>As for what's next for Rocksteady, it's worth reminding that the studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocksteady-reportedly-hit-by-layoffs-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit</a> by layoffs a few months ago. The rumor is that they've been working <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on a Director's Cut for Hogwarts Legacy</a>. Then, perhaps, they'll return to the Batman: Arkham franchise, though it will inevitably take a few years.</p>

            <p>If we follow Marshall McLuhan’s ideas about technology being an extension of the body, then the copy and paste keyboard shortcuts are my equivalent of a trip to one of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>’s ripperdocs. In the writing of this single article, I will use them for links, HTML code, and other ephemera. I even copied McLuhan’s name across from a different tab, which I’m sure he’d appreciate/be horrified by. I love those shortcuts. I need them. They are the wind beneath my wings, and the crud buildup beneath the bottom left of my keyboard.</p>
<p>I cannot say how the first tailor to gaze upon a sewing machine felt, nor the first egg-abacus attendant to behold the sorcerous ticking of the automated egg timer. But I think now that when they saw those things, they were afraid. As I am afraid now.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I am afraid now. I highlight the above words, and reach to press Ctrl+C. My curled pinkie finds its target instantly, but my index finger hesitates. Sense memory rushes through synapses. Somewhere, a rodent’s heart beats as it chews pensively on a bin bag yoghurt splotch. A moth’s wings flutter as it practises scaring the shit out of someone in the shower. A cascade of pigeon poop plummets into a lunching office worker’s quintuple-named Starbucks drink, ironically making it taste slightly more like real coffee. My index finger finds its mark, so quickly as to be indistinguishable to anyone as a lapse in cohesion.</p>
<p>Anyone but me.</p>
<p>I am afraid now. I type these words manually, refusing to cast aside yet more of my fleeting mortality to the micro-micro-microseconds I’ve now identified between my pressing of Ctrl and V. For I now realise what that ‘+’ symbol has taken from me. A gulf of time and possibility. A gaping wound of opportunity. A subtraction in mocking masquerade.</p><p>I have seen the face of the cosmic jester that jabs and japes at the apex of all realities, and his name is the Copy and Paste 2-Key Keyboard SAYO OSU Keypad Hotswap One Handed Mechanical Gaming Keyboard Cherry Switch RGB Backlit Mini USB Keypad for macros or Rhythm Games. Which is just the sort of bollocks you’d expect from him, honestly.</p>
<p>I am afraid now. I am typing this manually again. It feels, in some small way, like an act of reclamation. One less layer of simulacrum in the chain of words on a website, copied from words in a document, copied from words in a dictionary, copied from soundwaves uttered by human mouths, inspired by abstract concepts, material realities glimpsed and filtered through subjective experience, dreams where someone offers you a grape but there’s a tiny version of your own dad living inside the grape and you say “I can’t eat that, it’s my dad!” and your dad shouts from inside the grape “but you must, son. <em>You must</em>.”</p>
<p>Perhaps I must. And perhaps I must also purchase the Copy and Paste 2-Key Keyboard SAYO OSU Keypad Hotswap One Handed Mechanical Gaming Keyboard Cherry Switch RGB Backlit Mini USB Keypad for macros or Rhythm Games. I’m actually genuinely curious to see whether it makes my life any easier. Maybe I could set up little macros for Total Warhammer. Maybe I could finally start to live again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Recently, a trailer surfaced on YouTube for a new Satisfye product called the Zengrip 2, a case for the Nintendo Switch 2 — or whatever it’s going to be called. The trailer was quickly deleted, but not before eagle-eyed users snapped shots of the footage, which showcased what could be the first look at a finished Switch 2.</p>



<p>It’s highly likely it’s a shot of a mock-up produced by Satisfye based on leaks and Nintendo-provided dimensions, but it <strong>could </strong>also be our first look at Nintendo’s upcoming console.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bait-and-switch-2">Bait and Switch (2)</h2>



<p>The assumed leak was spotted on Twitter by ‘DP19’, who captured a grainy image of the trailer before it was taken down by Satisfye:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Other users then followed up with successive shots of the same video <a href="https://x.com/nRAYm2002/status/1866295996785074518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">that were a little clearer</a>. Presently, the driving notion behind this being a real Switch 2 is that the ‘Joycons’ featured in the trailer have ‘the extra button’ that’s sitting front and centre on leaked designs.</p>



<p>Even if it is the Switch 2, it’s almost too blurry to make out any major details. Many have quipped that it ‘looks like a Switch’, which is fairly obvious. It was never expected that Nintendo would make any great or innovative strides when piecing together the next generation of the popular handheld console.</p>



<p>Do you think the Switch 2 leak is to be believed, or could it be a marketing ploy by Satisfye? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The FTC has announced that the ‘first wave’ of refunds resulting from a $245 million fine to Epic Games <span>is being distributed&nbsp;<strong>now</strong>. In March 2023, Epic Games was ordered to pay back players ‘duped’ into spending money by mistake, and the first round of refunds—totalling $72 million—has</span> started being handed out.</p>



<p>When the dust had settled in the FTC vs. Fortnite case, the gaming titan was found to have been promoting a ‘counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration’ that subsequently led to millions of players making purchases they didn’t want.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-are-you-owed-a-fortnite-refund">Are You Owed a Fortnite Refund?</h2>



<p>In recent years, the United States Federal Trade Commission has been hot on these tactics, which typically involve ‘clever placement’ of buttons and prompts to encourage users to buy things in digital stores without them necessarily meaning to.</p>



<p>The FTC claimed that Epic Games was knowingly allowing children to ‘rack up unauthorised charges without any parental involvement’. It’s not the first company to adopt these tactics, nor will it be the last, but it’s one of the firms hit the hardest by legal action pursued by the Federal Trade Commission.</p>



<p>By way of a resolution, Epic Games agreed to discontinue the use of these shady tactics, and it noted that it would put in place a prompt requesting consent from the consumer before making any purchase. </p>



<p>Next week, 629,344 customers will be refunded an average of $114 – and this is just the first stop of the refund train.</p>

<p>However, there are some prerequisites you’ll need to meet in terms of eligibility:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Monday, police <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare-death-investigation-12-9-24/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested 26-year-old Luigi Mangione</a> in connection to last week’s shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The handsome suspect and his alleged actions <a href="https://gizmodo.com/bitter-americans-react-to-unitedhealthcare-ceos-murder-my-empathy-is-out-of-network-2000534520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought the internet together</a>, and now we’ve been brought together again in the age-old practice of combing through Mangione's internet history. The literary-minded are diving into his <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/luigi-mangione-united-healthcare-goodreads-account.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goodreads account</a>, politics reporters are looking at his <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/murky-wing-politics-alleged-uhc-193654118.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">politics</a>, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/luigi-mangione-arrested-uhc-shooting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tech</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/healthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-luigi-mangione-has-connections-to-the-videogame-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games</a> sites are looking at his gaming history.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not a mystery why sites are doing this. At websites that depend on SEO, and even at news sites more broadly, it’s a pretty obvious thing to do: people are justifiably interested in Mangione, who he is and what might have motivated him. If some facet of that dovetails with the subject of your site, it’s a no-brainer to write it up, both to serve your specific readership and try to catch some of the spike in search interest before it expires.</p><p>And it even makes sense why non-journalists would read these stories, and why they’d do digging of their own. Often, readers do this because a violent event is so shocking, but what felt so unique about Thompson’s shooting was the general relatability of it all, a certain lack of outrage that crossed political divides. It wasn’t really a mystery why someone would do something like this to a health insurance CEO, one who oversaw a company rife with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/06/business/insurance-claim-denials-unitedhealthcare-ceo/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coverage denials and horror stories</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing that’s been uncovered so far about Mangione, who was arrested on firearms charges but has not been charged with the shooting, changes that fact. Neither his reading or gaming history or the speculation that he <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/unitedhealthcare-shooting-suspect-luigi-mangione-read-books-chronic-pain-1997995" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffered from back pain</a> is necessary to explain what he might have done. The alleged gaming-related details of his life are pedestrian: He is an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/luigi-mangione-arrested-uhc-shooting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">app developer</a> who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2020, where he helped start a game development club due to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200426034424/https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/student-club-highlights-interdisciplinary-art-making-video-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interest in indie games</a>. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/healthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-luigi-mangione-has-connections-to-the-videogame-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer</a> says his LinkedIn account suggests he interned at Firaxis in 2016 to help with <em>Civilization VI, </em>the kind of thing a young person interested in game development might do. On Reddit, a user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videogamedunkey/comments/1haj7qb/the_alleged_uhc_assassin_was_a_dunkey_fan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared an image</a> of what could be Mangione’s high school yearbook entry, featuring a silly quote by YouTuber Dunkey that reveals nothing but the possibility that he watched YouTube, the way millions of people do every day.&nbsp;</p><p>Wired identified an <a href="https://www.xboxgamertag.com/search/lmangione" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox account</a> that shares Mangione’s name, which doesn’t seem to have been used in over a decade.

Payments have been sent to folks who filed a claim before the original February 2024 deadline--but don't worry, there's still more time to get in on this settlement if you missed out previously.</p><p>At issue, according to the FTC, was "Fortnite's counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration [which] led players of all ages to incur unwanted charges based on the press of a single button." This refers to how the item shop used to allow players to make a purchase with a single, instant button push, and there was only a very brief window within which it was possible to cancel the purchase. The additions of the "hold-to-purchase" interaction in the shop, as well as the 24-hour window to cancel a purchase, were the result of this and similar suits in Europe.</p><p>As part of the claims process, users could choose to be paid via check or PayPal. Those who chose PayPal and have an approved claim--which the FTC  said makes up about half of the 629,344 payments in this round--should have received the money in their accounts on Monday. Those who opted for a check will receive it later.</p><p>This round of payments totaled about $72 million, which means users received a little over $100 on average, though the totals varied based on how much each person had spent during the window of time that this settlement applied to, with players receiving $250-300 on the high end.</p><p>For those who haven't filed a claim but want to get in on these refunds, it's still possible to do so--this first round of payments is only a third of the total Epic is supposed to pay, and the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FTC is still taking claims on its website here</a>. Just keep in mind this is only for folks who played Fortnite prior to September 2022, so newer players need not apply.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-mafia-the-old-country-lead-the-charge-as-more-game-awards-showings-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
With just days to go until The Game Awards 2024, developers are taking the opportunity to whip fans into a fury of anticipation by revealing ahead of time that, yes, their games will appear - with showings for both Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4 now officially confirmed.
</p>
<p>
Mafia: The Old Country's "gritty mob story set in the brutal underworld of 1900s Sicily" was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">announced earlier this year</a>, and developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a> has now <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1866165956134707406">taken to social media</a> with a simple, "See you at The Game Awards!". This fourth series instalment is due to launch next year, so the timing makes sense for a more substantial look beyond its initial teaser trailer.
</p>
<p>
As for Borderlands 4, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has been yapping excitedly about it since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-coming-2025-taking-players-to-an-all-new-planet">unveiling back in August</a>. And he's now popped up to tease the shooter's impending Game Awards appearance. "It's happening, you guys!," he <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1866164877665919396">wrote on social media</a>. "I will be at The Game Awards with a new trailer for Borderlands 4. I can't wait!"

<p>
"Yes, there is GAME PLAY in the trailer!," Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1866166033465106733">continued</a>. "Also, in addition to a lot of in-game footage, I will share a sick, never-before-seen original cinematic sequence depicting a moment that occurs about half way between the end of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> and the beginning of Borderlands 4. I AM EXCITE!"
</p><p>
Elsewhere, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocket Pair - currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">embroiled in a patent infringement lawsuit</a> with Nintendo - has <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1866170665101152345">confirmed a Game Awards appearance</a>, promising fans, "You won’t want to miss it!". And it probably won't surprise anyone to hear <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> will also be at this year's show, his appearance alongside host and pal <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> now almost as inevitable as the setting sun. But what might he reveal? A Death Stranding 2 release date? More of his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">intriguing Xbox horror game OD</a>? Only time, and perhaps a 45-minute show segment, will tell.
</p>
<p>
The Game Awards 2024 airs this Friday, 13th December, at 1am in the UK - but especially enthusiastic sorts can tune in half an hour earlier if they fancy a bit of a pre-show. 2023's event went on well into the wee hours, so if you value your sleep like a sensible person, you can always catch up at a more reasonable time via Eurogamer's coverage.

Season 4 Episode 7 launches on Tuesday, and Episode 8, which is set to release on January 14th, 2025, will “serve as the last seasonal Episode for&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League,” </em>developer Rocksteady <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-4-deep-dive">announced on Monday</a>.</p><p>After the release of the final content, the game will still be available to play online, according to <a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36121518094995-SEASON-4-FAQ">a WB Games FAQ</a>. But the game is also getting an offline mode tomorrow — which had been <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-is-getting-an-offline-mode-after-all-but-not-until-sometime-after-its-out/">previously announced</a>, though without a specific date beyond “2024” — that will let you play the main story and all seasonal story mission content without an internet connection.</p><p>The game has had a troubled history. The game was originally set to release <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21376280/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-game-trailer-rocksteady">in 2022</a> before being delayed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22992865/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-delay-spring-2023-announcement-ps5-xsx-pc">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/13/23682376/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-delayed-february-2024">times</a>. And a largely unsuccessful launch — in our review, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24062243/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review-ps5-xbox-pc">we said</a> the game “hides its brash personality under a generic looter shooter” — resulted in Warner Bros. Discovery announcing in May that it would be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172905/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-200-million-loss-wbd-rocksteady">taking a $200 million loss</a> on the game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Despite releasing into early access, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a> is filled to the brim with content. From the main story campaign to side bosses to an endless endgame, you're certainly getting your money's worth by participating in early access. Some players could find hundreds of hours of gameplay in Path of Exile 2 just through the game's initial content.</p><p>However, if you're trying to gauge exactly how much time you have to spend in Path of Exile 2 before "beating it," that's another story. Below, you can find how long it takes to beat Path of Exile 2, how long it takes to reach the endgame, and a full quest list so you can track your progress.</p><h2>How long to beat Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Since Path of Exile 2 is an ARPG, you can never truly "beat it." Most ARPGs follow a similar structure of progressing through a main campaign that's followed by the endgame. The endgame is what you make of it and you could spend however much time you want with a given character participating in endgame content.</p><p>With that in mind, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/path-of-exile-2-release-date-early-access-and-eveything-we-know/2900-5988/" data-ref-id="2900-5988">beating Path of Exile 2</a> can be defined as simply reaching the endgame and getting past all the campaign acts. In early access, there are three acts you need to progress through before reaching the endgame. This number of acts will eventually be doubled to six in the full release of the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412761-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.41.48.80.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412761" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412761-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.41.48.80.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412761"></a><figcaption>Act 2 features a completely new zone and quests.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412761-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.41.48.80.png"></figure><p>However, just beating the three acts doesn't get you to the endgame. Instead, you need to first beat the three acts on standard difficulty, which gets you to level 45. Then, you're required to beat Acts 1-3 again on Cruel difficulty to finally reach the endgame. Doing all of this should result in your character being around level 65.</p><p>Your first time <strong>beating the three acts should take 25 or so hours</strong> in Path of Exile 2. Then, you'll need another 15-20 hours to get past the acts again on Cruel difficulty. This puts the time to reach the endgame anywhere from 40-50 hours per character.</p><p>If you want to play as another class in Path of Exile 2, you'll have to repeat the same process over again. This means another 40-50 hours to reach the endgame with that character.</p><p>Once you reach the endgame in Path of Exile 2, the world is your oyster. You have the freedom to spend any additional amount of time with any character as you progress through endgame content. The maximum level cap in Path of Exile 2 early access is level 100, though, so it might not be worth it to try and go past that level just yet.</p><h2>Path of Exile 2 full quest list</h2><p>One of the best ways to track your progress during the main story is by checking what quest you're on. If you know the names and order of the quests in each act, you can accurately gauge how far away you are from the next act.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412762-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.42.18.16.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412762" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412762-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.42.18.16.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412762"></a><figcaption>A full quest list for Act 1.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412762-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.42.18.16.png"></figure><p>Below, you'll find the full three-act main quest list in Path of Exile 2:</p><p><strong>Act 1</strong></p><ul><li>Reaching Clearfell  <ul><li>Mercy for the Miller</li></ul></li><li>Secrets in the Dark</li><li>The Mysterious Shade</li><li>Sorrow Among Stones</li><li>The Trail of Corruption</li><li>The Mad Wolf of Ogham</li></ul><p><strong>Act 2</strong></p><ul><li>Earning Passage</li><li>The Trail of Corruption</li><li>A Theft of Ivory</li><li>The City of Seven Waters</li><li>A Crown of Stone</li></ul><p><strong>Act 3</strong></p><ul><li>Legacy of the Vaal</li><li>The Vaal Jungle</li><li>Mysteries of the Vaal</li></ul><p>There are more quests in Act 3, but that's all players have seen up to this point.
