            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/yanis-varoufakis-technofeudalism-valve-steam-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yanis Varoufakis has worn many hats over the course of his career: Economist. Academic. Politician, even briefly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanis_Varoufakis#Minister_of_Finance_and_the_Syriza_government_(January%E2%80%93August_2015)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">becoming Greece’s minister of finance</a> during a tumultuous period in 2015. Author, most recently of <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/751443/technofeudalism-by-yanis-varoufakis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Technofuedalism: What Killed Capitalism</em></a>. But many people forget that, back in 2012, he also helped Valve study hats – or at least, the market surrounding them in <em>Team Fortress 2</em>. At the time, Varoufakis was<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/videogame-yanis-varoufakis-used-study-eurozone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Valve’s economist in residence</a>, playing a role in pioneering the sorts of digital markets that now dominate Steam, video games, and to some degree, the Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>Varoufakis is not a fan of many of these markets, as he outlines in <em>Technofeudalism</em>, which posits that the likes of Amazon and the App Store have evolved into algorithm-powered fiefdoms that exist not to foster commerce or competition, but to modify behavior and extract rent from all who produce goods for them. Other people do the work, while big companies and platforms reap the rewards. At this point, it’s a well-documented dynamic that most ascribe to late-stage capitalism. Varoufakis believes that capitalism fell to this new system’s claws some time ago – that we’re now tussling with a wholly different beast. In fact, he doesn’t believe that what companies like Amazon offer are markets at all.</p><figure><blockquote><p>I realized that when I'm on Amazon.com, I'm not in the marketplace. It looks like a marketplace, but it isn't a marketplace.</p></blockquote></figure><p>“Every capital good that we had since antiquity was something we produced in order to produce something else with it, whether it's a fishing rod or a hammer or a tractor or, today, a very advanced industrial robot,” Varoufakis told Aftermath. “Cloud capital is not a produced means of production; its purpose is to modify our behavior, to replace Don Draper, to replace the market. And to replace it with a machine that interfaces with you in real time forever and extracts you from the market.”</p><p>The real goal, as Varoufakis identifies it, is to provide the land on which these transactions occur and, like the feudal lords of yore, to effectively give us, the townspeople, no choice in the matter. You either sell your product on Amazon – or share your music on Spotify, or tailor your videos to the ever-shifting whims of YouTube and TikTok – or you may as well take a hike into the internet’s equivalent of the frozen wastes. Companies extract rent, whether in the form of a 30 percent tax on the App Store and Steam or by collecting all your data and selling it to ad providers on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and the like – all while you provide the content that gives these platforms their appeal in the first place.</p><figure><figcaption>Ascannio / Shutterstock</figcaption></figure><p>“I realized that when I'm on Amazon.com, I'm not in the marketplace,” Varoufakis said. “It looks like a marketplace, but it isn't a marketplace. It has none of the characteristics of a market. And the most important characteristic of a market is its decentralization. You walk into a shopping mall, you walk into a farmer's market, if you and I walk together, we see the same products. We can have a discussion about it. We can say 'Ah, this is crap,' that we're not gonna buy the stuff, or 'This looks great.' We can't do that on Amazon.com because you and I cannot communicate. The algorithm doesn't allow us. It matches you with a particular vendor, maximizing the likelihood of extracting a greater cloud rent from the vendor. And if you and I type the same thing in the search box, we get very different recommendations, because that's how the statistical model works. This is how the algorithm works.”</p><p>The larger superstructure of technofeudalism, Varoufakis believes, is unsustainable. A small handful of companies maintain absolute control over these algorithms while extracting fees that do not even remotely correlate to a need.&nbsp;</p><p>"These are simply retained rents, because the Apple Store doesn't cost them,” he said. “The marginal cost of running it is miniscule."</p><p>As a result, money exits the circular flow of income – the version of the economy in which individuals provide labor that allows businesses to produce goods and services, for which individuals then receive income that can then be spent on goods and services – and ceases to benefit most people. Games that rely on user-generated content, Varoufakis said, are an example of this. The <em>Robloxes </em>of the world might offer generous payouts to a select few, but most never see any payout for their hard work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“There's so much work that is not remunerated, but it is monetized,” said Varoufakis. “It's not remunerated to those who actually created it. Kids get some money, but they get next to nothing compared to the value that they create, because they actually build the cloud capital, and they are wage-less. Up until now, you know, steam engines were manufactured by wage labor. Now all the worlds are manufactured by unwaged labor. This is not sustainable, even if this work is voluntarily provided. It's still work, and it's skilled work, and when it's not remunerated, that kid will not have enough money to go to college. That kid will not have enough money to buy stuff from Walmart. That kid will not have enough money to go to the movies. So that affects the rest of the economy."</p><p>Varoufakis recognizes his own role in paving the way for technofeudalism to bulldoze capitalism, which was already bad, and build something worse in its place. At Valve, he <a href="https://www.yanisvaroufakis.eu/category/essays/valveconomics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studied</a> Steam’s then-nascent <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community marketplaces</a>, which have since evolved to become some of the most influential in video games. Without <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoKtsdlbCy0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Team Fortress 2</em>’s hats</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/csgo-skin-economy-explained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Counter-Strike</em>’s knives</a> – not to mention Steam’s almighty algorithm – you’d have never gotten the real-world-money-powered stores present in games like <em>Roblox </em>and <em>Fortnite</em>, nor Facebook’s fumbling metaverse aspirations, nor numerous other platform monetization efforts. But during Varoufakis’ time at Valve, from his perspective, it all arose from a place of necessity.</p><p>"Some people have accused me and others of having commodified the games too much and having introduced the stores and the capacity to trade within,” he said. “My fear was that if you don't do that, [users] will take it outside, and then it will be completely impossible to regulate. So it was always a difficult project to maintain a balance between commodification and outside options, as I call them. If you don't commodify, then the commodification will escape outside the walls of the community – of the fiefdom, if you want – and then you will simply have no control over it. It's a big dilemma."</p><figure><blockquote><p>Some people have accused me and others of having commodified the games too much. ... My fear was that if you don't do that, [users] will take it outside, and then it will be completely impossible to regulate.</p></blockquote></figure><p>This has proven true for many games, whether it’s V-Bucks scams around <em>Fortnite </em>or, following Varoufakis’ time at Valve, the rise of <em>Counter-Strike</em> skin gambling, which exploded into <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-virtual-guns-counterstrike-gambling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a multi-billion-dollar aftermarket</a> until Valve was pressured into regulating it, first <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-people-are-flipping-out-over-the-counter-strike-gam-1783369102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in 2016</a> and then <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-gambling-csgo-skins-ban-1850428697" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">again in 2023</a> after the practice saw a resurgence, especially among content creators.&nbsp;</p><p>Varoufakis spent his time at Valve studying markets with the goal of avoiding these (<a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-counter-strike-cs2-csgo-cases-keys-2023-1-billion-1851190615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admittedly very profitable</a>) worst-case scenarios and ensuring stability.</p><p>"My main project was to study the economy – to work out its dynamics, to work out what determined prices, what determined the distribution of incomes,” said Varoufakis. “Was it a stable economy? We feared that it would collapse, that suddenly some kind of bubble would inflate in terms of the prices of these artifacts, and then suddenly go pop – and if it did, a lot of people would leave the community, and that could be detrimental to the interests of the company, as well as it would annoy a lot of people and even lead to substantial financial losses for a lot of people. … I was essentially highlighting how the economy functions and then when it came to advice, what I can tell you within my NDA is that it had to do with monetization. What is the optimal strategy for monetizing without losing the joy of playing to over-commodification?"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This involved, for example, learning why certain items came to function as currency – why players might hold onto one hat not for its own sake, but as a means of exchange. These findings also fed into another project that Varoufakis is disappointed never saw the light of day.</p><p>“I worked on how the Valve ecosystem could be used to create prediction markets,” he said. “Here's how you could use these 100 million people that interacted there in order to essentially improve upon the predictions of economic forecasters on the American economies, the global economies, interest rates, growth rates, and so on. Because like Reddit, you can crowdsource a lot of information from such a large pool of smart people who are interacting and create games within the video games where you, say, for instance, get these brownie points or credit points if you predict next month's inflation rate more accurately than the Fed.”</p><p>If done correctly, Varoufakis believes Valve could be even more on top of the world than it currently is.</p><p>“That was my advice: Since an economy had emerged within the community, you can connect the economy within the community with economies outside the community – and to do it in a gaming way, which creates pleasure and, at the same time, some useful statistics,” Varoufakis said. “I am of the belief that had that happened, then Valve would be able to produce better macroeconomic forecasts for the American economy or the global economy than the [International Monetary Fund] or Goldman Sachs."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Varoufakis was diplomatic in his appraisal of where Steam ended up instead: bigger and more profitable than ever, but also relentlessly focused on games and in-game items as commodities rather than anything more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"I shall constrain myself to saying that it's not as interesting as it was to me [at the time],” he said. “The way it has evolved makes it less interesting, and I feel a certain regret that it had to go that way in the end. Commodification won. There were important values in there that commodification has destroyed, but that's what commodification does."</p><figure><figcaption>Valve</figcaption></figure><p>Despite all this, Varoufakis doesn’t blame those he worked with at Valve for Steam’s role in the advancement of technofeudalism. He believes that technofeudalism – like capitalism before it – is an everybody problem. Just as kings, lords, and peasants did not purposefully seek to invent what eventually evolved into late-stage capitalism, Valve, according to Varoufakis, did not set out with anything resembling the current digital landscape in mind.</p><p>"The people who I met at Valve who were actually coding and designing these games were just gamers. They just loved to play games, and they wanted to create better games. They didn't want to create technofuedalism. … But once scarcity of particular artifacts creates a quasi-market, and this quasi-market gives the opportunity for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp#:~:text=Arbitrage%20is%20the%20simultaneous%20purchase,markets%20or%20in%20different%20forms." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arbitrage</a>, and this arbitrage can be monetized by individuals – not by the company – the company is caught between a rock and a hard place. It has created, without wanting to, a new profit drive and a new rent extractive drive amongst its players. And then either [the company] turns a blind eye and the whole thing goes outside and all sorts of things happen, or it tries to [control it]. ”</p><figure><blockquote><p>The people who I met at Valve who were actually coding and designing these games were just gamers. ... They didn't want to create technofuedalism.</p></blockquote></figure><p>However, just because a company didn’t intend to do something does not mean it’s absolved of responsibility.</p><p>“But then once [a company starts trying to assert control], you are going headlong to what I now think of as technofeudalism,” said Varoufakis. “You become part of the problem, the same way that everybody participated in the late 18th century and early 19th century in the creation of capitalism. If you had taken two people [back then] and described to them BlackRock and Vanguard and Goldman Sachs and said 'Would you like to live in a world with these companies?' they would've said 'No, no, no, no.’ But everyone participated in the creation of this world."</p><p>The question now is how people can build a better system. Varoufakis would like to see a “cloud tax” levied against the large corporations that control the internet, as well as a structure in which governments force companies to put 30 percent of their shares into a commonwealth fund, the dividends of which would be distributed to the public in the form of a basic income. But we’re nowhere close to a point at which companies or governments would agree to that. So we’ve got to get to work.</p><p>"The only solution is politics,” said Varoufakis. “I hate to say that because I don't like politics. Running in elections, that really bores me. I can't stand it. It's toxic. It's horrible. But there's a job that we must do. It's like taking the garbage out. Because the market is not going to solve this problem. The market has already been usurped by cloud capital. … We have control over all of our communities and our societies, and we're going to do this. I hope we do this democratically – through the old-fashioned idea that the '<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/demos#:~:text=1,of%20an%20ancient%20Greek%20state" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demos</a>' has to be returned to democracy. It's not part of democracy as we speak. It's an autocracy without the ‘demos’ calling itself democracy. That is hard work, but you know what? There's no alternative."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Mountaintop has officially revealed Spectre Divide after months of playtests and teasers. This all-new tactical FPS boasts extremely innovative mechanics that will make it stand out amongst the crowd, and from the ground up, it has been built as a competitive shooter that’s sure to disrupt the esports industry.</p>



<p>Spectre Divide, which legendary esports pro player and streamer ‘shroud’ has worked on, promises to be ‘your next 10,000-hour obsession’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-future-of-fps-esports">The Future of FPS Esports</h2>



<p>Today, Mountaintop has unveiled Spectre Divide, a tactical shooter that will pit teams of three against one another in small-map modes. However, at the core of Spectre Divide is an innovative mechanic known as ‘Duality’, which Mountaintop says has never been seen before in competitive gaming.</p>



<p>This mechanic allows players to control a ‘Spectre’ (hence the name) that they can port to in real-time, allowing them to be in two places at once – literally. By doing this, players can cover themselves, pick up their own trade, or protect two objectives at the same time. </p>



<p>Here’s the gameplay deep-dive trailer for Spectre Divide:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Welcome to Spectre Divide | Gameplay Deep Dive ft. shroud" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-2fqInBNkfE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>With an almost retro-looking, cel-shaded artistic style, Spectre Divide is somewhat reminiscent of VALORANT, but that’s not a bad thing, as that’s one of the most exhilarating shooters on the market. Spectre Divide boasts a diverse array of maps, abilities, weapons, and a clean UI – plus, almost every playtest for the game has been a roaring success, per the feedback.</p>



<p>Spectre Divide will have leaderboards and ranks from the get-go, which means it’s more competitive than your average shooter right off the bat. </p>



<p>Lee Horn, the game director at Mountaintop Studios, had nothing but good things to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>”<em>Our team has been patiently waiting for this day to show how&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Spectre Divide&nbsp;</em></strong><em>will bring new life to the genre</em>. <em>Our community’s support means everything to us and it drives us to make a better game.&nbsp; A huge thank you to all of our incredible playtesters who’ve helped make the game what it is over the last few years.</em>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>From August 3 – 4, a ‘major stress test’ will take place, with players being granted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2641470/Spectre_Divide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">access to the game on Steam</a>. It’s free, so if you’re a PC player, you’ve got nothing to lose. It’s worth stressing that the Mountaintop team is made up of industry experts who have worked on the likes of Counter-Strike, Apex Legends, Halo, and Battlefield, so the talent to produce a top-tier title is there.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/spectre-divide-hands-on-preview-breaking-fps-boundaries<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>When I booted up Spectre Divide for the first time, I fully expected to play yet another team-based competitive shooter that would probably be <em>fine</em> but likely wouldn’t elevate above that. After all, the teaser trailer provided no other information other than Spectre being a mash-up of Valorant and CS:GO. But I am so glad to be wrong and to be incredibly overwhelmed by the novelty Spectre Divide brings.</p><p>The first thing that stood out to me was the art style. Cel-shading in FPS games is definitely not something you see every day, and some may argue it could be distracting, but the shadowing and details you can see in the world are actually very clean and bright so you don’t get overwhelmed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Spectre Divide Combat</h3></div></output><p>I will say that the only downside to the visuals was the fact that sometimes the orange outlines on your enemies were too slight and you’d be unable to determine if who you’re looking at is, in fact, your enemy. But the fun I had in matches greatly outweighed that visual hiccup – one that I’m sure can be addressed before launch.</p><h3><strong>Seeing Double</strong></h3><p>But let’s back up. Spectre Divide is a 3v3 tactical shooter that utilizes a mechanic called Duality, where you control two characters in matches. Technically these characters are both you, just split into two bodies. To further solidify the point that these are <em>your</em> two bodies, you’re actually able to fully customize both yourself and your Spectre in the menu.</p><p>It’s a really interesting system in a genre that has Valorant or Overwatch where you traditionally have these set characters with set abilities that you recognize. Instead, you have yourself and your split body that you’re able to really make your own. But Spectre Divide not only encourages you to be creative with your character customization, but your gameplay too.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Technically these characters are both you, just split into two bodies.</p></div><p>You’re equipped with a puck that allows you to relocate your Spectre to any position, and then swap to that body. So this can be used to get up to higher points, quickly reposition through a gate, or even just live to see another day.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/customization-1722467571619.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Your Spectre can also alert you to any enemies approaching that specific body. If I left my Spectre on Point B and I had been guarding Point A, I’d be alerted if enemies were nearing Point B based on where my Spectre is. This allows your Spectre to be even more of a useful tool in each match.</p><p>If your Spectre dies, you’re still able to use your remaining body to see the game through. So the Spectre gives you a second chance if you’re smart with placement. When I ran through my first few rounds of a match, I was surprised that learning to manage a second body was not as difficult or daunting as I expected during the tutorial.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/spectre-divide-screenshot-mill-mid-puck-throw-1722467442538.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>It takes a solid minute to figure out how to position yourself and your Spectre and how to best utilize your two bodies in a fight, but the learning curve was actually incredibly shallow. I got about four hours of gameplay in, and during that time I did learn a few tricks to really boost my Spectre mechanics, but learning the basics getting the reflexes down for managing your Spectre was pretty quick.</p><p>While Spectres themselves don’t have any unique abilities, you’re given options for different sets of tech with Sponsors. Sponsors provide you and your Spectre with equipment that benefits your team with different abilities and gear. Think of the Sponsors as your different classes in an FPS. There are currently eight Sponsors available with different kits that vary from assault-based abilities to healing support abilities.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/sponsors-frame-at-0m2s-1722467616704.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Each set of Sponsors are created with Duality in mind so you’re able to further utilize your Spectre while activating your abilities. For example, when I used the Pinnacle Sponsor, using the Adrena-Link stim would heal the body I was currently in. But if I swapped to my Spectre, I’d be able to gain enhanced movement and vision for the duration of the stim.</p><p>This really encourages unique gameplay from players and during my hands-on time, it kept me on my toes throughout each round. Trying to strategize the best ways to flank enemies or utilize my Spectre for intel was half the fun. I honestly found myself immediately taken by this concept and, after each match, I’d want to queue back in and try a different strategy.</p><h3>Familiar Format With A Twist</h3><p>The actual matches themselves are pretty self-explanatory. You’re tasked with either defending or assaulting different bomb sites, and the first to eight wins takes the victory. There’s a buy period in the first few minutes of each round where you determine what weapons and abilities you want to equip.</p><p>Unlike Valorant or CS:GO, when you buy weapons you don’t just buy individual weapons for each character. The weapons come in sets of two that split between you and your Spectre. So when I bought the first weapon set in Tier 2, I received the Buzzsaw for myself and the Harpe Sniper for my Spectre.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/game2-metro-ryker-frame-at-2m53s-1722467734331.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>If either you or your Spectre dies but one of you survives the round, you’re able to simply buy back the single weapon you’re missing in the kit for a discounted price. On that note, the weapons in Spectre Divide aren’t particularly unique, they’re weapons I’ve seen before in most FPS rosters with your typical burst-rifles, SMGs, assault rifles, and super-powered Operator sniper rifle. But it’s the way the weapons work that was the more creative angle.</p><h3><strong>Run, Don’t Walk</strong></h3><p>Usually in tactical shooters, your aim becomes less accurate as you move and you’re encouraged to walk slowly or even crouch when pulling the trigger. It’s quite the opposite in Spectre Divide. As long as you’re ADSing, you’re able to shoot on the move with crosshair accuracy.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As long as you’re ADSing, you’re able to shoot on the move with crosshair accuracy.</p></div><p>You can still hipfire, but the best way to ensure your accuracy is maxed is by ADS-ing a majority of the time. Considering that developer Mountaintop Studios is comprised of developers from Valorant, Apex Legends, Destiny, and other FPS projects, these elements all make sense for Spectre Divide’s base mechanics. A lot of casual players feel isolated from the fact that you’re not able to move at your max speed and accurately shoot in tactical shooters.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/spectre-divide-screenshot-skyway-mid-defender-sniper-1722467774782.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>But now you’re able to move around however you want and maintain that accuracy. The competitive nature of Spectre Divide works without the added need to be strategic in your stuttered movement because of required management of you and your Spectre. Mountaintop’s ability to balance these mechanics is genuinely intelligent.</p><p>The barrier to entry is a nonissue with the concept of Duality being easily comprehended. However, the skill gap between comprehension and mastering Duality is deep enough that players can spend hours and hours in the game and still find new ways to utilize this mechanic in unique ways in each match.</p><p>For the first time in a really long time, I’m so very excited for an all-new competitive FPS. Spectre Divide will be free-to-play with Spectre and weapon cosmetics as the only purchasables, and no pay-to-win mechanics. Stay tuned for lots more on this one as development progresses.</p><p><em>Stella is a Video Producer, Host, and Editor at IGN.

The fight is over AI protections and other issues in contract negotiations with some of the biggest studios and publishers, and will halt work from SAG-AFTRA members on future projects, as well as possibly keep them from promotion of upcoming games like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>and <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, until a deal is reached.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Exploitation is exactly what the bargaining group would have us accept for ourselves,” bargaining committee chair Sarah Elmaleh (<em>Gone Home</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>) said during a press conference on July 25. “The employers refuse to plainly affirm in clear and enforceable language that they will protect all performers covered by this contract in their AI language. They insist we overlook obvious AI loopholes that imperil both movement and voice performance, which are in today’s games frequently combined.”</p><p>The game companies, which include Activision, Epic Games, EA, and Warner Bros., said in a statement that their offer “extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA (Interactive Media Agreement).” But SAG-AFTRA members say that’s not the case and that the proposals fall short of what has been established in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/video-game-strike/video-game-strike-interim-agreements&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/video-game-strike/video-game-strike-interim-agreements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous agreements</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sagaftra.org/production-center/contract/820/getting-started&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sagaftra.org/production-center/contract/820/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with other studios</a></span>. </p><p>Zeke Alton (<em>Callisto Protocol</em>, <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>) disputed the companies’ characterization. “It’s disingenuous,” he said during the press conference. “I’m sorry, all right, there is a base level that protects all of the members of this union, and that is what we expect, and that is what we demand, and that’s why we’re here, because we are not getting that. So you can say something, put it in the contract if you mean it.”<br></p><h2 id="h814"><a id=""></a>Why are game actors on strike?</h2><p>SAG-AFTRA represents over 2,000 performers in gaming on both the voice acting and motion capture sides. The last Interactive Media Agreement expired in November 2022 and the guild has been in negotiations with major gaming companies ever since to establish new safety guidelines, pay rate increases, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/beyond-the-spider-verse-generative-ai-art-third-movie-1851515894&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-the-spider-verse-generative-ai-art-third-movie-1851515894">protections around generative AI</a></span>. As interest in companies like OpenAI has exploded over the past year, and people have seen the power of tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney to copy existing work and remix it on demand with simple prompts, creatives have been calling for guardrails for how generative AI is used and monetized. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-god-war-ai-voice-atreus-star-wars-1850949607&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-god-war-ai-voice-atreus-star-wars-1850949607">Its potential applications in gaming</a></span>, where entire worlds, characters, and stories are made with strings of code, are especially evident, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/ea-boss-doubles-down-on-commitment-to-ai-believes-more-than-50-of-our-development-process-will-be-impacted/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/ea-boss-doubles-down-on-commitment-to-ai-believes-more-than-50-of-our-development-process-will-be-impacted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with CEOs at big publishers publicly hyping up</a></span> the prospect of using generative AI to cut down on costs to their shareholders.

The current protections offered would also seemingly leave out motion artists whose work is changed using generic AI tools trained on random internet data.</p><p>“The protections only extend to on-camera performers and to voice performers under their offer if the performer is identifiable in the output of the AI digital replica,” chief contracts officer Ray Rodriguez <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-grand-theft-auto-6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-grand-theft-auto-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Aftermath</em></a></span> in an interview last week. “But the truth is, in video games, it’s not going to be identifiable, as you could be doing the stunts that form the movement for Spider-Man, but what the player is going to see is Spider-Man. So that requirement of identifiability really leaves movement performers out of the scope of coverage.”</p><h2 id="h815"><a id=""></a>What games could be affected by the strike?</h2><p>Strike rules require all SAG-AFTRA members not to work on or promote games at any studios or publishers that are part of the current deadlocked negotiations or who haven’t already signed onto one of its existing agreements. That includes everything from voicing grunts in something like<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-playtest-wb-games-date-1850347676&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-playtest-wb-games-date-1850347676"><em>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</em></a></span> to pivotal scenes in Insomniac Games’ upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wolverine-ps5-insomniac-games-leak-rhysida-hack-sony-1851111188&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wolverine-ps5-insomniac-games-leak-rhysida-hack-sony-1851111188"><em>Wolverine</em></a></span> game. Promotion, meanwhile, could include everything from tweeting about a game to appearing on podcasts. But it’s not as simple as every game from the companies involved being part of the strike. </p><p>Part of why it’s so hard to know exactly which games will be affected is because of the video game industry’s infamous penchant for secrecy, which has trickled into the SAG-AFTRA strike itself. When asked for a list of currently announced games that would be impacted by the work stoppage, a spokesperson for the union told<em> Kotaku</em> that wasn’t possible since “the majority of the titles in production are listed under code names and we are not provided with actual titles of videogames when they register.” About 30 or so existing studios and companies have signed onto recent tiered or interim agreements that allow striking members to continue working with them, though the union wouldn’t provide a list of the entities’ names. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta6-voice-actor-strike-saf-aftra-1851606082&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta6-voice-actor-strike-saf-aftra-1851606082"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> Is Exempt From The Game Actors Strike</a></span></p><p>There is also a long list of games that are exempted from the strike because they began production before September 2023. While <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> publisher Rockstar Games’ parent company is part of the strike, the 2025 blockbuster won’t be impacted because it’s part of that exemption. An entry in SAG-AFTRA’s database of projects lists a warning under <em>GTA VI</em> that while members won’t be disciplined for working on it during the strike, they are still encouraged to show solidarity with their fellow actors by not performing new work on it in the meantime. (Rockstar has worked with SAG-AFTRA talent in the past, including Roger Clark, the voice behind<em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em>'s Arthur Morgan).</p><p> “We’re obviously not happy about that,” Rodriguez <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-grand-theft-auto-6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-grand-theft-auto-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Aftermath</em></a></span> regarding the <em>GTA VI</em> exemption and others. “That language was bargained into one of the legacy Interactive Media Agreements before merger [of SAG and AFTRA]. It’s language that the merged union basically inherited, that I think is insane. But it’s there.” But he also noted that most game actor work is contracted on a per-session basis and that performers could still voluntarily opt out of additional sessions until the strike is resolved. “This language made its way into our contract for one reason only, to undermine our union’s most valuable tool: a strike,”  committee chair Sarah Elmaleh <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/selmaleh/status/1818724152788021343&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/selmaleh/status/1818724152788021343" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said in a recent video</a></span>. “But you always have a choice not to undermine a strike.”</p><p>A second set of exemptions revolves around live-service games like <em>Fortnite</em> (made by Epic Games) and <em>Apex Legends</em> (made by EA). As ongoing productions set in motion years ago, those also aren’t part of the strike. SAG-AFTRA is seeking to change that though, which could impact content updates and new characters introduced in later seasons. “SAG-AFTRA has sent its notice of termination of the agreement with respect to many live service games, which will allow SAG-AFTRA to call a strike of one or more of those games at a future date,” a spokesperson for the union told <em>Kotaku</em>. “We will provide detailed instructions to members if such a strike is called in the future.”</p><p>These caveats are part of why EA CEO Andrew Wilson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://s22.q4cdn.com/894350492/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Q1-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-2024-07-30.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/894350492/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Q1-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-2024-07-30.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently told investors</a></span> that the company doesn’t expect any short-term impact from the strike or a “near-term disruption to any of the games we have in development or any of the live services we’re currently running.” But even completed games could still be affected by rules against promoting games sold by struck publishers. For example, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-bioware-dreadwolf-andromeda-anthem-1851545206&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-bioware-dreadwolf-andromeda-anthem-1851545206"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span> is set to come out later this year. If the strike is still ongoing at the time, cast members Matt Mercer (<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>), Ike Amadi (<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>), and other high-profile actors wouldn’t be able to join the marketing junkets around it.</p><p>Big games that are further out are much more likely to run into production delays, or potentially try to replace SAG-AFTRA members with scab labor. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-release-date-cast-1851235004&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-release-date-cast-1851235004"><em>Death Stranding 2</em></a></span>, a game that’s heavy on performances due to director Hideo Kojima’s cinematic and storytelling ambitions,  is set to come out in 2025. While it stars Norman Reedus, who is covered by SAG-AFTRA, it’s possible most of the actor’s work has already been wrapped on the project. If not, however, the strike could potentially delay any unfinished work or scenes that are re-written and need to be re-recorded. While not announced, the third <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> game starring Ashely Burch is also likely in some stage of development. The strike could impact that as well.</p><h2 id="h816"><a id=""></a>What happens next with the game actor strike?</h2><p>Despite the strike, both sides will continue to negotiate behind closed doors. Actors are expected to picket but exact locations for that haven’t yet been announced. One recent event that SAG-AFTRA members weren’t prohibited from attending was San Diego Comic-Con 2024. The guild announced that a carve-out from its promotion restrictions was made to allow actors with panels there to attend and speak out about the issues they’re striking over.</p><p>SAG-AFTRA members have also started their first picket line outside Warner Bros. Games on August 1. It’s likely to be the first of many in-person protests where members and those supporting them gather outside the offices of the companies they’re negotiating with to make their case publicly and to discourage colleagues from working during the strike. Union protections prohibit companies from retaliating against workers who refuse to cross picket lines. </p><p>In the meantime, its possible some game companies could be moving ahead with using AI for performances with non-union actors anyway. Earlier this week, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Wired </em>reported</a></span> that Activision is already encouraging artists on <em>Call of Duty</em> to use generative AI for concept art and help with assets. When asked at a press conference last week if it or other companies SAG-AFTRA is currently negotiating with might already have begun using AI to duplicate actors’ performances, Rodriguez said he was worried it might be a possibility.</p><figure id="" data-id="daa3b41fe09efc92f99c7ca0637fa086" data-recommend-id="image://daa3b41fe09efc92f99c7ca0637fa086" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dragon Age characters stand next to each other ready to fight.

Many members at the time rallied around the slogan “Performance Matters” while calling for royalties as companies tried to pit actors against developers when it came to who was getting paid more. The voice of <em>Uncharted</em>’s Nathan Drake, Nolan North, was criticized at the time when, using the spotlight at the 2016 Game Awards, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/parsing-nolan-north-s-vague-comments-about-the-voice-ac-1789616920&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/parsing-nolan-north-s-vague-comments-about-the-voice-ac-1789616920">he stressed that the performance</a></span> of every developer also mattered, which some took as a gesture that undermined the strike. </p><p>This time the conversation could be very different as developers at some of the biggest game companies also unionize.

It also comes packed with Super Mario figures, including Hammer Bro, Boom Boom, two Goombas, and two Para-Biddybuds.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Haunted-Mansion-Nintendo-Gamers/dp/B0CV2F99FR?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Haunted-Mansion-Nintendo-Gamers\/dp\/B0CV2F99FR?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Haunted-Mansion-Nintendo-Gamers/dp/B0CV2F99FR?tag=gamespot-promos-20">King Boo's Haunted Mansion (932 pieces)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Haunted-Mansion-Nintendo-Gamers/dp/B0CV2F99FR?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Haunted-Mansion-Nintendo-Gamers\/dp\/B0CV2F99FR?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Haunted-Mansion-Nintendo-Gamers/dp/B0CV2F99FR?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$75</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>King Boo's Haunted Mansion also joins the catalog of large-scale Lego Mario expansion expansion sets. This 932-piece set is one of our favorites in the entire Lego Mario series. Just look at that mansion design! If your Lego Mario/Luigi/Peach figures are brave, they can open the doors and step inside the pretty (but also pretty haunted) residence of King Boo. Your objective is to locate a key, unlock a treasure chest, and thwart the King Boo. The set has some cool interactive elements, including a rising sofa, a movable bookshelf, and multiple Blocks. Beyond King Boo, you get three additional figures: Yellow Baby Yoshi, Dry Bones, and a regular Boo.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Battle-Nintendo-Character-Adventure/dp/B0CV2896TL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Battle-Nintendo-Character-Adventure\/dp\/B0CV2896TL?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Battle-Nintendo-Character-Adventure/dp/B0CV2896TL?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Battle With Roy at Peach's Castle (738 pieces)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Battle-Nintendo-Character-Adventure/dp/B0CV2896TL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Battle-Nintendo-Character-Adventure\/dp\/B0CV2896TL?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Battle-Nintendo-Character-Adventure/dp/B0CV2896TL?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$65</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Though it doesn't come with Peach, this is a great addition to any Lego Super Mario starter set.

            <p>
Avowed, the upcoming fantasy action-RPG from Obsidian Entertainment, has reportedly been delayed, moving out of its previously announced 2024 release window into 2025.
</p>
<p>
That's according to journalist Tom Warren, writing in The Verge's (paywalled) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211199/microsoft-teams-new-ui-chat-xbox-employees-studio-d-notepad">Notepad newsletter</a>. "I'm hearing that Obsidian is about to announce an Avowed delay to early 2025," he revealed, adding the decision had been made to avoid a "very busy period" for Game Pass.
</p>
<p>
Obsidian and Microsoft have yet to formally announce a release date for Avowed beyond its vague "2024" launch window, but a 12th November date was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidian-accidentally-reveals-an-avowed-release-date-before-deleting-it">inadvertently shared</a> - and then rapidly deleted - in a developer blog post published in June.

<p>
Despite the reported delay, Warren's sources say Avowed is in "good shape" and that the shift to 2025 is "more a matter of wanting to give the game breathing room during very busy period for Xbox Game Pass". As Warren notes, a November launch for Avowed would see it competing for attention on Game Pass with developer GSC Game World's long-in-the-works Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, which recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-delayed-again-now-arriving-in-november">saw its release date shift</a> from 5th September to 20th November.
</p>
<p>
A 12th November launch for Avowed would also see it jostling with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, while another big RPG - BioWare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> - is also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date-narrowed">expected to land</a> in roughly the same timeframe. "Things are getting stacked for Xbox games in the all-important holiday season," Warren noted.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-believe-in-living-in-fear-obsidian-talks-avowed-release-date-prospects-and-xbox-studio-closures">spoke to Obsidian about Avowed</a> back in June, when the developer revealed it was "finalising" the game and "in a polish phase".

			<p>GTA Online has received a brand-new update, adding much new content to <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-reportedly-coming-soon-to-pc-game-pass/">the game</a>. This includes the all-new Benefactor Vorschlaghammer, the latest car eligible for drift tuning. It is a great new option for those who partake in the Drift Racing scene, and if you participate in Drift Racing, you get double rewards. If you win the race, you are eligible to get 2X GTA$ and RP. For GTA+ members, you'll get 4X GTA$ and RP through August 7.</p>
<p>If you want to purchase the Benefactor Vorschlaghammer, you can do so in-game at the Southern San Andreas Super Autos website. Alternatively, you can go to the Luxury Autos showroom to see it in person. The Drift Tuning upgrade is completely free for GTA+ members.</p>
<p>If you compete in the Drift Races and complete the weekly challenge of participating in six Drift Races, you'll receive a reward of GTA$100,000 and a Rockstar Helmet.</p>
<p>In addition to the new motor, there are plenty of rewards for event participants. If you place in the top five in the LS Car Meet Series four days in a row, you'll win an Ocelot Ardent (Sports Classic).</p>
<p>For GTA+ Members, August is the last month to receive an additional GTA%1,000,000 bonus, which is automatically deposited alongside the standard GTA$500,000 into your Maze Bank account.</p>
<p>Through September 4, you can get the following rewards as a GTA+ Member:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free Benefactor Vorschlaghammer</li>
<li>Free Drift Tuning Upgrade for the Vorschlaghammer at the LS Car Meet</li>
<li>Bonuses on Nightclub Management and Casino Story Missions</li>
<li>Free Cobalt Jackal Racing Jersey, Pants, and the Diamond Jackpot Tee.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTA+ website</a> has more information about the rewards available, which include some classic Rockstar Games titles.</p>
<p>As a result of GTA Online players all teaming up and delivering over 30 million pizzas, all members can now claim their "Pizza This... Tee" by logging in to GTA Online this week.</p>
<p>Additionally, those who want to be a taxi driver around Los Santos can get 3X GTA$ on Taxi Work is currently available. Visit the Downtown Cab Co. depot on the corner of Tangerine Street and Mirror Park Boulevard in East Vinewood to participate in being a taxi driver.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you participate in Issi Classic Races, you can earn 2X GTA$ and RP. To do so, open the Online tab in the Pause Menu and select Stunt Races. From there, you'll see the Issi Classic Races available.</p>
<p>This month is a busy month for GTA Online, as plenty of discounts are available on weaponry and vehicles, if you're looking for something new to add to your collection.</p>

			<p>The Verge's Tom Warren has just shared in a paywalled <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211199/microsoft-teams-new-ui-chat-xbox-employees-studio-d-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> that Avowed, Obsidian's action roleplaying game, might be about to get delayed from Fall 2024 to early 2025.</p>
<p>Sources cited by Warren say the game is not in any trouble. In fact, it's looking good, but Microsoft and/or Obsidian have decided to give it more 'breathing room' to get out of a busy release window.</p>
<p>To be fair, there are supposed to be four triple-A action roleplaying games due in Fall 2024: Avowed, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard. However, Bloodlines 2 is missing from Gamescom and may well be delayed, too.</p>
<p>In June, following the Xbox Game Showcase, Obsidian Entertainment's Carrie Patel (Game Director on the project) <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-to-feature-third-person-camera-and-respec-option-game-director-says-its-looking-fantastic-and-ready-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed </a>the team's confidence in the Fall 2024 launch window:</p>
<p><em>I'll say, just having come from the studio last week, the game is looking fantastic. The team is putting a lot of love into the polish. So we feel very good about 2024.</em></p>
<p>Avowed is set in Eora, the universe originally created by Obsidian for the Pillars of Eternity cRPG franchise. This game focuses on first-person (with optional third-person view) action, removing classes and generally targeting a more mainstream audience.</p>
<p>Josh Sawyer, who spearheaded both Pillars of Eternity games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-does-actually-include-some-contributions-from-pillars-of-eternity-creator-josh-saywer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributed</a> in some fashion to make sure that the game would maintain the core tenets and overall spirit of the previous Pillars of Eternity games.</p>
<p>The game will be much <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-confirmed-by-obsidian-to-be-very-short-for-an-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shorter</a> than the cRPGs. Obsidian itself has likened Avowed to The Outer Worlds, their previous first-person action RPG, whose main quest can be completed in roughly thirteen hours of playtime.</p>
<p>Like all games published by Microsoft, it will be released on PC and Xbox Series S|X. Game Pass subscribers will find it in their libraries on day one.</p>

It was fine. The film takes place on the first day of the invasion, documenting the early days in New York City as humanity desperately tries to survive. <em>Black Panther</em>’s Lupita Nyong’o and <em>Stranger Things</em>’ Joseph Quinn are strong leads, and while <em>Day One </em>does fall into a rhythm of cheap deaths and predictable setpieces, I appreciated when it delved into pathos and the need for human connection at the worst of times. But now I’ve seen a deleted scene that would have added more depth to Quinn’s character, and I see it as a missed opportunity to speak to that need for human connection when deadly monsters aren’t raining from the sky.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Content warning: suicide</strong></p><p>The scene in question premiered <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://people.com/a-quiet-place-day-one-deleted-scene-exclusive-8685120&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://people.com/a-quiet-place-day-one-deleted-scene-exclusive-8685120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on <em>People</em></a></span>, and shows Quinn’s character Eric telling Nyong’o’s Samira about why he was dressed up in a suit and tie on the day of the invasion. Initially, Samira asks if he was on the way to a job interview, but his destination wasn’t quite so hopeful.</p><p>He tells her that he came to New York City to be “accepted,” having not been in the small town he grew up in. He says his dad “had an idea of the sons that he wanted,” and he wasn’t like that. In New York, he says, people didn’t mind “that part” of him, but yet he still felt so lonely in the city. “I don’t have a home anywhere. I was really tired of feeling alone and just bored of feeling alone. So I thought it would be easier not to live anywhere.”</p><p>The implication here is that as a gay man, Eric wasn’t accepted in his small hometown, and even after coming to New York City, he still felt alone. Before the calamity began, he was planning to end things.

Gays from small towns dream of moving to the city and finding their people, and yes, while there are certainly days when I feel like I have, there are a lot of timeswhen I still struggle with feeling like I’ve yet to find my home. Being in an overwhelming city, a culture shock compared to where you once were, means a lot of feeling like the life you want is still just out of reach, even though it’s in walking distance.

<p>Gray Zone Warfare is still flying high as a solid extraction shooter since being released on April 30. It enjoyed soaring success at launch, with more than 800,000 copies being sold in the game’s first few weeks on the market. With an enormous and gorgeous open-world map to explore and an innovative, open-ended take on the extraction shooter genre, Gray Zone Warfare has plenty of potential and a sizeable roadmap lined up.</p>



<p>Later this month, Gray Zone Warfare’s next major update will be unveiled at Gamescom in Germany.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-changes">Big Changes</h2>



<p>GZW’s next major update will introduce the sought-after day/night cycle, which will bring about an intense shroud of darkness over the fictional world of Lamang. In consideration of the new night-based excursions, MADFINGER will also offer players night-vision equipment, tweaks to AI behaviour (to account for the darkness), and new weapons.</p>



<p>That’s not all, though. Gray Zone Warfare is set to receive some key improvements, many of which have been requested by the community, which MADFINGER has leant on to no end to provide feedback about this developing, early-access game.</p>



<p>For instance, LZ wait times are being reduced, which will make it faster to get in and out of the action. In Gray Zone Warfare, players must call in helicopters that’ll ferry them around – it’s the easiest way to travel further across the map in less time, but given that the game unfolds in real-time, it can take a while for a helicopter to arrive. This next update intends to fix that niggling issue.</p>



<p>We’ll be on-site at Gamescom later this month to get a first-hand look at the next major update for Gray Zone Warfare.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/spectre-divide-hands-on-preview-nailing-that-first-impression-with-a-unique-twist-on-6v6-fps/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>Standing among the pinnacle of tactical team shooters is Spectre Divide, an upcoming team-based competitive 3v3 tactical shooter that brings some unique twists to the genre. As the inaugural title from Mountaintop Studios, the team has a lot to prove if they want to be recognized alongside Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege, and the granddaddy of them all, Counter-Strike. In an exclusive three-hour presentation, we got hands-on with Spectre Divide ahead of its initial reveal.</span></p>
<p><span>As the meta for first-person shooters continues to evolve among a growing number of titles, a team of five or six players pit against each other remains a core tenet of so many of these games. Here, there are still six members of a crew to each side but with a unique twist that hasn’t been properly pulled off in another shooter to date: each player controls two heroes at once.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, there won’t be any split-screen hijinx or transitioning between worlds like The Medium. What Spectre Divide offers is the unique mechanic of Duality, a body-swapping mechanic that allows players to swap into their partner Spectre character at a given time. When not actively controlling the second character, they’ll remain on the lookout and be able to provide real-time feedback when another player approaches. Other than this, the inactive Spectre will remain a sitting duck and can easily be snuck up on by a player who is mindful enough to slowly walk up behind them.</span></p>
<p><span>To balance the act of juggling two bodies at once, the ability to swap into a player’s second Spectre takes time the further apart each character is from the other. Both teammates and enemies alike can see a spark run across the ground as a character's mind shifts into their second body. Players can also redeploy their Spectre in a better vantage spot by throwing out an infinitely reusable puck that draws the Spectre into wherever it lands (also subject to the same timed delay). This mechanic can be used to get a player up onto a vantage spot or across a choke point without needing to run out into the open.</span></p>
<p><span>The concept of Duality makes almost everything in Spectre Divide require two separate halves to create a singular game experience. Players will customize both of their champions individually and in the preview build I got my hands on, things like outfits and cosmetic accessories were limited to only one Spectre at a time. This meant no matching tracksuits or Afros and sunglasses for the pair. The same goes for weapons: aside from the initial buy round, where players are limited to pistols and a few hundred bucks to their name, the in-round shop appears limited to forcing each champion to pick a separate weapon. Granted, this may be a smart quick-pick system at play here and there may be a way to pick which weapon to buy for each warm body manually, but I couldn’t decipher the full breadth of tactics during my few rounds with Spectre Divide. For much of my experience, I settled on a combination of heavy machine guns with a massive clip size for laying down suppressing fire into a choke point accompanied by some semi-automatic sniper rifles for longer-range engagements.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Spectre Divide | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/01JX0mOjjKk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><span>True to its Counter-Strike lineage, the core of the team composition lies in the Buy section that begins each round of play. Players start with a limited pool of cash that grows each round based on individual performance, both good and bad, to purchase weapons, armor, and grenades for that specific round. Survive the round, and what you’ve purchased or picked up from the ground carries into the next; die, and you’re back to your starting pistol and whatever cash the Mountaintop gods have bestowed upon you to get back up to speed. From there, players explore the tried-and-true CS-style bomb defusal gameplay, with one side actively trying to blow up one of the two bomb sites in a given stage, while the other is tasked with either taking out the enemy team before they can successfully plant a bomb or defusing it before it can explode.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to a main weapon and secondary pistol, players will also have three separate abilities to use that are purchased at the start of each round and thrown like grenades. Rather than building out a champion and selecting these abilities from a wide pool of skills, the abilities are instead given out before each round by allying with a particular Sponsor. Each Sponsor in Spectre Divide grants the player the use of three distinctively different skills that all have their tactical uses. The most basic of Sponsors grants players abilities akin to a flash grenade and explosive while some of the more complex Sponsor kits yield surveillance drones, poisoned smoke screens, and a twin-linked health booster that can restore either your health or the health of a teammate you can move your crosshair over to. With eight different Sponsors available at the launch of Spectre Divide, players will have time to explore what trio to run with will be the most advantageous on the battlefield.</span></p>
<p><span>Spectre Divide’s gunplay is insanely snappy and responsive to the twitch shooter. What’s unique to the visceral firefights that Mountaintop Studios is bringing to the competition is something they’re coining “true-to-crosshair” accuracy. For ninety-five per cent of the weapons available in Spectre Divide, that initial shot will land exactly where the player is pointing, even while moving. To balance out the one-hit kill sniper rifles, these weapons do have a very brief cooldown period where the accuracy has to recenter itself after moving. This gives semi-automatic weapons that might not fire very quickly a massive initial shot. With the Duality system, losing your active character a second chance by taking over their Spectre, no matter how far across the map they might be.</span></p>
<p><span>Spectre Divide has nailed that initial first impression with a unique twist on the tried-and-true 6v6 gunplay, but it’s only a matter of time before we see if this has the potential to be the next great competitive shooter. The concept of Duality will certainly take some practice to get the hang of, and how the Esports community reacts will be a make-it-or-break-it moment for Mountaintop Studios. Spectre Divide is one of the most fascinating new mechanics to the first-person shooter genre since the inclusion of last-man-standing and battle royale modes.</span></p>
<p><span>There’s no release date yet, but Mountaintop Studios has already confirmed that its competitive tactical shooter will initially be PC-exclusive.&nbsp;</span></p>

The third-person action-adventure game let players hop into the bounty-hunting boots of Jango Fett aka Boba Fett’s clone dad from <em>Attack of The Clones</em>. It wasn’t great, but was a fun prequel to <em>Episode II.</em> Now, 20 years later, it’s been remastered, improved, and ported to new consoles, and while it looks and plays better than ever, it’s still mostly the same not-great PS2-era action game, but now with a flashlight. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-bounty-hunter-remaster-remake-boba-fett-jango-1851564002&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-bounty-hunter-remaster-remake-boba-fett-jango-1851564002">The remastered<em> Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em></a></span>, out now on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC, tells the same story as the original version did back in 2002. The game is set about a decade before <em>Attack of the Clones</em> and stars Jango Fett, who is contacted by Count Dooku and told to hunt down a Dark Jedi and criminal leader. If he can take down the leader he’ll collect 5 million credits. What he doesn’t realize is that this is a test orchestrated by Dooku and Palpatine to eliminate a threat to their plans while also finding a strong warrior to be the source of their clone army. </p><p>Needless to say, everything that happens in <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> isn’t canon anymore. But that’s not a dealbreaker. In fact, it’s nice to go back to a time when<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-14-weirdest-and-strangest-star-wars-names-1850455711&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-14-weirdest-and-strangest-star-wars-names-1850455711"><em>Star Wars</em> games got weird</a></span> and wild with the lore because nobody was worried about all of this connecting and knew that series creator George Lucas could, at any time, retcon everything in his next film.</p><h2 id="h3299"><a id=""></a>The same game, for better and mostly worse...</h2><p>Like<em> Bounty Hunter</em>’s unchanged story and cutscenes, its gameplay and levels are mostly left untouched in this new remaster. Instead, developers Aspyr have focused on improving the visuals, the game’s performance, and making it easier to control Jango Fett. And they’ve succeeded. </p><p><em>Bounty Hunter </em>is easier to play now thanks to a modern control scheme and steady framerate. It also looks about as good as a 20-year-old PS2 game can look thanks to improved textures, lighting, and resolution. And yeah, the developers added a flashlight so you can see in some darker areas, which is nice, and time now slows down when using Jango’s scanner, which is very helpful.</p><p>However, it’s time to acknowledge the Bantha in the room: <em>Bounty Hunter</em> was never a great game. In fact, I’d argue that in a lot of ways <em>Bounter Hunter</em> is a bad game. </p><p>The levels feel too big and empty. I often found myself wandering around brown and grey hallways wondering when the next group of baddies would appear and break up the mononity. But enemies aren’t much fun to fight and don’t do much to improve the game. That’s partially because enemy AI is horrible, and also because combat is repetitive. Get ready to shoot groups of the same enemies over and over again as they run at you in a straight line or fall off a ledge and die before they even reach you. </p><p>And while there are other weapons to find in the various missions you go on, those weapons are never good enough to compete with your standard dual blasters which pack a punch, fire as fast as you can pull the trigger, and have infinite ammo. You never need to swap to anything else! </p><p>There is a jetpack in <em>Bounty Hunter,</em> which you get early on in the game, but jetpacking around is more annoying than fun due to how limited it is and a wonky camera that makes it hard to use during a firefight. Worst of all: Bounty hunting in this game is a frustrating chore.</p><h2 id="h3300"><a id=""></a>Being a <em>Star Wars</em> bounty hunter isn’t much fun</h2><p>Every level in <em>Bounty Hunter </em>features a set number of bounty targets that you can optionally hunt down, capture, and collect, either alive or dead. In theory, it’s a neat idea that any NPC or enemy you encounter during a mission could be a wanted criminal. In practice, it sucks so much. </p><p>That’s because to find these targets, you have to scan every enemy and NPC you encounter first, mark any that are targets, and then either kill them or tie them up using a wire gun. If you kill a target before you’ve scanned and marked them, you get nothing. So every fight becomes a slog as you take cover and scan each enemy before fighting them.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="644f438d7c2ea510f19c34fc62df2e83" data-recommend-id="image://644f438d7c2ea510f19c34fc62df2e83" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Aspyr / Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="644f438d7c2ea510f19c34fc62df2e83" data-recommend-id="image://644f438d7c2ea510f19c34fc62df2e83" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And sure, you can ignore the bounty targets, but then the game is just a so-so third-person shooter with some wonky platforming bits. The bounty hunting part of <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</em> is the only thing keeping this game from just becoming a dull journey through boring brown rooms. But collecting bounties is so annoying that I wouldn’t blame anyone for just skipping it all. Do that, though, and you’ll quickly discover how little <em>Bounty Hunter</em> has to offer.<br></p><p>For sure, the remaster of <em>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter </em>is the best way to play this old Jango Fett adventure. The additions and tweaks made to the game are smart and I still like the wacky EU story it tells of Jango hunting down a Dark Jedi. But sadly, this just isn’t a good game. </p><p>In all honesty, I’d have preferred a full remake of <em>Bounty Hunter</em> that improved the combat, levels, and bounty-hunting mechanics. Instead, this is a mediocre 22-year-old PS2-era<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-demo-gameplay-preview-1851608928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-hands-on-demo-gameplay-preview-1851608928"><em>Star Wars</em> game</a></span> that only the most nostalgic fans will likely finish and enjoy. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Avowed is being delayed into 2025. That’s according to a new report from The Verge’s Tom Warren.</p>



<p>In his latest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211199/microsoft-teams-new-ui-chat-xbox-employees-studio-d-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Notepad </a>newsletter, Warren says that the game is being delayed slightly from Fall 2024 to early 2025. As far as a reason, Warren says it has nothing to do with the game’s development status.</p>



<p>“I understand Avowed is in good shape, this is more a matter of wanting to give the game breathing room outside of a very busy period for Xbox Game Pass,”  he said.</p>







<p>As of publishing, Obsidian has yet to make an official announcement of the delay. However, that is expected to come in the near future.</p>



<p>Obsidian was originally slated to release Avowed this fall, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-release-date-accidentally-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November release date</a> recently being leaked. That date was never ultimately confirmed, leaving this window open for a delay should they need it. </p>



<p>As far as game’s coming to Xbox Game Pass, the biggest is the new Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. The first Call of Duty to come to the service on Game Pass, it seems as though pushing Avowed out of the same launch window will allow it to not become overshadowed.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to both Obsidian and Microsoft for comments on the report. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-delayed-last-gen</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/core-keeper-delayed-on-last-gen-consoles-and-switch.942327/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-delayed-last-gen<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie sandbox survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>has been delayed on last-gen platforms, so if you've been waiting to check this one out on PS4, Xbox One, or Switch, then you're going to have to wait a little longer, unfortunately.</p>
<p>In a message posted on X (formerly Twitter) yesterday,&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>developer Pugstorm and publisher Fireshine Games revealed that the game's last-gen release won't be going ahead <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-release-date">on August 27th as planned</a>. Instead, the game will be launching on September 17th on those platforms, and the physical versions of the game for those systems will be arriving then as well.</p>
<p>Luckily, the release of&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s 1.0 version on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S hasn't been affected by this delay; those versions will still arrive on August 27th. Sadly, the physical versions of the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions will now be arriving alongside the last-gen version.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/core-keeper-delayed-last-gen-platforms-farm.jpg?itok=_Rtdu0Ms 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/core-keeper-delayed-last-gen-platforms-farm.jpg?itok=HkrTTF33 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>is going to take a little longer to cook on last-gen platforms.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Fireshine and Pugstorm,&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s delay is for the usual reason; to ensure that the game is "the best experience possible at launch" and that players experience the game "at its very best".</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>, it's a "mining sandbox adventure" in which players team up (or potentially head into the mines solo) in order to gather resources, build bases for themselves, and take on tough enemies.</p>
<p>Released into Early Access in 2022, the game quickly started racking up sales, amassing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-sales-reach-100k-in-two-days">100,000 within its first two days</a>&nbsp;then hitting the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-sales-top-250k-within-week">250,000 milestone in just a week</a>. In less than two weeks,&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-sales-top-500k-in-two-weeks">rack up half a million sales</a>, so it's safe to say there are a lot of people awaiting its 1.0 release.</p>

<p><em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on August 27th, although you'll have to wait until September 17th for the physical versions. The PS4, Xbox One, and Switch versions arrive on September 17th as well.</p>
