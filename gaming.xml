<p>Rebellion is celebrating the successful launch of Atomfall, a pseudo-apocalyptic survival game set in rural England in the 1950s. It’s a history-bending title with plenty of mysterious meat on some well-built bones, and that’s partly why <strong>one million players </strong>found their way into the game over the launch weekend.</p>



<p>In a statement, the team revealed that Atomfall is Rebellion’s most successful launch <strong>ever</strong>, and the company has been making games for more than thirty years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-is-here">The End is Here</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-review-rebellion-curveball/">my Atomfall review</a>, I praised the game’s solid foundation, genuinely intriguing story, and sumptuous visuals, topics that have been mirrored by players worldwide. It’s a phenomenal concept for a game that has been delivered very nicely by Rebellion after years of development.</p>



<p>In a recent press release, Jason Kingsley CBE, the CEO of Rebellion, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are delighted that so many players are enjoying Atomfall.</p>



<p>To have surpassed the one million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion. Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off.</p>



<p>We are a British company, and the game is a true reflection of that. Not only is it set in the lush, beautiful countryside but Atomfall also draws inspiration from so many classic British books, films and TV series.</p>



<p>We hope that players continue to enjoy exploring the world of Atomfall and are looking forward to future content for the game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team released some statistics along with the news, revealing that 316,000 people brutally murdered the innocent scientist who helps the player at the very start of the game.</p>



<p>I was one of those 316,000 people.</p>



<p>Also, 300,000 cups of tea have been consumed, which is nothing if not indicative of how <strong>quintessentially British </strong>Atomfall is.</p>



<p>Atomfall is available now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC – it’s also on the Game Pass subscription service.</p>



<p>Let me know if you’ve played Atomfall in the comments and pop over to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> to let the community know what you think.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/priestahh-parts-ways-with-lag-m8-major-ii/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Preston ‘Priestahh’ Greiner has split from Los Angeles Guerrillas M8 in the Call of Duty League following a turbulent time for the team. Presently, LAG sits one from the bottom in the CDL standings, sitting on a match record of 4-15, which is fairly woeful. The only team behind LAG is the Vegas Falcons, which has yet to win a single match in the CDL.</p>



<p>Priestahh has been passed from pillar to post since his monumental season in 2023 that saw him secure two chips and a world championship, and it’s hard to tell where he’ll end up next.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-fall">The Fall</h2>



<p>During the 2023 CDL season, Priestahh saw immense success while playing an integral part in the New York Subliners roster. He was a member of the crew that landed one of the most historic grand finals in COD Champs history – a 5-0 wash over Toronto Ultra that ended in record time.</p>



<p>As a tenured veteran of Call of Duty esports, Priestahh has been around since Advanced Warfare (2014). He has flown the flag of some prestigious organisations, including 100 Thieves, FaZe, Cloud9, and now Gentlemates, represented in the Call of Duty League by the Los Angeles Guerrillas M8.</p>



<p>LAG has failed to gain any traction this season, though. The team has been hampered at every post, and it’s looking extremely likely that the squad won’t make it to this year’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-championship-2025-kitchener-june/">COD Championship tournament</a>, set to take place in Canada in June.</p>



<p>On March 18, LAG M8 started breaking down the roster, bidding farewell to Skyz – who has since wound up starting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-skyz-new-official-roster/">with OpTic Texas</a> in place of Kenny. On March 27, Lynz was pushed to the sub spot, being benched by LAG M8 after a crushing defeat <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atlanta-faze-lan-3peat-major-ii-finals/">at Major II</a>. Two days later, Priestahh was benched – and now he has departed the team entirely.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Nous disons au revoir à </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Priestahh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Priestahh</a><span> , qui quitte le club aujourd’hui

Merci Preston, nous te souhaitons le meilleur dans tes prochaines aventures 🩷 </span></p></article></div>







<p>Rostermania has been pretty wild so far during the gap between Major II and Major III. This coming Friday, matches will return, but will everyone be too distracted by the resurfacing of Verdansk in Warzone?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/former-sony-exec-says-its-about-time-for-playstation-to-reconsider-its-focus-on-cutting-edge-graphics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida has been sharing quite a few insights on the games industry since his departure from Sony. Among them, he says it might be time for Sony to reconsider its adherence to cutting-edge graphics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/series/rt/2001814.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AVWatch</a> (translated via <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1906929110980653479" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genki_JPN</a>), Yoshida said it's time for PlayStation to reconsider its focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Up until now, PlayStation's DNA has been driven by values such as 'cutting-edge graphics' that have continued since [Ken Kutaragi]'s time," Yoshida said. "Users have also expected that from PlayStation games. However, it's about time we have to reconsider that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, I think it's necessary to provide the very best (in terms of graphics quality) to those who want it," Yoshida continued. "But, in order to continue to be popular with users in a broad sense, we naturally have to change our way of thinking."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's little doubt that games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii">The Last of Us Part 2</a>, or other major Sony exclusives have put a lot of focus into graphical fidelity. Yet Yoshida's comments indicate it might be time to reconsider approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether that's a focus on relatively smaller experiences like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>, or a complete pivot to lo-fi or stylized graphics, it's not suggested. But with the price of making a big, AAA game like those in Sony's stable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/major-publishers-report-aaa-franchises-can-cost-over-a-billion-to-make">seemingly only going up</a>, fresh approaches might be welcome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the only insight Yoshida has shared in his interview rounds. The former PlayStation exec <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-playstation-exec-says-nier-automata-revived-the-japanese-games-industry-convinced-it-to-stop-chasing-overseas-trend">also discussed NieR: Automata's impact on the games industry</a>, especially in Japan. Whether that's the blueprint for a renewed approach to games or not, I certainly wouldn't complain about more games like NieR: Automata going around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/den-of-wolves-hands-on-preview-payday-meets-inception-in-this-mind-bending-co-op-heist-simulator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The Usual Suspects are back up to their old tricks.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It honestly shocks me that there aren’t more heist games, because I can think of few experiences more awesome than carrying out my boyhood lawbreaking fantasies with the lads. Thankfully, after more than a decade away from the glamor and gunpowder of criminal activity, a group of familiar faces behind Payday: The Heist and Payday 2 have taken a break from making the insanely difficult co-op shooter GTFO to go back to what they do best. And that is, make games where you and your friends work together to break the law by pulling off a series of elaborate and high-risk burglaries for no other reason than to satisfy your wanton greed. But where the Payday series was and continues to be a fairly standard game about robbing banks, the upcoming Den of Wolves adds a compelling sci-fi world with a gritty, cyberpunk flair, multi-phase planning and execution of break-ins where you can decide exactly how you want to pull it off, and most importantly: the ability to dive into the minds of others to steal the valuable secrets hidden within their brains. If that doesn’t get your blood pumping, I don’t know what will!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Den of Wolves takes place in the extremely dark near future where the world’s technology ecosystem imploded due to hackers, and corporations were given free rein to do whatever they pleased to combat the crisis, including but not limited to human experimentation, and building dangerous and unpredictable technologies (y’know, your basic cyberpunk hellscape stuff) so long as they kept their activities contained to the newly minted libertarian dystopia and Andrew Ryan’s wet dream: Midway City. Naturally this leads to corporations storing their data straight inside totally unhackable human brains, transforming the host to all that delicious data into a wonderful little flesh battery, from the looks of it. But we’re hardened criminals, guys. Are we really gonna let a super creepy meat computer locked away in a bank vault get in the way of us pulling off heists? I think not!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Den of Wolves GDC 2025 Preview Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, Den of Wolves has you and three friends planning and carrying out a series of felonies in Midway City, where you’ll overcome those pesky brain-based security systems by mind-melding with victims to rip off their secrets and make off with the loot. My demo focused on a single operation where my crew and I planned and executed a high-stakes assault on a bank currently under new management by a very aggressive street gang with power and tech enough to rival world governments – pretty nasty stuff. In this particular case, our plan of attack was to use a swarm of drones acquired from a previous robbery to ambush a number of these gang members to gain entrance into the reinforced stronghold, then go loud as possible, shooting up the place with reckless abandon until we found what we were looking for. In this instance, the big prize was the data inside someone’s head who was locked safely away inside a vault and scarcely resembled a human anymore; truly just straight nightmare fuel, if I’m being honest.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You'll mind-meld with victims to rip off their brain's secrets and make off with the loot.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of this caper went off in a way any Payday fan will immediately recognize: we used a variety of automatic weapons to smash and grab everything in sight while holding off waves of folks who were quite mad about being ripped off, deploying and repairing drills that break every couple seconds even in a sci-fi future, apparently. Naturally, cooperation was critical to our success, as we laid down cover fire for one another, revived downed teammates who got caught in a bad spot, and called out to one another as we heaved bags full of loot across the ruined fortress. There really wasn’t a whole lot new about the foundation of this heist game, aside from maybe the consumable equipment abilities that let my squad do things like throw down a temporary barrier that provided some limited cover in the middle of a fight.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But all that changed when the bank vault doors slid open, revealing the prize we were chasing after: a caterpillar-like human lump locked away to contain valuable secrets. After a little bit of hacking, we lept from the physical plane and into the mind of this person to hack open their brain and make off with their secrets. Now, I don’t know what exactly is going on in the mind of this clearly and understandably disturbed individual, but what we found waiting for us inside his dome was an unsettling and surreal series of landscapes that we had to leap between to gain access to their thoughts. And since we were on a timer, we couldn’t afford to take our time or slip up, lest we get booted back out to the real world and have to continue to hold out against enemies before getting another crack at it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was the only brain I dove into in my limited time with Den of Wolves, but I was told that every mind would present unique challenges to play against, not just the high-stakes platforming of our current mission. And while it remains to be seen just how interesting or how much variety these will have, this section completely shook up an otherwise familiar formula in a seriously cool way. I love shooting at rival criminal gangs and robo cops as much as the next convicted felon, but it was really neat to jump back and forth between reality-based FPS combat and completely bizarre cooperative platforming in a geometrically impossible world of imagination. That really helps to set this one apart from what I worried might just be a Payday sequel with a cyberpunk skin plastered over it. Instead, it seems Den of Wolves plans on taking some real risks and trying stuff that makes it weird and interesting, and I’m absolutely down for that.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In between trips into our poor, troubled victim’s mind, we were yanked right back out to where we left off, only milliseconds apparently having elapsed in meat space while we went parading around in someone’s noggin. After jumping back into his skull for a few additional servings of deeply uncomfortable jumping puzzles, we got what we came for and made our exit by blowing up some windows with high explosives and diving out to what I can only hope was some Assassin's Creed-style hay piles waiting conveniently placed just below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Den of Wolves borrows quite a bit from Payday and other crime games, the setting, elaborate planning mechanics, and especially its surreal mind-hacking mechanics all made me feel pretty confident that developer 10 chambers’ return to the wonderful world of heisting has a good chance of being another stunning success. Here’s hoping they can pull off the score of a lifetime when this thing eventually makes its way into early access on PC.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There has been substantial progress over the course of the negotiations, reaching tentative agreements on a majority of the topics at the table.

                <p>Developer Rebellion is perhaps best known for the Sniper Elite series, but the UK's studio latest release, Atomfall, is now the developer's "most successful launch" in its 32-year history. </p><p>Atomfall launched in full on March 27 and reached 1 million players over its first weekend, climbing further to more than 1.5 million so far. The post-apocalyptic survival game was inspired by the real-world <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Windscale-fire" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windscale nuclear incident </a>in the 1950s. The game has been referred to by some as "British Fallout."</p><p>"To have surpassed the 1 million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion," the developer's CEO and co-founder, Jason Kingsley, said in a statement. "Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off."</p><p>Rebellion also shared some other stats from launch, including:</p><ul><li>316,000 players killed the scientist at the start of the game</li><li>Players have used the cricket bat 3.7 million times to rack up kills.</li><li>More than 4 million pasties and 300,000 cups of tea have been consumed.</li></ul><p>Atomfall no doubt benefitted in terms of player numbers by launching into the Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass game catalogs. Rebellion did not, however, say how many copies of Atomfall have been sold across all platforms, including Xbox and PlayStation consoles, as well as PC.</p><p>In fact, there is no indiciation at all as to how Rebellion is measuring success for Atomfall. Also unknown is how much Atomfall cost to develop or market. As always, game development budgets remain mysterious. What we do know is Atomfall is not Rebellion's first Game Pass day-one release, as Sniper Elite: Resistance was a Game Pass launch as well.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/atomfall-review-bunker-thrill/1900-6418348/" data-ref-id="1900-6418348">Atomfall review</a> scored the game a 7/10. Reviewer Mark Delaney wrote, "Atomfall is a good game that sometimes gets in its own way, but it's the process of finding your unique path through its story that will stick with you after the dust settles."</p>

If you're a fan of locomotives and fiendish deck-building strategy roguelikes, you've probably long been in the grip of developer Shiny Shoe's massively acclaimed Monster Train. So you'll likely <em>also</em> be thrilled to hear its previously announced sequel finally has a release date - and is coming to PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on 21st May.
</p>
<p>
Shiny Shoe's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-train-brings-a-new-idea-to-a-genre-i-love">original Monster Train released back in 2020</a>, plopping players onto an infernal locomotive destined for the heart of a frozen Hell. Here, they were tasked with fending off Heaven's forces - and, crucially, protecting the train's burning pyre - through strategic bouts of real-time card battles playing out across multiple floors of the train. And good stuff it was too, still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102190/Monster_Train/">boasting an 'Overwhelmingly Positive' Steam rating</a> four years after its release.
</p>
<p>
Which brings us to Monster Train 2. This time around, Heaven and Hell's denizens have formed a makeshift alliance to bring down the powerful Titans - in an adventure taking players through Heaven, Hell, and the mysterious Abyss. To aid in their quest, Monster Train 2 introduces five new clans, new units, new upgrade cards, and dangerous new enemies. That's alongside the new Room and Equipment card types - the former providing special boosts to the train itself, and the latter providing bonuses to units when applied.

<p>
On top of that, there's the new Covenant Outpost, which players can visit between runs. Here, they'll experience character interactions as the story plays out, and gain access to different features. There are unlockable Pyre Hearts, for instance, each said to add unique functionality to gameplay, alongside train customisation and an improved Logbook.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Monster Train 2's story is complemented by Dimensional Challenges - promising handcrafted challenges, new Mutators, and cosmetic rewards - as well as Daily Challenges, an Endless mode, plus the Celestial Alcoves where players can experience a "wide variety of random events... and maybe even a few surprises" from beyond the Monster Train universe.
</p>
<p>
Monster Train 2 launches for Steam, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch on 21st May. And if you're curious to see what's new, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830/Monster_Train_2/">demo's available now on Steam</a>.

			<p>Today, developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have released a new trailer for the highly anticipated game Elden Ring: Nightreign. The video is dedicated to the Ironeye class, one of the classes players will be able to pick while in the game.</p>
<p>According to the official brief, the ethos of the Ironeye is to strike from afar with ranged attacks and deadly precision. They start with a bow and specialize in dexterity-based weapons. The class brings damage and utility to parties brave enough to sojourn into Limveld. Experienced players will also recognize the usefulness of ranged attacks - being able to revive downed party members from a distance during a run can make the difference between surviving the night and not living to see another day. While the Ironeye starts with ranged attacks and has ranged Ultimates, like all Nightfarers, they can use any weapon they discover during a run.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN | Ironeye Character Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2wQ4uE_TPdE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There will be four more classes (or Nightfarers, as they are described in the game) in Elden Ring: Nightreign:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wylder - A balanced all-rounder, effective both in speed and attack power.</li>
<li>Guardian - A tank with heavy attacks and increased damage resistance.</li>
<li>Duchess - A nimble hero with quick attacks and a strong evasive ability.</li>
<li>Recluse - A caster with ranged magical abilities and a healing-based skill</li>
</ul>
<p>These Nightfarers still have to get their dedicated trailers, though. This is likely to happen in short order, given that the game is less than two months away from its planned May 30 launch date.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checking out Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> during the recent Closed Beta Test, Wccftech's Francesco De Meo was eager to play more:</p>
<p><em>FromSoftware isn't just combining its trademark gameplay mechanics with co-op and roguelike mechanics, it is doing so masterfully to deliver an experience that has a lot of potential and could really shine with some tweaks based on the feedback from these pre-release tests.</em></p>
<p>In less than eight weeks, we'll know if FromSoftware can deliver another hit even in a spin-off game dedicated to multiplayer.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dock-chipset-4k-support/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-dock-chipset-very-likely-to-support-4k-resolution-output-new-findings-suggest.1151247/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dock-chipset-4k-support/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Doom and gloom settled on Nintendo Switch 2 fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/developers-say-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-dont-offer-4k-output/">yesterday</a> when it was revealed that the system's devkits don't support 4K resolution outputs. However, there's a good indication that this won't be the case, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4194#post-1702829">Famiiboards forums member Serif</a> provided some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jozskd/the_switch_2_dock_uses_a_realtek_rtd2175ncg/">additional details</a> about the dock's Realtek RTD2175N-CG chipset. Information on this precise model cannot be found online, but the closest model, the RTDN2173 chipset, which is likely a predecessor to the Nintendo Switch 2 dock's chipset, supports DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI HDCP 2.2/1.4 and HDR, as well as video resolutions from 720p up to 8K60Hz, so the dock will be able to output 4K resolution, although it remains to be seen if 4K resolution will be supported by games. Still, even if 4K resolution output is only limited to the system's UI, it will still be a massive improvement over the original Switch, whose interface looks terrible on large 4K screens.</p>
<p>Even without the unlikely lack of 4K resolution support, the Nintendo Switch 2 is setting up to be a massive upgrade over the original system. The console's controllers will also receive some significant upgrades, as the new Pro Controller will likely feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-upgrade-dev-kits/">a headphone jack</a>, suggesting better voice chat support for the new system as well. Thankfully, it won't be long until we finally learn everything there is to know about the Nintendo Switch 2 and how much it will actually be an improvement over its predecessor, as the console will finally be fully unveiled tomorrow, April 2nd.</p>

<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct almost upon us, details about the upcoming console’s Pro Controller have surfaced online.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-upgrades-nbsp">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller Upgrades&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4192#post-1701204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famiboards</a> (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/nintendo-switch-2-unofficial-name/227778/news/fcc-filing-could-indicate-a-possible-upgrade-for-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), FCC Filings for the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller have been revealed, providing an idea about the new upgrades for this device. The filing has been listed for ‘BEE-008’, a controller with both Bluetooth and NFC. Interestingly, the filing suggests that Nintendo could finally add a headphone jack to their Pro Controller for Switch 2.&nbsp;Moreover, the controller should feature a new battery, too.</p>



<p>The community has long requested a headphone jack for the Pro Controllers. When the console is docked, wired audio is impossible unless you are glued to the TV. However, with the upcoming console finally introducing voice chat for the platform, a headphone jack for the Pro Controller seems more likely. We will have to wait for the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event tomorrow to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct-last/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will last one hour</a> and explain everything we need to know about the upcoming console.

<p>Compulsion Games is ready to bring the world South of Midnight. Its release date comes several years after its announcement, and the developer is preparing everyone for its debut by showcasing start times for its normal and Early Access launches.</p>



<p>If We Happy Few is anything to go by, then we already know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/south-of-midnight-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight</a> is a can’t-miss adventure. Xbox shares Compulsion Games’ affinity for the weird and wonderful, and this is the first project under the Xbox banner. South of Midnight looks like a mature and realized vision, and its release date can’t come soon enough for some. </p>



<p>If you’re after the earliest possible start time, you’ve come to the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-south-of-midnight-release-date">South of Midnight Release Date</h2>

<p><strong>April 8 is the confirmed South of Midnight release date, and it’s one of the month’s biggest games.</strong></p>



<p>South of Midnight—at the time of writing—hasn’t been subjected to a delay. It’s had little-to-no controversy and got a lot of hype ahead of its launch. It’s available to Xbox Series X|S and PC users, so let’s see if being available on these platforms helps its sales.</p>



<p>Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-south-of-midnight-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight being on Xbox Game Pass</a> is sure to go in its favor.</p>



<h2 id="h-south-of-midnight-start-times">South of Midnight Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>Expect South of Midnight to launch and get underway at 9 AM PDT / 11 AM CDT / 12 PM EDT / 5 PM BST.</strong></p>



<p>Again, this is for the official launch date. South of Midnight’s release has several editions to consider, so depending on which one you opt for, there’s a chance you’re entitled to Early Access—giving you an earlier start time.</p>



<h2 id="h-south-of-midnight-early-access-start-times">South of Midnight Early Access Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>The Premium and Premium Upgrade Editions come with five days of South of Midnight Early Access.</strong></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nightdive-studios-very-well-suited-for-hexen-and-heretic-remasters-lead-engine-dev-says/">Nightdive Studios</a> has made it their bread-and-butter to be the team you want remaking and remastering older games. If there's any game you loved when you were a kid that's currently trapped on aging hardware and not easily playable on modern machines, Nightdive is the team you'd want remastering that game.</p>
<p>So far, Nightdive has remastered and remade a number of classics, including its excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/system-shock-remake-shodan-establishes-dominance/">System Shock Remake</a>, The Thing Remastered, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nightdive-announces-turok-3-shadow-of-oblivion-remaster-for-pc-ps5-ps4-switch-and-xbox-one/">Turok</a> franchise, and Star Wars: Dark Forces Remastered, to name a few. The studio has no intention of sticking to games from a certain era, though, and it is looking to take on games from the seventh generation consoles, namely PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 games.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/we-stand-ready-nightdive-says-it-wants-to-start-remastering-xbox-360-and-ps3-era-games/">VGC</a><span>, Larry Kuperman, director of business development at Nightdive Studios, said, "<em>We stand ready</em>," on the subject of remastering and remaking seventh-gen games. However, both Kuperman and Stephen Kick, chief executive officer at Nightdive</span>, added that there are plenty of considerations for remastering seventh-gen games.</p>
<p>"<em>I would begin asking a couple of questions,</em>" said Kuperman. "<em>Was it Xbox 360 exclusive, or was there a PC version out too? Because that also changes things, the little preservation that’s available. Do we have source code? If so, what’s the quality of the source code? How about the assets? Those are the kinds of considerations that we have there. That being said, there were some really good games that came out in that era that shouldn’t be lost.</em>"</p>
<p>Kick then used the 2008 first-person shooter Haze as an example of a game that he and the team at Nightdive believe should be remastered.</p>
<p>"<em>To your point, though, with a game like Haze – let’s say hypothetically we had access to that, and that was our big title for 2028, right? – We would go to the original designers, and we would say: ‘It didn’t do as well as you had hoped, I’m sure you’ve had a lot of time to ruminate and to think about what you would have done differently.</em>"</p>
<p>Kick added that, specifically with Nightdive's remaster of System Shock 2, speaking to the original developers solved many of the issues they were working on, as they could hear directly from the original creators what steps Nightdive should take to properly recreate the original vision.</p>
<p>When it comes to remastering seventh-gen games, the big hang-up has never been games that were available on Xbox 360 or PC in that era. The PlayStation 3's unique CELL architecture has been the infamous roadblock that's kept plenty of PS3-exclusive titles landlocked on Sony's old grill-looking console.</p>
<p>Despite the challenge, Kick is certain that Nightdive is up to the task.</p>
<p><em>"I think that architecture – I mean, I remember the talk when the system was first released, of how difficult it was for developers to ‘get’ it – and that’s a big problem with backwards compatibility [...] So yeah, if we get to that – or I should say when – we get to the PS3 era games, it will be a challenge that we have to face. But I think that we’ve had enough experience to where we can do a serviceable job on a PS3 remaster."</em></p>
<p>Kuperman also added that part of Nightdive's advantage is their internal engine, which has helped them remaster and remake games from multiple eras of consoles. Hopefully, it turns out to be the ace up Nightdive's sleeve to make them the go-to studio for bringing PS3 games into the modern gaming landscape.</p>

                <p>From the original PlayStation through to the PS5 Pro, graphics have always played a key role in marketing that console. Former Sony president Shuhei Yoshida thinks that it might be time for Sony to start focusing on other aspects of video games so that Sony can become popular in a "broader" sense.</p><p>"Up until now, PlayStation's DNA has been driven by values ​​such as 'cutting-edge graphics' that have continued since [Ken] Kutaragi-san's time," Yoshida said to <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/series/rt/2001814.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AV Watch</a> (via a translation by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1906929110980653479" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Genki</a>). "Users have also expected that from PlayStation games. However, it's about time we have to reconsider that. Of course, I think it's necessary to provide the very best--in terms of graphics quality--to those who want it. But, in order to continue to be popular with users in a broad sense, we naturally have to change our way of thinking."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1948874153" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

for photorealistic visuals in several of its biggest games. While games like last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/astro-bot-review-fly-me-to-the-moon/1900-6418277/" data-ref-id="1900-6418277">Astro Bot</a> are an exception to the rule, Sony generally tends to favor a degree of realism with its exclusives. Meanwhile, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick believes that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-boss-believes-games-with-live-action-like-visuals-may-arrive-sooner-than-you-think/1100-6530498/" data-ref-id="1100-6530498">games with live-action-like visuals</a> aren't far away from being realized.</p><p>There are downsides to this, as games striving for realism can look dated after a few years and the cost to produce them has grown enormously. Former Sony executive Shawn Layden has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-aaa-game-development-/1100-6478908/">the AAA video game space is unsustainable due in part to rising development costs</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/">Sony is aiming to speed up its game-development process</a> with AI and machine-learning initiatives.</p><p>Interestingly, Naughty Dog co-founder Andy Gavin recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-founder-reveals-budgets-of-original-games-and-why-they-sold-to-sony/1100-6528634/">revealed the reason why the studio sold itself to Sony</a> back in 2001 was due to rising development costs. As Gavin explained, Naughty Dog spent about $100,000 to develop 1992's Rings of Power, $1.6 million on the first Crash Bandicoot game released in 1996, and $1.6 million on Jak and Daxter in 2001.</p>

                <p>For several years, former Donkey Kong and Pac-Man champion Billy Mitchell's biggest battles shifted from arcade expos to courtrooms over allegations that he cheated on some of his championship runs. Now, Mitchell has emerged victorious in an Australian court against Karl Jobst, a YouTube artist who allegedly defamed Mitchell.</p><p>Jobst has accused Mitchell of cheating numerous times, including his contention <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-donkey-kong-record-holder-billy-mitchell-accused-of-cheating-yet-again/1100-6511134/" data-ref-id="1100-6511134">that Mitchell used an 8-way joystick for Donkey Kong</a> in his record-breaking runs.

The judge agreed with that characterization of Mitchell, but ruled that Jobst's videos had "severely damaged Mitchell's reputation and caused distress."</p><p>Following the judge's ruling, Jobst must now pay $350,000 plus interest to Mitchell. When Mitchell brought the case to the court, he asked for $400,000 in damages and $50,000 in aggravated damages.</p><p>Mitchell had previously sued Twin Galaxies to force the organization to restore his high scores.

It features a fully-realized cast of attractive characters and is a captivating soap opera-flavored political drama.</p><p>While the show premiered in the autumn of 2023, I'd foolishly let it languish in my backlog. I've since corrected this error thanks to online chatter for its second season and the hype around the anime adapting a scene from a light novel that manga readers simply referred to as "the frog scene." The cryptic allure of something called "the frog scene" putting a relatively quiet fandom in such a tizzy piqued my interest enough to get caught up on the anime in time to witness its spectacle.</p><p>As someone who spent their teenage years on Tumblr hyper-fixating over anime ship GIF sets, it's my duty to put you on to the absurd brilliance of the scene. But before I get into why an amphibian had me gnawing on the bars of my enclosure, let me give a brief rundown of the show and why I dig it.&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Apothecary Diaries </em>is best described as a historical series that takes the same comfy drama cadence of shows like <em>House </em>while weaving a palpable will-they-won't-they romance between its leads, like Dana Scully and Fox Mulder in <em>The X Files </em>or Patrick Jane and Teresa Lisbon in <em>The Mentalist</em> (for my fellow "Jisbon" heads out there). The series follows Maomao, a young apothecary forced to work as a servant girl in the Emperor's palace after being kidnapped by bandits. Maomao prides herself on pragmatism, hiding her ability to read so she doesn't attract attention to whatever bullshit the bourgeois are up to. Maomao's also <a href="https://youtu.be/2WysADlv-hQ?si=UGBbYNNP6XGxd1OJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a freak when it comes to poisons</a>, testing all kinds of concoctions on herself to the point of developing an immunity to most of them and disfiguring her arm testing different allergic reactions.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Maomao Loses It | The Apothecary Diaries" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sEAPQEtaTuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>She's able to stay under the radar until a beautiful eunuch named Jinshi witnesses her covertly solve a string of political poisonings that were believed to be a curse plaguing children born of the Emperor's harem of courtesans. In what might be the epitome of begrudgingly becoming important at work, Jinshi appoints Maomao as the lady-in-waiting to the Emperor's favorite concubine as a poison taster and resident Columbo to the castle's stream of politically motivated poisonings.&nbsp;</p><p>Until now, the medical mystery interspersed with the hierarchical drama of the Emperor's concubines, whom the show treats with the same reverence as the feuding houses of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, was what enamored me about the anime rather than its romance. My tune has been forever changed after seeing the frog scene, and now I'm on the verge of strip-mining the fandom for a nugget of information about future "Jinmao" moments.&nbsp;</p><p>In the short time I've been a Jinmao shipper, I've discovered I'm a creature whose brain can only make happy chemicals from watching a man yearn for a woman desperately trying not to be put in a situation. For two seasons, I've witnessed Jinshi try (and fail) to weaponize his bishi wiles against Maomao, <a href="https://youtu.be/-UnlbOn_1fA?si=csi2c56SaIdZ_rJT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gawk at her wearing makeup</a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://youtu.be/NnQ2mA6Kxsg?si=nK311u89H1zW9h06" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stammer over an indirect kiss</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/5ARIu7grF8A?si=f5i1gcKswOex7AzH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly crash out</a> at the possibility of her striking up a tryst with someone else. All the while, Maomao is oblivious to his pining. To her, he's <a href="https://youtu.be/zz_U3xSawTk?si=5VRYsNaBuPrSvQ2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">objectively a beautiful man</a> who the gods made a eunuch to <a href="https://youtu.be/3f8td30TzZ0?si=QTuwoA2AK0HJeBos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prevent all-out war amongst the women</a> in the imperial palace over breaking off a piece of him for themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Add that to the mix of the show, by nature of its title, following Maomao's perspective and being an unreliable narrator. Some characters, like her estranged father, are initially portrayed as downright evil until the show gives him texture outside of her bias against them. For the most part, Maomao's perceptive deductions of people's characters are on the money. However, Maomao only wants to know as much information as necessary for survival in the imperial palace. This brings us to the anatomy of <em>The Apothecary Diaries</em>' frog scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Spoilers for that.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Maomao Falls on Jinshi | The Apothecary Diaries Season 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P6kd-cHggPA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The frog scene is so cliché that it's <em>almost </em>silly to obsess over. Jinshi and Maomao fall off a cliff into a ravine. Jinshi gives her mouth-to-mouth to resuscitate her in a cave under a waterfall. They strip down to avoid hypothermia and stand on top of each other to climb out of a chasm near the opposite end of the cave. When a leaping frog startles Maomao, she loses her balance, and they topple on each other. When Maomao moves to get off Jinshi, he holds her close, placing them in a compromising face-to-face position. Picking up from the previous episode's cliffhanger ending, Maomao's hand brushes against what she believes to be the frog when she readjusts herself off Jinshi. Jinshi tells her to move her hand away, reflexively prompting her to clasp even harder for whatever reason. The dominoes quickly fall in Maomao's head as she pieces together that she's been grabbing his junk—something he shouldn't have anymore—and that Jinshi isn't a eunuch.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Is That a Frog in Your Pocket? | The Apothecary Diaries Season 2" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0FMchxI2ltk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Before Jinshi confesses his true identity (a mystery the show, despite Maomao, telegraphed episodes into the first season), Maomao cuts him off, saying she must've crushed a frog. This leads to a funny back and forth where Jinshi ricochets from taking offense to feeling oddly complimented by her saying it must've been "a fairly large frog" before culminating in him asking her if she wants to check herself. He lifts her leg, and the two almost kiss before they're interrupted by a rescue party. I apologize for not recognizing that <em>The Apothecary Diaries</em> was operating on this level of romance novella in tandem with its political drama, because now I'm obsessed with this ship.</p><p>Fans—myself included—are so beside ourselves at what amounts to a two-episode-long dick joke pushing our ship to the next level that there are posts scientifically breaking down the average size of a frog to Maomao's proportions and <a href="https://twitter.com/dailykusuriya/status/1905642890606366927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reverse engineering Jinshi's size on Twitter</a>. I've never seen this level of innovation in any fandom I've frequented, and, unlike Maomao, I'd like to learn more. It's taken everything within my power not to call upon the wisdom of folks who've read the light novels and manga to tease other watershed moments that await me in their budding relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>On a deeper level, the moments sandwiched around the frog scene have me in awe of the engaging character writing in <em>The Apothecary Diaries</em>. In a world where every other scene involves a buxom supermodel of a concubine and aesthetic beauty is king, Maomao routinely disparages her appearance. When Maomao strips down to her underwear before Jinshi, she apologizes, saying she'll hide her frail frame as best she can. A slight remark, sure, but it also smacks of her viewing herself as a lowly, unattractive commoner whose appearance anyone of higher social ranking (even a eunuch like Jinshi) would find ugly. Meanwhile, viewers are given a front-row seat to Jinshi's perspective and his awe of her.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, Jinshi, who only views his beauty as a weapon to leverage for political means not yet made clear in the anime, is routinely disarmed by how Maomao is more concerned with the wellbeing of the human underneath his facade by checking his temperature and not fainting into a useless puddle at the sight of him being shirtless. The added cherry on top of this episode is Maomao explicitly spelling out that she <a href="https://twitter.com/dailykusuriya/status/1905670019855405331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perceives Jinshi as a person</a> and not an object to gawk at or some political figure worth smooching up to. This watershed moment development in Jinmao's Shakespearean tale of forbidden romance is all thanks to a frog that hopped in a hole. I, for one, salute the green quadrupedal icon for its service.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gdc-awards-deck-nine-laid-off-developers-life-is-strange-double-exposure"><h3>Deck Nine Takes Back GDC Award From Laid-Off Devs After Failing To Send Anyone To Accept It</h3></a><p>"I keep thinking about all of the opportunities that were denied to us because of our exclusion"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-severance-season-two-review"><h3>Severance Season Two Stuck The Landing</h3></a><p>With big tech trying to automate everything, Severance just keeps feeling more and more relevant</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>One of the main reasons Wccftech was on-site for GDC 2025 this year was to take part in the first hands-on play sessions for 10 Chambers' upcoming cooperative cyberpunk heist title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/den-of-wolves-qa-10-chambers-goes-back-to-heist-roots-with-a-sci-fi-espionage-flavor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Den of Wolves</a>. First revealed at The Game Awards 2023, Ulf Andersson made his directorial debut with the new studio founded from the ashes of his days designing PAYDAY and PAYDAY 2.</p>
<p>Den of Wolves takes the neo-futuristic approach where corporations are more than people and instead run the world. While you won't see Weyland-Yutani or Arasaka Corp logos on city streets, the sentiment is still very much the same with the megacorps that make up Den of Wolves' setting. As mentioned in my first impressions piece on Den of Wolves, the setting 10 Chambers is working with is a corporate haven known as Midway City, sheltered out in the mid-Pacific that operates outside jurisdictional waters or AI intranets. It's here that a new form of data transmission emerges right out of Johnny Mneumonic's playbook: human brains as cold storage.</p>
<p>Of course, it's quite difficult to convey the concept of brain-jacking and stealing secrets from someone's mind in a two-mission preview, but 10 Chambers gave a decent amount of onboarding to get into the flow of the heists. The first mission began with a smaller prep mission to get in and extract some key items for the larger heist. This played out across a small cluster of individual rooms linked together by closed vault doors where teammates need to regroup back before jumping into the next segmented room. It's a formulaic approach that 10 Chambers designed into the core gameplay loop of the studio's previous game (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gtfo-cooperate-or-die-trying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTFO</a>) that may feel like more of an homage to their previous title than something necessary to crack open some vaults. On the bright side, these discrete rooms do reset the enemy alarms, so players can attempt once more to go for a stealthy approach after getting into an accidental gunfight.</p>
<p>This mini-mission in Den of Wolves resulted in some half-dozen rooms with shorter encounters with a handful of guards and armed combatants on our way to gather some loot bags and head to an elevator for extraction under a constant stream of ever-respawning enemies. It's here that I learned the hard way that these prep missions are an all-or-nothing solution, and all four team members needed to walk out alive for the mission progress to count and what we've picked up to carry over. Sadly, I was the first to go down after foolishly trying to make a break for it and grabbing another loot bag on the way out. I had to lie idly by and watch as groups of five or more guards would spawn one at a time and fill the hallway with bullets, thus preventing my team from making a safe extraction, even if down a member.</p>
<p>Our second mission in Den of Wolves certainly went smoothly by comparison. It was a by-the-numbers vault-busting mission to start with the prep phase letting us swap out our primary and secondary weapons as well as choose an additional equipment tool, like a turret or deployable shield. No glimpse at the character or deeper customization options, so I was limited to the one mask and outfit on hand that were pre-selected for me. Given the sheer number of mask options in the first two PAYDAY titles, I do expect Den of Wolves to bring in a wide range of customization options to incentivize players to keep coming back for heists.</p>
<p><iframe title="Den of Wolves Pre-Alpha Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TGYfx7vKpRA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Our team split up into groups of two, each taking one-half of the bank vaults on each side, drilling through a number of vaults to find the sacks of loot we'd then pile up at a massive glass window that would prove to be our one way out. There were a few security guards throughout with more coming in at a drip feed as we made our way to the second part of the mission: diving into our target's brain to gather some crucial data stored in their human brain.</p>
<p>This segment is where Den of Wolves morphs into something I wasn't expecting. In the middle of gunfights, suddenly, our team would be pulled into the mind of the target and forced to run through a 3D parkour gauntlet where reality would rotate on a whim and force our entire squad to endure a running challenge to jump and scramble all the way to an exit point. In those moments, only one of the squad would need to actually be successful, but I wouldn't want to rely on just one person to clear it every time. After a successful dive, we'd be pulled right back into the firefight as if nothing had happened and proceed on as normal with the heist before getting pulled back in another one or two times before extracting all the information we needed from the target's brain.</p>
<p>Coming from GTFO, Den of Wolves feels much more in line with the difficulty curve that heist enjoyers would come to expect from the genre. There are still some obvious growing pains for 10 Chambers to overcome, from creating an enemy AI that's more responsive to flanking maneuvers to gunplay that feels more impactful in each shot. But for those looking for their next heist fix to play with friends online, Ulf Andersson and his team already have a good feel for what their next big move will be. Den of Wolves is currently slated as a PC exclusive without a release date in sight.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/den-of-wolves-preview-welcome-to-the-machine.1151166/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/den-of-wolves-preview-welcome-to-machine<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a little over a year since we last checked in with 10 Chambers, creators of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/gtfo-rundown-80-preview-youre-already-dead" rel="nofollow"><em>GTFO</em></a>. While we’ve been away, they’ve been hard at work on their next project – <em>Den of Wolves</em>, an all-new co-op shooter that calls back to the studio’s heist game roots when their founders worked on projects like the original <em>Payday</em>.</p>

<p>While <em>Den of Wolves</em> was announced towards the end of 2023, we’re only now just getting to see how it’s shaped up in the time since then. 10 Chambers has called it the game they “must make”, and all of this is coming together through gameplay, its themes, and design philosophies.</p>

<p><em>Den of Wolves</em> is set in a dystopian near-future place called Midway City – one controlled by corporations, and where the player will work as a criminal for hire as they engage in industrial espionage, sabotage, and assassinations to help rival companies.</p>

<p>Much of <em>Den of Wolves</em> centers on traditional first-person gunplay, but there’s also an all-new mechanic called “Dive”, which lets players hack into human neural networks with unique gameplay elements.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-012.jpg?itok=zngtdmHW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-012.jpg?itok=7Nls8EfT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With a focus on strategic planning in play, <em>Den of Wolves</em> blends stealth and action in a way we haven’t quite seen before.</p>

<p>We were able to preview some select missions from <em>Den of Wolves</em>, which still doesn’t have a release date, but will be available on Early Access when it launches in the future. That said, the preview was largely focused on two missions that helped draw up a picture of what players can look forward to in the full release.</p>

<p>For the first part, four of us gathered up together, meeting in a traditional load-out screen where you select weapons and what kind of tools you want to use for the mission. There’s a selection of guns, knives, and other supplies like shields – the latter especially will come in handy later.</p>

<p>So with weapons in hand, the first smaller mission we attempted involved getting some supplies, and a drone that will be important at some point in the future.</p>

<p>A lot of the level design here feels like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/gtfo-review" rel="nofollow"><em>GTFO</em></a> – you’ll go in, take out stationed enemies with stealth or force, and then meet up at scanning points to continue. There are also vaults that can be opened using drill tools, and it’s important to keep an eye on these because they do need to be repaired once in a while as they go.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-001.jpg?itok=M8ELpEMj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-001.jpg?itok=RwOsTElr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The co-op nature of these missions comes into focus here too because you’ll want to coordinate what everyone is doing – especially when there’s some enemies that can detect you with proximity, or when you’re in the middle of scanning and there’s a rush of enemies, you’ll need to take them out efficiently.</p>

<p>Once we’d obtained the drone, it was on to the next, bigger mission we’d get to see in <em>Den of Wolves</em>. For this we actually took a step back in the real world and planned out this mission on a scale map to work out how each of us was going to work during the heist.</p>

<p>Our first idea was to split up. The mission would have us find a set of three keys randomly inside three different vaults. Then we’d meet up and blast some windows out for an eventual escape, whilst also fighting off enemies and then getting to the whole Dive portion of the game.</p>

<p>We gave it a go, and after getting into the vault building through some nefarious means, we executed the plan. Two of us took the upstairs floor, and two of us went to the floor below. While we were starting to collect our keys, however, we came under fire, and the team ended up regrouping but ultimately dying and failing the mission because we weren’t equipped well enough.</p>

<p>But <em>Den of Wolves</em> encourages trying again, so that we did, and this time we decided to go around to each vault as the whole lot of us, break down those vaults and get the keys quickly. We also grabbed enough shields in the load-out screen to get us through some tough firefights.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-006.jpg?itok=1p9AMfGm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/den-of-wolves-screenshot-006.jpg?itok=MYQUmRTZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Den of Wolves</em>’ unique mechanic, the Dive system, came into play during the part of the mission where we had to hold our ground. This neural link counts down three separate times, and all four of us are seemingly transported into a virtual world where the goal is to get to the end.</p>

<p>It’s not as easy as going from point A to point B, however. The gravity is abnormal, and perspective can change after a single jump. There’s platforming too, and it can get tricky to time with all of that considered.</p>

<p>There is a bit of leniency, though, as only one person needs to scan in at the end of the map. There is a countdown, so you can’t stay in there forever.</p>

<p>It’s all fairly hectic and again, it’s why communicating with your team can be the difference between success and failure. We did manage to complete the mission, and it really did feel like the perfect taste of what’s to come in <em>Den of Wolves</em>.</p>

<p>For those looking for a deep co-op challenge or just want to have fun with some heist gameplay, it’s certainly one to watch, whenever it gets around to releasing.</p>

Flash forward to today and that<em> Fallen Order </em>sequel, <em>Jedi:</em> <em>Survivor</em>, launched in 2023. Meanwhile,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-fps-respawn-canceled-cuts-layoffs-ea-1851295478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-fps-respawn-canceled-cuts-layoffs-ea-1851295478"> the <em>Star Wars</em> FPS was canceled</a></span>. However, we’ve not heard much about the strategy game. Now, thanks to some leaked screenshots, we have a better idea of what to expect. I hope you like <em>XCOM</em>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mp1st.com/news/respawn-bit-reactors-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-leaked&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mp1st.com/news/respawn-bit-reactors-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-leaked" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As first reported by <em>MP1st</em></a></span>, a Bit Reactor artist shared some screenshots of the upcoming<em> Star Wars</em> game via their online portfolio. The screenshots indicate that Bit Reactor’s  game is known internally as <em>Star Wars Bruno. </em></p><figure id="" data-id="151f2ef84f56471359bdb827d7d47c92" data-recommend-id="image://151f2ef84f56471359bdb827d7d47c92" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Lucasfilm / MP1st / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="151f2ef84f56471359bdb827d7d47c92" data-recommend-id="image://151f2ef84f56471359bdb827d7d47c92" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The screenshots are dated to 2023, so it’s very likely that Project <em>Bruno </em>looks different in 2025. Still, based on the screenshots it appears that <em>Bruno </em>is heavily inspired by <em>XCOM</em>. In the screenshots we can see characters like Bo Katan taking cover while aiming at an enemy. Above that enemy’s head is a hit chance percentage. Another screenshot shows two characters entering “overwatch,” aka that mode in <em>XCOM </em>where your soldiers take out any alien that enters their line of sight.</p><p>Of course, it’s possible that two years later <em>Bruno</em> has changed a lot. But I’d bet a few of my Lego <em>Star Wars</em> ships that the upcoming game is still very <em>XCOM</em>-influenced.

It ain’t shocking that their first big <em>Star Wars</em> game is similar to <em>XCOM</em>. And I’m excited about that. I’ve grown tired of every new<em> Star Wars </em>game being a shooter or a third-person action thing. We deserve a<em> Star Wars</em> turn-based tactics game.</p><p> We won’t have to wait long to see more about this upcoming Bit Reactor <em>Star Wars</em> game, as Lucasfilm has confirmed that it will reveal the project on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-celebration-japan-2025-panel-schedule&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-celebration-japan-2025-panel-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 19 during<em> Star Wars</em> Celebration 2025.</a></span> </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
