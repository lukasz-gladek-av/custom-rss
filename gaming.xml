                <p dir="ltr">Persona 3 Reload launched on PS5, Xbox, and PC last year, and soon the remake of the beloved JRPG is making the jump to Switch 2. Persona 3 Reload launches on Switch 2 on October 23, and preorders are now live. So far, publisher Sega has announced a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FKNJHYR9?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$60 physical standard edition</a> and a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/persona-3-reload-digital-premium-edition-switch-2/?srsltid=AfmBOoo0uo0oq1kFopQ6-tss6FWwzXgKeIW3pCktHJP7k0MxapInHaEY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$90 Digital Premium Edition</a>, which includes a selection of extra DLC content. Preordering either gets you some extra in-game music tracks as a bonus.</p><p dir="ltr">While both Switch 2 editions appear to include identical content to the PS5, Xbox, and PC versions that launched last year, there are some notable differences to keep in mind. First, <strong>Persona 3 Reload's physical Switch 2 release is a Game Key-Card</strong>--which means it doesn't include the game data on the cartridge, and instead works as physical DRM that lets you download the digital version to your console.</p><p dir="ltr">The other potential difference is its technical performance. Atlus has not confirmed the Switch 2 version's performance metrics, but based on trailer footage, it appears Persona 3 Reload will run at 30fps on Nintendo's new console, whereas it runs at 60fps on all other platforms. It's possible the final release could run at higher framerates than what's been shown, but for now, it's looking like the Switch 2 version could lag behind the others. Nevertheless, those who plan to preorder Persona 3 Reload on Switch can secure their copy at multiple online retailers.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Persona 3 Reload Preorder Bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545008-psrswitch2pre.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545008" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545008-psrswitch2pre.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545008"></a><figcaption>Persona 4 Golden BGM Set in Persona 3 Reload </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545008-psrswitch2pre.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Preordering any version of Persona 3 Reload unlocks access to the Persona 4 Golden BGM Set, which lets you swap select in-game music with tracks from Persona 4 Golden.

Compared to the original game, Reload features updated graphics and soundtrack, an overhauled UI, a re-recorded soundtrack, and an all-new voice cast. It also introduces new characters and story content, as well as major gameplay changes that make it an easier game overall compared to the previous versions of Persona 3.</p><p dir="ltr">One notable omission from both Switch 2 versions of Persona 3 Reload is the Episode Aigis DLC expansion, which incorporates post-game content from the Persona 3 FES version on PS2 into the new remake. Sega has confirmed that Episode Aigis will be available as a separate $35 purchase via the Nintendo eShop after launch--which follows the same release schedule as the PS5, Xbox, and PC versions--though the exact date has not been confirmed.</p><h2 dir="ltr">More Persona 3 Reload and Persona 3 Portable Deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545020-portableb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545020" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545020-portableb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545020"></a><figcaption>Persona 3 Portable</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545020-portableb.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If the Game Key-Card and potential technical downgrades have you concerned--or you simply don't want to wait for the Switch 2 version--Amazon is discounting the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGFCC193?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 version of Persona 3 Reload to just $20</a></strong> (was $70). That matches the lowest price ever for the game. You can also grab the game for <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Persona+3+Reload%27s+Switch+2+Version+Is+Yet+Another+Game+Key-Card+Release&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-08-06+08%3A49%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-06+14%3A44%3A52&amp;fnarticle_id=6533737&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fpersona-3-reload&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fpersona-3-reload-switch-2-preorder-guide%2F1100-6533737%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">just $28.69 (was $70) on PC at Fanatical</a>.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting that another version of Persona 3 is available on Switch 2 (and other platforms). Sega brought Persona 3 Portable--which is itself an overhauled version of the game that launched on PSP in 2010 in North America--over to Switch, PS4, Xbox, and PC in 2023. While it doesn't have a dedicated Switch 2 version, the Switch version is playable on the new iteration of the hybrid console. Persona 3 Portable differs from both the PS2 and Reload versions of the game in significant ways, offering "Visual Novel-style" cutscenes and overworld exploration, rather than the full 3D cutscenes and city environments of the other releases. However, the Tartarus dungeon crawling and combat remain largely the same as the PS2 version--though it was notable for being the first version of Persona 3 to allow for full control over your party during battle.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the more limited presentation, Persona 3 Portable is the only version of the game to include the option to play as a female version of the protagonist, complete with her own unique story content and social links to explore. If you're curious to check out Portable's unique content, or want to experience a more challenging version of Persona 3's gameplay loop, you can pick it up via the Nintendo eShop. Limited Run games ran a small physical printing for the game, though <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Persona-Portable-Nintendo-Switch-Limited-Run/dp/B0CT6LDJGC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">most copies sell for well over $100 these days</a>. Persona 3 Portable is also available digitally on PS5, Xbox, and PC--and PC players can even grab it for <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Persona+3+Reload%27s+Switch+2+Version+Is+Yet+Another+Game+Key-Card+Release&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-08-06+08%3A49%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-06+14%3A44%3A52&amp;fnarticle_id=6533737&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fpersona-3-portable&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fpersona-3-reload-switch-2-preorder-guide%2F1100-6533737%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$14.39 (was $20) right now via Fanatical</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">McFarlane Toys Elite Edition - Persona 3 Reload: The Protagonist Figure Preorder</h2><h3 dir="ltr">$60 | Releases January 1, 2026</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545024-p3rfigure.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545024" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545024-p3rfigure.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545024"></a><figcaption>McFarlane Toys Elite Edition - Persona 3 Reload: The Protagonist Figure</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545024-p3rfigure.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Persona 3 fans will also want to check out this upcoming figure of the game's protagonist from McFarlane Toys' new Elite Edition product line.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Madden 25 supported crossplay, but let’s see if EA decided to bring the feature back for Madden 26.</p>



<p>Several game modes were overhauled for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-launches-on-august-14-first-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a>. In&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-franchise-deep-dive-shows-new-coaching-updates-gameplan-changes-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Franchise</a>, some of the significant new changes include coach archetypes, weekly playsheet updates, a new weekly highlights show, and more. Superstar added Game Day Beats, Sphere of Influence, and Career Chapters, which challenge you to complete specific objectives and build relationships off the field. </p>



<p>As for Ultimate Team, EA promised more content than before post-launch, and the solo experience has been overhauled. Let’s take a look at if these game modes support crossplay. </p>



<h2 id="h-does-madden-26-have-crossplay">Does Madden 26 Have Crossplay?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Crossplay returns in Madden 26. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Madden supports&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-26/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossplay</a>&nbsp;between PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>and PC</strong>, <strong>meaning it is not a feature for the Nintendo Switch 2. </strong></p>



<p>In addition, this is the first year that Madden 26 will not be available on last-gen consoles, so that means crossplay is not necessary. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-crossplay-in-madden-26">How to Use Crossplay in Madden 26 </h2>



<p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use crossplay.</p>



<ol>
<li>Open the&nbsp;<strong>EA Connect menu</strong>&nbsp;in Madden 26. </li>



<li>Navigate to the&nbsp;<strong>Player Search</strong>&nbsp;tab.</li>



<li>Search for a player using their&nbsp;<strong>EA Identification number</strong>&nbsp;or by using their&nbsp;<strong>platform identifier</strong>&nbsp;(Xbox Series X|S gamertag or PSN ID).</li>



<li>Invite them to a game or Dynasty save.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-which-madden-26-modes-support-crossplay">Which Madden 26 Modes Support Crossplay?</h2>



<p><strong>In Madden 26, you can play cross-platform in online Head-to-Head, Franchise, Ultimate Team, Superstar KO, and Superstar Showdown.</strong></p>



<p>In Ultimate Team, the Auction House does not support crossplay. As a result, PlayStation 5 players can only purchase cards from listings on the same console and vice versa. This might make cards more expensive, as there will be less supply and more demand because it doesn’t account for the entire player base.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-turn-crossplay-off-in-madden-26">Can You Turn Crossplay Off in Madden 26?</h2>



<p><strong>Crossplay is enabled by default, but you can opt out, regardless of which platform you are on.</strong></p>



<p>For players who opt in to cross-play, any leaderboard in any mode that supports cross-play will be a global leaderboard that includes players from all supported platforms. Players who opt out of cross-play will only see leaderboards for players on their own platform.</p>



<p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to turn off crossplay.</p>



<h3 id="h-xbox-series-x-s">Xbox Series X|S</h3>



<ol>
<li>Go to your&nbsp;<strong>Xbox</strong>&nbsp;<strong>settings</strong>.</li>



<li>Scroll to&nbsp;<strong>Account&nbsp;</strong>and click on&nbsp;<strong>Privacy and Online Safety</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Xbox Live Privacy</strong>.</li>



<li>Select&nbsp;<strong>View Details</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Customise</strong>.</li>



<li>Choose&nbsp;<strong>Communications</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Multiplayer</strong>.</li>



<li>Change “You can play with people outside of Xbox Live” to&nbsp;<strong>block</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="h-playstation-5">PlayStation 5</h3>



<ol>
<li>Go to the In-game&nbsp;<strong>Settings tab</strong>.</li>



<li>Select<strong>&nbsp;Gameplay Settings</strong>.</li>



<li>Toggle the crossplay option to off.</li>
</ol>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most exciting games to watch at Evo 2025 was Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fatal-fury-pros-dramatic-reaction-to-losing-at-evo-2025-goes-viral-but-it-was-actually-10-years-in-the-making">From KojiKOG's memeworthy and dramatic reaction to his loss in top 8</a>, to the incredible grand finals betwen Go1 and ET, and all of the exciting moments in between. It was a great reminder of how much fun the game can be. While I wasn't able to talk to anyone from SNK at the actual show itself, Producer Yasuyuki Oda and Animator Masari Obari were kind enough to answer several questions of mine via email relating to the release of Ken in City of the Wolves and a few other topics that I felt would be of great interest to fans of SNK and fighting games in general.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One of the biggest surprises to me once I got my hands on with Ken is how similar to his SF6 counterpart he is, despite this being a completely different game. Can you talk a little bit about some of the challenges involving taking a beloved character from one series and making them fit under a whole new set of rules and mechanics?</strong><br>
<strong>Yasayuki Oda, Lead Producer on Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves:</strong> The biggest initial concern for us was finding how to bring Ken into the Fatal Fury gameplay system and world without compromising his identity as a character. Our development team has so many people that are passionate about the Street Fighter franchise, and I think their love and dedication to the series really shined through in all the little details we worked on for Ken. We slowly worked out over time how to incorporate Ken’s fast speed and flashy flame-based attacks into the system of City of the Wolves, constantly asking ourselves “What was missing?”, “What could we improve on?”, “What were Ken’s strengths and where could we leverage that?” After much repeated trial and error, this version of Ken finally took form. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ken is a character that’s always been very strong in Street Fighter 6, thanks to being able to convert most regular hits on block to a Jinrai Kick that forces some risky decision making on defense, a plus on block gap closer in his heavy dragonlash kick, on top of just having really good neutral buttons and a balanced tool kit. Were you ever concerned that some of these elements might make him a bit too strong in Fatal Fury?</strong><br>
<strong>Oda</strong>: As you said, bringing Ken over the same way he is in Street Fighter 6 would undoubtedly make him a strong character in City of the Wolves. Of course, we had to make careful adjustments as we adapted him to the game. Integrating mechanics like Braking and REV Accel were challenging, but I think we were able to highlight what makes Ken special while also giving fans a chance to experience a different playstyle within the systems of City of the Wolves. We’re looking forward to seeing what fans think and how they engage with this version of Ken. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>With Terry and Mai appearing in Street Fighter 6, and now Ken, and later Chun-Li coming to Fatal Fury, do you have any interest in working together with Capcom once again for another entry in the Capcom vs SNK series? Or is that a far off dream?</strong></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p><strong>That would be something, wouldn't it?</strong></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Oda:</strong> That would be something, wouldn’t it? However, there is nothing I can talk about at this moment. We are always happy to receive questions like this because it shows how enthusiastic the fans are for another Capcom vs. SNK. It’s a great source of motivation for us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How do you feel overall about guest characters in fighting games? Do you think it’s a healthy trend for the genre, and do you think we might see more in future SNK games, or even in future updates of Fatal Fury?</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Oda:</strong> I think it’s a great trend. Of course, it is important to respect the story and world of other games, but the introduction of guest characters has great potential for the future of fighting games to create new “chemical reactions.” That is to say, it can lead to unexpected outcomes and birth something new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for City of the Wolves, there are still characters we need to bring back before we start thinking about more guest characters. Please rest assured that we are putting all of our focus on that right now. Even after Mr. Big releases, there are still many new characters and new aspects of the game we are working on, so please look forward to them!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I know she’s still a bit of a ways off, and we’ve got Joe coming first, but can you share any details about Chun-Li’s appearance in Fatal Fury? Will it be similar to the approach of Ken, in that you’re looking to her iteration in Street Fighter 6 as a primary source of inspiration?</strong></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We have a few surprises and finer details we're planning to add. We're looking to make this version of Chun-Li a culmination of her past iterations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Oda:</strong> We are using her SF6 version as a base, but since many of our staff are fans of the entire Street Fighter series, we have a few surprises and finer details we’re planning to add. We’re looking to make this version of Chun-Li, like Ken, a culmination of all her past iterations, so please look forward to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>For Obari-san, what was it like getting to create the animations for such an iconic character that’s outside of the world of SNK, like Ken. Were there any kinds of signature touches you felt like you were able to add, or did you try to keep things as close to the source as possible? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Masami Obari, Animator on Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves:</strong> First of all, I would like to say that it was a great honor to work on this project. I am extremely grateful to Capcom for this opportunity. As for the original elements, I would say the most work went into designing these characters in my style. I’d like to call it Bari-Ken! (Haha). It was extremely fun to draw Ken within the style and animation of the Fatal Fury anime.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are there any dream crossovers that you’d like to work on, either within the realm of fighting games or outside of it? </strong></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p><strong>I would be extremely happy to see a collaboration with a real pro wrestler. </strong></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Obari</strong>: I’m a huge pro wrestling fan, so I would be extremely happy to see a collaboration with a real pro wrestler. In terms of fighting games, I would be excited to see a crossover with Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer, a game I was originally in charge of the story and character design!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And finally, canonically, who do you think would win in a fight between Ken and Terry?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Obari:</strong> To be honest with you, I think Terry would win. I think they are evenly matched in terms of strength, but Terry is carrying a lot on his shoulders, and his will is strong because of that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, as a director of the anime, I would prefer not to decide and have the two work together to fight a common enemy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Last week, Electronic Arts and Battlefield Studios held a big <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190?utm_source=kotaku.com&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=share">multiplayer reveal event in Los Angeles</a>. While there, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">I got to go hands-on with the online military shooter</a> for a few hours and learned a lot about the game. And since then, EA has done interviews and shared more information about the highly anticipated sequel, which is set to arrive in a few months. There’s also a big open beta launching later this week that will go for a few weekends.</p> <p>So yeah, there’s a lot of<a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-guarantees-battlefield-6-will-run-at-60fps-or-more-on-all-platforms-2000614503"><em> Battlefield 6 </em>information flying around out there</a>. To help you out, I’ve grabbed seven pieces of info and cataloged them here for your convenience. All I ask in return is that if you see me on the battlefield, don’t snipe me right away. Please? Anyway, here are seven new pieces of info we’ve learned about <em>Battlefield 6</em> over the last few days.</p> <h2><strong>When does the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta start?</strong></h2> <p>EA has split the <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> open beta into three sessions. The first starts on Thursday, August 7, and runs until August 9. But you’ll need an early access code to play during this first window. Does that mean this is no longer an “open” beta? I’d say so, but whatever. Then, from August 9 until August 10, anyone who has downloaded the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta can start playing, with or without a code. The beta will wrap up early that Monday and then go live again on Thursday, August 14. This third session is also completely open and will end in the early morning hours on August 17.&nbsp; The <em>BF6</em> beta will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S and can be pre-loaded now.</p>

 <p>Here’s a full schedule courtesy of EA and Battlefield Studios:</p> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p><em>Battlefield 6</em> early access beta</p> <ul> <li>From Thursday, Aug. 7 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST to Saturday, Aug. 9 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST</li> </ul> </blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><em>BF6</em> Open beta – first weekend</p> <ul> <li>From Saturday, Aug. 9 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST to Monday, Aug. 10 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST</li> </ul> </blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><em>BF6</em> Open beta – second (final) weekend</p></blockquote> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p>From Thursday, Aug.14 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST to Sunday, Aug. 17 @ 1am PDT / 4am EDT / 9am BST</p></blockquote> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em> will feature bots to help fill servers</strong></h2> <p>Battlefield Studios and EA have confirmed that matches in <em>Battlefield 6</em> can include bots if there aren’t enough active players in the server. These bots will be replaced as more players join and will only return if people leave early. <em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;development director <a href="https://gnn.gamer.com.tw/detail.php?sn=289987">Anna Narrevik explained in a recent interview</a> that they have designed the game to “allow as many players as possible to play the game at the same time.” But when there are gaps, the bots will show up to help out.</p> <p>I actually played against some bots during the <em>Battlefield 6</em> reveal event’s afterparty. They were pretty stupid, but could revive people and take points, so they weren’t completely worthless, and having them around did make the battle feel more alive and larger in scale. I’ll be curious to see how often I run into bots when playing certain modes in the game once it’s out.</p> <h2><strong>The game will use some skill-based matchmaking</strong></h2> <p>Yes, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-matchmaking-will-include-sbmm-among-other-things-like-ping-location-and-server-availability"><em>BF6</em> will partially use skill-based matchmaking</a> to place players into different servers and matches. But, before you grab a pitchfork and riot or throw a party in celebration, EA wants people to know that a player’s skill is just one of many variables used during <em>BF6</em>‘s matchmaking process. During a Q&amp;A at the event, <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1952011658143924686">as further reported by <em>CharlieIntel</em></a>, <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s devs confirmed that numerous factors play a role in matchmaking. These include a player’s ping, location, what servers are available at that moment, and yes, skill factor.</p>

 <p>You might not think much about that, but for some players, skill-based matchmaking has become a dirty word, as they believe it makes shooters less fun as you are always matched up with people as good or better than you. Others think it keeps things balanced and more enjoyable. To me, it sounds like EA isn’t going to keep experts playing experts exclusively, but instead will try to keep teams balanced, something the series has done for a long time. So, until <em>Battlefield 6</em> is out, I think people can chill.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield 6 Maps, Modes &amp; Portal" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/92CHDiFW0wA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2><strong>There won’t be a traditional server browser in <em>Battlefield 6</em></strong></h2> <p>EA has confirmed that when <em>Battlefield 6</em> launches, it won’t include a traditional server browser. This is a feature that has been included in most <em>Battlefield</em> games and lets players search for specific servers running maps or modes they want to play while avoiding the stuff they don’t like. Server browsers can also run specific rules and use moderators to control griefing while developing a community around them.</p>

 <p>Instead, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-a-server-browser-but-there-is-a-catch/1100-6533674/"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s server browser</a> will be included in Portal, a part of the game that will operate like Forge in <em>Halo</em> and let players make their own experiences, maps, and game modes. So it sounds like you’ll only be able to access community-created modes and experiences using this server browser and not official EA servers running vanilla maps and games.&nbsp; Alexia Christofi, a producer on <em>BF6</em>, <a href="https://x.com/Lex_mate/status/1951898828669395394">tweeted about the server browser</a> after the reveal event, saying that community-created modes can “award full XP” and confirming that the browser “will be front and center in our main menu, not hidden.” It’ll feature a filter, too. The question is how persistent servers will be and whether more traditional <em>BF</em> experiences will be a part of it, or if folks looking to play conquest have to rely solely on matchmaking. EA says more info is coming soon. Hopefully, that will clear things up.</p> <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em> on PC will require Secure Boot</h2> <p><a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/secure-boot-information">Battlefield Studios has also confirmed that its upcoming military shooter will require Secure Boot on PC</a>. This is a newer way to try and stop cheaters from playing the game and malicious software from booting on your Windows 10 or 11 PC. While Secure Boot can be effective at stopping cheaters and bad actors, it can also cause a lot of headaches for users who have to upgrade older machines to support the feature. It is also prone to failure or causing other PC problems, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1mhpu0t/secure_boot_is_a_requirement_to_play_battlefield/">something you can spot in Reddit threads</a> with people asking for help getting the open beta launcher to load on their Windows PC.</p>

 <p>“Requiring Secure Boot provides us with features that we can leverage against cheats that attempt to infiltrate during the Windows boot process,” said EA in a blog about requiring the feature. “It also lets the Battlefield Positive Play team use its own features and related dependent security features like TPM to combat other forms of cheating, the most relevant of which include: kernel-level cheats and toolkits, memory manipulation, spoofing, hardware ID manipulation, virtual machines…” and other anti-cheat tools.&nbsp; While that’s all very true, its presence may still be a dealbreaker for some. And the worst part is that cheaters can still bypass Secure Boot. This won’t be a feature on consoles, which are closed systems with tighter platform control.</p> <h2><strong>All the maps that will be available in <em>Battlefield 6</em> at launch</strong></h2> <p>During the big reveal event, EA listed all nine maps that will be available in <em>Battlefield 6</em> when it launches later this year. Here’s the list:</p> <ul> <li>Siege of Cairo</li> <li>Iberian Offensive</li> <li>Liberation Peak</li> <li>Empire State</li> <li>Operation Firestorm</li> <li>Saints Quarter</li> <li>New Sobek City</li> <li>Mirak Valley</li> <li>Manhattan Bridge</li> </ul> <p>And yes, Operation Firestorm is a returning classic from <em>Battlefield 3</em>. EA has confirmed that it will bring back more classic maps in the future based on player feedback and requests. Also, EA confirmed that all modes are playable on all maps, as every level in <em>BF6</em> can scale up or down to better fit the selected mode. So if you play deathmatch on Empire State—a map set in NYC—you’ll play in a smaller section of the map designed for that mode. But if you return to the NYC-based map later and play conquest, you’ll get to explore the whole thing as it will be opened up more for modes that demand more real estate. So in a sense, you really have more than nine maps in <em>BF6</em>. What a deal!</p> <p><strong>When does <em>Battlefield 6</em> launch? How much is it? And what platforms?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>During last week’s <em>Battlefield 6</em> multiplayer reveal, EA and Battlefield Studios confirmed the launch date for the game, as well price and platforms. <em>Battlefield 6</em> will arrive on October 10. There is no paid early access window. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-price-70-80-ea-preorder-black-ops-7-1851787292">The game will cost $70</a>, though you can buy a fancier version for $100.&nbsp; And <em>BF6</em> will be available on PS5, PS5 Pro, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first-person shooter world is a diverse one populated by so many games, many of which boast a competitive scene that feeds into the wider esports ecosystem. From VALORANT to Counter-Strike, Apex Legends to Rainbow Six, and Call of Duty to Overwatch, first-person shooters are ten a penny these days.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, a former Counter-Strike pro player took a dive into the spread of games on the market, ranking them by how tough they are to master, from the perspective of a successful esports athlete.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-pretty-easy">‘It’s Pretty Easy’</h2>



<p>Fredrik ‘roeJ’ Jorgensen sat down for a lengthy interview ahead of the <a href="https://thunderpick.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Thunderpick</a> World Championship to review his career and sum up the state of the industry. Jorgensen started competing professionally in 2017 and retired earlier this year, but not before claiming more than $300,000 in winnings.</p>



<p>He revealed in his interview that he was earning around $8,000 a month at ‘his peak’, even though his team wasn’t qualifying for many major tournaments or sizeable events.</p>



<p>When the conversation turned to which games are the hardest to master, Jorgensen offered a breakdown of the top seven titles put to him, with <strong>only one </strong>being something other than a first-person shooter: Fortnite.</p>



<p>According to Jorgensen, the toughest first-person shooter to master is Apex Legends:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Apex Legends is pretty hard to be honest. I think it’s like one of those battle royale games if you’re not good at the game or you don’t really understand what’s going on, I think you’re just gonna get killed instantly and you just spend your time flying down.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the other end of Jorgensen’s scale sat Call of Duty, one of the oldest and most popular first-person shooter franchises in the world:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When I think about Call of Duty, I think about Modern Warfare 2, where you just go in and you just play a team deathmatch and you just basically have to kill and you respawn and repeat.&nbsp; I think that’s one of the easiest games you can play.</p>



<p>Obviously, actually killing people is probably a bit harder, but just, you know, the sheer mechanics of the game is pretty straightforward. So, I say Call of Duty on that one. <strong>It’s pretty easy.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Counter-Strike, which was the game that put Jorgensen on the map, came in just two spots beneath Call of Duty on the scale, beaten in the toughness stakes by Rainbow Six Siege.</p>



<p>Do you agree with roeJ that Call of Duty is the easiest shooter to get good at? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt Red has announced a new <em>Witcher</em> board game. This new entry, <em>The Witcher: Legacy</em>, will be handled by Go On Board, building upon the foundation of their past experience with the license to bring a new narrative-focused board game experience.</p>

<h2><em>The Witcher: Legacy</em> Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>On its official <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/go-on-board/the-witcher-legacy" rel="nofollow">Gamefound campaign</a> page, Go On Board's own Łukasz Woźniak discusses what players can expect from <em>The Witcher: Legacy </em>board game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-witcher-legacy-miniature-promo-art.jpg?itok=irb7A2iA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-witcher-legacy-miniature-promo-art.jpg?itok=1KKUuYTM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is a story-driven scenario-based experience for one to four players. Each player takes on the role of a witcher from the School of the Wolf after a devastating attack has devastated their home..</p>

<p>Players will battle monsters, train their skills, explore the kingdom of Kedwin, and manage resources, all while tracking down the ones responsible. How will these witchers protect what remains of their legacy? That is for your table to decide. The game's narrative scenarios will feature challenging moral decisions with long-term consequences for your campaign, contributing to its high replayability.</p>

<p>Woźniak also confirms that <em>The Witcher: Legacy</em> will build upon what the design team learned from their last big experience with the franchise, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/witcher-old-world-now-on-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Witcher: Old World</em></a>. This Kickstarter success story is similar to <em>Legacy</em>, in that both are prequels set before the time of Geralt of Rivia and focus on witchers facing down monsters in a hostile environment.</p>

<p><em>The Witcher</em> is one of Poland's most popular fantasy franchises ever. What began as a series of novels swiftly shot to mainstream success with three acclaimed action RPGs designed by CD Projekt Red, several crossovers with <em>Soul Calibur</em> and <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and a popular live-action Netflix adaptation. CD Projekt Red has announced both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-4-official-reveal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Witcher 4</em></a>, featuring new protagonist, Ciri.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the Gamefound campaign for <em>The Witcher: Legacy</em> hasn't gone live. However, you can follow the campaign and receive updates if you are interested in backing the campaign.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bravely-default-hd-switch-2-best-jobs-tiz-agnes-ringabel-edea-2000614612</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/these-are-the-best-jobs-for-each-bravely-default-hd-character.1263870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><i>Bravely Default HD</i> offers nearly limitless team customization thanks to its take on the iconic <i>Final Fantasy </i>job system. Want to have a Monk who can cast healing magic to back up the party? You can. Need a dedicated tank to take the hits while wielding two shields? No problem. Maybe your Black Mage could use swords and heavy armor, it’s all up to you! And as it turns out, there’s a <i>very </i>subtle layer of customization underneath that robust job system which might influence the way you build your party.</p> <p><i>Bravely Default </i>follows four main characters throughout its runtime: Tiz, Agnes, Ringabel, and Edea. Each has slightly different base stats, which <i>technically </i>makes certain characters fit select jobs better than others. It doesn’t make a huge difference, as a character’s power will be predominantly determined by their job and their equipment. Still, stats are stats, and what is an RPG if not an exercise in taking every advantage to make your damage numbers as big as possible? Below you’ll find a breakdown of what stats each character excels in, and what that means for how you should build them.</p> <h2>Each characters’ base stats in Bravely Default</h2> <p>Both <i>Bravely Default </i>on the 3DS and the HD Remake on Switch 2 appear to follow the same rules when it comes to each characters’ stats. Here is what each character excels at:</p>

 <p><b>Edea</b>: Highest STR and VIT of the party.<br> <b>Ringabel</b>: Highest DEX and AGI of the party, though his stats are well rounded. INT is also high.<br> <b>Agnès</b>: Highest INT and MND of the party.<br> <b>Tiz</b>: Highest HP of the party. Has high STR, VIT, and MND</p> <p>What do we make of this information? Well, let’s do another breakdown:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614614" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614614"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614614">© Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><b>1: Edea is a clear candidate for a physical attacker or tank role.<br> </b><b>2: Agnès is your best source of magic damage</b>. She has an edge as a healer too, though I’d personally say the best defense is a good offense.<br> <b>3: Ringabel is your best Thief or Ninja, but he can be a strong magic attacker as well.</b> Ringabel’s naturally high AGI means he’s slightly more likely to attack before your other party members, particularly in the early game.<br> <strong>4: </strong><b>Tiz can be best thought of as a Paladin, even if you don’t need to build him that way</b>. He’s your best healer if Agnes is already spoken for, and your best tank or physical attacker aside from Edea.</p> <p>Tiz only lags behind the party in INT and AGI, making him <i>almost </i>a near mirror image of Ringabel. Which is fitting, as Edea and Agnès are both also opposites in their stat distribution.</p>

 <h2>The best jobs for each character in Bravely Default (through Chapter 1)</h2> <p><b>Take this section with a grain of salt, for reasons we’ll get into below</b>. But if you’re still early enough in the game where these stat differences will be the most noticeable, consider giving each character any of the following jobs:</p> <p><b>Tiz</b>: White Mage, Knight, Merchant, Monk<br> <b>Agnès</b>: Black Mage, White Mage, Time Mage, Thief<br> <b>Ringabel</b>: Thief, Monk, Black Mage, Spell Fencer<br> <b>Edea: </b>Knight, Spell Fencer, Monk, Merchant</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614615" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614615"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614615">© Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Caption: A screenshot of <i>Bravely Default </i>for the Nintendo Switch 2. Tiz, Agnès, and Edea are looking at a Black Knight who has boarded their ship.</p>

 <h2>After the opening hours, don’t limit your job choices to each characters’ role</h2> <p>When you’re still getting your feet wet with the game, your future job choices will likely be determined by the jobs a character has already used. For example, if Agnès is your magic attacker, you’ll likely keep her as a caster so she can seamlessly carry over her spell-slinging prowess to whatever job she equips next. A well balanced party will help a lot early on, but the more jobs you unlock, the more you’ll realize just how the game rewards you for thinking out of the box.</p> <p>Does a party of four black mages sound crazy? Maybe, until you realize the job’s innate Black Resonance ability boosts magic damage for every Black Mage in your party, setting yourself up to potentially nuke bosses into the moon in a single brave-boosted turn. Conversely, you might decide to level up everyone as a Knight so they can learn the Two-Handed ability and tear through random encounters. Heck, if a character masters <i>every </i>job, they can become absolute monsters as a lowly Freelancer thanks to the Late Bloomer ability!</p> <p>All of this is to say that there’s a <i>lot </i>to be gained by experimenting with jobs, even the ones that don’t fit a character’s role. And to restate what was said above, most of a characters’ power will come from their build and not their innate stats. Edea won’t be quite as good of a Black Mage as Agnes, but she won’t feel weak if you decide to build her as one either. So please, <i>please </i>experiment with your job choices as you progress, as you may be surprised by the combos you uncover. And considering just <a href="https://kotaku.com/bravely-default-flying-fairy-switch-2-hd-mini-games-1851784559">how long <i>Bravely Default</i> is</a>, you’ll have plenty of time to level up your party before your journey is over.</p> <hr> <p><i>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</i> is available on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/bravely-default-hd-switch-2-best-jobs-tiz-agnes-ringabel-edea-2000614612]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kadokawa Corporation has recently registered a web domain for Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice Anime. </p>



<p>Talks about a Sekiro anime have been circulating for a very long time; however, the latest development almost seals the deal. The only thing left now is an official announcement, which will also confirm who is involved in the upcoming project. Read more about the Sekiro anime web domain registration below. </p>



<h2 id="h-sekiro-anime-announcement-could-arrive-soon">Sekiro Anime Announcement Could Arrive Soon?</h2>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-web-domain-for-the-long-rumored-sekiro-shadows-die-twice-anime-has-been-registered.1263348/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1953100767453220870" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>), Vestan has posted about the Sekiro Anime web domain registration on the forum. The domain has been registered by Kadokawa Corporation, which is the parent company of FromSoftware, the developers of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. The domain was registered on July 31, 2025, in Japan, and the name has been set as ‘SEKIRO-ANIME.JP’. It will expire on July 31, 2026. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The leaker has also provided more information about the upcoming Sekiro anime. It appears that a studio called Qzil.la, the creators of Hell’s Paradise, is bringing the Sekiro anime to life. As it is a relatively new studio, the anime adaptation is expected to have a low episode count. Moreover, as the domain has been registered, a reveal could arrive “soonish”. However, as this information doesn’t come from an official source, players should take it with a grain of salt. </p>



<p>In other news, FromSoftware is reportedly in “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advanced development</a>” of an unannounced game that is expected to arrive next year. Additionally, Elden Ring’s movie director is likely more skilled at the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-movie-director-better-than-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">than most players</a>. What are your thoughts on a Sekiro anime web domain being registered?

                <p>The most traditional input throughout the lifespan of Battlefield has been a controller. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6 </a>has full support for mouse and keyboard on PC as well as consoles, a majority of the playerbase will head into battle with a controller in their hands. Due to the popularity of controllers, Battlefield 6 offers a wide range of input settings, including some brand-new options that haven't been seen before in the franchise.</p><p>It can get a little daunting trying to go through all of the available controller settings, so if you want to set all of them correctly and head straight into the action, we have you covered. Below, you'll see a list of every major controller setting in Battlefield 6 and what you should be using for those settings.</p><h2>Best controller presets in Battlefield 6</h2><p>For starters, you'll want to head into the "Settings" menu of Battlefield 6, which is done by pressing the cog icon at the top of your screen. Once you're in Settings, go to the Controller section on the left side of the screen.</p><p>This brings you to a large image of your current controller layout. Here, you can choose to "Edit Presets" or "Edit Settings." Choosing to edit your presets allows you to simply go through all six of the available controller schemes and decide what buttons you want assigned for every action in those schemes. You can also "Edit Keybinds" by clicking edit presets, which allows you to change every single keybind within a specific controller scheme individually.</p><p>While you can customize everything to your liking, the simplest way to go about your controller schemes is by using the following presets:</p><ul><li><strong>Controls</strong>: Default</li><li><strong>Buttons</strong>: Alternate</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544943-386bdfb69134c736d1188a83789bd073.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544943" data-ratio="0.558984375" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544943-386bdfb69134c736d1188a83789bd073.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544943"></a><figcaption>The basic controller settings menu in Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544943-386bdfb69134c736d1188a83789bd073.jpg"></figure><p>By going with the "Alternate" buttons preset, you're swapping some key actions on your controller. The Alternate preset makes it so your Melee button is now assigned to B/Circle and your Crouch/Prone button is assigned to the right joystick on the "Soldier" controller scheme. This has always been the most popular way to play first-person shooters, but you can, of course, switch this back to default if that's what you're used to.</p><p>However, you really don't want to switch back to default in the "Vehicles" and "Aircraft" schemes. By swapping these to the "Alternate" preset, you change the left joystick to turn/yaw left and right instead of moving backward and forward. This makes it much easier to control aircraft and ground vehicles in Battlefield 6, and should result in you crashing less.</p><p>The other schemes can also be set to the "Alternate" buttons preset, but they're not as important.</p><p>Once you're done switching your presets, you can now press "Edit Settings," which launches you into an entirely new section of your controller options.</p><h2>Best control settings in Battlefield 6</h2><p>After clicking "Edit Settings," you can click on "Control Settings" in each of the different sections.

                <p>The Battlefield franchise has always been known for its high-quality graphics, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> is no different. From what we've seen so far, PCs will be pushed to their limits, and a high frame rate might be difficult to achieve if you're not using the best graphics settings.</p><p>Fortunately, that's where we come in. We'll be listing off every single one of the PC graphics settings in Battlefield 6 and letting you know what you should set each one to. This will not only give you a great-looking game, but it will also allow you to play at a high FPS and get the most out of your PC.</p><h2>Best graphics settings in Battlefield 6</h2><p>To get started with your graphics settings, go to the main menu screen in Battlefield 6 and click on the cog icon at the top of the screen. From here, click the "Graphics" section on the left side of the screen.</p><p>Here, you'll be able to change around all of the general graphics settings, including choosing what resolution you play at and which monitor Battlefield 6 appears on. These settings are going to be more personal for every player, but you can find a list of our best settings for the general graphics menu below:</p><p><strong>Graphics</strong></p><ul><li>Graphics Quality: Custom</li><li>Brightness: 50-60</li><li>Sharpness: 75</li></ul><p><strong>Camera</strong></p><ul><li>Field of View: 105-110</li><li>Vehicle 3rd Person Field of View: 83</li><li>Weapon Field of View: Wide</li><li>World Motion Blur: 0</li><li>Weapon Motion Blur: 0</li><li>Camera Shake Amount: 20</li><li>Chromatic Aberration: Off</li><li>Vignette: Off</li><li>Film Grain: Off</li></ul><p><strong>Display</strong></p><ul><li>Fullscreen Mode: Borderless or Fullscreen</li><li>Fullscreen Device: Your preferred monitor</li><li>Fullscreen Resolution: Your preferred resolution from the monitor you're using</li><li>Aspect Ratio: Auto</li><li>Refresh Rate: Maximum Hz of your monitor</li><li>Vertical Sync: Off</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544975-fe83912e6fb099ad597a10f9cb79e849.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544975" data-ratio="0.56360078277886" data-width="2555" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544975-fe83912e6fb099ad597a10f9cb79e849.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544975"></a><figcaption>The main graphics settings menu in Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544975-fe83912e6fb099ad597a10f9cb79e849.jpg"></figure><p>There are other sections further down in the graphics menu, but they only relate to your HUD. Change them as you see fit, but they can be left alone for the most part.</p><p>Moving on, if you scroll back up to the Graphics section of the menu, you can click on "GRAPHICS" to modify each individual setting. This allows you to raise or lower the graphical fidelity of Battlefield 6 by changing settings that have a high or low impact on your PC's performance.</p><p>You can see a full list of these settings and what they should be set to below:</p><p><strong>Graphic Settings </strong></p><ul><li>Texture Quality: High</li><li>Texture Filtering: High</li><li>Mesh Quality: Low</li><li>Terrain Quality: Medium</li><li>Undergrowth Quality: Low</li><li>Effects Quality: Low</li><li>Volumetric Quality: Low</li><li>Lighting Quality: Low</li><li>Local Light &amp; Shadow Quality: Low</li><li>Sun Shadow Quality: Low</li><li>Shadow Filtering: PCF</li><li>Reflection Quality: Low</li><li>Screen Space Reflections: Off</li><li>Post Processing Quality: Low</li><li>Screen Space AO &amp; GI: Off</li><li>High Fidelity Objects Amount: Medium</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544976-68cd1e35a19f117f41bbf8a7aa12c02e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544976" data-ratio="0.55660847880299" data-width="2005" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544976-68cd1e35a19f117f41bbf8a7aa12c02e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544976"></a><figcaption>Customizing the individual graphics settings</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544976-68cd1e35a19f117f41bbf8a7aa12c02e.jpg"></figure><p>Naturally, if you want the most frames per second possible, then just set every single setting to its lowest value. Our settings will still give you a decent frame rate, but they also keep your game's graphical fidelity high so you can see objects and enemies more clearly.</p><p>Finally, back out of the "GRAPHICS" settings and look right below the "Brightness" and "Sharpness" settings in the graphics menu. Here, you'll see an option called "ADVANCED." Click on it and you'll be brought to a new menu where you can change your upscaling and other performance options. Look below for the optimal settings in this menu:</p><p><strong>Advanced Settings</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed Resolution Scale: 100</li><li>Frame Rate Limiter: On and set to your maximum refresh rate (160,144, 240, etc.)</li><li>Nvidia Reflex Low Latency: Enabled + Boost</li><li>Upscaling Technique: DLSS for Nvidia users / FSR for AMD users</li><li>Upscaling Quality: Quality for better visuals, Performance/Ultra Performance for the highest FPS</li><li>Nvidia Frame Generation: Off (adds too much input lag)</li><li>Future Frame Rendering: Off</li><li>Performance Overlay: Off</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544977-b736cb8b816eb2eee044551e3d5dc719.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544977" data-ratio="0.56281800391389" data-width="2555" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544977-b736cb8b816eb2eee044551e3d5dc719.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544977"></a><figcaption>Going through the upscaling options in Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544977-b736cb8b816eb2eee044551e3d5dc719.jpg"></figure><p>Your choice of upscaling depends on your graphics card's brand and whether you want to run Battlefield 6 at a native resolution. You can also run Nvidia Frame Generation if you have a capable RTX GPU, but the added input lag is noticeable, so you'll have to decide if the extra frames are worth it.</p><p>With that, we've covered every available graphics setting.

              <p><span>Sometimes you hear about something and realize the trajectory of your life could have completely changed if one thing had happened differently. Or, I guess in this case, two things had happened differently. For years now, there’s been a story circulating online in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>spaces about Nintendo of America allegedly asking Game Freak to give Pikachu, the lovable little yellow guy who would go on to become one of the most prominent pop culture mascots of all time, human-like breasts when bringing </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>over to the west. If that had happened, the world would be different, and I probably wouldn’t have a job here at </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>because I would have likely never been allowed near </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>as a child and gone on to become hyperfixated on the rest of nerd culture. This story has </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1mbg8nc/til_that_when_pok%C3%A9mon_was_being_localised_for_the/"><span>been disputed</span></a><span> because of what some deemed a questionable translation, but Japanese outlet </span><a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/07/29/155531.html"><i><span>Game*Spark</span></i></a><span> went looking and found the original interview and it sounds like, yeah, someone at Nintendo wanted Pikachu to have giant bazongas to appeal to Americans.</span></p> <p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-of-america-really-did-suggest-giving-pikachu-large-feminine-breasts-at-one-point-japanese-media-confirms/"><i><span>Automaton</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> translation breaks down the findings and the translation disputes. The </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180731153121/https:/www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0007/taidan1/page03.html"><span>25-year-old interview</span></a><span> with Pokémon Company CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara includes a story about how Nintendo of America thought that Pikachu and company were “too cute” and might need a redesign to appeal to Americans’ edgy sensibilities. Pikachu’s redesign was described as “a tabby cat with huge breasts,” similar to what you might see in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical </span><i><span>Cats</span></i><span>, but the Japanese word “mune” is used here, which can be used to refer to either pronounced pecs or the presumed mommy milkers, which led to the aforementioned dispute. However, when the interviewer asked if this design was “like those girls who do Pikachu cosplays at anime conventions,” Ishihara said, “Yes, exactly.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Ishihara said that it was an interesting thought experiment and made him appreciate the cultural differences between the Eastern and Western audiences, but he thankfully turned down the design, we got the little yellow guy unchanged, and </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>still became a cultural phenomenon over here. That’s not to say that monster taming franchises can’t also have sexualized designs and be successful. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digmon-story-time-stranger-preview-pokemon-pc-ps5-xbox-1851784677"><i><span>Digimon</span></i></a> <span>has several humanoid monsters like Angemon and Angewomon that appeal to people looking for that, but </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s longevity is tied to how timeless its characters are and how every new generation of kids can jump into it from anywhere. That certainly hasn’t stopped them from creating humanoid Pokémon over the years, but the visual identity of those characters has remained child-appropriate. The franchise already had to weather enough bullshit from people trying to paint it as </span><a href="https://filmschoolrejects.com/pokemon-satanic-panic/"><span>some kind of gateway to evil</span></a><span>. Imagine if it was also having to fight against parents accusing it of trying to corrupt children’s minds with sexual imagery. </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/70p101/til_that_a_40second_sequence_of_james_showing_off/"><span>Good thing that never happened, right</span></a><span>?</span></p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Ending" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9824329e3a075/donkey-kong-bananza-ending.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>From the moment Nintendo revealed Pauline's presence in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, I knew one thing for certain: I was going to be writing a feature on the DK timeline in the next two months.</p>
<p>Look, you know I love Bananza. DK and Pauline have such a wholesome little relationship, I adored hearing the same senile rant from Cranky on each and every layer, and the little nods to the great ape's previous endeavours were perfectly balanced. It felt like a wall-to-wall celebration of all things DK while also serving as an introduction to the modern age of 3D platforming for one of Nintendo's oldest characters.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4tlpnxz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>And then the ending happened. It's a wonderful set piece that I played with the biggest, cheesiest smile on my face, but it, along with the mere presence of a 13-year-old Pauline, throws up a lot of questions about where Bananza sits in the wider canon, and let's be honest here, DK doesn't need that.</p>
<p>If you've stayed with me this far and you think there's a chance I'll make it through the next 800 words without spoiling the end of Donkey Kong Bananza, you are very much mistaken. I'll be talking about the final sequence of Donkey Kong Bananza in depth. Heck, there might even be some screenshots thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>If you don't want that spoiling (and I'd really recommend seeing it fresh for yourself — it's awesome), then wrap up your reading here and only scroll past the following image when you've seen everything for yourself, <strong>as there are major spoilers below</strong>.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Ending" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ece8c9c5bafeb/donkey-kong-bananza-ending.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>3, 2, 1... right, that's it, I'm unpeeling things — <em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where was I? Ah yes, the ending!</p>
<p>The final stage of Donkey Kong Bananza finally sees DK and Pauline get back to the latter's home turf on the surface, which is... New Donk City! Yep, the very one seen in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>. There's some more platforming and a boss fight (I've broken it all down in an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-ending-explained-is-it-a-prequel-to-mario-odyssey">Ending Explained guide</a>, if you need reminding of the deets), but the tl;dr of it is that NDC returns to its rot-free glory, DK returns to the mines — <a href="https://youtu.be/wJO_vIDZn-I?si=_2rCxvy25prEHc_s&amp;t=4">like Steve, he yearns for them</a> — and Pauline gets to live out her dreams of singing in front of the whole city. Hmm.</p>
<p>That last note got under my skin when I first played through the grand finale, and I haven't been able to shake it in the weeks since. This is <em>Pauline</em>. This is <em>New Donk City</em>. This is <em>singing</em>. Nintendo could have played the riff from 'Jump Up, Superstar!' over the entire sequence, and it wouldn't have made it any more obvious that the game is going, "Look, it's just like that 2017 3D Mario game!! See??"</p>
<p>All these threads come together in a great big Odyssey-shaped signpost, actively encouraging us all to think about the prized plumber's previous platforming exploits and start to question where Bananza fits in around it.</p>
<p>And think about it I did. I was so ready for Bananza to end with Pauline saying something like, "You know what my <em>real</em> dream is, DK? To be mayor of this great city!," but it doesn't. Instead, it ends with an image of a very-much-still-13-years-old Pauline singing on the roof of City Hall (after the post-credits missions, that is), and all of those references to her grandma — which she's been banging on about throughout the game, let's not forget — ringing in your ears.</p>

<p>This isn't the Odyssey prequel that I thought it would be, but instead a <em>sequel</em>. Another child in the Pauline family tree (also called 'Pauline', confusingly), learning to love the giant ape that had caused so much drama for her ancestors. <em>Aw</em>.</p>
<p>No! Not "<em>Aw</em>"! This is exactly why I started this piece in the first place. I have put too much thought and energy into a timeline that, let's admit it, is a load of rubbish.</p>
<p>Don't even get me started on Cranky Kong. We all know that this elderly ape is <em>the</em> DK from the original arcade machine (it's even referenced in one of his Bananza speeches), so what's he doing <em>still</em> up and about all these years later? And what about his son, Donkey Kong Jr? Are we just going to assume that vest-wearing chimp faded away as he headed back to his home planet?</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I can get behind a BS timeline. I know the <strong>Zelda</strong> one more than most and actually enjoy slotting things into it. But at least <strong>Hyrule Historia</strong> is based loosely (and I mean <em>loosely</em>) on the games' narrative events and not solely on "how old is this kid now, do you reckon?"</p>
<p>A Donkey Kong timeline — or, casting the net even wider in this instance, a <em>Mario</em> timeline — is a fool's errand right from the jump because there's almost no narrative to hang things on. Nobody is saying "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a> <em>has</em> to come after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/dk_king_of_swing">DK: King of Swing</a> because you can see DK still riding the high of the Jungle Jam Festival".</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Ending" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c11871822b222/donkey-kong-bananza-ending.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And I really want to hammer this home, I <em>love</em> Donkey Kong Bananza, I just don't think that good things necessarily need to be strung up to other good things. I should be relishing in the glow of post-Bananza joy, but instead I'm getting myself wound up over lore that didn't exist until a month ago.</p>
<p>If we're going to keep pretending that the narrative events of DK or Mario matter to the wider pantheon of Nintendo games, at least give us a nicely bound lore book to add to the coffee table. The DK Dictionary? Kong Kompilation? Gorilla Glossary?... I'll work on it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA is kicking off its first public beta for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> tomorrow, and even though the first two days of this weekend's beta is only open to players who were able to grab a code through Twitch or sent out to players that previously signed up to participate in Battlefield Labs, servers for the beta are already starting to fill up, as tens of thousands of players are queued up for the beta ahead of launch.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/tens-of-thousands-of-players-are-queuing-for-the-battlefield-6-beta-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/">VGC</a>, players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mj6s2e/the_hype_is_real/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a> are sharing that the servers have already been maxed out, and there are thousands more waiting in the queue to get in, which means there are thousands who are keeping their devices on and ready, waiting in the game's lobby for the beta to go live tomorrow.</p>



<p>At least for these coming beta weekends, it seems like EA won't need to use <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-include-bots-servers-arent-full-classic-maps-fan-feedback/">bots to fill the game's servers</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">SteamDB</a> is showing thousands of users currently in-game with a peak of 24,879 players earlier today. </p>



<p>Pre-loading the beta has been available to players since <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-preload-now-available-matchmaking-skill/">yesterday</a>, and with thousands already chomping at the bit to try out the next entry in the Battlefield series, it's clear that the caption on the above Reddit post is right. The hype is indeed real, for Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Will it live up to the hype is another question all together. <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october-10-pre-orders-open-two-open-beta-weekends/">Last week's reveal</a> was a very promising show of the new shooter, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto had plenty of positive things to say in his hands-on impressions,</a> saying "<em>this is exactly what I've wanted out of Battlefield multiplayer since the days of Operation Metro and Strike at Karkand. Massive maps with the flow of infantry, tanks, and jets all coordinating in tandem, and the constant chatter of squadmates calling for revives or ammo packs. While I know what I've experience during the multiplayer reveal event is only a small slice of the complete Battlefield 6 package, October 10th can't come soon enough.</em>"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-you-need-to-know-about-getting-three-star-gold-trophies-in-mario-kart-world.1263819/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>What does it take to “beat” the single player Grand Prix and Knockout Tour modes in <i>Mario Kart World</i>? For some, simply finishing Rainbow Road and rolling the credits is enough to call it a day. For others, maybe you want to get gold trophies in every cup on 150cc, or even <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-mirror-mode-unlock-free-roam-1851784857">Mirror Mode</a> if you know how to unlock it. But what if that’s not enough? What if you want bragging rights that well and truly signaled to the world “I’ve <i>conquered</i> this?” That’s what your Star Rank is for.</p> <p>In short, your Star Rank is the extra stars you might see next to your gold trophies in both the single-player Grand Prix and Knockout Tour. The better you did during that particular challenge, the more stars you’ll earn (up to a maximum of three). If it sounds straightforward, that’s because… it kind of is. Still, critical details about this system are never explained in-game, so if you’re looking to earn a three-star rank on every cup in single-player mode, here’s what you need to know.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614605" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614605"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614605">© Nintendo / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>How do you get three stars in Grand Prix in <i>Mario Kart World</i>?</h2> <p>Similar to past <i>Mario Kart </i>games, your star rank in Grand Prix mode depends on your final point tally at the end of the final race. 54 points gets you one star, 57 points gets you two stars, and 60 points gets you the full three stars. To put that in straightforward terms, <b>getting three stars requires finishing first in all four races of a single cup</b>.</p>

 <h2>How do you get a three-star rank in Knockout Tour in <i>Mario Kart World</i>?</h2> <p>Since Knockout Tour is new to <i>Mario Kart World</i>, the rules here are a little different than the series’ standard Grand Prix mode. In lieu of a proper point system, your Star Rank is instead determined by your position when you pass through each of the checkpoints that kicks out the bottom four players from the race. <b>To get three stars in Knockout Tour, you have to be in first when you pass through each of these checkpoints</b>.</p> <p>Yes, that includes the first one, so you’ll have to dash from 24th to 1st fast!</p> <h2>Your Star Rank in a higher difficulty will count as completion for all previous difficulties as well</h2> <p>If you want to get three stars in every cup in Grand Prix and Knockout Tour modes, your first instinct may be to start from 50cc and work your way up from there. After all, you might as well save the hardest stuff for last, right? Well, if you’re confident enough in your skills to pump up the difficulty ASAP, all Star Ranks are retroactive across all previous difficulties. That is to say, if you get three stars in a cup in 150cc, you’ll see your 50cc and 100cc completion appear as three stars as well. Conversely, if you get three stars in 50cc and only one star in 150cc, your previous record won’t be overwritten.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-mirror-mode-unlock-free-roam-1851784857"><b>Mirror Mode</b></a><b> also grants retroactive star rankings</b>. This hasn’t been the case in past <i>Mario Kart </i>games, but a Mirror Mode max Star Rank in <i>Mario Kart World </i>will also carry over to 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc if you haven’t already done so. In other words, if you’re trying to get your bragging rights as fast as possible and you think you’re ready for it, you can immediately start in Mirror Mode.</p> <h2>What do you get for getting three stars in every cup in <i>Mario Kart World</i>?</h2> <p>Nothing! Absolutely nothing!</p> <p>I’ve been calling this a bragging right for a reason. Much like <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-coins-question-marks-outfits-1851784658">most tasks in Free Roam mode</a>, earning a max Star Rank is a challenge that exists for its own sake. This might be disappointing for longtime <i>Kart</i> fans, as previous games would often signify your accomplishment with some kind of reward. But here, you won’t even see a congratulations message for pulling off this feat.</p>

 <h2>Tips for getting three stars in <i>Mario Kart World</i></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614608" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614608"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614608">© Nintendo / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>If you’d like to press on to get a suite of maxed out Star Ranks despite knowing there is no reward attached, here are a few quick tips to propel yourself into first place (usually).</p> <p><b>1: Practice</b>. It sounds obvious, but the more you know which twists and turns are ahead of you on a track, the better equipped you’ll be to blow past the competition without slamming headfirst into a wall. The Time Trial mode comes equipped with ghosts for each track that you can study, and if you’re feeling adventurous <b>you can load the ghost data of whoever holds the world record in a track too.</b></p>

 <p><b>2: Focus on getting coins at the start. </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-coins-vehicles-speed-power-up-unlock-1851785020">The more coins you have, the faster you’ll go</a>. And the faster you’ll go, you’ll… I don’t need to explain why going fast matters in a racing game, right? You can stop going out of your way for coins once you have 10-15, and by the final lap you should focus on cutting tight corners as you approach the finish line.</p> <p><b>3: Prioritize shortcuts</b>. This is especially important for Knockout Tour, as you’ll need to make up a lot of ground to go from 24th to 1st before hitting the first checkpoint. Fortunately, players in a lower place will get better items from item boxes, and the first item you’ll usually get in Knockout Tour is a Mushroom (or something else that boosts your speed). Look for any turns that you can speed right across, and don’t be afraid to hold your item if it means waiting for that right moment.</p>

 <p><b>4: Manage your items</b>. As mentioned above, racers further back will get better items. And if you’re on a tear blazing past the competition with three red shells around you, you might want to use them strategically to specifically target opponents you can’t catch. Alternatively, you might want to hold at second so you don’t get targeted by a Blue Shell. Conversely, once you’re in 1st, the name of the game is defense. Shells and feathers can prevent you from taking a hit from red shells, and the Superhorn can break Blue Shells before they hit you. Try to have at least one defensive item ready at all times.</p> <p><b>5: Be patient. </b>No matter how good you are or how well you race, you can and <i>will </i>fail to get a three-star rank simply because you got hit with the wrong items at the wrong time. After all, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mario-karted">there’s a reason the term “Mario Karted” is common internet slang</a>. It can be incredibly frustrating and defeating when it happens, so just accept that a few bouts of impossibly bad luck are just going to happen and give it a try another time.</p> <p>Remember, this challenge only exists for fun, and you should probably take a break if you’re not enjoying it. Take some time to <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-coin-farming-tips-vehicles-unlock-1851784093">grind coins</a> or <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-clips-stunts-rewind-wall-1851783907">pull off some super cool stunts</a>, and come back to it when you feel ready. Getting three stars wouldn’t be a bragging right if there was nothing to brag about!</p>

Each player controls an interstellar alliance of three unique factions drawn from a pool of 40 distinct options. This creates an asymmetric suite of abilities that informs and influences strategy. Utilizing a selection of multi-use cards, players explore new systems, settle planets, research advanced technologies, and build shiny galactic cruisers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While quick and sharp, the main focus is on executing tough decisions on how to use cards for either long-term benefits or short-term bursts. The inclusion of a solo mode is also a very nice addition that extends the life of the game. </p></div><p id="ace-of-spades"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Ace of Spades">Ace of Spades</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226508"><div id="226508" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ace of Spades</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games"><u>Solo gaming</u></a> is not a new concept, but it’s certainly exploded in recent years. Ace of Spades is the latest noteworthy title in this category, allowing a lone player to utilize a hand of cards to battle progressively tougher bosses. On the surface, it looks a lot like the tabletop version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>, but a closer gander reveals an interesting card game brimming with identity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The wild setting helps as you head to Sweet Haven, Arizona seeking vengeance upon a vile necromancer. This leads to a cemetery where you are confronted by horrific denizens of hell intent on claiming your soul. Best of all, if you get tired of facing these terrors alone, you can call in a partner and play the game in two-player <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> mode. This works surprisingly well, even if the core engine feels more comfortable as a solo endeavor. This is a heavy-metal charged experience with distorted riffs and a thick tracklist of content.</p></div><p id="dying-message-card-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dying Message Card Game">Dying Message Card Game</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226506"><div id="226506" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dying Message Card Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the oddball entry of the list, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">party game</a> for a collection of people where one is ruthlessly murdered and the others attempt to solve the crime. The twist here is that the victim tries to form clues from a randomly dealt allotment of cards. These contain symbols and characters of various types, requiring some creative thinking from the murdered participant. You’re given a few minutes to arrange the clue cards how you’d like, using them in conjunction with several suspect cards placed off to the side. The idea is that in the last moments of life, you’ve done what you can to leave a message for those who find you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After arranging the murder scene, the victim sprawls out on the table capturing their final position at time of death. The ensuing discussion as people try, often in vain, to tease out the meaning of the scene and decipher the clues can be riotous and engaging. Ultimately, the group guesses the murderer and either succeeds or fails. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a quirky design that absolutely requires the right set of people. Acquire the wrong crowd or a misaligned mood and it runs the risk of firing blanks. However, with some performative buy-in and a deductive attitude, Dying Message will hit its mark and result in a tabletop game that is wholly unique. </p></div><p id="high-tide"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="High Tide">High Tide</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226509"><div id="226509" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>High Tide</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Cozy games are all the rage right now. These are designs that present a relaxed experience which is more focused on meditative play and chill vibes over brutish competition. High Tide is the latest to break out in this category, selling out at Gen Con due to its stellar aesthetic and intriguing play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a small game, easily portable and completely unassuming. But it boasts a surprising amount of depth. Tiles are arranged randomly in a grid and players take turns stacking pieces upon ones that are higher. You may only move your own or neutral tiles, however. It teases out just the right level of strategic thought without tipping over into a cerebral grind. High Tide is a neat, novel work that stood out among the swathe of new games.</p></div><p id="lightning-train"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lightning Train">Lightning Train</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226510"><div id="226510" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lightning Train</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of the buzz surrounding Lightning Train is the pedigree of designer Paul Dennen. His previous work, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-imperium-board-game-review"><u>Dune Imperium</u></a>, is a modern classic that has caught on like wildfire in the gaming community. This new release uses a similar concept of bag building as players add various resources to their bag in a strategic bid for developing their company. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The goal is to open train stations and railroad lines across North America, facilitating the delivery of goods to cities in need. The interesting detail is that players can share each other's infrastructure, sending cargo along another participant’s route. Both receive benefits from this cooperation, birthing a more nuanced and fuzzy strategic space. Unlike most games in the train category, Lightning Train is a more approachable design that slots in as a step up from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-board-game-buying-guide-and-expansions">Ticket to Ride</a>.</p></div><p id="the-lord-of-the-rings-fate-of-the-f"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the F">The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226511"><div id="226511" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pandemic-board-game-buying-guide"><u>Pandemic</u></a> has dozens of spinoff games at this point, and The Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship appears to be just another iteration on Matt Leacock’s modern classic. That is not the case. This new design does contain some faint indicators of that previous game’s DNA, but it’s so much more than that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a rich adventure game where players cooperate to take the One Ring to Mount Doom while evading the attention of Sauron. It’s part tower defense, with players recruiting Free World troops to battle invading Orcs and Southrons, and it’s part stealth thriller as Frodo must constantly sneak past armies and Nazgul. This is a tense affair, and it’s far more detailed and thematic than expected. In fact, it barely feels like a Pandemic property at all, which may take some people by surprise. Regardless, this is perhaps the most exciting game I played at Gen Con this year, and I’m enraptured by it.</p></div><p id="nature"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Nature">Nature</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226512"><div id="226512" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nature</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/91jYRn?object_uuid=fb854556-6e2a-4fc7-b3cb-9e9864335368&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0725LRH1W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Evolution</u></a>, the board game that captures the pressures of a dynamic ecosystem and how this influences species, has been wildly successful over the past 10 years of its life. It’s spawned numerous expansions and spinoffs, and may have just found its final state with Nature. This latest version of the system is pared down to a straightforward and approachable core game that retains the interesting card play of its predecessor. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the elements have been simplified, and it’s easier than ever to introduce this game to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">beginners</a> and non-hobbyist of any age. The magic resides in the game’s module system. Multiple add-ons exist that can be inserted to layer on sub-systems for flight, dinosaurs, and environments. This slightly increases the complexity, while boosting the strategic potential. A huge boon is that it changes up the feel of each session, and allows North Star Games to expand this properly infinitely. Nature is poised to have the longest legs of any game in the Evolution line.</p></div><p id="star-wars-battle-of-hoth"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Star Wars: Battle of Hoth">Star Wars: Battle of Hoth</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226513"><div id="226513" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars: Battle of Hoth</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle of Hoth was the most talked about game heading into Gen Con. This was for good reason, as it puts a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games">Star Wars board game</a> spin on the popular <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/27/days-of-wonder-announces-memoir-44-online"><u>Memoir 44 series</u></a> of games. Players take on the role of either the contingent of Imperial AT-ATs and snowtroopers, or the Rebel soldiers holding the line in order to protect the planet’s shield generator. Each takes turns playing cards from their hand to activate one portion of the battlefield, choosing from a selection of units occupying that flank. This restriction of the card system is a hallmark of the Memoir series, forcing tough decisions with only a modicum of rules overhead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">wargame</a> of sorts, it’s also a very streamlined and rules-light design. It’s a dramatic game, full of dice rolling and big moments where units are scattered and lines are broken. The Star Wars backdrop only helps.</p></div><p id="spooktacular"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Spooktacular">Spooktacular</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226514"><div id="226514" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Spooktacular</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">During the 1986 Spooktacular horror film festival, a freak accident occurs involving a lightning strike and a little bit of mystery. This results in dozens of monsters spanning the length of cinematic history being released from their fictional bonds. Now they are free to terrorize the festival goers and wreak havoc.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This dynamite concept is realized through a highly asymmetric yet still smartly restrained system. Players take on the roles of movie monsters animated from the screen, competing to scare and devour guests. Each of the 20 included monsters is unique, featuring its own suite of abilities and cards. Yet, this is not an overstuffed game and the core processes are direct and sensible. The concoction here is magnificent, and this monster mash is full of delight and terror.</p></div><p id="vantage"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Vantage">Vantage</h2></p><div catalogid="e8f12747-5728-4e80-83b6-331bd2f6a37c" id="226515"><div id="226515" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Vantage</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vantage-board-game-review"><u>review of Vantage</u></a>, I declared it as possibly being the top game of 2025. It seems the crowds of Gen Con agreed, as this game was everywhere. This is a fully cooperative adventure where players crash land on an uncharted planet and must navigate its many mysteries in order to fulfill a collective mission. While this was clearly designed in the tradition of modern narrative adventure games, it goes about things its own way, massively improving on the pre-existing approach. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For one, it’s not a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign game</a>. Each individual session has a complete arc, which makes it far more approachable for most groups. It also does away with narrow objectives requiring players head to specific locations. Instead, many of the missions may be fulfilled in numerous ways. This highlights the game’s focus on creativity and freedom, allowing you to wander and explore whatever catches your eye. Finally, the mysteries of the world are special and worthy of the effort required. This is a fantastic game, and it was the closest thing to a singular standout title of the convention. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Charlie Theel is a tabletop games freelancer.

              <p>InXile Entertainment’s next game is the first-person steampunk RPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-xboxs-big-summer-2025-showcase-1851784007"><i>Clockwork Revolution</i></a>. Studio founder Brian Fargo, who’s leading the project, recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjeRn2eA3y4">sat down with YouTuber MrMattyPlays</a> for a deep-dive interview about his long career and his take on current hot topics in the video game industry like generative AI and LLM technology, which the Xbox studio’s parent company is currently investing $80 billion in. Has InXile embraced it in a similar fashion? “For certain things, but but I’m very keen to what are the ethical uses of it?” he said. “I am worried about job loss.”</p> <p>Fargo, whose career in games dates back to the 1980s when he worked on influential role-playing games like&nbsp;<em>The Bard’s Tale&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wasteland</em>, laid out <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-baldurs-gate-3-nier-automata-ai-chatgpt-1851778257">a couple of different use cases</a> he foresees for tools like ChatGPT, but distinguished them from things like using generative AI to plagiarize the creative output of other artists. “These games…we’re close to about the same word count as the Bible, basically, and so that’s a lot of data no human can get in in its head,” he said. “So would I like an LLM to be able to query: ‘How many times did [inaudible] talk?’ ‘How many times have we used this skill?’ Like there’s some things that I would want to query the information to make sure so I see that.”</p> <p>The veteran studio head said he also uses generative AI for inspiration they way he might visit a museum or scroll through people’s Deviant Art pages, but that only commissioned work is used in the actual production process. Other uses Fargo pointed to were cleaning up motion capture footage and potentially voicing quick pickup lines added to a game at the last minute if the actor agrees to it and is paid extra but is otherwise unable to make it into the studio. That part sounds in line <a href="https://kotaku.com/sag-aftra-strike-voice-actor-game-darth-vader-1851784189">with what SAG-AFTRA members settled on</a> in a new contract after months on strike.</p> <p>“Can we use it for, like, mundane tasks that nobody wants to do so the human creativity can soar?” Fargo said. “Well, I think that’s kind of cool. I don’t think anybody wants to do some of these things. Do we really want humans going through checking for punctuation? You know, I mean, I don’t have it doing it right now, but that would seem like I’d rather have those same people going, ‘I have a great idea to to make this scene far better.’ Like that, I’d rather have the minds thinking about the good stuff.”</p>  <p>While the <em>Clockwork Revolution</em> director wasn’t as hypercritical of AI and the hype around it as some game developers have been, he also came off as more cautious than others within Microsoft, including CEO Satya Nadella. Nadella recently boasted that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/29/satya-nadella-says-as-much-as-30percent-of-microsoft-code-is-written-by-ai.html">30 percent</a> of Microsoft code is written by AI, and revealed earlier this year that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-15/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-on-his-ai-efforts-and-openai-partnership">he uses multiple AI assistants</a> to get him through his day. The company is pushing its use in gaming as well, rolling out models that can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/">hallucinate gameplay</a> or watch you play games and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/719668/microsoft-xbox-gaming-copilot-windows-game-bar-beta-test">Google tips for them</a>.

<p>The Black Ops 6 Season 5 update introduces three new multiplayer maps, three new weapons, and adds the final Zombies map for this game. </p>



<p>The star of the show in BO6 Season 5 is the sixth and final Zombies map, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-the-new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-come-out-everything-we-know-about-reckoning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reckoning</a>. Set in the project Janus headquarters, the towers’ systems are on the verge of total failure, and it’s up to the team to stabilize the Aethor Reactors before the Aetherium leak gets out of hand. </p>



<p>Reckoning features a new Wonder Weapon that alters gravity, a new elite enemy, and adds several other surprises. Let’s jump right into what fans can expect. <br></p>

<h3 id="h-new-multiplayer-maps">New Multiplayer Maps</h3>



<p><strong>Runway (6v6)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>A Pantheon mole attempts their escape via the Arzak Provincial Airport. All hell breaks loose as the Rogue Black Ops team pursues one of their final targets. Wreckage and luggage litter the tarmac, flames licking the sides of the terminal and black smoke rising from the fire in the airport control tower.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Exchange (6v6, 2v2)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Rogue Black Ops pursues a mole attempting to strike a deal in a vibrant Avalon marketplace. Crash the party and unleash havoc on this small-sized three-lane map centered around the Deli, its roof adorned with a marble statue of a mythic sea god.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>World Motor Dynasty (W.M.D.) (6v6)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>From its inception as a Nova 6 processing laboratory first introduced in the original Call of Duty: Black Ops, W.M.D. returns in a reimagined form as an Italian luxury car manufacturer in Avalon. Trade the snow of the original map for an overcast day around the Autofiorno plant, using your memories of the prior map to help navigate the larger area of operations.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-multiplayer-mode">New Multiplayer Mode</h3>



<p><strong>Aim High</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Aim high to survive across a variety of game modes — including Team Deathmatch, Domination, Hardpoint, and Kill Confirmed — where headshots land instant eliminations while full body armor minimizes damage dealt anywhere below the neck. As a bonus, this headshot training is likely to hone your talents when unlocking Weapon Camos.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-weapons">New Weapons</h3>



<p><strong>PML 5.5 – LMG (Battle Pass)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Full-auto light machine gun. Fast rate of fire and high lethality offset by low mobility and hefty recoil.</li>



<li>When a rival Operator is holding the trigger down on the PML 5.56, you’ll know, mainly due to the damage and huge ammunition reserves, mitigated somewhat by a lengthy reload.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>ABR A1 – Assault Rifle (Battle Pass)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Three-round burst assault rifle. Good handling and power. Moderate recoil and range. Configurable to full auto.</li>



<li>The iconic Assault Rifle returns! With a similar weapon being a fan-favorite staple of the Black Ops series, the ABR A1 combines a high damage output that can drop enemies in tight three-round bursts with a brief pause in-between, almost fast enough to be called automatic.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Boxing Gloves – Melee (In-Season, Event Reward)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Moderate damage. Fast attack speed. Long range.</li>



<li>Slip on the Boxing Gloves and knock out foes with a swift barrage of jabs and uppercuts.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-attachments">New Attachments</h3>



<p><strong>9mm PM Skull Splitter (Two Attachments, Battle Pass)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Bring the power and precision of a marksman rifle to your favorite pistol with the 9mm PM Skull Splitter Barrel. The Barrel greatly increases damage, especially to the head, reducing rate of fire. Pair with an extended magazine that gives the Operator additional ammo for this weapon at the expense of handling.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>PPSh-41 Helical Magazine (In-Season, Event Reward)</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fire to the beat of your own drum with this SMG attachment that puts other magazines to shame. Manage heat on this high-ammo count magazine that excels at spraying bullets in close and medium ranges.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-5-zombies-update-patch-notes">Black Ops 6 Season 5 Zombies Update Patch Notes</h2>



<h3 id="h-new-map-reckoning">New Map: Reckoning</h3>



<p>Looming over the once-sleepy settlement of Liberty Falls, the Project Janus Headquarters—three edifices known locally as Janus Towers— now teeters on the verge of collapse.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-enemies">New Enemies</h3>



<p><strong>Uber Klaus + Uber Klaus Core</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>The secret Research and Development program of Project Janus appears to have been more evolved than originally thought, developing many more robots in the Klaus Assembly Lab than first anticipated. The greatest of these threats is the Uber Klaus – a murderous automaton encased in a toughened, bulky exoskeleton – that maintains a cocky attitude, lethal efficiency, and super strength, all directed at newly-programmed threats.</li>



<li>Enemy takedown tactics are unknown at this point, though combat is likely to be focused on disrupting the Uber Klaus form’s heavy shielding and avoiding its melee attacks. Once the exoskeleton is broken, the Uber Klaus Core will eject, revealing its second deadly form.</li>



<li>The Uber Klaus Core increases in agility, sacrificing defenses for less lumbering locomotion and flying capabilities thanks to rocket-powered hover boots. It continues to employ energy-based, arm-mounted launchers, while its defensive shield can prevent your incoming attacks.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Kommando Klaus</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Preceded by a strange red mist, these automated enemies have had their higher functions disconnected and self-destruct sequences activated.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-wonder-weapon-gorgofex">New Wonder Weapon: Gorgofex</h3>



<p>Latest intel all but confirms Janus Towers may be hiding a new and grotesquely potent Wonder Weapon known as the Gorgofex. Partly charred experimentation notes discovered on microfiche indicate the existence of a “bio-aetheric” armament.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Combining fungal, floral, and insectile traits to deliver precise impact damage and gravity-defying disruption in close quarters, glowing membranes on the weapon show hints of motion and circulation under the surface. The weapon seems to pulse and breathe, with a beating central heart-like organ that “pumps” energy through the weapon. Due to the saturation of Dark Aether and other unknown energies, the weapon is said to emit faint psychic vibrations.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-field-upgrade-mister-peeks">New Field Upgrade: Mister Peeks </h3>



<p>Summon Mister Peeks to our reality to create chaos, as the deadly and distracting bunny busts out the moves and bashes undead brains to a raving disco beat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once Mister Peeks arrives in your hands, throw this hairy helper into the fray, and he gleefully attracts normal and Special enemies and attacks any undead within his wandering radius, savaging foes until they explode in a shower of bright confetti.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Mister Peeks: Major Augments</strong>
<ul>
<li>Dance Party
<ul>
<li>Mister Peeks becomes the life of the party, attracting nearby zombies to him, before he detonates an Aether Pulse to thin out the crowd considerably.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Arcane Fury
<ul>
<li>Mister Peeks has become a master of the elements, enhancing his regular damage with a random Ammo Mod (with an Augment from that Ammo Mod).</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Apex Hunter
<ul>
<li>Mister Peeks focuses all attacks on the strongest nearby enemy other than bosses. For example, Uber Klaus would be targeted over regular foes, with increased damage inflicted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Mister Peeks: Minor Augments&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Social Butterfly
<ul>
<li>Increase Mister Peeks’ attraction radius.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Peeks’ Favor
<ul>
<li>Mister Peeks is good to have around Mystery Box locations. Get a free box spin if you’re near one during activation!</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Party Animal
<ul>
<li>Increase Mister Peeks dance duration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Isle Sorna, the setting for The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park 3, will also be available for flyby, where players will be able to see the ruins of various Site B facilities used to create the park's dinosaurs.</p><p dir="ltr">Jurassic World: Archipelago is developed by Orbx Studios and will be available directly through the Orbx Direct website (where it sells other Flight Simulator DLC) or in-game through the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 marketplace.</p><p dir="ltr">It was reported earlier this year that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, as well as other first-party Microsoft titles, would soon be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744">coming to PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

Starting August 11, experiences that get the "Sensitive Issues" label will receive the descriptor on their details page and will be unavailable by default for users under the age of 13, although parents of older teens can choose to enable access if they wish.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The issues, according to the company, involve "current sensitive social, political, and religious" themes. As per the announcement, the descriptor is "not meant to take a stance on any specific issue," and Roblox anticipates "very few experiences will receive this label."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Said experiences must also meet both the "polarized viewpoints" and "strong emotional response" criteria.

"Please note that this is not a comprehensive or finite list - any issue that meets the above criteria qualifies as a 'sensitive issue.' These issues are topics that are frequently in the news and inspire strong opinions and emotional debate."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a more specific example, the company said that an experience with a core gameplay loop focusing on immigration or border security would qualify, but one that simply includes references to countries and borders would not. Both experiences in this example would still be covered by Roblox's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/8862768451604-Content-Maturity-Labels">content maturity guidelines</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Roblox said that experiences that fall under the descriptor will not be suspended or removed from the platform, and instances where consequences would apply are for creators who repeatedly provide inaccurate information in the questionnaire.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="'This change is not a response to any specific regulatory requirement or governmental request'">'This change is not a response to any specific regulatory requirement or governmental request'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company added that it understands that identifying sensitive issues can be complex and varies greatly by region.

            <title><![CDATA[You can still get into this weekend's Battlefield 6 beta but you'll have to watch 30 minutes of those awful Twitch people]]></title>
            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-still-get-into-this-weekends-battlefield-6-beta-but-youll-have-to-watch-30-minutes-of-those-awful-twitch-people</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-can-still-get-into-this-weekends-battlefield-6-beta-but-youll-have-to-watch-30-minutes-of-those-awful-twitch-people.1263762/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>If you failed to swipe an early access key for this week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> beta, because you <em>neither</em> signed up via the Battlefield Labs programme before 31st July <em>nor</em> watched Your Favourite Creators play the game during the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-full-multiplayer-reveal-sees-ea-trying-to-rebottle-the-lightning-of-battlefield-3-and-4">recent multiplayer reveal</a>, then Don't Sweat It, Soldier, because Drill Sergeant EA Have Your Back in the shape of a last-gasp code giveaway. </p>
<p>All you have to do to is sign into the EA and Twitch apps, then watch 30 minutes of Your Favourite Creators streaming the game. Unfortunately for me, the suggestion that I watch 30 minutes of anything on Twitch is a grievous insult akin to filling my wineglass with Vimto or farting on my outstretched hand. I hate game streaming and so do you, which is why neither of us will be playing Battlefield 6 this week. I will share further details of the giveaway only out of a sense of absolute perversity.
</p>
<p>Here's the specific wording from Drill Sergeant EA.</p>
<blockquote>The first step in participating is logging into your EA and Twitch accounts and linking them HERE. Then, during Battlefield 6 Open Beta Early Access, August 7th &amp; 8th, tune into your favorite creators streaming Battlefield 6 to unlock your own early access code after watching just 30 minutes.* Once you have your Twitch Drops code, visit Battlefield's Code Redemption page and enter the code to get Early Access added to your account. </blockquote>
<p>The little asterisk there is for "while supplies last". Perhaps it's too late, and you'll have to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/boomtown-rats-transformice">Transformice</a> instead. Alternatively, you can wait till the full public Battlefield 6 betas, which run August 9th-10th and August 14th-17th. No Twitch viewing required to access those.</p>
<p>These giveaways are business as usual for videogame publishers, but I've found EA's attempts to drive up Twitch engagement with Your Favourite Creators kind of eerie. It's an open effort to cook the numbers and fox Twitch's visibility algorithm. I imagine they don't care whether you actually watch Your Favourite Creators, only that you leave your fingerprints on the client, so why not turn on Twitch, lower the volume and spend 30 minutes ensuring that all of your socks are correctly paired.</p>
<p>If you're a real sucker for punishment, EA are also handing out Battlefield 6 cosmetics for people who carry on Twitching their Favourite Creators. Here's what you get for time served, with some observations of my own about how your state of mind might escalate in the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch for 1 Hour and, once you have conquered your nausea, you will earn the Mimic Weapons Package</li>
<li>Watch for 2 Hours and, once you have stopped feverishly washing your face, you will earn the Landslide Soldier Skin</li>
<li>Watch for 3 Hours and, once you have stopped cursing the day you were born, you will earn the Shattered Vehicle Skin </li>
<li>Watch for 4 Hours and, once the police have persuaded you to come down from the tree, you will earn the Imperial Soldier Skin</li>
</ul>
<p>Have I mentioned that I really hate game streaming? I'm sorry if you don't, and I'm harshing your buzz. I probably just haven't found the right streamer. Recommendations pls. People who prefer the comforting silence of text might want to read James Archer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">Battlefield 6 hands-on thoughts</a> instead.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-still-get-into-this-weekends-battlefield-6-beta-but-youll-have-to-watch-30-minutes-of-those-awful-twitch-people]]></content:encoded>

<p>Activision announced that PC users will have to enable Secure Boot to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. </p>



<p>Secure Boot is a Windows 10 and Windows 11 security feature that ensures a PC only loads safe software during startup. Secure Boot enables Activision to detect and remove users of banned third-party devices or other cheating software. </p>



<p>EA also uses the security measure for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-secureboot-not-enabled-error/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, and players experienced difficulties because they couldn’t play the game without enabling it. Enabling Secure Boot varies depending on the manufacturer of your PC, which can make it a confusing process. Black Ops 6 players are about to experience the same confusion. </p>

<p>Starting in Black Ops 6 Season 5, which begins on August 7, PC users must have Secure Boot enabled. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision</a> explained, “Secure Boot makes cheating at a hardware level much more difficult, ensuring cleaner PCs at start and allowing for more trusted environments for RICOCHET Anti-Cheat to operate in.” </p>



<p>If you need more information on how to enable Secure Boot, Activision provided a <a href="https://support.activision.com/articles/trusted-platform-module-and-secure-boot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">manual</a> on how to do so. You won’t be able to play BO6 without having the security measure enabled, and that also applies to Black Ops 7, when the upcoming game releases later this year. </p>



<p>In addition, the devs encouraged you to secure your account with email verification and two-factor authentication. Activision also introduced new detection tools targeted at rooting out boosting and teaming in BO6 multiplayer and Warzone Ranked Play, and confirmed that 22 additional individuals responsible for developing and selling cheats were cut off.  </p>



<p>Is Secure Boot enough to cut down on cheating? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/black-ops-7-will-require-secure-boot-to-play.3211/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-activision-leadership-isn%E2%80%99t-worried-about-battlefield-6-because-call-of-duty-is-%E2%80%9Ctoo-big-to-fail%E2%80%9D.1263753/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has learned that Activision leadership has been taking note of Battlefield 6’s recent hype, but is not worried that the franchise will surpass Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources who wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorised to talk about Activision’s internal conversations, it’s been said that although Activision is keeping a close eye on Battlefield, they are not worried about the game outcompeting its flagship franchise.</p>



<p>It’s said that Activision leadership believes that Call of Duty is “too big to fail” and will remain a profitable, annually released franchise for many years to come. At the time of writing, an annual Call of Duty title is penciled in for the next four years at least.</p>



<p>This year’s Call of Duty title, dubbed ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-revealed-during-xbox-games-showcase-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>‘, is said to be a “strong” title according to those familiar with the game’s plans, despite initial problems in development. </p>



<p>Interestingly enough, this year’s Call of Duty will take place in a slightly futuristic setting similar to Battlefield 6, with both games targeting a similar audience. Whether or not that direct competition will impact Call of Duty is unclear, but at the time of writing, Activision doesn’t think it will.</p>



<p>There’s also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6’s Battle Royale</a> to consider, which is believed to be a free-to-play component to the premium game. If EA can take a considerable chunk out of Call of Duty: Warzone’s playerbase, which has been depleting for the last couple of years, it could have a detrimental impact on Call of Duty’s long-term playerbase.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-black-ops-7-reveal-event-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 is set to get a full reveal</a> at this year’s Opening Night Live on August 19th.</p>



<p>What do you think of Activision not being worried about Battlefield outcompeting Call of Duty? Should they be? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Another hotfix is scheduled for next week.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Behaviour Interactive has released detailed patch notes for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> update 9.1.1 following backlash to bugs and balance changes introduced last week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team behind the popular asymmetrical horror game offered a breakdown for its long list of new fixes <a href="https://forums.bhvr.com/dead-by-daylight/kb/articles/517-9-1-1-bugfix-patch" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the Dead by Daylight website today</a>. It’s a bug fix patch that arrives just one week after update 9.1.0 launched for players across PC and consoles, but according to fans, it’s already long overdue.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dead by Daylight update 9.1.0 came with The Walking Dead representation, map changes, and balance tweaks for many of Behaviour’s playable Survivors and Killers. While the additions were celebrated by many, others struggled to focus on the positive aspects of the content update because it just so happened to come hand in hand with several new game-breaking exploits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lowlights from the patch saw players expressing concern regarding Perks like Streetwise, Blood Rush, and Last Stand, as each introduced either a fresh bug to squash. There’s also the issue of The Clown, who has paraded around player Trials with his lightning-fast speed and unstoppable, bottle-throwing arm. Thankfully, after Behaviour moved to Kill Switch (or disable) many of these issues yesterday, Dead by Daylight update 9.1.1 is here with more permanent fixes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Streetwise and Last Stand will both be re-enabled with the new update, with both receiving tweaks to repair the problems introduced with the last patch. The troublesome Fog Vial, which was added as a new item just last week, is also getting a nerf to its opacity and volume. Meanwhile, a list of priority bug fixes mends issues related to Killers and chase mechanics, how Survivors see The Deathslinger’s aiming animation, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fixes for glitches tied to audio, characters, environments, and other Perks can also be found in Dead by Daylight update 9.1.1 as Behaviour works to regain lost ground with the fanbase it’s grown throughout the last nine years. Part of the plan to do so, which was outlined in <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1952792732394754237" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post published by the Dead by Daylight X/Twitter account</u></a> yesterday, involves issuing another hotfix sometime next week. It’s said to come with a fix for Blood Rush bugs as well as additional tweaks to Fog Vials.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Behaviour says it will work to Kill Switch problematic gameplay elements and communicate with fans at a quicker pace in the future, thanking vocal players for their feedback as development continues.
