            <p>From developers Cannibal Interactive, the creators of Purgatory Dungeoneer, springs forth a new labyrinth game. This one is called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/labyrinth-of-wild-abyss-layeredux">Labyrinth of Wild Abyss: LayeRedux</a> and it has labyrinths. Except the labyrinths don't just have single paths to their centres, but tube monsters covered in eyes who'll stalk you slowly and methodically as you meander. Personally, it's not the vibe I'm after when I sit down in the evening and I think, "I would like to play a video game that makes me feel somewhat pleasant". But hey, it might be for you.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>LayeRedux is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a>, then. A horror game that's less focused on jump scares and more on the feeling of being lost and not knowing what's around the next corner. There are <em>lots</em> of corners, spread across 50 handcrafted labyrinths with multiple floors, all kitted out with a single monster that'll kill you instantly if they touch you. Think you've lost them? Nah, sorry, you've probably passed an eye on the wall that would've alerted them to your precise location. You can't outsmart them. You can't have a nice chat with them. "There is no hope but to run", says the Steam page.</p>
<p>Moments of respite can be found at toilets, which also act as save points. It's here where the monsters can't get you. Although, these toilets can't be found on every floor of a labyrinth, so you best be careful.</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">"Labyrinth of Wild Abyss: LayeRedux", a horror game about paranoia and persistence predation, is now out on Steam for $2.99! Enjoy vast hand-crafted labyrinths and the despair of escape! There is no reasoning with Monsters. There is no hope but to run.<a href="https://t.co/4j3D8MLtOg">https://t.co/4j3D8MLtOg</a> <a href="https://t.co/hml3yeO11h">pic.twitter.com/hml3yeO11h</a></p>— Damien Crawford (@TheWorstRPGDev) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWorstRPGDev/status/1851882608730460642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>I've not seen the film It Follows, but I've heard that it has a similar schtick? From what I gather, something in a human guise will follow you to the ends of the earth at a normal walking pace. So you could be at a train station looking up at the notice boards, when all of a sudden you notice a person staring directly at you and gently shoving others aside without breaking eye contact. That'll be the monster. And if they catch up with you: you die. I think that's a far from ideal situation and LayeRedux only goes and puts you directly in the monster's lair. No thanks.</p>
<p>But if you're like, "Yes thanks", then you can find the game over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3285660/Labyrinth_of_Wild_Abyss_LayeRedux/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a post on social media, the developer shared a playful gif showing off the impressive download number. It also left us with this interesting little factoid. Apparently of those 50m downloads, 10k of those were players renaming Baldur's Gate 3's mysterious Undead entity, Withers.</p>
<p>And, what are people renaming him? Well, Bone Daddy, of course! "So, uh, glad we could facilitate that," Larian wrote in its post.</p>

<p>We knew mods were a hit for Baldur's Gate 3 players already. In fact, in less than 24 hours of mod support going live on PC, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modding-is-pretty-big-says-baldurs-gate-3-director-as-over-1m-mods-are-installed-in-less-than-24-hours">developer announced more than 1m mods had been installed</a>.</p>
<p>Mod support then came to console and Mac players in October, when the team revealed over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-says-baldurs-gate-3-console-mods-smashing-records-just-a-week-after-release">1.7m mods were downloaded in the first 24 hours of release on consoles</a>.</p>

<p>The developer is yet to formally reveal its next project, it has confirmed two games are currently in the works - both of which will be based on its own IPs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">described as the studio's "best work ever"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo has launched Nintendo Music, a new music download and streaming app for your smartphone with access to a library of the company's top video game tunes. 
</p>
<p>
Available now via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nintendo-music/id6466376604">iPhone App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znba&amp;pli=1">Google Play</a>, the app requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to let you mooch around with Mario or pick up your morning jog with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin">Pikmin</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo Music features playlists from dozens of Nintendo games across the years, with more to be added over time. You can play themes from specific games, or from playlists themed around certain Nintendo characters, music genres and moods. 
</p>

<p>
There's also the ability to curate your playlists, and hide music from games you haven't played (or don't want to hear) via a Spoiler function. 
</p>
<p>
Best of all, tracks can be extended (you can choose from either 15 minutes, 30 minutes or a full hour) allowing you to bliss out to some relaxing Animal Crossing or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin-4">Pikmin 4</a> vibes all night long. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has increasingly taken a sterner stance towards the hosting of its music elsewhere on the internet, and the decision to provide an official source for its tunes (and the ability to extend them - an offering that is a YouTube favourite) is an interesting step. 
</p>
<p>
So far, Nintendo Music hosts music from: 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>Splatoon 3</li>
<li>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</li>
<li>Kirby Star Allies</li>

            <p>The creative director of Insomniac's upcoming Wolverine game has moved across to Xbox, and joined the team working on the Perfect Dark reboot.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wolverine-perfect-dark-brian-horton-playstation-xbox">Game File</a>, Brian Horton hasn't been part of the PlayStation Marvel project since the summer. Horton was announced to be serving as Wolverine's creative director back in 2021.</p>
<p>The game will now be led by Marcus Smith, who has taken on the role of creative director in Horton's stead. Mike Daly is Wolverine's game director, while the game's previously announced game director Camerson Christain will remain with Insomniac, but will serve in a different role. Smith and Daly previously worked together on Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, as creative director and game director.</p>

<p>According to sources close to the matter, the recent changes on the Wolverine development team are "the result of creative decisions around the game".</p>
<p>Following his departure from Playstation, Horton has now moved to Xbox, where he has joined the Perfect Dark reboot team as creative director. Horton will be "bringing his wealth of experience to the upcoming reboot of the classic secret agent series," an Xbox representative said.</p><p>We finally got a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/at-long-last-the-perfect-dark-reboot-gets-a-first-gameplay-trailer">gameplay for the Perfect Dark reboot back in June</a> during an Xbox showcase, four years after the game's initial announcement. The reboot is being co-developed by Microsoft's The Initiative and Embracer-owned Crystal Dynamics (where Horton once worked on Tomb Raider). In May, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-reportedly-in-a-very-rough-state-and-a-big-protracted-mess">described as still being in a "very rough state"</a>.</p>
<p>There's still no release window for the Perfect Dark reboot yet but it'll be a day one Game Pass title when it arrives.</p>
<p>As for Wolverine, it was first announced in several years ago, but little official has been heard about the project since. </p><p>In 2023, Insomniac was subject to a cyber attack, following which people were playing - and uploading footage - of an<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/people-are-posting-footage-of-marvels-wolverine-from-stolen-early-version"> incomplete early development build of the game</a>, found within the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-investigating-insomniac-hack-which-reportedly-leaked-wolverine-files-and-employees-personal-data">files stolen from the developer by ransomware hackers</a>. Insomniac issued a statement following this incident stating: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-issues-statement-addressing-hack">Like Logan... Insomniac is resilient</a>."</p>

<p>That’s right, hot on the heels of that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/09/nintendo-alarmo-is-an-alarm-clock-and-not-switch-2/">alarm clock</a>, this is a new perk for subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online, letting us all more legitimately delve into the soundtracks for a good selection of Nintendo games – as opposed to, you know, just looking them up on YouTube.</p>


<p>There’s some modern greats included, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> sure to get an awful lot of playtime, but you can also head back to all-timers like the original Super Mario Bros., Metroid, and fan favourites with Nintendogs and the Wii Channels music – yes, the music from the console menus, from when Nintendo still had fun console menus.</p>
<p>Personally, I think this is great, and I can’t wait to see how Nintendo will expand and grow the line up. Sure, they can fill out the library with more obvious soundtracks, but I’d love to see some oddments like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/17/cadence-of-hyrule-review/">Cadence of Hyrule collaboration</a> make an appearance, and collaborations with third parties.</p>

<p>The full line up of soundtracks and games is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Animal Crossing: New Horizons (Nintendo Switch)</li>
<li>Donkey Kong Country (Super NES)</li>
<li>Dr. Mario (Game Boy)</li>
<li>Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade (Game Boy Advance</li>
<li>Kirby Star Allies (Nintendo Switch)</li>
<li>Kirby’s Dream Land (Game Boy)</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Nintendo Switch)</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (Nintendo 64)</li>
<li>Lylat Wars (Nintendo 64)</li>
<li>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (Nintendo Switch)</li>
<li>Metroid (NES)</li>
<li>Metroid (Famicom Disk System)</li>
<li>Metroid Prime (Nintendo GameCube)</li>
<li>Nintendogs (Nintendo DS)</li>
<li>Pikmin 4 (Nintendo Switch)</li>
<li>Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet (Nintendo Switch)</li>
<li>Super Mario Bros. (NES)</li>
<li>Super Mario Galaxy (Nintendo Wii)</li>
<li>Super Mario Odyssey (Nintendo Switch)</li>
<li>Super Mario World 2:Yoshi’s Island (Super NES)</li>
<li>Splatoon 3 (Nintendo Switch)</li>
<li>Tomodachi Collection (Nintendo DS)</li>
<li>Wii Channels (Nintendo Wii)</li>
</ul>

			<p>Stephen Totilo <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wolverine-perfect-dark-brian-horton-playstation-xbox?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=150949805&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=5eh0e&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> via Game File that the Perfect Dark reboot recently added a new Creative Director: Brian Horton. He's an industry veteran with credits dating back all the way to Disney: Pocahontas, released in 1996 for the SEGA Genesis/Mega Drive console.</p>
<p>Most of his credits are in the art department. He was, for instance, the Senior Art Director for Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider while at Crystal Dynamics. Horton then switched to a Creative Director position when he did a couple of years <a href="http://wccftech.com/rise-tomb-raider-art-director-leaves-crystal-dynamics-join-infinity-ward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at Infinity Ward</a> and kept the same role when he joined Insomniac to work on Marvel's Spider-Man, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, and Marvel's Spider-Man 2. More recently, he was the creative director of the upcoming game Marvel's Wolverine, which Horton <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolverine-ps5-full-size-mature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a> briefly three years ago. Given that the Perfect Dark game is largely being developed at Crystal Dynamics in a joint venture with The Initiative, this is a return home for Horton. An Xbox spokesperson told Game File:</p>
<p><em>Brian Horton will be bringing his wealth of experience to the upcoming reboot of the classic secret agent series.</em></p>
<p>We finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-first-gameplay-footage-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got </a>our first look at the game during this Summer's Xbox Games Showcase. The gameplay trailer was definitely promising and we also learned a few concrete details. The developers have taken inspiration from elements of the first two installments while creating an entirely new story and universe for the reboot.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark will be a single-player experience with a set of missions that offer various choices on how players complete them. Traversal and gadgets are going to be very important. The focus was on creating an intuitive movement system to let players find interesting ways to tackle their tasks. The combat system has been designed to allow for both melee and gunplay, stealth, and gadgets. Supposedly, the development teams want to blend elements from first-person shooters, immersive simulations, and stealth games into a cohesive whole, delivering a complete secret agent fantasy.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark doesn't have a release date yet, but it will launch on PC and Xbox Series S|X. As all games developed by studios owned by Microsoft, it will be available on Game Pass from day one. As for Marvel's Wolverine, Horton has been replaced by Marcus Smith as the new Creative Director for Insomniac's game.</p>

            <p>Almost ten years after Inquistion offered up a thrilling herb-harvesting adventure, today sees the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-4-release-date-trailer-details-theories-and-predictions">Dragon Age: Veilguard</a>. I’ve popped the release times below. The internet's Aged Dragons are naturally quite excited, and there’s been some lovely interactions over on Le Epic Musk Zone, where veteran Bioheads are celebrating the RPG studio’s history of animation quirks, <a href="https://x.com/ChachiBobinks/status/1851307428656161158">specifically the ‘Bioware Turn’</a>. Here’s a clip:</p>

<p>Violet McVinnie, currently of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resistor">Resistor</a> studio Long Way Home and previously a cinematographer at Bioware on games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-2">Mass Effect 2</a>, has chimed in to speak about the animation.</p>
<p>“Ex Bioware dev here,” <a href="https://x.com/VioletMcVinnie/status/1851558624461496555">wrote McVinnie</a>. “I'm responsible for some of the "Bioware Turns". This anim is part of a set called "Posebreakers" which are intended to move characters around the area if a scene is feeling too static. We'd combine them with the infamous "Exit Left/Right" between cuts.”</p><p>People in McVinnie’s replies are also curating a collection of their favourite Bioware-isms, including 'flick of the wrist accusatory point', 'walk away nonchalantly while looking back over the shoulder', ‘worried forehead rub’, and ‘aggressive headshake after drinking alcohol’ (“just from the mocap recording”, says McVinnie).</p>
<p>One player asked why “everyone in Mass Effect break(s) eye contact and look(s) off to the side when handing objects to people?”, to which McVinnie replied “if it’s the hand off anim I think it is, it was baked into the animation file before we started using it. Not sure of the origin. Many animations propagate through lots of Bioware franchises. ME3's Thane/Kai Leng fight cutscene has a lot of Jade Empire combat animations stitched together.” We do love to see a bit of canny asset reuse.</p>
<p>I done wrote Wot I Think about Dragon Age: The Veilguard <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">here</a>. In short: It’s not much of an RPG, and its action wears thin sooner than I’d have liked, but it’s got such heart and enthusiasm it won me right over by the end. Oh, I just remembered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/weve-temporarily-closed-comments-for-maintenance-but-theyll-be-back">comments are temporarily down</a>, too! Sera best companion. Dragon Age 2 wasn’t that great. Anyone moaning about Marvel dialogue in the new game, fair enough, but I must ask if you’ve somehow erased Alistair from your memory. Happy Veilguard day to those who celebrate, and happy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3184110/Widget_Inc/">Widget Inc</a> day to those who don't.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Today in "person you already like says something you already agree with, but it’s still good to hear them say it" news, Arkane founder and im-simmy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> studio WolfEye head Raphael Colantonio has spoken on Microsoft’s decision to shutter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey-2017">Prey (2017)</a> studio Arkane Austin - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">alongside a handful of others</a> - back in May.</p>
<p>Colantonio, who founded Arkane in 1999 and departed in 2017 to form <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/weird-west">Weird West</a> studio WolfEye, recently chatted to Jeremy Peel <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/microsoft-closing-arkane-austin-was-a-dumb-move-says-founder-and-former-president">for PC Gamer</a> about Arkane’s closure, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think if you look a little bit, it's obvious that Arkane Austin was a very special group of people that have made some cool things and that could pull it off again. I think it was a decision that just came down to, 'We need to cut something.' Was it to please the investors, the stock market? They're playing a different game.</p></blockquote>

<p>"The rules that they play, we might not understand them. It's a different thing. It's hard to know why they did what they did,” said Colantonio. "The only thing that I stand by is saying that the specific choice of killing Arkane Austin, that was not a good decision."</p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Recreating a very special group like that is, I would dare to say, impossible. It takes forever. When you have that magic of Harvey [Smith] and Ricardo [Bare] etc that all come together, it's a specific moment in time and space that just worked out this way, that took forever to reach. Those people together can really make magic. It's not like, 'Doesn't matter, we'll just rehire.' No, try it. That's what big groups do all the time. They try to just hire massively and overpay people to create those magic groups. It doesn't work like this. So to me, that was stupid. But what do I know?"</p></blockquote>
<p>Arkane Lyon - the original 1999 French studio from which Arkane Austin spun off in 2006 - are currently at work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-blade">Marvel’s Blade</a> - the last we saw of it was some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arkane-release-new-marvels-blade-concept-artworks-hinting-at-missions-combat-and-levels">concept art</a> last December. WolfEye’s next project is an “<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wolfeyes-new-first-person-rpg-is-an-evolution-of-prey-and-dishonored-featuring-mechs-magnets-and-a-continuous-world">evolution of Prey and Dishonored”</a>, and it sounds great. We’re currently expecting a ‘limited private alpha test’ next year. In August, we learned that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> studio Tango - shuttered by Xbox at the same time as Arkane Austin - had been rescued, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pubg-owner-krafton-have-acquired-tango-gameworks-and-the-hi-fi-rush-ip">in a manner of speaking</a>, by Plunkbatters Krafton.</p>

			<p>Early signs on Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 sales and overall reception were great, and now we have confirmation from Microsoft and Activision. During the company's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-fy25-q1-total-gaming-revenue-up-by-43-all-from-activision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q1 2025 earnings</a> call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed that the game set new franchise records and also helped the Game Pass subscription service reach records of its own.</p>
<p><em>One year since we closed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, we are focused on building a business positioned for long-term growth, driven by higher-margin content and services. You already see this transformation in our results as we diversify the ways that gamers access our content. We set new records for monthly active users in the quarter as more players than ever play our games across devices and on the Xbox platform. Game Pass also set a new Q1 record for total revenue and average revenue per subscriber. And as we look ahead, our IP across our studios has never been stronger.</em></p>
<p><em>Last week's launch of Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty release ever, setting a record for day 1 players as well as Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day. And unit sales on PlayStation and Steam were also up over 60% year-over-year. This speaks to our strategy of meeting gamers where they are by enabling them to play more games across the screens they spend their time on.</em></p>
<p>Granted, there were little doubts in both cases. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is, after all, the first new game in the franchise to launch day and date on Game Pass, which would inevitably have expanded its player base (and the subscription service's user base). The bigger question is whether, in the long term, this will be financially beneficial compared to the traditional way the game has been sold before the massive acquisition.</p>
<p>Activision is also celebrating, of course. The official X account revealed that, unsurprisingly, Black Ops 6 has registered the biggest opening weekend ever for Call of Duty in terms of total players, hours played, and total matches. Moreover, the publisher <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/30/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-500-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> The Washington Post that the first-person shooter franchise has now surpassed 500 million units since its debut twenty-one years ago.</p>

<p>After a 14-year-long wait, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games</a> has finally released their 2010 hit title, Red Dead Redemption, on PC. So, if you’re looking for a fresh start to John Marston’s story, don’t forget to implement these best PC graphics settings during your playthrough.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-graphics-settings-for-red-dead-redemption-on-pc">Best Graphics Settings for Red Dead Redemption on PC</h2>

<p>Considering Red Dead Redemption is over a decade-old game, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">system requirements</a> are more on the demanding side. However, even if you have somewhat dated hardware, you can still enjoy the game at higher frames without losing quality. Just use the settings mentioned above.</p>



<p>Unlike Red Dead Redemption 2, where the graphics options are much more robust, you don’t get that in this game. But to get the optimal performance, you can tweak it a little bit as per your liking.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-0-15-5-patch-brings-fall-weather-%E2%80%98matching-inventory%E2%80%99-and-more.1023906/</guid>

<p>Escape from Tarkov’s latest patch – 0.15.5.0 – is being implemented today, October 31. It’s bursting with features and changes, but it’ll take the game offline for several hours while it’s being deployed and tested. One of the standout tweaks to the game coming with 0.15.5 is the introduction of fall weather – which means we’re one step away from winter and that damned snow.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-tarkov-s-0-15-5-patch">What’s in Tarkov’s 0.15.5 Patch?</h2>



<p>Tarkov’s 0.15.5 update has plenty packed into it.</p>



<p>First, there’s the switch to fall weather, marked by orange and brown leaves and foliage, crispy terrain underfoot, and low-sitting sunscapes that blind you at the wrong moment every time. In a few weeks, we’ll get <strong>late </strong>fall, which is a different thing entirely. It’s the preface to winter, so it’s not long until we get snow back in Tarkov.</p>



<p>One of the best features being added with the 0.15.5 patch is the ability to interact with your stash, profile, and even the Flea Market while matching. It’s limited to the earliest phase of matching, which means you’ll need to move quickly, but it’s expected it’ll be expanded later as a feature.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, you’ll now get in-game rewards for unlocking certain achievements. These rewards won’t disappear when you undergo a wipe – once you’ve got them, you’ve unlocked them for life. For instance, if you completed the full Tarkov Mystery event, you’ll unlock the ‘Mr Kerman’s Cat Hologram’ item.</p>



<p>Players will also be able to pin items in the stash following the rollout of the 0.15.5 patch. You’ll also be able to lock items, preventing you from accidentally using or selling them. </p>



<p>Battlestate Games has also adjusted transition points, introduced new shotguns and attachments for a string of assault rifles, and fixed various bugs and issues in the game.</p>



<p>Is this a solid Tarkov update? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Uses summoning magic to summon the hero Hero to aid her escape from the Demon Castle. According to herself, the princess of a small and isolated island kingdom off the coast of the continent of Maygard. Having had very little contact with others, she has long dreamed of making friends. Because of this background, while Julietta rarely initiates conversation she always makes sure to properly answer when someone speaks to her, even if in an awkward manner. While she may be an introvert, that does not mean she is bad at communicating.</li><li><strong>Aria</strong> (voiced by Mao Amatsuka) – The princess of Aria Zaza, one of the two great kingdoms of the Maygard Continent. Having led a sheltered childhood, Aria has been insulated from most knowledge of the real world. While soft-spoken, she harbors a deep desire for a peaceful world in which everyone can live happily. While prone to making ditzy remarks, Aria posesses a gifted mind and sometimes surprises those around her with her logical arguments and astute oberservations. She is also exceptionally well-trained in magic. While on the journey to defeat the Demon King, she runs into Demon King Hamehameha and is taken away to the Demon Castle.</li><li><strong>Zena</strong> (voiced by Fumiko Uchimura) – The princess of Zanji Zard, one of the two great kingdoms of the Maygard Continent. She trains in swordsmanship daily and her skills are second-to-none! Being afraid of nobody and lacking restraint, she may flip between insulting the Hero in one moment and joking around with him the next. Says this and that, but in the end finds herself drawn to the Hero. While on the journey to defeat the Demon King, she runs into Demon King Hamehameha and is taken away to the Demon Castle.</li><li><strong>Charlotte</strong> (voiced by Yuki Tanaka) – A stern female knight who swore her allegiance to Aria. A leader-like figure to the group, always troubled by the other girls’ freewheeling <a title="Genres > Action [2,283 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. A keen and observant person, Charlotte understands the strengths and weaknesses of each party member and is able to give out orders appropriate to the situation, displaying her talent as a commander. While calm, collected, and able to be relied on most of the time, when Charlotte loses control of her emotions she loses sight of her surroundings, often repeating the phrase “Ugh, kill me!”</li><li><strong>Finanche</strong> (voiced by Honoka Inoue) – A mage from the kingdom of Aria Zaza. An apprentice to the sage who previously accompanied the Hero on his journey. Having lost her parents at a young age, Finanche was raised by the sage in their stead. To Finanche, the sage is both her master and a parental figure. In order to pay back the sage for having raised her, Finanche studied hard to become a skilled mage. Because of this past, she blames the Hero for the death of the sage and looks down on him as lacking in ability.</li><li><strong>Chouquette</strong> (voiced by Ayumi Mano) – A dark <a title="Companies > elf [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/elf">elf</a> and former bandit who now serves Aria. Becoming a bandit in order to provide for her kind, hated and looked down upon by the citizens of Aria Zaza, Chouquette was apprehended by Charlotte and became a prisoner awaiting execution. However, Aria, upon hearing the struggles of Chouquette and the dark elves, extended her support to them and spared Chouquette’s life on the condition that she become Aria’s personal guard. Moved by Aria’s open-heartedness, Chouquette pledged her loyalty to Aria.</li><li><strong>Demon King Hamehameha</strong> (voiced by Mikoi Sasaki) – The Demon King that reigns over the Maygard Continent. The very culprit that screwed the Hero’s party in the Demon Castle. Cold, calculative, and condescending towards human life, she has no reservations about killing. In addition, she wields powerful magic thanks to her massive magical power.</li></ul><p><strong>System</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Guide the Princesses to Escape From the Demon Castle!</strong> – Since you, the hero, have no physical body, you cannot search for or solve traps on your own. Instead, you must guide the captured princesses to uncover the castle’s many puzzles, rescue your party members, and escape! Depending on your choices, the fates of the princesses could change dramatically!</li><li><strong>Use the Hints and Items You Find to Solve the Castle’s Many Puzzles!</strong> – You’ll need to deal with a plethora of traps and puzzles to free the princesses from the Demon Castle. To solve them all, search each room corner-to-corner to collect items and hints! As the hero, your wits and resourcefulness will be tested!</li><li><strong>Rescue the Members of the Hero’s <a title="Genres > Party [79 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a> Who Have Been Screwed!</strong> – At the hands of Demon King Hamehameha, who loves to screw others more than anything in the world, the Hero’s Party have been taken away to the Demon Castle and strewn screwn all over the castle, crying out for help! Try not to be distracted by the unbecoming positions your allies have been placed in, and search for items and hints to rescue them as soon as possible. Suppress your urge to stare at the maidens before you, and fulfill your duty as a Hero to rescue your friends and save the world!</li><li><strong>No Need to Worry About Channel Bans (or Your Mom Walking in)! a Curtain of Light to Protect the Girls’ Precious Parts!</strong> – The configurations menu now boasts “Sensitive Mode,” which you can turn on to have a curtain of light cover up your party members’ precious parts! This mode can be toggled on and off at any time, even during exploration, from the config menu. With this mode active, you won’t have to worry about your streaming, video sharing, or social media accounts getting banned! Plus, you can now play in the living room without having to worry about mom walking in!</li></ul><p><strong>Staff</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Character Design:</strong> Waon Inui, MIZU</li><li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Linkedbrain Inc.</li><li><strong>Producer:</strong> Yujiro Usuda</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a set of videos below.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-how-to-farm-spectral-pages-quickly-during-festival-of-the-lost/1100-6518479/" data-ref-id="1100-6518479">Festival of the Lost</a> brings a few unique weapons to the game alongside its spooky season-themed activities. New this year is Arcane Embrace, a one-of-a-kind shotgun with a new archetype that fires two slugs with each pull of the trigger instead of one. Especially with its god roll perks, it's an extremely powerful option for leveling tough enemies or dealing boss damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Arcane Embrace is only available during the Festival of the Lost and only from specific sources. Here's how to get it and the god rolls you'll want to chase.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_Arcane_Embrace">How To Get Arcane Embrace</a></li><li><a href="#Arcane_Embrace_God_Rolls">Arcane Embrace God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Arcane_Embrace_PvE_God_Roll">Arcane Embrace PvE God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Arcane_Embrace_PvP_God_Roll">Arcane Embrace PvP God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_Arcane_Embrace">How To Get Arcane Embrace</h2><p dir="ltr">You can only get Arcane Embrace by completing the Haunted Sectors activity as part of the Festival of the Lost or from event vendor Eva Levante in the Tower. The good news is that you're guaranteed to get an Arcane Embrace just by completing the quick set of quests Eva gives you at the start of the Festival of the Lost to get acclimated to the event--and it's kind of a great one with Trench Barrel and Dual Loader, which you can only get as this reward from Eva. After that, you can play Haunted Sectors for a chance to get Arcane Embrace rolls as rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">You can also decrypt Eerie Engrams, earned from the event, for a chance to get the shotgun to drop from them. Eva offers the ability to "focus" your Eerie Engrams to get specific rewards instead of a random item from the Festival loot pool, so provided you have the Candy to spend, you can guarantee new Arcane Embraces by visiting her.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4392798-20241030100339_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392798" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4392798-20241030100339_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392798"></a><figcaption>Arcane Embrace</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4392798-20241030100339_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Arcane_Embrace_God_Rolls">Arcane Embrace God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Arcane_Embrace_PvE_God_Roll">Arcane Embrace PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Fluted Barrel or Corkscrew Rifling  <ul><li dir="ltr">Fluted Barrel: Stability +5, Handling +15</li><li dir="ltr">Corkscrew Rifling: +5 Stability, +5 Handling, +5 Reload Speed</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Tactical Mag  <ul><li dir="ltr">Stability +5, Reload Speed +15</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Fourth Time's the Charm  <ul><li dir="ltr">Rapidly landing precision shots will return two rounds to the magazine.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Surrounded / Precision Instrument  <ul><li dir="ltr">Surrounded: This weapon gains improved bonus damage when three or more targets are in close proximity.</li><li dir="ltr">Precision Instrument: Dealing sustained damage significantly increases precision damage.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Handling or Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Firing two shots for each pull of the trigger, Arcane Embrace can dish out massive damage very quickly--so the struggle becomes keeping it full of ammo to keep that damage flowing for as long as possible. Focus on increasing your reload speed so you can get the gun loaded quickly, with a secondary emphasis on handling so you can quickly swap to it when needed. Fourth Time's the Charm helps with keeping the gun loaded since you get ammo back for landing precision shots and you can land two hits with each blast. Surrounded and Precision Instrument both do well to add additional damage to the gun. Use Precision Instrument if you're doing well in landing lots of headshots, and Surrounded if you can wade into a group of enemies to do your dirty work. Surrounded offers a more significant damage boost but is generally harder to activate.</p><p dir="ltr">As mentioned, it's worth noting that the Dual Loader / Trench Barrel roll you get from Eva as a quest reward is also pretty great--and you <em>can't</em> get that version from a random roll, at least right now. It's a pretty solid stand-in from these god roll options.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Arcane_Embrace_PvP_God_Roll">Arcane Embrace PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Smallbore  <ul><li dir="ltr">Stability +7, Range +7</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Steady Rounds / Accurized Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">Steady Rounds: Stability +15, Range -5, Airborne Effectiveness +7</li><li dir="ltr">Accurized Rounds: +10 Range</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Slideshot  <ul><li dir="ltr">Sliding partially reloads this weapon's magazine and temporarily boosts handling and range.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Closing Time  <ul><li dir="ltr">Improves range, accuracy, and handling as the magazine gets lower.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Stability or Range</li></ul><p dir="ltr">You can do solid work in PvP with Arcane Embrace just with its two shots, but it operates like a slug shotgun, which means precision is important. For that reason, stability is a stat you want to lean into, especially because you can get strong boosts to range through other perks. The benefits of Slideshot--increased range and stability, as well as reloading the magazine--are hard to pass up in the Crucible. Closing Time is also great for boosting stats that will help you win fights, including range, although you need to get the magazine down to at least half to trigger it, so keep that in mind when choosing when to reload.</p>

		<p>The LEGO Group is wrapping up a month-long experiment in LEGO Islands within Fortnite with today’s launch of the LEGO Dark Space experience.</p>
<p>LEGO Dark Space is a level that you can find within Fortnite – either in the LEGO Islands section or with the code 5633-3820-8944 – giving players a creepy level to navigate, completing puzzles and challenges to make it through the space station, using lights to avoid monsters, and eventually try to escape.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO Islands in Fortnite - LEGO Dark Space" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G7vvMsO7wcU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Through the month of October, The Lego Group has launched three custom made experiences within their broad collaboration with Fortnite, first providing a 3D platformer in Lego Parkour Worlds set in the Lego Dreamzzz universe. This was followed by Lego Chasers vs. Hunters, again featuring the Dreamzzz universe as players battle for control over a map, blasting away at world items (and one another) to acquire dream sand. And then there’s Lego Monster Fishing, with a giant tentacle monster beneath the surface of an otherwise calm fishing and town improvement game.</p>
<p>This all feeds into Lego Dark Space –&nbsp;something completely different. Something a bit darker.</p>

<p>Starting off with a tentacled alien terror attacking you and a fellow astronaut on a dusty Mars-like planet, you race to get inside the space station and try to make your way to a rocket to blast off to safety. What stands between you and that rocket, though, is a labyrinth dark and spooky corridors and rooms, aliens on patrol, and some light puzzles to solve.</p>

<p>It’s actually surprisingly effective, shifting to a first person view of a station that’s been constructed entirely out of Lego bricks and chunky Lego props. All you have to hand is a flashlight that lazily follows the direction that you’re looking, and a map of the level that you can use to navigate to each of the puzzles.</p>
<p>With no weapons to hand, you will have to avoid the Lego aliens that patrol the corridors, though their routes don’t intersect with puzzle rooms, giving you safe havens to reach without stress for when you’re solving puzzles. These can be surprisingly inventive, like matching the shadows of objects or blending colours to match, or they can be as simple as hitting a few triggers. Once all 10 have been completed, you’re on to the home stretch.</p>
<p>It can be played solo or in co-op (matchmade or otherwise), with players having five lives that will send you back to the beginning, though with puzzles remaining completed.</p>
<p>It’s all intended as a bit of a demonstration of what the Lego asset kits in Fortnite are able to produce, and in that regard Team Unite has done a good job… though they inevitably butt up into the limitations of Fortnite as a UGC game creating platform. Unreal Engine can create fantastic worlds, but once you’re abstracted from a game engine, it’s difficult to get a truly polished experience.</p>

<p>Flicking to and from the map would often see the world disappear or switch view temporarily back to third person, some of the puzzles are a bit finicky in their style, and as effective as the flashlight lag is for instilling a little bit of fear in you, I can’t be sure it’s truly intentional.</p>
<p>Still, it shows the potential of this creative playground, in combination with the trio of preceding Lego Islands games. And the whole Mystery of the Monolith loosely links the four together with clues and codes in previously released levels that can unlock things in this finale.</p>
<p>It also goes hand in hand with a streaming collaboration, with SypherPK, Lachlan, Loserfruit and Ali-A amongst the first to set foot in the labyrinthine level… and then set to be trapped and imprisoned by the Monolith. Players will be able to follow in their footsteps and then vote on who to release between now and 12th November, with a reward being exclusive&nbsp;Dark Studies and Eternal Restlessness décor bundles.</p>
<p>LEGO’s collaboration with Fortnite has been and intriguing one to watch from afar, combining two things that millions upon millions of children are no doubt obsessed with. This month and the Mystery of the Monolith shows that this partnership can absolutely go further in future.</p>

Beyond that, it sounds like a faithful recreation of this standalone entry in the Xeno series.</p><p>Nintendo Switch Online owners can play with 31 other players across the world in several different multiplayer modes: Squad Tasks, Online Missions, and Global Nemesis Battles.</p></div>                      </div><p>Set in 2054, the game follows a small group of humans as they flee their destroyed Earth and crash onto the mysterious planet of Mira. You’ll be tasked with doing everything you can to bring humanity back from the brink, and the story is just as nuanced as all the others in the Xenoblade Chronicles series. There’s no need to have played any other Xenoblade games before diving in, as the story is a standalone experience.</p><p>Our original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review/1900-6416322/" data-ref-id="1900-6416322">Xenoblade Chronicles X review</a> gave it an impressive 8/10, thanks to its incredible landscapes, complex combat systems, and rewarding character progression.

            <p>
Microsoft boss Satya Nadella has called last week's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> launch the "biggest Call of Duty release ever", saying its arrival set a record for "Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day."
</p>
<p>
News of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's success came amid Microsoft's Q1 FY2025 financial earnings report, which once again saw the company recording notable gains in gaming revenue, up 43 percent year-over-year. That's alongside a 61 percent year-on-year increase for Xbox content and services revenue, although growth was primarily a result of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">$69bn Activision Blizzard acquisition</a>. In contrast, the company's Xbox hardware revenue has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-console-sales-decline-continues">continued to fall</a>, this time by 29 percent year-on-year.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> acquisition also helped provide more good news for investors, thanks to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's recent arrival. While opening weekend numbers saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-uk-physical-sales-drop-in-shift-to-game-pass">physical sales of Black Ops 6 fall by 10 percent in the UK</a> compared to Modern Warfare 3, likely due to its day one appearance on Game Pass, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella trumpeted the launch in an earnings call today, calling Black Ops 6 the "biggest Call of Duty release ever".

<p>
While Nadella didn't share specific figures to illustrate his claims, he noted Black Ops 6's launch had set a "record for day one players as well as Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day." That Game Pass metric was previously rolled out last year when Nadella announced Bethesda's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> had "set a record for the most Game Pass subscriptions added on a single day ever", indicating higher numbers for Black Ops 6. However, it remains to be seen if those numbers prove sufficient for Microsoft, given Black Ops 6's Game Pass launch marks a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/analysts-reckon-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-could-bring-up-to-4m-new-game-pass-subscribers">critical test</a> for its subscription service strategy following its Activision Blizzard acquisition.
</p><p>
Nadella also revealed Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's opening weekend had attracted the highest number of PC players in the franchise's history, while unit sales on PlayStation and Steam were said to be up 60 percent year-over-year. Black Ops 6 developer Treyarch repeated many of Nadella's record-setting claims in a <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1851753565900927282">message shared on social media</a>, adding that Black Ops 6 had also seen the highest number of total players, hours played, and total matches played during a three-day opening weekend in Call of Duty's history.
</p>
<p>
But how has it gone down with the critics? Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell shared his thoughts on Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's "nonsensical, but surprisingly intimate" campaign earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review">calling it</a> a "return to form for the series, mixing the usual, slightly unsavoury real-world set dressing with cracking action, horror twists and tongue-in-cheek charm." We'll be reaching a verdict on Black Ops 6's multiplayer component at a later date.

Today’s layoffs were especially severe: According to several current Fandom employees who spoke to Aftermath on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, Fandom has laid off 11 percent of its staff. On the games media side of things, that includes many GameSpot video team members and GameSpot UK.&nbsp;</p><p>The day began with GameSpot staffers taking to social media to announce that they’d lost their jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>"GameSpot was the goal. Reached it sooner than I thought I would," <a href="https://x.com/devantechisolm/status/1851672746071097591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> GameSpot video producer DeVante Chisolm. "Now that it's over... idk."</p><p>"While I may have issues with the folks who have owned GameSpot throughout my time there, I always loved working with the GameSpot team," <a href="https://x.com/ChrisHayner/status/1851669451403383130" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> senior editor Chris Hayner. "Best team I've been on. We made so much out of so little and made it work."&nbsp;</p><p>According to current Fandom staff, employees were invited to an all-hands meeting earlier today in which CEO Perkins Miller broke the news, chalking the layoffs up to a broader restructuring of the company in the face of market changes, as well as a failure to hit revenue goals. In addition to GameSpot UK and video team members, Fandom employees in sales and management were also affected, say current employees from Fandom’s gaming group, who are still taking stock of damage to the company beyond their own departments. On social media, staff from Screen Junkies, the Fandom-owned home of pop culture video series like "Honest Trailers," also <a href="https://x.com/billyapatterson/status/1851716666935382481" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported that they’ve been let go</a>.</p><p>Despite all this, gaming remains a core part of Fandom's business, though one current employee added that "Gaming is still a focus in that they don't have any other focuses."</p><p>A Fandom representative declined to provide further details on record.</p><p>GameSpot staff were blindsided and now find themselves once again picking up the pieces, after weathering <a href="https://kotaku.com/giant-bomb-gamespot-metacritic-fandom-layoffs-1850008228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another round of layoffs</a> just a few months after Fandom purchased the site in 2023, as well as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/giantbomb/comments/1afpyej/looks_like_fandom_laid_off_some_folks_over_at/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a smaller batch earlier this year</a>.</p><p>"It’s rough," one current employee told Aftermath. "A big part of that is because we didn’t really see it coming. ... It was a bit of a rugpull."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This time, it’s a mobile app called Nintendo Music, which lets users listen to classic gaming tunes from Nintendo games spanning the last few decades, including <em>Splatoon</em>, <em>Animal Crossing,</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. It’s only available to Switch Online subscribers, and it’s launching today on both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-music/id6466376604">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znba&amp;hl=en_CA">Android</a>.</p><p>The app features curated playlists themed around games, moments, moods, or characters, though you can also build your own. It also supports streaming as well as downloading tracks for offline listening. Curiously, it includes a spoiler feature that lets you filter out tracks that, somehow, might spoil a game you haven’t played or finished yet. And if you just want some Hyrule white noise, the app also lets you “loop songs or extend select tracks to 15, 30, or 60 minutes for uninterrupted listening.”</p><div><p>Here’s <a href="https://support.m.nintendo.com/hc/en-us/articles/10463992555535-In-which-regions-will-Nintendo-Music-be-available">a list of all the regions</a> the app will be available in.</p></div><div><p>The announcement of Nintendo Music comes not long after a handful of other surprise, non-<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Switch 2 reveals from Nintendo</a>, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">the launch of an alarm clock</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo">a mysterious MMO that’s currently in testing</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, has gone on record stating that Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty launch <strong>ever</strong>. This news came amid Microsoft’s first-quarter earnings call, held just days after Black Ops 6 hit the market.</p>



<p>This was the first Call of Duty game to be released on Game Pass on day one, which was a huge win for Xbox. It was mentioned by Nadella that the launch of Black Ops 6 set a record for the number of new Game Pass subscriber adds.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>Speaking during the Microsoft call, Satya Nadella said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Last week’s launch of Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty release ever, setting a record for day one players as well as Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day. </p>



<p>And unit sales on&nbsp;PlayStation&nbsp;and Steam were also up over 60% year-over-year. This speaks to our strategy of meeting gamers where they are by enabling them to play more games across the screens they spend their time on.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since dropping worldwide, Black Ops 6 has gone from strength to strength. We reviewed it at launch and awarded it a lofty score, recommending that Call of Duty fans everywhere invest in this wondrous game. From the campaign to the Zombies, and from the multiplayer to everything that’s coming next, it’s well worth the time and effort you’ll pour into it.</p>



<p>On November 14, the game’s first season will go live, introducing the first content drop, amongst other things. Also, on November 1, Nuketown returns to Call of Duty, with Treyarch having assembled a remaster of the original map that appeared in 2010’s Black Ops.</p>



<p>Have you played Black Ops 6 yet? Do you think it’s one of the best games in the series? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, one of the most graphically demanding and visually impressive games in recent years, will soon get a Mac release, according to developer and publisher CD Projekt Red.</p>
<p>The announcement was published on <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/50947/just-announced-cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-coming-to-mac">CD Projekt Red's blog</a> and also appeared briefly during Apple's pre-recorded MacBook Pro announcement video. The game will be sold on the Mac App Store, Steam, GOG, and the Epic Game Store when it launches, and it will be labeled the <em>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</em>, which simply means it also includes <em>Phantom Liberty</em>, the expansion that was released a couple of years after the original game.</p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk 2027</em> launched in a rough state in 2020, especially on low-end hardware. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/it-cost-120m-for-cyberpunk-2077-patches-and-dlc-to-fix-the-games-image/">Subsequent patches and a significant overhaul</a> with <em>Phantom Liberty</em> largely redeemed it in critics' eyes—the result of all that post-launch work is the version Mac users will get.</p>
<p>Apple has been working with AAA game publishers to try and get the games they made for consoles or Windows gaming PCs onto the Mac or iPhone, including <em>Assassin's Creed </em><em>Mirage</em>, <em>Death Stranding</em>, and <em>Resident Evil</em> <em>Village</em>, among others. But the addition of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is notable because of its history of running poorly on low-end hardware, and because it uses new technologies like ray-traced illumination, reflections, and shadows. It also heavily relies on AI upscaling like DLSS or FSR to be playable even on high-end machines.</p>

            <p>
Nightingale developer Inflexion Games has announced the closure of its UK office and the "restructuring" of its Canadian studio, saying its Victorian fantasy survival game's early access launch "hasn't been successful enough to continue [at our] previous size".
</p>
<p>
Nightingale released into Steam early access back in February, hitting a peak of 47,569 concurrent players. But as those numbers rapidly dwindled and reviews remained middling, Inflexion boss Aaryn Flynn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nightingale-developer-admits-its-not-happy-with-games-current-state-after-disappointing-launch">admitted</a> things were "not quite where we want them to be". Six months later, Flynn shared a similar sentiment despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nightingale-introduces-highly-requested-offline-mode-in-new-early-access-update">efforts to improve the situation</a>, telling players, "We are not satisfied with where the game is at, we're not satisfied with the overall sentiment, we're not satisfied with our player numbers".
</p>
<p>
And, unfortunately, Inflexion is now beginning to feel the impact of Nightingale's early access struggles more acutely. Following last week's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/inflexion-games-uk-division-is-reportedly-closing-down">reports</a> Inflexion was poised to close its UK arm, the studio has confirmed the news in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayNightingale/status/1851671600078143563">message shared on social media</a>.

<p>
"The past few weeks here at Inflexion have been incredibly challenging, and no words can adequately express the sadness we feel," Flynn wrote in the statement. "Like many other studios over the past few years, we have been hit by the stark realities of the industry, and after exploring every possible option, we've had to make the difficult decision to let go of some of our remarkable and talented team members." Flynn did not specify the extent of the layoffs, but <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dozens-of-staff-laid-off-at-inflexion-as-part-of-restructuring">GamesIndustry.biz sources</a> claim "at least 22 people" will be impacted by the reductions "based on internal communications they've had access to."
</p><p>
"Although we're proud of what we've accomplished with Nightingale to date - as well as the enthusiasm and support from our community," Flynn continued, "the Early Access release hasn't been commercially successful enough to continue development at our studio's previous size. As a result, we're undergoing a restructuring process in Canada, and we will also be closing our UK office. Our priority is to support each member of the team affected by the reductions as they search for new opportunities. We thank them for their invaluable contributions to Nightingale - it would not have been possible without their immense talent and passion for adventuring in the Faewilds".
</p>
<p>
"While this is a difficult moment for the entire team, we will continue to work tirelessly, alongside our players, as we move forward as a studio", Flynn concluded, adding he would be "available to answer questions from the community" and providing more details on future Nightingale updates soon. "I hope our players will join me in expressing heartfelt thanks to our departing team members for everything they've contributed to."

Today's news continues a devastating 2024 for the games industry, with around 13,000 industry employees believed to have lost their jobs since the start of the year - and that's in addition to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">10,500 workers laid off in 2023</a>. So why are these layoffs occurring? GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Dring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">shared his thoughts</a> earlier this year.
