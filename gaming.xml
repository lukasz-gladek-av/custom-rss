<p>"Major" DLC also announced for Sparking! ZERO</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Dragon Ball series is currently celebrating its 40th anniversary, and as part of a special 'Dragon Ball Genkidamatsuri' event this week, Bandai Namco has shared some video game announcements.</p>
<p>First up, there's <a href="https://en.dragon-ball-official.com/news/01_3963.html">"breaking news"</a> regarding the latest game in the works. It's the official announcement of the new game project "<strong>AGE 1000</strong>". This title has <a href="https://screenrant.com/dragon-ball-new-anime-game-age-1000-confirmed-2026/">reportedly been in development</a> for around seven years now and features a new "never-before-seen world and characters" from legend and series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/akira-toriyama-the-dragon-ball-dragon-quest-and-chrono-trigger-artist-that-inspired-the-world">creator Akira Toriyama</a>, who passed away in 2024.</p>
<p>AGE 1000 is currently "set for 2027", although no platforms have been revealed at this point in time. There's already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1qm6ekl/comment/o1jvyhv/">plenty of speculation</a> about the title as well. Dragon Ball fans can expect more information to be shared at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026, which is taking place between 18th -19th April this year.</p>

<p>In some other Dragon Ball video game news, Bandai Namco and Spike Chunsoft have announced a new "major" DLC for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Super Saiyan Bardock, Super Android 17 (GT), Great Demon King Piccolo, and more will be joining the lineup of playable characters! Plus, customizations for skills and outfits, new stages, and a new single player mode are planned to be added!</p>
<p>This fabulous DLC is scheduled for release on PlayStation®5, Xbox Series X|S, and STEAM® in summer 2026, with more details on the Nintendo Switch™ and Nintendo Switch™ 2 release to come!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ahead of this new DLC, there'll also be some free updates including 'Mission 100' mode (where you take on missions as your favourite characters) and 'Survival Mode'. This content will arrive later on the Switch and Switch 2, with DLC 1 and DLC 2 to arrive first at some point in Winter and Spring 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dragon Ball ‘AGE 1000’ is Revealed, and Fans Think It’s Dragon Ball Online 2]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-age-1000-fans-dragon-ball-online/</link>
            <guid>1415407</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Dragon Ball team recently revealed an all-new project, codenamed ‘AGE 1000’, set to be released in 2027. In a short trailer posted online that showcased a never-before-seen character, it was confirmed that a full reveal will take place on April 18 during Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to pick up on the AGE 1000 reference, which until now, has only been used in connection with Dragon Ball Online. This MMORPG debuted in 2010 but has long since been shut down, being replaced somewhat by <em>Xenoverse</em>.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-dragon-ball-game-coming-2027">New Dragon Ball Game Coming 2027</h2>



<p>The Dragon Ball team wrote on social media that AGE 1000 offers ‘a new world and new characters brought to life by Akira Toriyama,’ the father of Dragon Ball. You can see the two-minute teaser trailer below:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Announcing a New Dragon Ball Game Project, "AGE 1000", set for 2027!<br>A new world and new characters brought to life by Akira Toriyama!</p><p> The latest updates will be unveiled at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026 in the U.S. on April 18-19.<br>Stay tuned for more information. <a href="https://t.co/ouBqvz5FwA">pic.twitter.com/ouBqvz5FwA</a></p></div>— Dragon Ball Games (@dragonballgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonballgames/status/2015246051461210565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Eagle-eyed fans spotted the AGE 1000 reference in seconds, pointing out that, until now, the only other game to use that setting was Dragon Ball Online.</p>



<p>In <strong>that </strong>game, players are transported to the age 1000 in a time-traveling adventure that sees them explore an open-world environment, search for Dragon Balls, and interact with NPCs and other players on their journey. It boasted multiple classes and races, several settings in terms of time and location, and diverse quest mechanics.</p>



<p>While Dragon Ball Online died years ago, <em>Xenoverse </em>almost took its place, adopting the core story elements and character creation features that surfaced in DBO.</p>



<p>This is why fans think AGE 1000 is a direct follow-on (or reboot) of Dragon Ball Online.</p>

<p>Following the release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mysims_cozy_bundle">MySims Cozy Bundle</a>, there's reportedly been a new EA survey sent out to select Sims players, and it's believed to be hinting at a new MySims game for the Switch and other platforms.</p>
<p>It apparently suggests the game would be a "cozy, collaborative adventure simulation" title where players can "explore a whimsical world, customize their village, befriend residents &amp; pets, and uncover delightful secrets".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067oygzwu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>This title would supposedly offer solo play and multiplayer with "up to four friends". Many <a href="https://simscommunity.info/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/new-mysims-game-features.jpg">other features are listed</a>, too. This latest development follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/rumour-removed-ea-app-listings-suggest-more-mysims-revivals-might-be-on-the-horizon">discovery of some MySims game listings</a> in January last year.</p>
<p>Following the release of MySims on the Switch, EA's CEO Andrew Wilson mentioned how the Cozy Bundle had performed "well ahead" of the third-party giant's expectations.</p>
<p>In our review, we gave the Switch bundle seven out of ten stars and said the titles were still engaging and easygoing spin-offs.</p>

<p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/rayman">Rayman</a> series is currently celebrating 30 years, and it seems an announcement could be taking place soon.</p>
<p>A new rating has appeared on the Australian Classification Board for <strong>Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition</strong>. The classification took place on 22nd January 2026. Additional details list Atari as the developer and publisher, and UI Entertainment as the applicant.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8ee436245b45a"><a title="Rayman - Game Boy Color Box Art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ee436245b45a/rayman-game-boy-color-box-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ubisoft kicked off Rayman's 30th anniversary celebrations last September and it followed with some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/">rumours about a Rayman Remake</a>.</p>
<p>The original 2D <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/rayman">Rayman</a> platformer launched in 1995. On Nintendo platforms, this eventually followed with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/eshop/rayman_gbc">Game Boy Color version</a>, a Game Boy Advance port, and years later <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/dsiware/rayman">Rayman</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2009/12/rayman_dsiware">for DSiWare</a>. In December last year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</a> was added to the Switch Online's Nintendo 64 library.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytJEHFv10kUS0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6rtpqiy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>This rating follows news of Ubisoft's major organisational restructure. Rayman has been confirmed as being part of the company's future plans. Its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">creative house 'CH4'</a> will be responsible for the IP and other "narrative adventure" series such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/prince_of_persia_the_sands_of_time">Prince of Persia</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/beyond_good_and_evil">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a>.</p>

The cover features top WWE stars from that era, like The Rock, Stone Cold, and Triple H. There are also top WCW wrestlers from the 90s, such as Goldberg and the nWo.</p>



<p>Pre-orders begin on January 30.</p>

<p>As announced on January 23, WWE 2K26 will also have a special <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/attitude-era-edition-of-wwe-2k26-revealed-pre-orders-soon/">Attitude Era edition</a>. The key art for that edition features many legends from the 1990s and 2000s. WWE and 2K have yet to announce who will be featured on the standard edition of the game. Still, much more information has been revealed about the forthcoming WWE video game.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/">As first reported by Insider Gaming, </a>four new match types will be playable in this year’s release. WWE 2K26 will introduce the new Dumpster Match while reviving three classic match types once playable in previous games: the Inferno Match, the I Quit Match, and 3 Stages of Hell. </p>



<p>Also, the Island mode is slated to return this year with an all-new storyline providing the backdrop for the open-world action. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-island-returns-wwe-2k26-new-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>







<p>As of now, 2K Games has not announced any perks for pre-ordering the game, but noted the Monday Night War Edition would provide access to the most content. There’s also no set release date or price point. Previous iterations of the game have released in March. Insider Gaming will keep you up-to-date with the latest WWE 2K26 news.</p>

            <p>
How do teens in IT classes waste their time these days? When I was a young whippersnapper, when my teacher wasn't looking I'd head to sites like Miniclip, Nitrome, wherever I could get my hands on some Flash games, to play all sorts of little oddities, particularly system heavy ones that were fun to mess around with for 10 minutes once in a while. Games like that feel rare now with the death of Flash, but I think Tower Lab, a physics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> tower defence deckbuilder where you attempt to blast enemies off a ledge into an infinite void to their demise, feels pretty close.
</p>
<p>
Tower Lab works thusly: there are two portals, one where variously coloured upright beans are emitted, another where they enter. You are presented with a selection of cards, all of which cost a certain amount of points, points which you are in limited supply of, that allow you to plant different bits of machinery to try and shove these enemy beans off a ledge.

<p>
These machines come in a range of flavours. For example, one is quite simply a fan, turning on every so often to attempt to push the beans off. Some beans are too heavy, however, so you might place a shrink ray earlier along the tower so that they're easier to blow off. A gif on the game's Steam page shows how you can take this even further by shrinking them down, making them weightless, blowing them away, before making them even larger than before so that they fall to their deaths. Systems! They're quite neat, and from what I can tell your technical know-how will be put to the test more and more over the course of the game's various levels.
</p><p>
This is exactly the kind of game I would have loved messing about with as a distracted teen. IT class is a waste of time! But a game like Tower Lab isn't. It's quite satisfying in small doses, and levels don't waste your time either. I quite like the foundations that have been laid here, and look forward to recreating scenes from my youth when it launches later this year. In the meantime, you can wishlist the game on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3084810/Tower_Lab/">here</a>.

            <guid>1415281</guid>

			<div data-nosnippet="">
		
		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>

			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>The rumors of a <strong>Resident Evil Code Veronica Remake</strong> have gotten a lot louder over the past month. To kick things off, dedicated CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-resident-evil-remakes-code-veronica-2027-zero-2028/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed in mid-December</a> that Code Veronica and <strong>Resident Evil Zero</strong> would be <strong>the next remakes</strong> on the schedule, with the former targeting a 2027 launch and the latter aiming for a 2028 debut. A few days ago, he added that the closest game to release <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-resident-evil-remake-that-starts-with-c-and-ends-ode-veronica-will-be-announced-this-year-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would be formally announced sometime in 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Now, though, we have another renowned insider confirming the rumor and even adding to it. <strong>Nate the Hate</strong>, probably <strong>the most reliable insider</strong> at the moment (he also won the <strong>'Leaker of the Year'</strong> award in a community poll on Reddit's GamingLeaksAndRumors), <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2014767509803512263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on X</a>:</p>



<p><em>Yes, Code Veronica is being remade and deep in development. Target of release is the first half of 2027.</em></p>



<p>This means we might be just a year and a few months away from being able to play the game. So far, all three Resident Evil remakes have been successful, although 2 and 4 have been more successful and critically acclaimed than 3. RE2 Remake is now <strong>CAPCOM's third best-selling game of all time</strong> with <strong>16.30 million units</strong>, only behind Monster Hunter World and Rise, and the far more recent RE4 Remake (which launched in March 2023) is closing in with <strong>11.10 million units</strong> already sold. RE3 Remake, on the other hand, is at <strong>10.60 million units</strong>, which is still not shabby.</p>



<p>In late 2023, CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-more-remakes-coming-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> they were working on more remakes. Franchise fans had long been yearning for the Resident Evil Code Veronica Remake, and for good reason: <strong>the original game was originally an exclusive for SEGA's final console, the Dreamcast</strong>. Sure, it eventually launched on PlayStation 2 and later on GameCube, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, but by then, it was old and didn't get much traction. </p>



<p>For those who haven't played it and are looking forward to this remake, the game takes place about three months after Resident Evil 2. Its protagonists are <strong>the Redfield siblings</strong>, Claire and Chris, who desperately try to survive a viral outbreak <strong>at a remote prison island in the Southern Ocean</strong> and <strong>a research facility in Antarctica</strong>.</p>

<p>Rayman is getting a 30th Anniversary game, and it has been rated in Australia.</p>



<p>Rayman was Ubisoft’s mascot at one time, and while the series may be best known today for introducing the Rabbids, Rayman was one of the premier adventure-platforming titles. The original game was released in 1995 for PC, Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation, and Atari Jaguar, and now a 30th-anniversary edition is coming to modern consoles.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson recently stated on <a href="https://youtu.be/8rRejJWM3jg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Insider Gaming Weekly podcast</a> that two Rayman projects were in the works at Ubisoft, and while one, codenamed “Steamboat,” is believed to be a remake of Rayman Legends, Insider Gaming understands that this project is currently under the codename “Iceman.”</p>

<h2 id="h-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-s-rating-in-australia">Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition’s Rating in Australia</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Australian classification </a>has rated the currently unannounced title as G, safe for the General Public, with very mild content and minimal impact. Specifically, this game is noted as having very mild violence. The classification date is listed as Thursday, January 22, 2026.</p>



<p>The game is listed for release on both the Nintendo Switch and the Sony PlayStation 5. Atari is listed as both the publisher and developer. Atari also handles the remakes and new releases in the once-popular Bubsy franchise.</p>







<p>Even though Rayman is no longer the face of the Ubisoft franchise, this remake comes at a time when Ubisoft is undergoing a massive restructuring in its own right. Recently, the planned remake for Prince of Persia: Sands of Time was shelved as the company moves forward in a new direction. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Sometimes, the world you live in sucks. It is a place filled with despair, and misery, and blood, guts, and death. This is much the case with the world of Mörk Borg, an apocalyptic fantasy TTRPG where you have no sense of hope, only dread, that is now also a video game. This video game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mork-borg-heresy-supreme">Mörk Borg Heresy Supreme</a>, is more of an action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, though its tabletop routes are still to be found, and it is as mean as it is darkly enchanting.
</p>
<p>
Stylistically it very much takes after its original book form, using only black, white, yellow and red for its colour scheme (you can guess what the red is used for). In the demo version of the game there is only one class to choose from, whose stats and starting weapon are randomly generated. Though, you can just re-roll infinitely until you get something you've happy with, an ability I hope is limited in the full release.

<p>
To start, you are tasked with finding a troll finger. You set out into the world, this miserable little world, on a 2D plane, your only directional options being left or right. When you finally meet enemies, you can slash at them with your weapon, be it a femur, a knife, or a scimitar you pick up after slicing a skeleton in half. There's a dodging mechanic, you both consume items for health or lob them at your opponents for damage, this starting class can also kick or block with a shield. It is laborious in a way that teeters on the edge of being insufferable, though I expect it'll fall right off for some.
</p><p>
Everything is slow, some of it perhaps a bit too much so, yet there's a method to the madness. You don't have much health, so timing a block or a dodge and a slash at just the right time is important. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> comparisons are all but guaranteed to be made in future reviews. I died quite quickly, of course, this game is tough and cares not for your happiness. Dying almost seems like it's the point, especially with its lightly procedurally generated world.
</p>
<p>
The RPGness of it all comes in the occasional dice roll, a digital D20 randomly deciding your fate, your character's attributes assisting or impeding said rolls. Levelling up comes at set points apparently, with some skills improving, others worsening. It is a player hostile game, one that begs for you to challenge it, and that'll be a boon for many, and a curse for many more.
</p>
<p>
It's too early for me to say whether I like the thing or not, but I can say I'll be curious to give it another look whenever it does come out. In the meantime, you can check out the demo, or just wishlist it, on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3216800/MRK_BORG_Heresy_Supreme/">here</a>.

        <p>Though I don't totally buy it</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Soon after it launched in 2019, Taiwanese horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devotion">Devotion</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devotion-disappears-from-steam-after-pooh-review-bombing">pulled from sale</a> following some controversy regarding Chinese president Xi Jinping and Winnie The Pooh (long story). It was made available for purchase again <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devotion-devs-are-selling-it-themselves-after-gog-chickened-out">a couple of years later</a>, though it should have been a touch earlier than that as it was promised to be released on GOG late 2020. However, on the same day it was announced to be returning, GOG put out a statement saying they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-back-down-from-re-releasing-devotion">wouldn't be releasing it after all</a>. Now, half a decade on from that, managing director Maciej Gołębiewski reflects on the decision to not put it up for sale, after it stood by selling the also controversial Horses.
</p>
<p>
"That situation remains difficult to reflect on," Gołębiewski told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-reflects-on-devotion-delisting">Eurogamer</a> in an interview. "At the time, we made that decision in the context of very real business constraints, a limited understanding of the complex geopolitical factors at play, and a lack of good options that would both protect GOG and partners and allow the game to be released responsibly. In hindsight, we acknowledge that this decision - and the way we communicated it - understandably damaged the trust our users have in us."
</p>
<p>
Gołębiewski went on to say that in order to keep a "global digital storefront operating means navigating legal, operational, and commercial realities that don't always allow for ideal outcomes. In 2020, we chose a path we believed was best for GOG, even though it came at a cost to our credibility." 
</p>
<p>
When it comes to a game like Horses, which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">banned from sale on Steam supposedly over an outdated scene</a>, he feels that the situation was different, saying that its sale on GOG didn't pose any "legal, political, or operational risk to our business or partners. There was no other concern driving this decision, just a straightforward evaluation of the game itself."
</p><p>
I am not entirely convinced by his reasoning, I have to say. GOG explained that they were pulling Devotion from sale at the time <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1339227388438306817">like so</a>: "After receiving many messages from gamers, we have decided not to list the game in our store." Of course, this might have just been the public reason presented at the time, and Gołębiewski is now telling the true version of events, but I find it a bit tough to believe that they hadn't considered the potential business and geopolitical factors up to that point (the game was nearly two years old by this point). Still, better to have at least one storefront that willingly releases games with difficult themes occasionally than not at all, I suppose.

<p>As Nintendo continues to celebrate Milestones like the 40th anniversaries of the Super Mario and Legend of Zelda franchises, key developers from Nintendo’s history are entering the next phases of their lives as well.</p>



<p>Legendary producer Kensuke Tanabe recently announced that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be his final game at Nintendo. The news was shared in an interview with the Japanese magazine<a href="https://www.ndw.jp/category/news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Nintendo Dream</a>, which was later posted on<a href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309405257646218805574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Weibo.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-kensuke-tanabe-confirms-he-s-worked-on-his-last-title-at-nintendo">Kensuke Tanabe Confirms He’s Worked On His Last Title at Nintendo</h2>



<p>As <span>reported by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/veteran-nintendo-producer-kensuke-tanabe-known-for-metroid-and-paper-mario-reportedly-confirms-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><span>Vi</span>deo Games Chronicle</a>, Tanabe confirmed that he will no longer be involved in the studio’s production, but trusts that Risa Tabata and the team at Retro Studios will be able to continue moving forward should that be what Nintendo requests.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Completing this game took far longer than anticipated… Furthermore, I have confirmed that I will no longer be involved in the production of the series moving forward. Whether a sequel will be made is still uncertain, but I sincerely hope that one day, Ms Tabata and Retro Studios will be able to tell this story completely and bring it to a close.</p>



<p>It’s been 40 years since I joined Nintendo. Metroid Prime 4 will be my final title developed at Nintendo.</p>



<p>However, we didn’t set out to create anything ‘special’ because of this. Instead, we worked closely with Retro Studios, just as we always have with Nintendo projects, aiming to deliver a fun and unique experience for players of all ages and playstyles.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>Following news about Tanabe, it was also confirmed that Hideki Konno, known for launching the Mario Kart franchise, left the studio in July 2025. </p>



<p>The news was confirmed via his private Facebook account. He received a special thanks credit in the recent Mario Kart World release and last worked on the Mario Kart 8: Deluxe DLC for the original Nintendo Switch.</p>







<p>Shigeru Miyamoto, the man behind the Mario and Zelda franchises, remains on board at Nintendo. Currently, he has been working closely with Universal on the release of the Super Mario Bros. movies. The forthcoming Super Mario Galaxy movie is due to release in April 2026. A Nintendo Direct will reveal new information about the movie on January 25.

<p>The head of Xbox Games Studio has commented on the mindset and strategy behind XGS-produced games landing on PlayStation and Nintendo consoles.</p>



<p>The days of the console wars of the 2000s, pitting Xbox, Nintendo, and Sony consoles against each other, have come and gone. These days, the Xbox team wants players to get behind the idea that everything is an Xbox. As part of the strategy, Xbox’s first-party games are beginning to release on PlayStation 5 and the Nintendo Switch family of consoles.</p>



<p>Recently, Xbox announced that the forthcoming Fable reboot and Forza Horizon 6 would both be coming to PlayStation 5, with Fable releasing across all consoles on the same day and Forza coming to Xbox platforms in May with a later release on PlayStation.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-head-of-xbox-game-studios-discusses-multiplatform-release-strategy">The Head of Xbox Game Studios Discusses Multiplatform Release Strategy</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/were-going-to-try-and-be-more-consistent-with-what-we-do-the-head-of-xbox-game-studios-on-the-developer-direct-reveals-multiplatform-strategy-and-hard-lessons-learned-from-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">During the recent interview with Games Radar+,</a> Craig Duncan of XGS stated that his main focus is to ensure as many players as possible get to experience Xbox-produced titles. </p>



<p>When questioned about the consistency of titles across different platforms, Duncan admitted that, while strategies and realities change, they’re aiming to be more consistent with multiplatform releases in the near future.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There’s always development realities about when these projects start – how big a team is, and what plans we have at the start of development. Like you said, when a strategy changes, maybe you’ve got a plan that exists with a game and maybe you can adopt that, maybe you can’t. So that’s why. And to be clear, this is totally fair feedback. Sometimes we are inconsistent. You see some games in one place, some games in multiple places. Just know that we’re going to work on that, and we’re going to try and be more consistent with what we do.</p>



<p>But you know, for our game makers, if you’re on the Fable team, you just want as many people who love Fable to appreciate the great work that the team’s doing. That’s always our goal. It’s rarely more complicated than that. It’s like, how can we get this game to as many players as we can?</p>

            <p>Highguard is set to pull back the curtain with an "in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio" on 26th January, which also just so happens to be the same day the free-to-play live-service hero shooter is expected to launch.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qR9Xbzt5t0">"official launch showcase"</a> will reportedly include a "full gameplay deep dive", plus plans for the game's inaugural year and "much more", which is just as well, as we have heard extraordinarily little about the all-new PvP raid shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">since its announcement trailer</a> at last month's The Game Awards, which you can see below.</p>

<p>Despite buying time to showcase the game at The Game Awards (or maybe because of it?), developer Wildlight Entertainment has shared very little since, which means we're just a few days off from release with just a 180-second reveal trailer to show for it. If it wasn't for the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-shows-signs-of-life-less-than-one-week-away-from-launch">Steam activity has picked up in recent days</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-really-is-alive-and-even-has-a-ps5-trophy-list">PS5 trophy list</a> has popped up, you'd be forgiven for thinking it had been delayed.</p><p>Hailing from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, Highguard is a PvP raid shooter which will see players "ride, fight, and raid as Wardens". That is to say, "arcane gunslingers" who have been sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. Hopefully we'll find out more when the showcase goes live at 6pm UK time on Monday, 26th January.</p>
<p>As for that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-really-is-alive-and-even-has-a-ps5-trophy-list">PlayStation 5 trophy list for Highguard</a>? There'll be 33 PS5 trophies in total, including Plunderer, which is awarded when a player opens and acquires loot from at least 15 chests in a single match, and Animal Control for eliminating 20 enemy mounts.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">Roguelike</a> deckbuilders! They're everywhere! It's a bit of an epidemic, honestly, sorting the wheat from chaff is a tough job. Of course, once in a while a genuinely novel take on the genre rolls around, and PinKeep has done just that, a pinball game where you change the playfield as you progress through runs. And it's from the devs behind the Far series and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/herdling">Herdling</a>!
</p>
<p>
The pinball element is likely self explanatory. There's a ball, it gets shot off, and you have two flippers to hit it with, nothing new there. It's everything else around it that'll have you thinking about the beautiful game (in this world the beautiful game is pinball). Runs are split up into different themed stages, and it's up to you to add elements to the main playing field.
</p>

<a aria-label="PinKeep | Demo Launch Trailer | OUT NOW!" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RuBkEa1HFFE?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
So, for example, say you want a bumper somewhere on the field to propel your ball along, you choose from the cards you've collected, and place it at various fixed points. You can rotate such structures to your liking, but to play these cards you need to spend money. To get money, you need to use your ball to destroy trees and rocks. Then you collect resources from these destroyed elements of nature, selling them to merchants at the top of the screen, of which you get to by flinging your ball successfully towards them.
</p><p>
This is further complicated by enemies slowly progressing towards your town of operations, and if they manage to reach you, you lose a bit of health. You'd think hitting enemies would be as much a bit of luck as it is skill, but you also have the ability to slow down time and flick your ball anytime you like, allowing you to line it up just so to take down an enemy combatant.
</p>
<p>
All this took some getting used to, with the fast-paced nature of pinball mixed with slowing down to plot out where you want being an interesting tactical exercise. The thing is, I just don't think you can go wrong with pinball, but the way you can build upon it here makes it much more strategic. Take the aforementioned bumper you can add in. It comes with the added effect of a little goblin that sits on top of it who shoots out arrows at incoming arrows if you hit said bumper.
</p>
<p>
When you build up your field just right there's a nice harmony to it all. I do wonder if adding in changes to the slow motion flick or the flippers themselves would add something or overcomplicate things, but as it is in its current demo, PinKeep is heading in the right direction. You can try it out for yourself, or just wishlist it, right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4143700">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The ARC Raiders Headwinds season launches on Tuesday, January 27, 2026. The expansion brings several updates to the game, including new cosmetics, new quests, a new map condition, and a new matchmaking level option for those who have reached level 40 or higher. This is in addition to other items and general quality-of-life updates.</p>



<p>The ARC Raiders team announced the arrival on social media. This is only the first step in the roadmap, which outlines plans for the game through April 2026 and promises even more content for the popular extraction shooter.</p>

<p>Players will still have to wait until April for a new map, expected to be a waterborne map, to arrive in the game, something that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-fans-disappointed-new-map-wait/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not all players are happy about.</a> However, the game has been an overall success, netting over 10 million sales since its release in the latter half of 2025.</p>

            <p>Despite the death threats he faced when first deciding to bring Konami's horror franchise to the big screen, director of the third Silent Hill movie, Return to Silent Hill, would be open to adapting a further game for the big screen.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/film/features/return-to-silent-hill-director-death-threats-game-fans-1236638923/">Variety</a>, director Christophe Gans said that whilst critics panned 2006's Silent Hill adaptation, "the reputation of the movie has grown", giving him a new audience in the "2.0 generation of Silent Hill lovers" that he hopes to tap into for this new adaptation of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>.</p>

<p>"If I have the opportunity, we'll come back to Silent Hill once more," he said. "I'm not looking at Silent Hill only as a great video game. I'm looking at it as a piece of modern art. It has something really edgy and experimental. I will adapt another chapter because there are some that are extremely good, something very different from the first film, and now Return to Silent Hill. I like this world, and I can see that plenty of people are thinking I'm doing a pretty good job."</p>
<p>Gans also revealed that when he announced interest in adapting the series for 2006's Silent Hill, he received "plenty" of death threats.</p>
<p>"It was a big challenge to adapt correctly and respectfully a game which is considered a classic," Gans added. "We know that the people who love video games are very passionate. I remember when I did the first film, I received plenty of death threats. People were saying, 'If you mess up this one, we are going to find you.' So I came onto the first film with great responsibility, and certainly even more with the second one. At the same time, it was important for me to imagine a movie that people who are not playing games can be interested in."</p><p>Return to Silent Hill is part of a resurgence of Konami's horror franchise, following the success of Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake and last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>. Unfortunately, it's not faring much better than its panned predecessor, Silent Hill Revelation: at the time of writing, it's sitting at 31 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/return-to-silent-hill/">Metacritic</a> (and a 4.4 user score), and 15 on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/return_to_silent_hill">Rotten Tomatoes</a> (30% user score). Admittedly, it's only the end of January, but that makes it the worst-reviewed movie of the year to date on both Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes, and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/movie/?releaseYearMin=2025&amp;releaseYearMax=2026&amp;page=20">one of the worst released over the last 12 months</a>.</p>
<p>By comparison, Silent Hill: Revelation has a Metacritic score of 16 (4.5 from users).</p>
