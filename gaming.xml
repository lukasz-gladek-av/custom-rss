<p>It was a somewhat quieter week in Nintendo Land this time, but there were still a few nice stories to keep us entertained. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-to-acquire-bandai-namco-studios-singapore-as-a-subsidiary">Nintendo picked up Bandai Namco Studios Singapore</a> as a subsidiary, we got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-update-1-0-2-patch-notes-new-quests-weapons-and-battles-added">brand-new content update</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-nes-and-game-boy-library-with-four-more-titles">four new titles</a> arrived on the Nintendo Switch Online NES and Game Boy libraries, <em>and</em> the Switch 2 landed a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-1-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">system update</a>.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This is my final weekend before <em>all the games</em> release, so I'm determined to wrap up <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> and get a run or two of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a> under my belt. Yes, these are the same two games that I have been playing every weekend for weeks now, and no, I will not apologise for that.</p>
<p>I'm already nervously eyeing all the titles I'll want to pick up in the next seven days, so I'll be trying to enjoy having some money while I can. That said, there's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/switch-2-black-friday-deals-are-a-bit-meh-but-here-are-the-best-weve-seen">Black Friday deal</a> on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> that's looking <em>particularly</em> tempting...</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'd like to give <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/outlaws_plus_handful_of_missions_remaster">Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</a> a shot this weekend if I get chance – it looks so cool! Other than that, a quick dive into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> before the fourth entry drops sounds like it might be on the cards. Have a good weekend, folks!</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>I forgot to mention that last weekend I went to the 10th edition of Lisboa Games Week. As one of the leading video game culture shows in Portugal, it is always a great place to meet old friends, make new ones and play the latest upcoming chart toppers. Nintendo had the biggest show floor ever, right at the main entrance, so it was impossible to miss all that Switch 2 red-tinted area. I was surprised to have play time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a>, both running their demo builds quite smoothly. The main reason that made me not stay at home was hands-on with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>… and I was smiling the whole way. The latest entry in the series came out in 2007, I was an entirely different person back then. With the imminent release, I am clearing my schedule to ensure that it is all Samus Aran from next week onwards (and yes, my head is still back there, I got me a bad case of post-convention blues!).</p>
<p>My game of the week is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>. Will I be able to complete it before next week? Certainly not. Will I be redecorating the streets of Kamurochō with every street thug foolish enough to look me sideways until then? Put your money on the Dragon of Dojima, and you will never be poor again.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>Not much time for gaming this weekend, as the HOLIDAY TIME has begun. I've got a Christmas party, a Christmas craft market, a house Christmas decoration plan, and a (not-Christmas) D&amp;D session.</p>
<p>But I did just buy <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/outer_worlds_2">Outer Worlds 2</a> in the Steam Sale, like I said I would last week. So mayyyyyybe I can find the time in between all the Christmas...</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I'm still playing and loving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a>, and the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> update has got me surveying the state of my museum. Bugs, fossils, and fish-wise, I'm 100% complete, but my art gallery is perhaps 20% finished. So, I've started hitting Redd up on Harv's Island to see about changing that.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I'm dipping into the Namco DLC for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration_-_the_namco_legendary_pack">Atari 50</a>, and the kids are intrigued by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/katamari_damacy_reroll">Katamari Damacy</a>, so it might be time for a Reroll. Have a good one, folks.</p>

			<p>It's been nearly nine years since the release of Dead Rising 4, the latest new entry in CAPCOM's quirky zombie-themed action/adventure series. </p>



<p>At the time of its launch, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-rising-4-review-jolly-hacknslash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was reviewed favorably by Wccftech's Jorge Jimenez</a>, who gave it an 8 out of 10 rating. However, it failed to meet CAPCOM's sales projections, setting the series on a downward trend. Historic developer CAPCOM Vancouver was trying to make a different game afterward, a new IP which would have been set in an alternate version of New York, but that project <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-capcom-vancouver-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was canceled in February 2018</a> and the studio suffered a cut of 20% of its manpower.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Vancouver team had also released a PvP puzzle game titled Puzzle Fighter for mobile devices. However, shortly after the aforementioned layoffs, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-vancouver-focus-dead-rising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly vowed to refocus on its flagship franchise, Dead Rising</a>.</p>



<p>Even that was not enough to save CAPCOM Vancouver from the parent company's axe, which fell on September 18, 2018, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-capcom-vancouver-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down the 14-year-old studio for good</a> with a total cost for the cancelled games estimated at around $40 million. A couple of years later, a rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-vancouver-wanted-to-make-new-dino-crisis-dead-rising-5-before-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the Vancouver team had indeed started working on Dead Rising 5 before its closure. The limited information available suggests that the game was intended to take place in Santa Catarina, Mexico, between Dead Rising 2 and 3, featuring the protagonist of the former game, Chuck Greene.</p>



<p>With CAPCOM finally on a hot stream of game releases in the Resident Evil, Monster Hunter, and Devil May Cry franchises, the revival of this intellectual property didn't seem to be high on their priority. Still, the Deluxe Remaster <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-coming-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was well received</a> (despite some <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-remaster-comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial changes to protagonist Frank West's face</a>) and it also <a href="https://wccftech.com/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-selling-below-dead-rising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">registered solid sales</a>, according to the publisher.</p>



<p>That might have been the key to persuading CAPCOM to give the proverbial green light for a brand new game installment, which MP1st <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-dead-rising-game-development-set-in-hollywood" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now reports is in development</a>. The website's sources reckon a new title has been in the works since at least 2023 under the codename 'Rec'. This upcoming entry will once again feature Frank West and is reportedly going to be a sequel to the very first installment, suggesting that it might take place after DR1 but before DR2. </p>



<p>MP1st adds that the setting will be Hollywood, more specifically, a massive film studio lot where a crazed director forces Frank and other survivors to participate in various insane trials in the pursuit of filming the so-called perfect movie. The director will also send Psychopaths to hinder Frank, including the director's right-hand man, whom MP1st adds Frank had previously saved. This Psychopath is reportedly tasked with filming everything with a bomb strapped to his chest.</p>



<p>The time limit mechanics, a key feature of the Dead Rising franchise that was, however, absent in DR4, are supposedly returning with a vengeance. For instance, the movie director threatens to blow up the entire lot if Frank and the others don't comply with his orders. Of course, Frank's camera is also returning, and franchise fans will see other characters making appearances, including Isabela Keyes.</p>



<p>If the project started in 2023, we might be at least two to three years away from a release, given the average triple-A development timeframe, so best sit tight. Still, would you be happy if CAPCOM confirmed this rumor? Let us know in the comments. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> marks a completely new story where the legendary bounty hunter Samus Aran is unexpectedly transported to the unknown planet Viewros. As you've probably already seen, she's also joined by a team of Galactic Federation soldiers.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4-beyond-difficulty-settings-revealed-by-nintendo">same recently published article</a> on Nintendo's Japanese website, there's an official introduction to the team of soldiers who have also been transported to the same location. Throughout this new adventure, Samus will work and fight alongside all of these characters to return home alive.</p>

<p>The setting and time period of Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series may have been revealed, according to a new report. Even more so, more information regarding the show’s development has emerged online.</p>



<p>Since 2007, the Assassin’s Creed series of games has been going rather strong, spanning eras of history with action-packed gameplay and gripping story. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-live-action-series-ordered-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earlier this year</a>, Netflix announced that it’s working with Ubisoft to develop a live-action Assassin’s Creed series. Multiple ones are apparently in the works, as revealed in the blog from July, but the biggest one just cast <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-series-actor-toby-wallace-euphoria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actor Toby Wallace</a> as co-lead. Now, more information on <strong>the show’s setting has reportedly been revealed</strong>, and <strong>it’s one that fans have been asking for for a long time</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-series-may-take-place-in-ancient-rome-according-to-new-report">Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed Series May Take Place in Ancient Rome, According to New Report</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The report comes from <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-set-to-explore-ancient-rome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive from Nexus Point News</a>, which has previously leaked multiple game adaptations like God of War and Elden Ring. In the article, it mentions that sources have said what Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed’s setting will be: <strong>Ancient Rome</strong>. Specifically, <strong>the show is reportedly taking place between 54-68 AD</strong> during Emperor Nero’s reign. Both Nero and his mentor, Seneca, will be featured in the series. Filming is taking place in Italy, so it does line up there, if true. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the report says that Toby Wallace will be part of<strong> an ensemble cast</strong>, meaning there will be <strong>multiple leads</strong>. It’s important to note that <strong>Ubisoft and Netflix have not confirmed this news</strong>, so <strong>take it with a grain of salt</strong>. Still, Ancient Rome has been asked for by fans for a long time. However, if true, it would mean players would likely not get to play in that time period like they’d hoped to. This would also mean that the show would feature an original story, which is a bit of a risky move. Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see how the show shapes up.</p>







<p>What do you think of Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed setting? Is Ancient Rome a good fit? If true, are you disappointed to not see it in the games? Is doing an original story worth it? Going with an ensemble cast?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Up to extra 6% for subscribers</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPlayer is joining in on the Black Friday and Cyber Monday fun with their <a href="https://seller.tcgplayer.com/cyber-weekend-2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyber Weekend event</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting on November 28 at 9 am ET, trainers will get 10% back in store credit on their TCGPlayer account from whatever they buy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This promotion will be running until December 1, 11 pm ET. So if you've been waiting for your favorite chase cards to go down in value to snap them up, this is it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPlayer does these promotions once or twice a year for a big holiday like Black Friday and Halloween, but this 10% credit offer comes while Pokémon TCG is finding a new floor. </p><div catalogid="0cc34152-a4aa-4aaf-8c84-5d8a17b23349" id="231793"><div id="231793" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>From November 28 at 9am ET to December 1 at 11pm ET</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Shop TCGPlayer Cyber Weekend</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p> 10% in store credit on all products purchased. TCGPlayer Subscribers13%+ (12% base plus 1-3% monthly loyalty bonus).</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That much is clear just by looking at the most recent Pokémon TCG set, Phantasmal Flames. But more on that later, long story short, this is a great time to pick up chase cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But which chase cards should you buy on TCGPlayer's Cyber Weekend? Well, I've handpicked some of the best cards from Mega Evolution, Scarlet and Violet, and the Sword and Shield eras of Pokémon TCG for you to catch. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Modern Chase Cards to Look Out For</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet and Violet has been one of the best era's in recent memory for chase cards with multiple banger sets, and yes I know Evolving Skies from Sword and Shield was insane, more on that later. 151, Black Bolt/White Flare, Destined Rivals, Prismatic Evolutions and Twilight Masquerade collectively hold the most expensive chase cards of this era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's great and all, but it means more money spent on catching the best cards going. Then the latest era, Mega Evolution is off to a flying start with its base set and Phantasmal Flames expansion bringing back Pokémons most popular gimmick from the main games. There's a lot to focus on, just the carousel above will proove that much, but just focus on what stands out to you and what fits into your budget.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the top 5 cards here value wise are Umbreon ex SIR, Mega Charizard X ex SIR, Mega Charizard X ex Gold Hyper Rare, Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex SIR and Mega Lucario ex Gold Hyper Rare. Even though Mega Evolution sets have dropped in value significantly since launch, they're still putting out some of the most valuable cards in modern Pokémon TCG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umbreon is never going to be knocked off the top spot, not even Charizard can do that, but it's going to be the best time to snap it up on TCGPlayer. Let's do some quick math; 10% of $1,294.99 is $129.49, which is going to be the minimum cashabck you'll recieve after purchasing Sunbreon. That means you could put that credit towards Roaring Moon ex SIR from the same set and grab it for $42.14 instead of $171.63. Oh, then you'd also get another 10% cashback from that purchase which is $17.16. It's the best kind of snowball i've ever seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But even with the cashback, Sunbreon will still cost a fortune regardless of how good the deal is, so let's pick out something that you're other half won't kill you (as much) for. Greninja SIR ex from Twilight Masquerade absolutley pops and is easily one of the best artworks in the Scarlet and Violet era. Whilst you might think $325 is steep, this card was touching $380 just a week or two ago. So getting $32.50 back as 10% cashback to effectively get this card for $292.50. Now that's a great investment, which is also the near-mint price.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Scarlet and Violet Promo Cards To Catch</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Scarlet and Violet era has also been a very strong era for promo cards. This means anything from a STAFF stamped card to a Pokémon Center stamped card found inside Pokémon Center-exclusive Elite Trainer Boxes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my favorites from the Scarlet and Violet era is the Paldea Evolved Pokémon Center exclusive Elite Trainer Box (Takes a deep breath). It features Pikachu alongside the Paldea starter Pokémon in a "Let's go suit shopping" pose that has the power to cause genuine cardiac arrest. A stunning card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now considering the exclusive Elite Trainer Box is currently going for $500 sealed right now, the $119 price tag for the card is actually quite cheap. And when you consider the $11.90 cashback you'd get off buying the card, that's not a bad deal at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeping in with the Pikachu theme, one of my favorite promos from Scarlet and Violet that I actually own is Pikachu with Grey Felt Hat. This costs even more than the ETB at $547.99 right now, which is a big drop from around $647 just days ago. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/van-gogh-pikachu-pokemon-card-value-spike-invest-trends-tcg-updated">I've written about the full story behind this infamous card previously</a>, but this is a fantastic time to get this card thanks to the extra $54.79 you'll get in cashback this weekend.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Sword and Shield Chase Cards You Can't Miss</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, we're about to talk about Evolving Skies, well done for waiting until the end of the article. I remember walking into stores on release and not being able to move for Evolving Skies boosters, premium collections and Elite Trainer Boxes, often below MSRP. It's frankly insane how much this set it worth compared to how available it used to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the home of the most valuable Sword and Shield era chase cards for the most part, including Moonbreon, Rayquazza VMAX Alt Art, Umbreon V Alt Art, Dragonite V Alt Art, most of the Eeveelution VMAX Alt Arts and the stunning Rayquaza V Alt full art. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apologies for just going mad listing cards, but this is why it's costing north of $2,000 just for a Booster Box. Of course you'd also get $200 in cashback which is awesome, but just wow. If you're looking to get some big chase cards for a steal in TCGPlayer's Cyber Weekend, start with Evolving Skies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sword and Shield isn't just about one set though, Fusion Strike, Lost Origins and Silver Tempest also have some god tier level grails. The Secret Alt Art of Gengar VMax for example is currently $730, which is over double the worth of the next Fusion Strike chase card down the line, Espeon VMAX Secret Alt Art, running at $329.58 right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for an amazing chase card that isn't going to require a remortgage, Lugia V Alt Full Art from Silver Tempest is a banger. Other than me being really proud of myself getting it for under $150 earlier this year, the mood in this card thanks to Lugia jumping out of the ocean in the middle of a storm over a fisherman is stunning. Hands down the best Lugia Pokémon Card ever printed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TCGPlayer Subscription</h2></div><div catalogid="0cc34152-a4aa-4aaf-8c84-5d8a17b23349" id="231794"><div id="231794" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>(Up to 15% Cashback for Cyber Weekend) Free Shipping and up to 3% Cashback on orders over $35</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>TCGPlayer Subscription</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Free Shipping and up to 3% Cashback on orders over $35</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're planning on snapping up quite a few Pokémon cards in the sale, this is a great time to become a TCGPLayer subscriber. It costs $8.99 a month and gives users free delivers and 1% cashback regardless of the time of year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst this climbs to 3% after a years membership, subscriber will get a boosted 13% cashback over cyber weekend on top of their usual cashback. For longtime members, this could equate to 16% cashback, which is frankly insane.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For even more card recommendations in TCGPlayer's Black Friday/Cyber Weekend sale, check out our brand new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-tcgplayer-cash-back-sale-riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-2025">Riftbound</a> and Magic: The Gathering roundups as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

<p>In a new article on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/ed98179e-b57e-4ae8-8ac5-3cdc5d721661">official Japanese Nintendo website</a>, the difficulty settings in Samus' new mission on Planet Viewros have been detailed. When you start this adventure, you will be able to select from either a 'casual' or 'normal' mode.</p>
<p>Casual mode will lower enemy HP and reduce the amount of damage Samus takes, and is recommended for first-time players. And as you probably guessed, normal mode offers the standard Metroid Prime experience. If you want a tougher challenge, once normal mode is cleared, you'll unlock hard mode.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

            <guid>1367875</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO makes a lot more than just toys for kids: This PAC-MAN arcade cabinet is an example of one of their adult-focused sets that are meant to be displayed rather than played with. This collectible, which is based on nostalgia, recreates <strong>the classic arcade experience from the 1980s with 2,651 pieces of real detail</strong> that both gamers and LEGO collectors will love.</p>
<p>During Black Friday,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6067/"> this set is only $188 on Amazon, down from $269</a> and it is a record-low 30% discount that beats all previous prices. Since it came out, the set has stubbornly kept its $269 launch price with only short sales bringing it down to around $230. This price of $188 is a huge change that will create a lot of value and cause buying frenzies as word spreads through LEGO and gaming communities.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6067/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bring 1980s Games to Life</h2>
<p>The <strong>functional 4-way joystick moves in a way that feels like real arcade controls</strong> with satisfying clicks as you change directions. The coin slot lights up when you press it, and the score display can be changed to show high scores that are special to you like personal gaming achievements or inside jokes. When you open the back panel, you can see the engineering magic that makes static bricks look like they’re moving.</p>



<p>The <strong>rotating display base has figures of PAC-MAN, Blinky, and Clyde</strong> that change direction and behavior when you press buttons which makes for dynamic presentations instead of static poses. As you move through the positions, watch characters switch from chase mode to fleeing mode, just like in the power pellet moment when the hunted becomes the hunter.</p>
<p>The <strong>1980s arcade scene with a gaming mini-figure gives the cabinet a sense of place</strong> in its cultural moment instead of showing it in isolation. The vignette captures the arcade atmosphere where kids fed quarters into machines for hours, bringing back memories for anyone who lived through that time. LEGO’s dedication to authenticity is shown in the way they style their mini-figures, choose their accessories, and add environmental elements.</p>



<p>The<strong> 12.5-inch height makes a big impression on a desk</strong> or shelf without taking over like huge sets with more than 5,000 pieces that are more than two feet tall. The size is perfect for office desks, where the cabinet shows that you like retro games without looking like a toy collection; bedroom shelves, where it goes well with other gaming memorabilia; or entertainment center displays, where it fits in with modern consoles.</p>
<p>The 2,651 pieces make for a satisfying level of building difficulty that<strong> takes experienced builders about 8 to 12 hours to complete</strong>, which makes it a good weekend project or evening building session that lasts for several days. This number of pieces strikes a balance between being fun and easy to get to.</p>
<p>The LEGO PAC-MAN Arcade is now 30% cheaper than the stubborn $269 price that has been in place since it came out, thanks to the record-low Black Friday price of $188. If you’ve wanted this set but didn’t want to pay the usual price, this Black Friday deal makes nostalgic LEGO engineering available before it sells out.</p>

            <guid>1367872</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Board game nights thrive on novelty. So if your board game collection could use some updating, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-sales-2025-best-deals">Black Friday</a> is the time to do it. That’s when you can save up to 50% off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board games</a> of all kinds. Plenty of games are discounted right now, from family-friendly board games to more serious strategy board games. Read on to see what games we recommend picking up for cheap before Black Friday ends.</p><p id="top-deals-today"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Top Deals Today">The Best Black Friday Board Game Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You want to see all the best Black Friday board game deals in one place? That’s easy, my friend, just scroll through the catalog above and you’ll get them. If you’d rather separate the more in-depth heavyweight board games from the family-weight games, keep on reading, because I have them divvied into those categories below. Almost all of the discounts are available in Amazon's Black Friday sale, but there are a few from Walmart and Target we've featured as well.</p><p id="board-games-for-adults"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Board Games for Adults">Board Games for Adults on Sale</h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Note that these are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults">board games for adults</a>, rather than adult-oriented board games. There’s nothing naughty going on in these. They’re aimed at adults in that they’re a bit too complicated for younger board gamers to grasp. They involve <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a>. They might involve <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">horror</a>. They’re complex and may require patience. You can still play them while drinking, though, so don’t worry there if your board game group enjoys tipping a glass.</p><p id="family-board-games"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Family Board Games">Family-Friendly Board Game Deals</h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of these <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family-friendly board games</a> can be perfectly fun to play with your board game group, but you can also pull them out when the kids are looking for something to do and they’ve used up all their screen time. Some of these are super basic games for younger kids. Others are a little more complicated and intended for slightly older kids. Many of them are timeless classics, like Mouse Trap or Hungry Hungry Hippos. Others are newer hits like Exploding Kittens and What Do You Meme?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Makes a Good Board Game Deal?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The one thing all the games on this list have in common is that they’re on sale for Black Friday. But what makes a good board game deal? It's tough to pin down, because it all depends on the game. Unlike <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-black-friday-deals-2025">LEGO Black Friday deals</a>, for instance, board games are published by a variety of different companies and available at various retailers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I focus my attention on Amazon, because it has the most board game Black Friday deals, and prices there are easy to track. I checked all of the prices above on the Amazon price-tracking site <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Camelcamelcamel</a> to make sure they’re good deals. Most of them are at their all-time low prices now, so you can feel free to purchase, knowing you’re getting a big discount. If you branch out to other games, or other retailers, you can also use the site to check against Amazon's price history to get an idea of how good the deal is yourself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-doesnt-care-about-margins-on-echo-show-now-selling-15-smart-home-hub-at-pure-cost-2000648491</link>
            <guid>1367857</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smart displays have come a long way since they were just voice assistants with small screens. Now, <strong>the Echo Show 15 is Amazon’s biggest effort to make a real home hub</strong>: This 15.6-inch Full HD display mounts on your wall like a digital bulletin board that actually earns its space, unlike the small 5-inch or 8-inch Echo Shows that work well on a nightstand.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6069/">you’re getting the newest model for $254 instead of $299, which is in line with Amazon’s Black Friday strategy of cutting its own hardware’s margins</a> to almost nothing. This is the lowest price ever for a device that lets you control your smart home, stream entertainment, organize your family and make video calls all in one place.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6069/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Kitchen Command Center That Works</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch Full HD display changes how you use information all day</strong> because it has enough space to show more than one widget at a time. You can quickly check your family calendar, the weather, your shopping lists, and your smart home controls without having to swipe between screens or ask Alexa to read everything out loud. The customizable widget system lets you put the most important information for your family front and center, so you can find it quickly. This<strong> setup is great for kitchens where you need to check the schedule</strong> while cooking or for mudrooms where everyone needs to see the day’s schedule before they leave.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>real streaming device because it has built-in Fire TV functionality</strong>: It doesn’t just play content through voice commands with limited controls. You can use the included Fire TV remote to navigate Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube, Apple TV, and thousands of other apps in the same way you would on a regular TV. The picture quality is surprisingly good for casual viewing, like when you’re cooking dinner or doing the dishes.</p>



<p>When you can see and tap controls on a big screen instead of remembering voice commands or getting your phone out, controlling your smart home becomes a lot easier. You can see all of your connected devices on the dashboard at once. With just a few taps, you can turn off several lights, change the temperature, or check the feeds from your security cameras. You can see your front door, backyard, or kids’ rooms clearly on live camera feeds without having to squint at a small screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>auto-framing camera with 3.3x zoom and a wide field of view that keeps you centered in frame</strong> as you move around makes video calling a lot better. You can really cook and talk to family members at the same time without making them look at your ceiling or cutting yourself out of the picture. The noise-canceling technology gets rid of the sounds of blenders, running water, and other kitchen chaos that usually makes calls hard to hear. What’s more, the <strong>built-in shutter gives you physical privacy</strong> when you want to turn off the camera completely.</p>
<p>You get here a device that can stream, control your smart home, organize your family, and make high-quality video calls for only $254. That’s less than what you would pay for many standalone tablets and this price is only possible because Amazon cut its margin on Black Friday.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Surprise: The BrickBoy kit for the Lego Game Boy uses floating magnets instead of switches]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/832654/brickboy-kickstarter-lego-game-boy-magnet-buttons</link>
            <guid>1367845</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you’re one of the nearly 3,500 Kickstarter backers paying to give your <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787849/lego-nintendo-game-boy-review">Lego Game Boy</a> an actual screen and buttons, I have a question: did you expect those buttons to have physical switches underneath? That’s a real question.</p><p>Because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/808051/brickboy-lego-game-boy-emulator-upgrade-kit-kickstarter">the BrickBoy</a> — not to be confused <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/805673/nintendos-chips-make-this-lego-game-boy-upgrade-kit-the-most-authentic">with Natalie the Nerd’s Build A Boy</a> — is not currently going with physical clicks. Instead, it glues rare earth magnets inside Lego bricks, for what will hopefully be a magical experience… but isn’t one quite yet.</p><p>The magnets came as a surprise to me, because the BrickBoy Kickstarter, ending in three days, barely mentions magnets at all. Every one of the startup’s promo images shows domed switches underneath the buttons, the text of the Kickstarter does little to suggest otherwise, and we somehow missed that the company’s October 24th video narration <a href="https://youtu.be/3SvSihv29Yw?si=_B_-c3aKZO7nYTNO&amp;t=53">briefly mentions that tiny magnets and “powerful 3D magnetometers”</a> will control the action instead. So my question is genuine: did you back this expecting magnets, or switches?</p><p>To be fair, the magnets are a clever idea! Instead of having to hollow out much of the Lego Game Boy to fit a PCB, you only need to remove a few extra bricks here and there to fit a second magnetometer between the D-pad and face buttons. It’s easy to pop out the Start and Select keys (which are rubber tires) to fit a magnet inside; same with the A and B button posts. Here’s a glimpse at where those parts go:</p><p>When I press the A button, Mario jumps! When I press right on the D-pad, he runs. Some magnetic presses <em>are</em> being wirelessly detected. But I’m writing this story because — so far, with an early prototype — it doesn’t work very well. Like, I keep dying on the very first Goomba in <em>Super Mario Bros</em>, because I can’t stop running, or start jumping, reliably at all. Wireless multi-magnet sensing seems pretty ambitious from where I’m sitting right now!</p><p>It’s probably too early to judge that prototype. But it’s not too early to raise some eyebrows. Though Substance Labs published a video to YouTube that claimed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7dTBq8FR1A">you can build a “playable Lego Game Boy in 5 minutes</a>”, it omitted the extra minutes it takes to wire up an entire magnetometer, remove extra Lego bricks to stuff it inside, and calibrate each and every magnet.</p><p>When I ask Substance Labs’ Thomas Bertani whether his backers know that magnets are at the controls — pointing out there’s nothing in his FAQ about it, and that a recent question about how the controls work went unanswered — Bertani says his team fully explained it in <a href="https://youtu.be/jAAFV4yGZac?si=hGIcrI6VqV_igg5O&amp;t=3963">a new AMA video</a>. But that video came out just yesterday, days ahead of the campaign’s conclusion, and only has 248 views at the time I type these words.</p><p>When I ask my colleague Andrew Liszewski, who’s covered the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805376/lego-game-boy-brickboy-emulator-kickstarter">twice</a>, it’s a surprise to him too there are no switches. He says he assumed they’d be rubber domes. If we both missed it, did the product’s backers miss it as well?</p><p>Even if this is a surprise to you, it might be a welcome one! Whether you’re angry about any of this probably depends what you believe crowdfunding should be about. Are you funding an exact product that you want to exist, or are you funding a team to figure it out? Thomas Bertani tells me his team is figuring it out, building the most magical experience they can, and they’re ready to fall back to wired buttons if the magnets don’t work.</p><p>“I don’t think people care about it being magnets or wired buttons,” he tells me. “They do care about it working well and about the Lego experience being enjoyable,” he says, adding that the magnetometers actually make the product more expensive to produce.</p><p>Bertani says an early 800-backer survey suggested his customers care more about the building experience than the playing experience, that it “was clear they were Lego fans more than Game Boy fans,” and that many people were simply planning to put it on display.</p><p>I can imagine being one of those people: I would enjoy handing the Lego Game Boy to my friends, challenging them to figure out how it works, and then reveal the cleverly hidden magnets inside. If Substance Labs figures out how to make the magnets truly playable, it’d be the cherry on top for my investment.</p><p>But I believe I deserve to know what I’m betting on <em>before</em> I put money down, not after seeing lots of images suggesting I’ll be getting a physical button and assuming the device is built for play. Maybe that’s my mistake. Either way, Bertani tells me he’ll update all his backers this weekend, before the campaign ends, to be more transparent about how the device works.</p><p>Coincidentally, Natalie the Nerd just posted <a href="https://blog.nataliethenerd.com/build-a-boy-update-1-wip-and-tech-specs/">a new update on her Build a Boy project today</a>, including a photo of the actual switches she’ll be using for the buttons. That Lego Game Boy may not be exceptionally playable either, mind. She writes: “It’s important for me to reinstate that at the end of the day it is Lego. I wouldn’t suggest this being an everyday carry item.”</p><p><strong><em>Update, November 28th: </em></strong><em>Clarified that the BrickBoy team did previously mention magnetometers briefly in the Kickstarter video; restructured the story to make it clearer that my initial question is a genuine one.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/832654/brickboy-kickstarter-lego-game-boy-magnet-buttons]]></content:encoded>

              <p>This is the first year that Apple has put all of its Watch models on sale at the same time on Black Friday: This includes the rugged Watch Ultra model for extreme sports, the standard Series models, and the SE models that are focused on value. This all-encompassing sale strategy gives people access to Apple’s wearable ecosystem in ways that have never been possible before, since Apple usually keeps prices high except for short promotional periods (and mainly on Amazon).</p>
<p>Since this morning, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6066/">the price of the Apple Watch SE 3 with 44mm GPS (and sport band) on Amazon dropped from $279 to $229</a>. This is the lowest price ever with an 18% discount that makes it a good choice against affordable Samsung and Garmin watches at similar prices. Amazon went above and beyond the usual Black Friday discounts, making the Apple Watch SE 3 the <strong>best-selling smartwatch on the main Black Friday day</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6066/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Always-On Display</h2>
<p>The <strong>always-on Retina display is the SE 3’s biggest improvement</strong> over the SE 2: It gets rid of the need to raise your wrist which made previous models feel half-functional when you just wanted to check the time. It also means that you can check notifications during meetings without the obvious wrist flick that says you’re looking at your watch, or keep track of your workout metrics without waking up the screen by making big movements.</p>



<p>The <strong>temperature sensing lets you look back at ovulation estimates</strong> by taking nightly wrist temperature readings that show patterns that point to fertile windows. This makes natural family planning tools or fertility awareness that dedicated ovulation trackers offer at similar prices. The <em>Vitals</em> app combines temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and sleep data into unified health dashboards that show patterns that individual metrics don’t show. <strong>Daily sleep scores measure the quality of your sleep</strong> by looking at how long you sleep, how consistently you sleep, and how your body works.</p>
<p>The new <strong>battery lasts 18 hours on a single charge and has an always-on display</strong> so you can use it all day, from waking up to going to sleep, without having to charge it in the middle of the day, which makes sleep tracking impossible. Fast charging gives you 8 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes, so you can quickly charge it up while you shower or get ready in the morning. The battery lasts twice as long as the SE 2’s and the new charging architecture makes it charge twice as fast.</p>
<p>The <strong>Apple Intelligence-powered Workout Buddy looks at your past workouts to give you personalized coaching</strong>, changing goals, and real-time support that keeps you motivated during tough sessions. The feature learns how well you usually do and changes its suggestions based on that, so you don’t get the unrealistic goals that generic fitness apps give you without knowing what you can really do.</p>



<p>The <strong>crash and fall detection features use data from the accelerometer and gyroscope</strong> to look for serious impacts or dangerous falls. If you don’t respond after an incident, they will automatically call emergency services. The safety features are especially useful for people who do things alone, like running on remote trails, biking on busy streets, or older people who are more likely to fall.</p>
<p>The record-low Black Friday pricing at $229 makes Apple’s latest Watch SE 3 model cost similarly to Samsung and Garmin alternatives but they offer better ecosystem integration, safety features and seamless iPhone connectivity that Android watches cannot match. The combination of always-on display, temperature sensing, 18-hour battery and Apple Intelligence features at 18% below retail creates exceptional value.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Goes Zero-Profit on Surface Laptop (1TB SSD, X Elite, 15″), Now $700 Off in Black Friday’s Final Hours]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-goes-zero-profit-on-surface-laptop-1tb-ssd-x-elite-15-now-700-off-in-black-fridays-final-hours-2000648487</link>
            <guid>1367839</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For the last few hours of Black Friday, Microsoft has decided to go all out by cutting prices even more on its Surface laptop line (the Surface Pro tablets are getting the same treatment on Amazon). There is only one model that is 41% off the original price, and it is this <strong>powerful 15-inch Surface Laptop with a Snapdragon X Elite processor, 16GB of RAM, and a huge 1TB SSD</strong>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6068/">Instead of the usual $1,699, this Copilot+ PC costs $999 ($700 off)</a> which puts it in the premium range without the high price tag. This isn’t just another laptop deal: it’s <strong>Microsoft’s first big step into AI-enhanced computing</strong> for regular people and the hardware that comes with it actually lives up to those promises.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Snapdragon Power Lasts All Day</h2>
<p>This Surface laptop has a<strong> Snapdragon X Elite processor, which is a big change from Intel or AMD chips</strong>. Microsoft says that it works better than the MacBook Air M3. Benchmarks show that it does, but the 12-core architecture makes it surprisingly easy to do more than one thing at once. When you have a lot of browser tabs open, music streaming, and documents open at the same time, you’ll notice this the most. The built-in NPU (Neural Processing Unit) is what really makes it better because it <strong>does AI tasks locally instead of sending data to cloud servers</strong>: This means that features like real-time translation and image processing will work faster, and your data will be safer because it stays on your device. And the good news is that you don’t need to be<strong> connected to the internet all the time to use the AI features that come with Copilot+</strong>.</p>



<p>It can<strong> last up to 20 hours on a single charge</strong> which is longer than most Windows laptops in this category. You can really get through a whole day of meetings, presentations, and editing documents without having to look for outlets. The Snapdragon architecture makes it more efficient because it uses less power than older x86 processors.</p>
<p>The<strong> 15-inch touchscreen display uses HDR technology</strong> to make the brightness levels high enough to work outside. The ultra-thin bezels make the most of the screen space without making the laptop bigger, and the colors are bright without being too bright. When using Windows 11’s touch-optimized interface, the touch functionality responds right away, which is more important than you might think.</p>



<p>Windows Studio Effects changes video calls by changing the lighting in real time, blocking out background noise, and blurring the mess behind you. These features run on the NPU instead of your main processor, so they don’t slow down calls. The <strong>live translation feature works in 44 languages</strong> and makes subtitles for video calls and streaming content in real time. It’s processing everything on your own computer so there won’t be any lag and you won’t have to worry about sending your conversations through outside servers.</p>
<p>Right now, you get specs that would normally cost well into four figures for $999: Just the 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage are worth a lot, and that’s before you even think about the display quality and battery life. This setup gets rid of the usual trade-offs: you don’t have to choose between storage space and budget, and you don’t have to give up RAM to get good battery life. Microsoft has called this their flagship AI laptop, and the Black Friday sale makes it competitive with mid-range laptops that can’t match its features.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-arc-ultra-soundbar-drops-to-new-record-low-9-1-4-surround-sound-budget-bars-will-never-replicate-2000648474</link>
            <guid>1367818</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Budget soundbars that cost between $100 and $200 make bad TV speakers sound better by adding basic audio enhancements. However, they are still limited by cheap drivers, low processing power and simple audio architectures that make sound louder without actually improving quality. Premium soundbars like the <strong>Sonos Arc Ultra</strong> cost more because they use acoustic engineering that rivals dedicated home theater systems, and they have advanced driver arrays, proprietary technologies like Sound Motion that change the way speakers work, and processing that can make real spatial audio instead of just fake effects.</p>
<p>Right now,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6065/"> the Sonos Arc Ultra is on sale for $879 on Amazon on Black Friday, down from $1,099</a> and it is a record-low 20% discount that makes Sonos’s flagship soundbar available at prices close to those of mid-range options that don’t perform as well. The <strong>9.1.4 channel Dolby Atmos</strong> makes soundscapes that sound like they’re coming from above, beside and behind you. No matter what the marketing says, budget bars can’t do this.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6065/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Sound Motion Technology</h2>
<p>The proprietary Sound Motion transducers use new architecture to move air more efficiently in much smaller sizes, getting rid of the need for traditional cone-based speaker design. This new technology makes it possible to fit more powerful drivers into slim soundbar profiles without the big boxes that physics usually requires for good bass reproduction. The end result is a small unit that sits quietly under TVs and fills the room with sound, unlike bulky alternatives that need their own furniture to be placed in front of them.</p>



<p>The 9.1.4 channel setup with 14 carefully placed drivers makes real overhead sound effects that put helicopters, rain, and other sounds above the listener instead of just pretending to do so with psychoacoustic tricks. Dolby Atmos content mixed for height channels shows details and immersion that stereo soundbars can’t reproduce. This changes action scenes, nature documentaries, and atmospheric thrillers by using directional audio that matches what you see. The spatial accuracy lets you hear exactly where sounds are coming from in three-dimensional space, as opposed to the vague left-center-right positioning that flat soundbars give you.</p>
<p>AI-powered Speech Enhancement looks at conversations in real time to make voices clearer without making everything sound fake or compressed, like basic “voice mode” settings on cheap soundbars. The processing finds the frequencies of human voices and boosts them while leaving music and effects alone. This keeps the audio balanced instead of making everything sound like talk radio. This is very helpful during movies when mumbled dialogue or strong accents make sense without needing subtitles or having to change the volume all the time.</p>
<p>The Sonos app uses Trueplay room calibration to look at the acoustics of your room and find the best EQ settings for it by measuring how sound bounces off of walls, furniture, and other surfaces. Trueplay will record sound from different places while you walk around with your phone. Then, you’ll see how automatic adjustments fix problems in the room that would make static settings sound bad. To keep the sound from being too harsh, hard-surfaced rooms get treble reduction. To make up for this, carpeted rooms get boosts. This makes sure that the sound is always the best it can be, no matter what kind of interior design choices you make that affect acoustics.</p>
<p>The HDMI eARC connection lets you listen to lossless audio formats like Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio, which streaming services compress into lossy formats. This means you can hear the full quality of Blu-ray collections or high-bitrate streaming sources. The single cable makes setup easier than optical connections with limited bandwidth, and the fact that it works with TV remotes means you don’t have to learn new controls or deal with multiple remotes, which can make setting up a budget soundbar more difficult.</p>
<p>Adding a Sonos Sub for deep bass and Era 300 rear speakers for true surround sound makes systems that are as good as home theater systems that cost $5,000 or more, but are much cheaper and easier to set up. You can start with just the Arc Ultra and then add more pieces as your budget allows, instead of having to buy the whole system all at once. Because the components connect wirelessly, you don’t have to run speaker wires across rooms, which makes installing traditional surround systems a nightmare.</p>
<p>The soundbar is more than just a TV sound enhancer because it can stream music over WiFi, Bluetooth, AirPlay 2, and Spotify Connect. The sound quality when playing music is as good as that of dedicated wireless speakers, which makes systems that combine TV sound and music into one platform. With multi-room audio, you can add Sonos speakers to different rooms in your home so that they all play the same thing or you can control each room separately.</p>
<p>The sleek design, with clean lines, high-quality materials, and little branding, fits in with entertainment centers instead of standing out with loud colors. The slim design fits under most wall-mounted TVs without blocking the screen or looking out of place. It also works well on a tabletop with built-in feet.</p>
<p>At $879, the lowest price ever for Black Friday, Sonos’s flagship soundbar with real 9.1.4 Dolby Atmos, Sound Motion technology, and AI-powered dialogue enhancement is hundreds of dollars cheaper than when it first came out, and it sounds better than any other budget option. The combination of spatial audio, room calibration, an expandable ecosystem, and music streaming at 20% off retail price makes this a great deal. This deal makes Sonos engineering available at prices that have never been seen before, so you can get home theater audio that justifies its high price through actual performance instead of just specs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[LG 48″ OLED evo C4 Series Gets “Hidden Price” on Amazon, 45% Off Price Violates LG’s Display Rules]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/lg-48-oled-evo-c4-series-gets-hidden-price-on-amazon-45-off-price-violates-lgs-display-rules-2000648469</link>
            <guid>1367797</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LG is the leader in the OLED TV market because of decades of experience with display panels that competitors can’t match. They stay on top even though Samsung, Sony, and Chinese manufacturers are always trying to take them down. Every year, the company comes out with new generations of TVs but some models become bestsellers that last longer than the yearly refresh cycles because they offer great value by balancing performance and price.</p>
<p>Right now, a 48-inch OLED C4 TV is currently on sale <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6064/">for $876 on Amazon on Black Friday, and it is a 45% drop from its original price of $1,599</a> which makes flagship OLED technology available at mid-tier LED prices. The pricing proves so aggressive that Amazon displays it as <em>“hidden price”</em> requiring cart addition before revealing the actual cost. Amazon explains this policy through manufacturer agreements: “<em>Because our price on this item is lower than the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, the manufacturer does not allow us to show you our price until you place the item in your shopping cart.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6064/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>OLED pixels that light themselves up to make perfect blacks</h2>
<p>The main benefit of OLED is that the self-emissive pixels can turn completely off to make true blacks: This gives <strong>OLED TVs infinite contrast that LED TVs with backlights bleeding through LCD panels can’t match</strong>. LED TVs with local dimming come close to this with backlight zones but blooming and haloing around bright objects on dark backgrounds show the compromise that OLED gets rid of completely with per-pixel control.</p>



<p>The <strong>Gen7 α9 AI processor looks at each frame of content to improve picture quality</strong> by recognizing scenes, reducing noise and upscaling lower-resolution content to near-4K quality. Firmware updates keep the processor learning and getting better which means that picture quality will always be better than what the hardware can do at the time of purchase.</p>
<p>With <strong>VRR and HDMI 2.1 on all four ports and a 120Hz refresh rate</strong>, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles can take full advantage of next-gen features and perform at their best. The near-instantaneous response time stops ghosting during fast motion, the high refresh rate lets you play competitive games at 120 frames per second, and variable refresh rate synchronization stops screen tearing that breaks immersion.</p>



<p><strong>Dolby Vision IQ automatically changes the brightness of HDR</strong> based on the amount of light in the room which is measured by built-in sensors. This keeps the picture quality at its best no matter what time of day or how bright it is. Different tone mapping is used for bright daytime viewing and dark evening viewing and makes sure that content looks the way it was meant to, not washed out by sunlight or too dim in the dark.<strong> Dolby Atmos audio processing makes three-dimensional soundscapes</strong> through the TV’s built-in speakers which act like overhead and surround channels.</p>
<p>The <strong>webOS smart platform</strong> makes it easy to navigate through thousands of streaming services such as Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, Prime Video, and more, all from one interface that doesn’t lag. Using the <em>Magic Remote</em> with pointer control is like using a mouse instead of having to deal with directional buttons that make typing hard. You can use voice commands to search for content, control your smart home, and ask questions through the built-in Google Assistant and Alexa.</p>
<p>The record-low Black Friday pricing at $876 versus $1,599 launch makes LG’s OLED technology cost approach premium LED TVs delivering fraction of the picture quality through inferior backlight-based contrast. If you want OLED picture quality without waiting years for depreciation or accepting smaller sizes, this hidden price deal makes flagship display technology accessible at unprecedented Black Friday costs.</p>

They’re big on technology and specialize in soothing the machine spirits of wounded war engines, such as tanks and Dreadnoughts.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-will-be-reworking-monster-hunter-secret-lair-superdrop</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has listened to feedback regarding the Monster Hunter Secret Lair superdrop. The drop, which promised to bring characters from Capcom's action RPG to Magic: The Gathering, was underwhelming. So the company is delaying the release.</p>

<h2>The <em>Monster Hunter</em> Secret Lair Superdrop Delay Announcement</h2>

<p>In a straightforward <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/back-to-the-drawing-board-with-secret-lair-x-monster-hunter" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast announced that they will be going back to the drawing board on the <em>Monster Hunter</em> Secret Lair superdrop. In their assessment, the drop, which was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-magic-gathering-monster-hunter-secret-lair-superdrop" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">last week</a>, fell short of expectations. The studio stated that they can do better.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-secret-lair-superdrop-select-monster-cards.jpg?itok=6mymrqUa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-secret-lair-superdrop-select-monster-cards.jpg?itok=wfO8Rf1G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The big issue cited in the superdrop was card selection and failing to integrate&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter'</em>s world and mechanics into <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. With the publisher's consent, Capcom and Wizards of the Coast will delay the release to take another crack at this collaboration. More details will be released in 2026.</p>

<p>The fact that the <em>Monster Hunter</em> Secret Lair superdrop has been delayed is exceedingly rare for Wizards of the Coast. Most of the time, the studio is spot on with adapting various characters from different properties into their popular card game. That history includes bringing characters from <em>The Walking Dead</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-magic-gathering-sonic-hedgehog-secret-lair-is-gonna-go-fast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Sonic The Hedgehog</em></a>, after all.</p>

<p>If you're a dedicated Monster Hunter fan, some of the creative choices made were head-scratching. Why does Brachydios, a monster known for punching and leaving large globs of explosive slime everywhere, have a card effect that clones instant spells? Why does Zinogre, an extremely fast, lightning-channeling beast, have an exile effect? Why does Nargacuga spawn cat tokens?</p>

<p>But probably the biggest oversight in the eyes of the fandom can be summed up in one word: equipment. In <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Monster Hunter</em></a>, your gear is key to your power and progression. It is the part of the core loop of the franchise. So why weren't there any artifact cards in the superdrop?</p>

<p>Hopefully, Wizards of the Coast's second attempt is a bit closer to the level of quality they usually reach with such collaborative projects.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Dead Rising Game Possibly in Development]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-dead-rising-hollywood-possible-capcom-report/</link>
            <guid>1367776</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new entry in the <strong>Dead Rising</strong> series is <strong>potentially in development</strong>. Furthermore, a report details much of the game’s story and Hollywood setting.</p>



<p>The zombie genre has become quite dramatic over the years, with Telltale’s The Walking Dead and The Last of Us. However, one franchise saw the fun in the bloody mayhem of it all: Capcom’s Dead Rising. Released in 2006, the series has multiple spinoffs and sequels, upping the carnage with weapon building and bigger open worlds. A remake/remaster of the first game, titled <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-guides-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a>, launched last year to much acclaim. Now, almost a decade since the last main entry, Dead Rising 4, it seems fans should gear up for a trip back to the zombie apocalypse with some familiar faces. </p>







<h2 id="h-hollywood-set-dead-rising-sequel-in-the-works-claims-report">Hollywood-Set Dead Rising Sequel in the Works, Claims Report</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a report from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-dead-rising-game-development-set-in-hollywood" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, the outlet mentioned that a source shared information that <strong>Capcom is actively working on a new Dead Rising</strong>. The title, which has <strong>reportedly been in the works since 2023</strong>, would <strong>reunite players</strong> with <strong>Frank West </strong>and company in a new setting: <strong>Hollywood</strong>. The game’s setting would actually be <strong>in a large Hollywood set</strong> where the crazed director, the villain, traps everyone in to create the perfect movie. </p>



<p>In terms of the timeline, the report mentions it <strong>being a direct sequel to Dead Rising</strong>. If true, it would be set before Dead Rising 4. Many elements from the original title, like <strong>the camera and time limit</strong>, would <strong>make a return</strong>. The <strong>survivor system</strong>, used in most franchise games, would also be present, even taking a <strong>bigger role in the narrative</strong>. Unfortunately, the report does not provide any information on release or actual gameplay.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that <strong>no confirmation from Capcom regarding a new Dead Rising has been made</strong>, so <strong>take the news with a big grain of salt</strong>. Given how long it’s been since a fully new entry, it does feel like the perfect time to bring it back. Seeing as Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster did quite well, perhaps it served as a segue to the new title. Either way, it’ll be exciting to see whether we’ll see the wartime journalist anytime soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valve Accused of Removing Solitaire Game with LGBTQ+ Art From Steam In Russia At the Request of Russian Government]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/valve-accused-of-removing-games-from-steam-at-russia-request-flick-solitaire/</link>
            <guid>1367770</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Valve is stuck in yet another content-related controversy <a href="https://wccftech.com/santa-ragione-new-horror-game-horses-might-be-its-last-steam-ban/">regarding which games make it onto Steam and which ones get to stay there.</a> This time, the controversy centers around a free solitaire game called Flick Solitaire, with Valve accused of removing the game from Steam in Russia over its LGBTQ+ themed card decks at the request of the Russian government, while other digital platforms ignored the government's request.</p>



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.videogamesindustrymemo.com/p/how-steam-censors-lgbtq-content-on">Video Games Industry Memo</a>, Flick Solitaire had been available in Russia on the iOS store and the Google Play Store since 2020. However, shortly after it was released on Steam in October 2025, Russia's censorship body, the Roskomnadzor, sent messages to Valve, Apple, and Google, all requesting that the game be removed from their platforms for "<em>promoting non-traditional sexualities</em>."</p>



<p>While Apple and Google both ignored the request, Valve succumbed to it, not only removing the game from Steam in Russia, but also pointing its finger at developer Flick Games for not following "<em>applicable laws</em>" in a country in which it was publishing its game. Flick Games points out that Russia is not the only country that has laws criminalizing LGBTQ+ people, in which Flick Solitaire is available, and in all of those scenarios, Flick Games has never dialled down or censored the LGBTQ+ content included in the game.</p>



<p>"<em>Since launching Flick Solitaire, it has been available in 40+ countries that criminalize LGBTQ+ people. Russia is only one of these,</em>" said Ian Masters, Flick Games founder. "<em>As we started adding decks that celebrated Pride, or were created by out queer artists, we did not self-censor in any of these countries. It's incredibly important that LGBTQ+ people in these countries can see that other LGBTQ+ people exist, that it's 100% normal and should even be celebrated</em>."</p>



<p>According to the report, Google didn't respond to Roskomnadzor's notice at all. Apple sent a note to Masters acknowledging that it had received the notice from the Roskomnadzor, but affirmed to Masters that the notice had not impacted the studio's standing with Apple and on the App Store. Flick Solitaire is still, at the time of this writing, available on both the Google Play Store and the App Store in Russia.</p>



<p>Valve is the only platform that buckled under the pressure applied by Roskomnadzor, which, as Video Games Industry Memo points out, isn't exactly a huge amount of pressure. That said, Flick Solitaire is allegedly not the first game Valve has removed at the request of the Russian government. A <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/steam-has-taken-down-over-260-materials-containing-illegal-content-from-its-russian-store-brags-the-countrys-media-censorship-agency/">report from PC Gamer claims</a> that Valve removed 260+ games from Steam at the request of the Roskomnadzor.</p>



<p>"<em>This isn't 'wokeness', it's basic human rights and equality and nothing more</em>," said Masters on the importance of protecting LGBTQ+ content on platforms like Valve. "<em>If Steam can't support free speech of LGBTQ+ people, then at the very least they should be transparent about this</em>."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/team-cherry-hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-thinking-about-non-hollow-knight-games/</link>
            <guid>1367725</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Team Cherry is almost three months removed from finally releasing Hollow Knight Silksong, one of the most anticipated games ever and one of 2025's best releases. It's <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/">sold millions of copies</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">earned five nominations at The Game Awards</a>, including Game of the Year. After seven years of development and such a roaring success, you might think Team Cherry is taking a bit of a break to reap its rewards. Not so, it would seem, as the small studio is already working on DLC for Silksong, and has begun thinking about games outside of the world of Hollow Knight.</p>



<p>All this comes from a new interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDM0NzQzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzY0OTUyMjM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNkczNjFLR0NUSDAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.nHDv04b3quPAcWKT5nBOeCqr1KCS01wBn_nMscKzzng&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, which includes a solid chunk of spoilers for Hollow Knight Silksong, so if you've not finished Silksong yet, but want to hear how Team Cherry is reacting to how the game was received, be prepared for spoilers. </p>



<p>On the topic of non-spoiler territory and on DLCs, when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier asked about Steel Assassin Sharpe, Ari Gibson said, "<em>Just waiting in the wings. Waiting to arrive is probably the best way to say it. One of those enemies, a little suite of Sharpe and their companions, they got tucked away for a while because the game had so much in it. And all of these pieces need polish, and polish takes time. We're excited to reintroduce Sharpe. We just have to get to them</em>."</p>



<p>Schreier immediately followed up by asking if the Village of Lions was part of its DLC plans that were tucked away and are now waiting in the wings, to which Gibson responded, "<em>We will make sure to deliver on all of our obligations. One, because they're going</em> <em>to be very fun to do. But even alongside those tasks we had our own ideas for extra things that could be added to the world. We're trying to juggle when that could potentially be</em>."</p>



<p>As far as when these extra bits of content and DLC updates are coming, the truth is that Team Cherry is not sure. "<em>We didn’t plan seven years for </em><em>Silksong</em>," said Gibson. "<em>Not that we expect to take an excessive amount of time, but we still are pursuing the same development philosophy, which sometimes can expand our timeframe</em>."</p>



<p>Regarding what Team Cherry will do after Silksong, Gibson and William Pellen, the other half of Team Cherry's core, both admitted that they have ideas for what would be next. The question is how much longer they have in this life to get to them.</p>



<p>"<em>We haven't thought that much about the time, but we've thought about the ideas that we have, the stuff we want to make and put in there</em>," said Pellen. "<em>And then we do have other games that we plan to make</em>," Gibson continued. </p>



<p>"<em>The only time concern really is - and we've talked about this before - death. It's not that far off if you spend seven years per project, and potentially add another two. So it'd be nice to do a few more games. Apparently our timeframe still allows us to fit a few more in. Short of an unexpected tragedy.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We have said we'll go elsewhere,</em>" Gibson added. "<em>Although we've also said those experiences will still be about exploring big worlds full of weird characters and giant bosses and whatnot. So there would be a through line there that people will be familiar with. That's not to say we won't return to these Hollow Knight worlds. We do have ideas around what forms those would take. But we also don't want to be exclusively people that make Hollow Knight</em>."</p>



<p>That said, Gibson was quick to clarify that he and Pellen aren't sick of making Hollow Knight. Gibson said that if they were forced to make another Hollow Knight game right now, "<em>it'd be a joy.</em>" The drive to go beyond the games that made Team Cherry a household name in the industry is rooted in their own creative endeavours to try something new. </p>



<p>"<em>It'd be interesting for us to explore the same things we're interested in but maybe in a slightly different genre, slightly different theme, and how that affects the stories we come up with. We're interested to see what would happen ourselves</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Warframe: The Old Peace Gets December 10 Launch Date; Android CBT Live Now]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/warframe-the-old-peace-gets-december-10-launch-date-android-cbt-live-now/</link>
            <guid>1367722</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Digital Extremes announced that Warframe is getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-to-get-the-old-peace-in-2025-tau-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Old Peace update</a> on December 10 across all platforms. The Old Peace represents the next Narrative Chapter for the ongoing Warframe storyline, but it also introduces two brand new game modes to shake up the gameplay experience.</p>



<p>The first one, called Descendia, is a roguelite-style, weekly-rotating Tower mode where players descend through increasingly challenging levels in pursuit of rewards. Progression allows for deeper starting floors and varied loot each week, keeping things fresh. </p>



<p>The second is Perita Rebellion, a time-limited '12-minute war' mode that challenges players or squads to complete as many randomized objectives as possible on the moon Parita before facing a bespoke boss fight. Players will face intense time pressure and must therefore make robust use of the new movement options, such as the enhanced grappling. Perita Rebellion's bosses are randomly assigned and include encounters with the Prime Vanguard and other unique enemies. This mode will also have players fending off the Anarchs, the newest enemy faction added to the game.</p>



<p>Another big new addition brought by The Old Peace is the introduction of the Tauron Strikes into Warframe. This is a set of five all-new Focus School Ultimates, unlocking legendary artifact weapons (e.g., sword, hammer, staff), which can then be modded and enhanced through a bespoke interface. These are the Naramon Strike (Vexoric), the Unairu Strike (Cogron), and the final three that have been shown in today's devstream: Madurai's Thara, Vazarin's Nidri, and Zenurik's Lorak. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Warframe | The Old Peace Official Teaser - Coming December 10 To All Platforms!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F2a4_rkcbyM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Players will use the new Perita Rebellion resources and Focus to unlock and upgrade each Tauron Strike. These powers drastically enhance Operator/Drifter gameplay, with artifact acquisition and empowerment tightly integrated into the new game modes and narrative content, as planned by the studio.</p>



<p>A new limited-time Operation, Blood of Perita, will be available between December 16 and January 6. Players must gather Marks of Valiance from the Perita Rebellion and other Alert mission completions, found via the Star Chart map, then take these spoils to Roathe of the Devil's Triad in exchange for time-limited rewards, including the new, evolving Loyaus Chest Armour cosmetic item and an exclusive Honoria player title. This new Operation will only be accessible to players who have completed The Old Peace narrative quest.</p>



<p>Just like with most big Warframe updates, The Old Peace comes with a new playable Warframe, Uriel, who's thematically inspired by World War I and trench warfare. Uriel, the game's 63rd Warframe, introduces the bayonet class Vinquibus, a hybrid weapon that functions as both a semi-automatic primary firearm and a melee weapon, featuring fluid auto-switching between stances. Uriel's kit centers around direct, frontline aggressive combat, summoning demon minions, and activating powerful comet-style movement abilities. Urile's build paths allow for deep customization, as both the primary and melee forms can be independently modded for varied combat approaches.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TheOldPeace_Screenshot_UrielAltHelm_4K_NoLogo-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Lore-wise, Uriel originated as the Protoframe Roathe of The Devil’s Triad. This demon commander embodies the rage of a thwarted imperial takeover and temporal banishment thanks to the meddling of Dr. Entrati. Uriel can be unlocked for free by collecting the required Blueprints and resources via The Descendia. Alternatively, if you have Platinum currency to spare, you can unlock the Warframe right away from the Marketplace.</p>



<p>The Old Peace makes Warframe prettier, too. A significant visual overhaul is coming for Operators and Drifters; all their faces and hairstyles have been remastered for improved fidelity. There are even additional options for character customization. The update also features improved lighting, material fidelity, and entirely new environmental tile sets, especially for Perita, the focal moon of new lore and battlefields. The user interface and map have also been overhauled for clarity, featuring new icons and improved navigation.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, the Android Closed Beta Test is out today, nearly two years after <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-finally-makes-its-way-into-ios-release-expected-by-20th-februrary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe launched on iOS</a>. You can try your luck at being selected <a href="https://www.warframe.com/android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the official website</a>. There's more, as Digital Extremes already confirmed the dates for TennoCon 2026. The annual convention will take place in London, Ontario, Canada, on the weekend of July 10-11, 2026, and it will also feature a reimagined TennoConcert.</p>



<p>Lastly, the studio teased that Warframe fans eager for a glimpse at the next narrative chapter coming after The Old Peace should tune into The Game Awards 2025 on December 11.</p>
