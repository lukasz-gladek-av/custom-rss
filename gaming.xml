<p>More to come?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ldQYMwzWrY">a new trailer</a> to provide an overview on how Switch 2 cartridges and Game-Key Cards work (just in case the last six or seven months' worth of discourse hasn't already clued you in).</p>
<p>In it, one of the examples showcased to demonstrate the Game-Key Card is none other than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a>, which has just been confirmed to launch on <strong>5th March, 2026</strong>. The title is being published by The Pokémon Company in Japan and Nintendo in the West, which makes this the company's first Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p>Of course, the renders shown in the trailer clearly have a 'sample' watermark included, so there's a chance – however small – that the game may have just been plucked from thin air to demonstrate Nintendo's practices, but we think not. We reckon Pokopia is a full-blown Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean? Is this the start of something more? We can't be sure yet. Nintendo has previously gone on record to state that it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-has-no-plans-to-use-game-key-cards-for-first-party-developed-titles">wouldn't use the medium for "Nintendo-developed titles"</a>, but that's the thing... This isn't a Nintendo-developed title – it's Omega Force (Koei Tecmo). But then if that's the case, then why didn't <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> also receive a Game-Key Card release?</p>
<p>Lots of questions for now, and we'll be sure to push for answers going forward. But if you're someone who's dead set against Game-Key Cards, then you might want to strike Pokémon Pokopia off your wish list.</p>

              <p>Back in July this year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-z-a-unite-champions-netflix-1851786687">Nintendo held a <em>spectactularly</em> bad&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>Presents</a>, during which close to nothing was announced but for a shambolic reveal that there was going to be a new Pokémon theme park opening in 2026 called PokéPark Kanto. The announcement treated us to images of cheap, plastic Pokémon toys balanced on a table. Someone used the words “where Pokémon truly exist” to describe the supposed wonders of this place, while we saw fiberglass Pokémon put near some trees. It was amazing. Anyway, jump forward four months and an official opening date has been announced, along with a video showing…animated people visiting an animated park?</p>

 <p>I am very here for this ongoing weirdness. Part of me wishes it could all turn out to be some <a href="https://kotaku.com/willy-wonka-experience-fyre-fest-glasgow-1851292959">Willy Wonka Experience-type fiasco</a>, eventually opening on February 5 to reveal a bleak, near-empty warehouse with a few 3D-printed Pokémon toys and a lady wearing a yellow tracksuit and face paint telling crying children that she’s Pikachu. I realize, given this is The Pokémon Company (and therefore Nintendo), that’s not enormously likely. But it sure is being marketed like it should be! The park itself will be a part of an enormous theme park in Tokyo called Yomiuriland, and is described as “the first ever permanent Pokémon outdoor facility.”</p>

 <p>But first, that Direct footage is still making me laugh months later:</p> <figure><figcaption>The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>And now we can add to it a superbly made animated trailer for the park that—because it’s an animated trailer that leans into the fantasy of the place—tells us literally nothing concrete or useful whatsoever. I’m going to go out on a limb and argue that The Pokémon Company has not successfully conducted some sort of gruesome genetic modification program and successfully bred real-world Pokémon to populate their park, so I suspect that we can at the very least reject the bit where there are Eevee and Pikachu scampering down the paths, or terrifying stampedes of Rhydon and Onyx as Pidgeo fly overheard. I am, however, willing to suspend my disbelief enough to accept that something a lot like Rattata might be present.</p>

  <p>OK, so let’s be fair; the website for the park <em>does</em> show some proof of existence, albeit very sparse. Among a&nbsp;lot of cartoon images we have what look like real-life photographs of a Pokémon Center, a Poké Mart and a Gym. And then, bizarrely, <a href="https://www.pokepark-kanto.co.jp/ppark/img/about/forest-poke-02.png">the same photographs</a> of fiberglass Eevee that we saw back in July.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642910" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642910"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642910">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000642912" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642912"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642912">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000642913" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642913"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642913">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>So don’t get me wrong. I would hop from foot to foot in gleeful excitement if I were able to go into a real, actual, full-size Pokémon Center, where I assume I would meet Nurse Joy herself. But again, I’m getting abandoned park vibes before this place even opens.</p>

 <p>There are to be three sections: Sedge Town, Pokémon Forest, and PokéPark Entrance Plaza, which will feature a Research Lab where you start your adventure. It remains opaque exactly how the whole thing will work, but you seem to be given a choice between a Bulbasaur, Charmander or Squirtle (“No Timothy, Pikachu wasn’t one of the original starters! Stop that crying!”), and then you’re off to explore the various areas. The Pokémon Center will apparently feature Chansey and allow you to heal your Pokémon (which itself implies a lot), while the Mart seems to be primarily a refreshment area. Beyond that, there’s an Eevee-themed carousel and something called Pika Pika Paradise powered by 30 Pikachu. These both require separate ticket purchases! Meanwhile, the Gym will be used for live performances. Which seems a shame, given the chance to offer a bunch of challenges for kids to complete, right? And some of these live shows require their own separate tickets too!</p> <p>Let’s hope it’s completely brilliant, and given that it’s being added to such an established and popular park, and created by The Pokémon Company itself, it really should be. But please can we have more of this super-weird marketing before any of that happens?</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/up-your-audio-quality-with-this-dji-mic-mini-bundle-down-to-its-lowest-price-yet-2000642562</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-mic-mini-bundle-is-going-for-peanuts-likely-to-sell-out-at-this-all-time-low-price-before-black-friday-hits.1349848/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="680">If you’re creating content for TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts, there’s one simple upgrade that can dramatically improve the quality of your videos: invest in a good microphone. It might sound minor, but clear, professional audio can make the difference between a clip that feels polished and one that viewers scroll past. Many creators focus heavily on lighting, cameras, and editing but overlook how crucial sound is. Even if your audience doesn’t consciously notice poor audio, they’ll feel that something’s off—and it can make your content seem less professional overall. The truth is, nine times out of ten, the issue isn’t your camera or setup; it’s your sound.</p>
<p data-start="682" data-end="909"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5450/">Fortunately, fixing that doesn’t require a big budget. Right now, the DJI Mic Mini two-person vlog bundle is 41% off, bringing the price down from $169 to just $99.</a> That’s a $70 savings for a serious boost in quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5450/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2 data-start="682" data-end="909">Always Reliable Audio</h2>
<p data-start="911" data-end="1276">These compact wireless microphones are designed for creators who want great sound without bulky gear. Each mic weighs just 10 grams, making them ultra-light and discreet on camera. They clip on easily, look clean in your shots, and are comfortable to wear even during long recording sessions. Despite their small size, they deliver impressively rich, clear sound.</p>
<p data-start="1278" data-end="1621">One of the standout features is their maximum transmission range of 400 meters. That’s nearly a quarter mile. You can move freely while recording without worrying about losing signal or sound quality. Whether you’re filming casual vlogs, outdoor interviews, or travel content, this kind of range means flexibility and freedom of movement.</p>


<p data-start="1623" data-end="2138">The DJI Mic Mini system is built to handle noisy environments. Each mic includes pro-level noise cancellation with two adjustable intensity modes. The “Basic” setting is perfect for quiet indoor recordings, while “Strong” mode helps cut through background chatter or city noise when filming outside. Plus, an automatic volume limiter prevents distortion if the audio input spikes too high. That feature alone can save you a lot of frustration during post-production. No more clipped or unusable takes.</p>
<p data-start="2140" data-end="2416">Another great perk is compatibility. The DJI Mic Minis integrate smoothly with the DJI Osmo Audio ecosystem, pairing seamlessly with devices like the Osmo Action 5 Pro without needing a separate receiver. It’s plug-and-play simplicity, designed with creators in mind.</p>
<p data-start="2418" data-end="2646">Battery life is pretty great. Each transmitter and receiver can operate for up to 10 hours on a single charge, so you can record interviews, live streams, or full-day shoots without worrying about running out of juice. Combined with the included charging case, you can expect to have a total of 48 hours of life on a single charge.</p>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <p>Pokémon Pokopia, the Animal Crossing meets Minecraft game with an anthropomorphised Ditto, now has a release date.</p>
<p>As revealed by Nintendo, the game is heading to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> on 5th March next year. "Build a Pokémon paradise in Pokémon Pokopia," reads a post on social media. No further details have been provided.</p>
<p>However, it looks like the game will be released on a Game-Key Card, Nintendo's controversial physical media that still requires a download.</p>

<p>The company has released a new<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ldQYMwzWrY"> video explaining how to use Game-Key Cards</a>, which features Pokémon Pokopia as an example. The images do have "sample" over them, but from the inclusion of the game all over this video we can presume it's correct.</p>

<p>To recap, Game-Key Cards are physical cards for the Switch 2 that do not contain game data. Instead, they're used as a key to download the full game, meaning an internet connection is required and the game will take up more of the console's storage space. It's something game preservationists are rallying against, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-dev-comes-out-with-first-actually-good-reason-for-using-switch-2s-controversial-game-key-cards">some developers explaining why they're required</a> - performance, essentially.</p> <div>

<p>The spin-off was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ever-wanted-to-play-a-pokemon-animal-crossing-meets-minecraft-pokemon-pokopia-might-be-just-that-game">revealed back in September during a Nintendo Direct</a>, and is being developed by Koei Tecmo Games - previously responsible for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-quest-builders-2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a>.</p>
<p>Players will create their own Pokémon paradise, taking on the role of a Ditto who's morphed into a human-like appearance.</p>
<p>You'll collect materials, build furniture, grow vegetables, and create homes for Pokémon. You'll then be able to invite other players to visit your creation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Tetris has Tetrominos. Lumines has blocks. Tetris tasks you with forming lines. Lumines tasks you with forming larger blocks. They’re two sides of the same block-dropping coin, and while Tetris is instantly recognisable as one of the most iconic, generation-defining games of all time, Lumines can stake a claim to its own equally important place in history. In some ways, Lumines: Arise is the culmination of both these series.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lumines Arise - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SwuqiVNs058?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Developer Enhance, led by game design guru – and original Lumines creator – Tetsuya Mizuguchi, revolutionised the look and feel of playing Tetris in 2018’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/11/09/tetris-effect-review/">Tetris Effect</a>. The result of this fusion of Tetris’s classic block-based puzzle action with Mizuguchi’s penchant for wild, psychedelic visuals and thumping, visceral music was an unequivocal triumph, a bona fide masterpiece.</p>


<p>Lumines Arise takes the lessons learned from Tetris Effect and folds them back into Lumines’ framework, expanding on the series’ formula, bringing new life and energy with it, and in the process, crafting another genre-defining puzzle game.</p>
<p>Lumines is all about building up your score by repeatedly forming blocks of matching colour. These can start with a simple 2×2 square, expanding out for higher scores and bigger chain combos. You’re racing against the screen-wiping Time Line though, passing at different rates across the playfield depending on the level and the music. It lends Lumines, and in turn Lumines Arise, a frantic, heady pace, but one that you can zone in and out of, easing back at times before snatching once more at the high score leaderboard.</p>


<p>That alternating pace is changed up by each level, and it’s here that Lumines Arise has felt Tetris Effect’s influence most keenly. Visually, and aurally, Lumines Arise is one of the most incredible experiences in gaming. It’s an assault, a barrage, a blanket, a seabed, a keening wind, an astral vacuum, a tolling bell, a thumping nightclub, or a chopping board. It’s an experience that shifts and moves level by level, changing up the formation of the blocks themselves, while the visuals writhe and twist around you. It’s only heightened by the closed-circuit isolation of VR, and it’s one of the few games that will warrant dusting off your PSVR 2 for.</p>
<p>It’s hard to understand how the changing aspects of the blocks makes them feel different, but Enhance combine visuals, audio and haptic vibration with alarming precision to bring a different sensation to you through the game’s extensive Journey mode. Blocks may pulse, or move, or release tiny astronauts into your field of view when you combine them. They might be hard and delicate as glass, or as difficult to grasp as sound itself, but no matter what form they take, they are captivating.</p>
<p>On your first play through each of these levels, I’d recommend forgetting about your high score. That initial experience is, for one, too good to ignore, but it’s also a distraction at times, drawing you away from the core task you’re set on. Tetris Effect was much the same, catching you up in its synesthetic web, overwhelming your senses with beauty and musical drama, but in Lumines Arise that sensation feels stronger.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s because the block dropping here is broader and more organic than its brethren, or perhaps it’s because I’m happier to be led by Enhance’s psychedelic pipe. Lumines remains one of the most impactful puzzle games of my life – I still own my PSP, and both Lumines and Lumines II – and Lumines Arise takes everything that was special about the originals, and refines it down into something that feels like Mizuguchi’s opus. He was riffing with Tetris Effect, playing with someone else’s toys, but here he’s taking the next step with his own creation. Because of that, there’s a more personal touch, a deep-seated love and care that permeates the entire game.</p>
<p>Journey is the central mode, drawing together all of the levels into a form that feels like a concept album. The levels and tracks have been put together in such a way that you can feel the ebb and flow of intent, sweeping you along just as Enhance intend, and while you’re ranked and scored at the end of each section, it’s almost unnecessary, craving the next section simply to continue the journey. Chameleons rave, hands pull puppet strings attached to your blocks, and fresh fruit cascades across the screen as you chop it up. It feels nonsensical, but it’s also utterly human, utterly natural, delighting in the world around us, and making it feel fresh and new.</p>
<p>One of the key additions to the formula is Burst mode. Once charged and then unleashed, this gives you the chance to create one giant block while extraneous blocks flying off beyond the screen, and giving you the same rush of adrenaline that Tetris Effect’s Zone did. It’s good for both high score chasers, and those who need a list-ditch attempt to save their run, often clearing a good portion of the screen if you’re quick enough.</p>

<p>Once you’re done with Journey, there’s plenty to keep you coming back to Lumines Arise, from being able to form Playlists of your favourite levels and tracks to the Mission mode, which brings in a handy tutorial as well as a series of Challenges. These mix up the Lumines gameplay by messing with the rules, so the blocks might grow or change shape, the playfield might shrink, or you might have to dig or unleash some hidden secret by building blocks around the outside of the shape. It’s a fun aside, and hopefully one that Enhance will add to throughout the game’s life.</p>
<p>There’s also a suite of multiplayer modes, with both local and online options. From here you can attempt to move yourself up the online leaderboards, or go head-to-head to see just how good you are at making blocks. These come in both Ranked and Custom flavours, with Ranked mode awarding you with a steadily increasing battle rank if you win, and knocking you back down when you come across someone who’s infuriatingly better than you are, while Custom won’t have any consequences other than the enjoyment of knocking your best friend into next week. With blocks, obviously.</p>
<p>The only negative, if you can call it that, is that Lumines Arise isn’t quite as groundbreaking as Tetris Effect was. That feels unfair, when Tetris Effect essentially borrowed Lumines’ own schtick, but there is some familiarity that simply can’t be escaped. That doesn’t diminish its impact, nor its aspirations, but there is a level of euphoria that Lumines Arise doesn’t quite match because of it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/texas-attorney-general-sues-roblox-claims-it-put-%E2%80%9Cpixel-pedophiles-and-profits-over-the-safety-of-texas-children%E2%80%9D.1349818/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Less than three months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-lack-safety-protocols-against-sex-predators/">state of Louisiana announced it would be filing a lawsuit</a> against Roblox, which claimed that the company "<em></em><em>permitted and perpetuated an online environment in which child predators thrive, directly contributing to the widespread victimization of minor children in Louisiana</em>," the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, has <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/press/Petition_0.pdf">filed his own lawsuit</a> against Roblox with similar allegations and similarly intense language, as Paxton alleges the company put "<em>pixel pedophiles and profits over</em> <em>the safety of Texas children</em>."</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-sues-roblox-putting-pixel-pedophiles-and-profits-over-safety-texas">press release</a> regarding the lawsuit, Paxton says, "<em>We cannot allow platforms like Roblox to continue operating as digital playgrounds for predators where the well-being of our kids is sacrificed on the altar of corporate greed. Roblox must do more to protect kids from sick and twisted freaks hiding behind a screen. Any corporation that enables child abuse will face the full and unrelenting force of the law</em>."</p>



<p>It's intense language, to say the least, and while Roblox Corporation would disagree with it and, in a statement to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roblox-must-do-more-to-protect-kids-from-sick-and-twisted-freaks-texas-attorney-general-says-as-he-sues-roblox-for-putting-pixel-pedophiles-and-profits-ahead-of-kids/">PC Gamer</a>, said Paxton's claims and lawsuit were "<em>based on misrepresentations and sensationalized claims</em>," there is no denying that Roblox has garnered a reputation for being a platform riddled with safety concerns for children.</p>



<p>We've seen <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">multiple reports</a> in recent years that have deeply investigated Roblox for its lack of child safety protocols. In 2024, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">Bloomberg reported</a> that in 2023, there were 13,000 incidents of child exploitation on the platform, with Roblox employees quoted in the report saying the company was "<em>on its back foot</em>" in the fight against child predators on the platform.  </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Investigation: How Roblox Is Exploiting Young Game Developers" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_gXlauRB1EQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>People Make Games published two in-depth videos that explored issues of child predators on the platform and the issues of Roblox's dependence on user-created content and how little those creators actually see compared to the profits that Roblox Corporation rakes in.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Roblox Pressured Us to Delete Our Video. So We Dug Deeper." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTMF6xEiAaY?start=1030&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>It's worth noting that Roblox has <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/tech-talks-update-on-roblox-safety-initiatives">made several changes since both the above videos were published</a>, but there is a case to be made that those <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-adds-new-child-safety-measures-to-protect-pre-teens/">changes were implemented too late</a>, and it's also worth asking if the changes are actually doing enough to make it a safe platform for children.</p>



<p>It should also be noted that Louisiana and Texas aren't the only states in the US going after Roblox. <a href="https://www.ag.ky.gov/Press%20Release%20Attachments/2025.10.06%20-%20%5bFINAL%5d%20KY%20Roblox%20Complaint.pdf">Kentucky has a similar lawsuit filed</a> against the company, and <a href="https://x.com/AGJamesUthmeier/status/1980272803992809937">Florida has launched a criminal investigation</a> into Roblox.</p>



<p>Roblox, for its part, as stated earlier, calls the Texas attorney general's claims "<em>sensationalized</em>," and goes further to say that it is "<em>deeply committed to child safety</em>." </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18076140/tetris-effect-review-ps4-vr"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a>, designer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18047826/tetris-effect-tetsuya-mizuguchi-interview-ps4-vr">Tetsuya Mizuguchi</a> and his team at Enhance, Inc. managed to make something old feel new. There are few things as well defined in video games as the falling blocks of <em>Tetris</em>, and yet with the studio’s trademark immersive sound and visual design, the game was transformed into something else, with every element pushing you toward getting into the proverbial zone. Now the team has done the same thing with <em>Lumines</em>. And while the result isn’t quite as crisp as <em>Tetris Effect</em>, <em>Lumines Arise</em> is still one of the most absorbing puzzle games I’ve ever played.</p><p>If you haven’t played before, <em>Lumines</em> is sort of like a version of <em>Tetris</em> built around music. (In fact, it began life when Mizuguchi wanted to make a music-themed <em>Tetris</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/15/17465364/tetris-effect-preview-enhance-games-e3/">but was initially stymied by rights issues</a>.) 2x2 blocks fall from the top, each made up of a combination of two different colors, and the goal is to place these blocks so as to create solid-colored 2x2 blocks on the playing field, which will then be cleared from the screen. The twist is that the screen doesn’t clear automatically; instead, you wait for a “time line” to wipe across the playing field in sync with the music, which gives you a chance to build up combos of blocks to all be erased at once.</p><p><em>Lumines Arise</em> doesn’t change any of this core functionality, though it does add a new mechanic called “burst,” which lets you hold off on clearing the screen for longer, resulting in absurdly satisfying combos. Mainly it layers in visuals and sounds that are designed to create that zen-like state inherent to the best puzzle games. The main portion of the game is a mode called “journey” — there’s also multiplayer and some challenge stages — where you play through a series of themed levels, which jump around in style and tone.</p><p>If you’ve played a <em>Lumines</em> game before, you won’t be surprised to learn there is some great electronic music here, with levels filled with thumping beats augmented by lots of bright, flashy visuals. This stuff is great, though it’s not that far off from past <em>Lumines</em> titles. Where <em>Arise</em> gets interesting is when it becomes weird and surprising. In many instances, the blocks become other things, and they grow as you create matches. In one early stage, instead of blocks, you’re matching vegetables, so as you create bigger combos, giant tomatoes start to fill the screen. It’s playful and strange and just one of the many flavors in <em>Arise</em>. There’s an R&amp;B level set to the backdrop of a rainy Tokyo at night, a stage where you match jellyfish, and another where connecting spider eggs results in little hatchlings running over the screen. For <em>Tetris Effect</em> fans, there’s also a spiritual sequel to that game’s incredible jazz level.</p><p>For the most part, all of these audiovisual elements enhance what<em> Lumines</em> already is. Particularly if you’re playing with headphones on, which I heartily recommend, the effects can create an almost trance-like state as you focus on the mechanics of matching up blocks while the sounds and visuals wash over you. This led to me playing some of the best <em>Lumines</em> of my life. (I’m still terrible, though.) Often the effects in <em>Arise</em> are more dramatic and ambitious compared to <em>Tetris Effect</em>, which creates some really memorable moments, like when a giant holographic snake is nodding along to EDM beats while you fiddle with blocks.</p><p>Sometimes, though, these effects go just a touch too far and interfere with, instead of augment, the gameplay. In some of the levels the visuals become hard to parse, with colors or symbols that are a little too close to each other, making it easy to mix them up, particularly when you’re stressed out with a screen full of blocks. There are only a handful of stages like this, and it’s possible they’ll be adjusted in a future update, but right now they run counter to the mood<em> Arise</em> tries so hard to create. They take you out of the game instead of immersing you further in it.</p><p>Even with that issue, though, this remains the best version of <em>Lumines</em>. The core of the game is as good as ever and is infused with just the right amount of style to turn it into something that’s constantly shifting, all while helping you stay in the right headspace for high score chasing. <em>Lumines</em> might not be as iconic as <em>Tetris</em>, but <em>Arise</em> shows just how similar they can be.</p><p><sub>Lumines Arise <em>launches November 11th on the PS5 and PC.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/817997/lumines-arise-review-ps5-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo is airing a <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-spring-2026-2000625274"><em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em></a> Direct this week. It will include the upcoming sequel’s first full trailer. I’m on the edge of my seat wondering how it will deal with Yoshi.</p> <p>The livestream will be available Wednesday, November 12, at 9:00 a.m. ET for the special Nintendo Direct. “Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation,” the company cautioned. Still, that gives us the rest of the day to wrap our minds around whichever new stars have been cast to bring the latest trip back to the Mushroom Kingdom to life.</p>

  <p>Most importantly, the trailer will likely reveal what Illumination and Nintendo have decided to do with Yoshi’s voice. The green dinosaur was teased at the end of the first <em>Mario Bros. Movie</em> with an egg breaking open in the sewers beneath Brooklyn, and has since been all but confirmed via promotional imagery <a href="https://kotaku.com/your-first-look-at-yoshi-in-the-mario-galaxy-movie-comes-from-a-box-of-cookie-dough-2000642406">for cookie dough</a>.</p>

 <p>But Yoshi is not like most <em>Mario Bros</em>. characters. He’s not humanoid and doesn’t talk in the games. He just shouts “Yoshi!” in an adorable buttercream voice that just melts your heart. That seems like the most obvious approach for the<em> Mario Galaxy Movie</em>, which will seemingly have something to do with the titular plumber and pals exploring new worlds in the stars.</p>

 <p>The alternative is that Yoshi talks and sounds human. Despite the horror, that seems like a non-zero possibility. I’m imagining something like Idris Elba’s version of Knuckles in the Sonic movies: a completely earnest delivery in a vaguely cockney accent that is at once both completely bizarre and yet somehow fitting. I would love for Nintendo and Illumination to really go for something wild here.</p> <p>Give us Nicholas Cage in the role of a lifetime. Even if it’s just him screaming “Yoshi!” every five minutes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Epic Games has denied that gambling mechanics are being added to Fortnite in user-created experiences, despite their own explanation confirming their addition.</p>



<p>Leaks first emerged to state that “gambling” was coming to UEFN, which was confirmed in the latest patch notes, but there appears to be some confusion about the clarification of “gambling” in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-epic-games-denies-gambling-added-to-fortnite">Epic Games Denies ‘Gambling’ Added to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New addition. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Epic Games approached Insider Gaming to request a correction to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-adding-gambling-in-future-update-leaks-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our article about the addition of “gambling” in Fortnite</a>, stating that gambling is against the Fortnite Developer Rules.</p>



<p>Section 1.11 of the Developer Rules states that developers cannot “implement gambling content, raffles, or casino-style games,” which are “prohibited whether or not they involve real money or virtual currency.”</p>



<p>Additionally, section 1.15.5 states that “teach or prominently feature images or activities that are typically associated with real-world gambling, casino-style games, or games of chance that offer a prize, even if they are not directly simulating a gambling experience, are not permitted in any form.”</p>



<p>Epic Games explained that, instead, the addition is for “paid random items” and that developers must “disclose the actual numerical odds of what the player may receive before the player makes a purchase.” However, Epic Games denies that gambling and paid random items are the same.</p>



<p>Despite Epic Games’ arguments, the above still constitutes gambling. Any paid-for item with a chance of a specific reward is still gambling, just as loot boxes in other titles qualify as gambling.</p>



<p>This is confirmed by legal action in countries like Belgium, where the Belgium Gaming Commission <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43906306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banned loot boxes in 2018</a> and declared the content to be “in violation of gambling legislation.”</p>



<p>This article will be updated if Epic Games provides any further details on the addition.</p>

Though they look quite alike and both deal with some heavy themes, the specifics of Rue Valley help it stand apart.</p><p>The game tells the story of a man trapped in a timeloop where each reset changes who he will become and what he can do.

But all the while, a central mystery and the personal lives of other characters become focal points, with the team exploring some of its more serious themes through these characters.</p><p>Rue Valley's way of grappling with mental health issues led the team at Emotion Spark Studio to collaborate with <a href="https://us.movember.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Movember</a>, a leading men's health charity, in hopes of promoting positive change in the lives of players and others.</p><p>“It was really important for us to craft an engaging yet poignant story highlighting the struggles many of us face every day” said Marko Smiljanić, creative director of Emotion Spark Studio. “We’re confident that it will resonate with people in a way that conveys that they’re heard, they’re seen, and they matter.”</p><p>Rue Valley is available now.</p>

The aim, he said, is for Digiphile to become the "best place for publishers," which he feels will ultimately allow it to "deliver the best content for our community."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Everything starts with curation. Each Digiphile collection is a limited-time event, made in collaboration with respected voices in each genre to create meaningful showcases that celebrate what’s worth playing right now," said Hill.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-says-destiny-2-has-underperformed-since-it-acquired-bungie" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony says Destiny 2 has underperformed since it acquired Bungie</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our partner-friendly rev share, reseller protections, and post-promotion community support provide a safer, smarter way to engage a new cohort of players well before they would have organically encountered these games, at a time when momentum matters most.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We’ve also built systems that fix long-standing issues in the bundle space, most notably The Digiphile Exchange, which ensures games reach real players instead of sitting unused. Players can trade in keys for games they already own and receive credit toward other titles featured in our collections. This keeps engagement high and key waste low, a necessity for publishers looking to secure more keys for future promotions."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Digiphile founders understand that 'growth doesn't always equal success'">Digiphile founders understand that 'growth doesn't always equal success'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That partner-friendly revenue share model will see publishers receive a fixed 75 percent cut of every sale—with an additional 5 percent set aside for charity. Hill said partners will receive 100 percent of revenue (minus processing fees) from sales of add-on content such as DLC.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Digiphile doesn’t have a persistent storefront, so each collection is, by design, a limited-time event, maximizing attention and impact while preserving the value of each title," he added.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The long-term goal is to remain independent while expanding the platform with a focus on nurturing communities. "Think Letterboxd meets Humble Bundle," says Hill. "We want to be a place where fans can meet up to share, discuss, and celebrate the things they care about."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/halo-infinite-to-receive-final-major-update-after-four-years" target="_self" data-discover="true">Halo Infinite to receive final major update after four years</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Crucially, Hill said the team won't chase "short term gains" and understands that success isn't purely about delivering growth hand over fist. "A smaller, more intentional approach builds trust with both players and partners. We don't mind doing fewer things if it means doing them well," he continued.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Digiphile's inaugural game collection, Return of the Immersive Sim, has been launched today in support of the Arbor Day Foundation.

The indie studio produces kinesthetic puzzlers that prioritize flow and feeling to deliver avant garde experiences that are, at their very best, utterly transcendental.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the most dedicated members of Enhance's flock will be well aware, there is an near-religious quality to the studio's eclectic oeuvre, and that's not by accident. During a recent interview ahead of the launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lumines Arise</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, studio founder and CEO Tetsuya Mizuguchi explains there is a slogan within the studio:&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Experience is king, and synesthesia is queen."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But there is something that comes on top," he adds. "which is the word 'Kando.' It means 'to move emotionally.'"&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mizuguchi says experience and synesthesia must exist in perfect synchronicity to deliver Kando, which is—in the eyes of the team—as close to perfection as they can possibly get. "They both have to exist, but only when they exist in balance and harmony is when you have the real thing, which is Kando—and Kando is God for us," he continues. "We live by that slogan. And if you don't have Kando, it doesn't matter is one or the other is great. It just doesn't work."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/how-poor-leadership-slows-down-game-development" target="_self" data-discover="true">How poor leadership slows down game development</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ascending the stairway to heaven once more with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lumines Arise</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was no easy task.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;We're the craftsman, and we're humans&quot;">"We're the craftsman, and we're humans"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mizuguchi says "tuning" has become a key word within Enhance.

It's in a very rough state at this point, but we do that because the music element is so important in defining the structure and the flow of the narrative," says Mizuguchi, noting that long-time music collaborators Hydelic are part of that formative process.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's also important because what happens is, after the music is made, we have to break it down into pieces, because now we're starting to build stages. Once we have that big piece of music, we can break it down and identify which sound effects are going to work with each action—such as when a block drops—and so if we don't have that piece of music it would be almost impossible to do that. Even if it's rough, it's very important to have the music so we can identify what the sound effects are going to sound like."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/leadership-lessons-from-mark-darrah-s-days-at-bioware-game-developer-podcast-episode-57" target="_self" data-discover="true">Leadership lessons from Mark Darrah’s days at BioWare - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 57</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To determine whether they're on the right path at that early stage, Mizuguchi ponders whether those primordial sound effects and sonic movements stir emotion.

From that point on, Miziguchi explains working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lumines Arise</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was akin to watching a sculpture take shape.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You're constantly in the process of making these very fine adjustments so that in the end you have this beautiful piece," he adds. That requires each member of the roughly 20 person team to expertly chip away to unearth the intricacies within.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Miziguchi believes it's an approach that requires an "instinctual" understanding of what the end goal is. It also requires constant communication and perhaps most importantly, trust.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ishihara, who directed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lumines Arise</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, describes the process as "labor intensive and very challenging."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Every person's interpretation of a given thing is going to be different, and that's the same with myself and the team.

Then came the next part: communicating with players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Now we've understood each other, how do we then deliver that and have the players understand? I think in order to deliver that message and communicate to the players, that's where each of the characteristics of Lumines come into play: sound, light, and movement," he says. "We use these elements to communicate with players, but it's all down to basically a parameter per element and how much tuning—there's that key word—we do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's down to an 0.01 percent type of shifting here and there.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Tomas Sala is a solo developer known for aerial combat game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-falconeer">The Falconeer</a> and sea-town building game Bulwark - projects that are large and ambitious undertakings for one person. Using AI to offload some of that creative load could be an attractive proposition for someone like him. But of all the people I've spoken to about AI, Sala has some of the strongest remarks to make against it.</p>
<p>That's not to say he's never used it. He has, as a tool for learning things - in his case asking questions about programming. He especially likes being able to talk to it in his native language Dutch. "It can be very beneficial," Sala tells me in a video call. "But as a creation tool," he adds, "it sucks balls."</p>
<p>Creating pictures with AI is like playing a slot machine, he says, by which I presume he means you're never sure what's going to come out. Mostly, Sala says, "AI looks like shit now or reads like shit." He knows it'll get better - that much seems inevitable - and that's the point in time that particularly worries him. "I'm not so much worried for me," he says. "I've already found my direction.<strong> </strong>I am mostly afraid - I have kids - for how we as a society deal with creativity; how we value creative people and creative creators, in the broad sense of the word. Makers."</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Consider a Reddit post he came across last week written by a gaming enthusiast who's a fan of AI. This person wrote, according to Sala: "I can't wait till these filthy game development companies that take all our money and treat us like shit get replaced by AI, where we can just ask and have the game I want tailor-made for me as I play it." Or words to that effect. "That's the fantasy," Sala says - it's the belief AI can create anything we want.</p><p>"As a creator it is frightful that people would have such limited fantasies," Sala says in response. "It's a future where 'I just want to feel great - bump it into my brain'," he says. He likens it to recreational drug use which, he quips, "is probably cheaper than a ChatGTP subscription is going to be in a couple of years".</p>
<p>And the cost-warning is a good point: we are in the attachment phase now where big tech companies are trying to attach us to their AI services. Onboarding prices are attractive in the attempt to lure us in. But once we're there and we begin to rely on the AI services, prices will inevitably rise, and we'll probably pay because we won't want to do without it. Tangentially, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">see Microsoft's recent Xbox Game Pass price-hike</a> - it's a broadly similar thing.</p>

<p>"Hey kid," says Sala, voicing another issue he has with the Redditor's post, "do you really think the people that are fucking up gaming are not going to find a way to make money off your back and your AI, or whatever you're going to enjoy? Whatever is going to bring enjoyment, there will be people trying to make a buck and reducing it to the lowest common denominator." The App Store is a good example, he says. "That is ultimate monetisation without boundaries. Whatever this stuff is bringing," he goes on, "it's opening up so much darkness at the same time."</p><p>Sala tells me another story about worrying AI use, this time about a friend with a tech startup, who was approached by someone with one clear and unscrupulous idea: "I want to make the algorithm that makes the ultimate addictive online gambling experience," Sala's friend was told, as per Sala's recollection. "I want to do that with AI: learn from all the gamblers and then make it even more... Supercharge it."</p>
<p>"And that's the world we live in," Sala says. "That's what we're using AI for. We're not curing cancer. We're figuring out how to reduce people to emasculated puppets that get in line to get their shot. It's Soma - it's fucking Soma!" he says, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soma-review">referencing the superb horror game</a> from 2015. "That's what it is. It's sedation. That is my base fear."</p>
<p>I was speaking to Sala in light of him remastering his debut, breakout hit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-falconeer-review-i-love-that-we-live-in-a-world-where-theres-a-launch-title-like-this">The Falconeer, which I really liked when it launched alongside Xbox Series S/X</a>, and it sounds as though it's now significantly improved (and it's heavily discounted by way of a remaster promotion; note, original owners should get the update for free). And it's this approach with The Falconeer of considerable post-release development that has come to characterise <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-viral-hits-like-escape-from-duckov-and-megabonk-change-the-industry-falconeer-developer-tomas-sala-has-found-another-way-to-survive">Sala's approach to game-making in 2025</a>. Doubling-down on nurturing and growing communities around his work is his way of surviving in an increasingly viral-hit-driven market. He seems happier, his audience is happier because it's playing better, constantly evolving games, and Sala has a more reliable safety net around him, from their support, because of it.</p>
<p>Incidentally, he's also soon to begin work on a third game in the Ursee trilogy called Ancient Waves - a shipping-focused take on that same stormy archipelago world.</p>

            <p>Following a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">plagiarism scandal</a> and an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">indefinite delay</a> earlier this year, Bungie's corporate overlords Sony have reiterated again that extraction shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> is still aiming to release by March next year. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s struggles have seen the parent corp flatly admit that game's not doing as well as Sony imagined when they bought Bungie.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>During an <a href="https://www.irwebmeeting.com/sony/fast/20251111/SzQTgsRB/202603_2q_02_en/index.html">earnings call</a> as part of the company's latest financial results, Sony CFO Lin Tao responded to a question about Marathon by declaring that they are "fully dedicated to launching the title as scheduled". That schedule being by the end of this financial year, which concludes at the end of March 2026. Tao's words aren't that surprising, given they've been the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-confident-marathon-will-release-by-march-2026-and-that-their-live-service-transition-is-paying-off">company line</a> throughout this year.
</p>
<p>However, back in August, Tao did mention that Bungie hoped to be able to stick a fresh release date on the game at some point this autumn. We're by no means out of that window yet and things could change any day now, but as of writing no new date's been forthcoming and winter beckons. To be fair, Tao revealed that Bungie are still "in the process of analysing Marathon's performance in terms of gameplay and retention during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-shows-signs-of-life-with-a-closed-network-test-scheduled-for-later-this-month">October's technical test</a>, with tweaks to be made "as needed".</p>
<p>Things being pretty quiet on the Marathon front <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-seek-to-reassure-everyone-that-marathon-is-still-alive-by-saying-almost-nothing-about-it">isn't unusual at this point</a>, but questions'll only intensify if it keeps inching closer to March without that new date.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, these financial results revealed that Sony's accountants have had to record an impairment charge which indicates that Bungie's current value is about 31.5 billion yen (about £155 million/$204 million) less than the number the corp would like it to be. That underperformance relative to what was envisioned by Sony when they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sonys-purchase-of-bungie-is-now-complete">bought the studio</a> is being dumped firmly at Destiny 2's door, with Tao saying that "partially due to the changes in the competitive environment, the level of sales and user engagement have not reached the expectations we had". As a result, profits have been cut into and corporate frowny faces abound, though Tao did declare that the companies "will continue to make improvements". Hopefully that doesn't just mean <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">more layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>Here's also hoping Marathon can avoid a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">Concord-esque fate</a> whenever it fully breaks cover.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-airpods-4-suddenly-drop-to-almost-free-early-black-friday-strategy-or-just-a-clearance-move.1349758/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re still a couple weeks shy of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. While you can expect to find lots of deals over that late-November weekend across consumer tech and pretty every every other category of products, that doesn’t mean you can’t find any lucrative deals right now. The Apple AirPods 4 are just over a year old and are now seeing a pretty significant discount. It’s a great time to pick up a pair if you’ve been holding out. The base model of Apple’s versatile earbuds released at the price of $129. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3769/">Right now, Amazon has them for 34% off, brining the price to just $85. You’ll end up saving yourself a good $44</a>. If you want to upgrade to the model with support for active noise cancellation, you can expect a 16% discount. That pair normally goes for $179, but the deal ends up shaving off $30 so you only have to pay $149 for a limited time.</p>
<p>AirPods have been around for a while now with Apple adding in some incremental improvements with each generation. The latest version in the Apple AirPods 4 feature a refined contour with a shorter stem and quick-press controls for music. Apple put a lot of focus on all-day comfort this time around.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3769/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Isolate Sound</h2>
<p>You can expect better sound quality when it comes to calls all thanks to the new H2 chipset Apple designed. The new chip enables voice isolation to remove background noises. Folks on the other end of the call will be hearing you and only you, even if you’re in a crowded, noisy environment. The AirPods are able to eliminate sounds coming from around you so you come across perfectly clear.</p>
<p>Likewise, you can expect to better audio quality on your end because of the H2 chip. the new acoustic architecture is designed for crystal clear highs and deep bass.</p>



<p>A nice little addition to the AirPods feature set is how the buds interact with Apple’s voice assistant. Sire can now interpret basic gestures such as nodding yes or shaking your head no as a response to question. Not sure which seems weirder though for someone sitting across from you on the subway. You doing that, or you just blankly saying “Yes” or “No” allowed to no one in particular.</p>
<p>Something you can see different between the AirPods 4 and the previous model right away in a side-by-side is Apple has finally done away with the proprietary Lightning port. The case for the AirPods now charge using the now standard USB-C which is a welcome change indeed.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-middle-of-journey/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-is-%E2%80%98only-in-the-middle-of-the-journey%E2%80%99-says-sony.1349755/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony Chief Financial Officer Lin Tao has said that Sony believes the PlayStation 5 is only at the midpoint of its journey.</p>



<div><p>The quote came from Sony’s latest quarterly earnings call, where Sony CFO Line Tao revealed that the PlayStation 5 is currently only in the middle of its lifecycle. Tao said,</p><p>“Our view is that compared to conventional console lifecycles. Looking at the PS4 lifecycle, it seems to be getting longer and longer. Especially the PS4, which was launched in 2013, and it’s been over a decade since then, but there are many active users enjoying the console… So from that perspective, we believe that the PS5 is only in the middle of the journey, and we are really planning to expand it even further.”</p></div>







<h2 id="h-so-when-will-the-ps6-release">So, When Will The PS6 Release?</h2>



<p>Well, Tao’s comments are not actually suggesting that the PlayStation 6 is another five years away, instead, she’s suggesting that the console generation of the PlayStation 5 will bleed through during the PS5. Just like with the current generation with the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, we’re now only just seeing developers move away from the PS4 with its games.</p>



<p>So, in theory at least, the PlayStation 6 is scheduled to release likely in 2027 – 2028, with the PlayStation 5 continuing to be supported to around 2031 – 2032.</p>



<p>The support for the ‘past generation’ is simply because of economics, allowing developers to release on a much bigger market than they would if they just developed games for the latest generation. For instance, on PlayStation 6’s launch, which could sell 10-15 million units in its first year, it’s not an ideal market to solely release a game on. Instead, it’s much better to release on the PlayStation 6 (10-15 million units), plus the PlayStation 5 (likely 100 million units+ by 2027).</p>



<p>It’s why popular games such as Call of Duty still remain on past-generation consoles, simply because the platform still has a large number of players.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-worlds-collide-explained/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is bringing a host of new adventures into the fray, but the mysterious Worlds Collide mode has raised questions among the community.</p>



<p>First emerging as a query following the start of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-preload-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preloads for Black Ops 7 becoming</a> available, a download option for Worlds Collide was confusing, as it wasn’t abundantly clear what the download was for—unlike the options for Zombies and multiplayer, which are self-explanatory.</p>



<p>Fear not, though, as the answer is out there, and we’ve got all the details you need for Worlds Collide in Black Ops 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-worlds-collide-in-black-ops-7">What is Worlds Collide in Black Ops 7?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New adventure. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Worlds Collide is the name for the Campaign in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and specifically refers to the endgame mode available once the campaign is completed.</strong></p>



<p>Black Ops 7 features co-op with up to four players throughout the campaign, with a huge focus on replayability in the post-game when the main story is completed.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-endgame-multiplayer-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed by Activision</a>, the endgame mode is a new and shared experience “where the narrative continues to unfold.” It takes place on the Avalon map, with POIs from across Black Ops history, featuring discoverable intel, expansive skill tracks, and more.</p>



<p>Detailed in the Call of Duty blog, the endgame mode takes place after the conclusion of the 11 co-op campaign missions that make up the game’s story, and tasks players with exploring Avalon to find The Guild’s remaining Command Centers, while battling with exposure zones that are leaking a mysterious toxin into the city.</p>



<p>The area is expected to be the best place to grind for the exclusive campaign camos that are available for weapons in Black Ops 7, for the first time, which adds to the camos available in multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-worlds-collide-pvp-or-pve">Is Worlds Collide PvP or PvE?</h2>



<p><strong>Unlike Warzone, the Worlds Collide endgame mode is an entirely PvE operation, and there is no combat against other players.</strong></p>



<p>The mode is designed for one-to-32 players in squads of up to four, where players can choose to tackle smaller objectives individually in their squad, or combine with other squads to take down more difficult objectives.</p>



<p>Different areas of Avalon have different recommended Combat Ratings, providing varying degrees of challenge for players, but there are no PvP offerings available.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Bridging game and reality.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you ever need to make like Sam Porter and hike through tricky terrain while lugging hefty cargo, Kojima Productions literally has your back, or in this case your knees. Hideo Kojima's studio is partnering with exoskeleton maker Dnsys to release an official Death Stranding 2 On The Beach limited edition exoskeleton to provide knee support. The surprise collaboration was revealed on Kojima Productions’ official X accounts in both <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015/status/1987883970403705323?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Japanese</u></a> and <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1987884067178852705?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>English</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back on November 8, Kojima Productions’ <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015/status/1987110126332023186?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Japanese</u></a> and <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1987104080892993781?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>English</u></a> X accounts teased the collaboration under the cryptic tagline: "A new experience that bridges the game and the real world is coming soon." This prompted puzzled users to guess everything from a headset to some kind of gaming chair, with some clocking that the zoomed-in pictures bore some resemblance to Sam’s supportive exoskeleton.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>DNSYS ✖️ DEATH STRANDING 2 co-branded exoskeleton is here 👍</p><p>📦 Dnsys Z1 Exoskeleton Pro – DEATH STRANDING 2 ON THE BEACH Limited Edition<br>It enhances lower-body strength and stability, allowing humans to keep moving through complex terrain and extreme environments. 🦵🦿… <a href="https://t.co/Yi1E6RnKNC" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Yi1E6RnKNC</a></p></div>— KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS (Eng) (@KojiPro2015_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1987884067178852705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">As revealed in Kojima Productions’ more recent X post, the mystery product turned out to be an actual exoskeleton, made in collaboration with exoskeleton maker Dnsys, which worked with Kojima Productions' art director Yoji Shinkawa to make it look true to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We designed this exoskeleton with the same passion and precision as if it were built for the world of Death Stranding,” said Shinkawa. “Every detail was refined to bring the game’s futuristic vision into reality, creating something Sam himself might wear." The exoskeleton is battery-powered, and even features lights that show how much juice it has left, just like in Death Stranding. No Bridge Baby included, but that's probably just as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although handy for Sam Porter cosplays, it is also a functional and serious piece of equipment. According to the Dnsys <a href="https://dnsys.ai/pages/z1-exoskeleton-death-stranding2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>website</u></a>, the Death Stranding 2 exoskeleton enhances lower body strength and protects the knee joints by offloading the user's body weight, sort of mimicking the game's load-balancing system in real life. In addition to helping you hike miles further, the product description even boasts that you will “instantly feel up to 44 pounds lighter,” which might be useful when in denial about how much you ate post-Christmas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Death Stranding 2: On The Beach Limited Edition Exoskeleton will be available globally from December 2. No word on the price yet, but Dnsys is giving away three of them through a creative competition, details of which can be found at the <a href="https://dnsys.ai/pages/z1-exoskeleton-death-stranding2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>bottom of the product page</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

The park is split into two areas, a Pokémon Forest and Sedge Town. The Pokémon Forest will be a wooded trail with varied terrains in which visitors can spot different Pokémon statues. Sedge Town will offer rides like the Vee Vee Voyage carousel, a Pokémon Center for merch, a Trainer’s Mart offering park-exclusive refreshments, and the Sedge Gym, where you will be able to watch a stage show (complete with dancing Pikachus). There will also be Pokémon meet and greets, plus a Pokémon parade.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"How do you know what you’re going to get?"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Bungie developer Chris Sides has called out the term "extraction shooter," saying it's a "terrible" genre name because it doesn't tell the player what to expect from the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking on the <a href="https://youtu.be/Xqwje5N5ArA?si=ITRZ6Nsu845IdyhY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Shooter Monthly podcast</u></a>, the former director of product on Bungie's upcoming Marathon didn't hold back, stressing that with so many distinct games potentially falling under the umbrella of "extraction shooter," players will find it hard to know "what you're going to get."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The problem is Helldivers 2 can be called an extraction shooter, but it's not. The genre name is so bad," Sides said (thanks, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/former-bungie-director-different-genre-name-for-marathon-extraction-shooter-dumb/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TheGamePost</u></a>). "I hate the genre name of 'extraction shooter.' When I was working on Marathon, I was working with marketing, dying to be like, 'Can we please create a different genre name, because extraction shooter is so dumb.' It's the only genre where its name is a mechanic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Extraction is the mechanic to get out. Helldivers 2, is that an extraction shooter because you extract? No. It's not like Tarkov at all. So the terminology of the genre is already terrible. It makes it really hard to compare these games. It's why Arena Breakout and Tarkov, you can kind of look at it because they're both extraction shooters and they kind of fit the same mold. Comparing Arc Raiders to Tarkov just doesn't really fit. Comparing Arc Raiders to maybe like a Rust could fit, and then Rust... is that an extraction because it's survivor? It's a problem. I cannot stand the name of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So I think that when you say the extraction genre, it should hit your spot, I think it's really the fact that the genre doesn't even know what it is. So you as a player, how do you know what what you're going to get? And I think that's one of the real issues with the genre itself."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's well worth listening to the podcast, where Sides is joined by other shooter developers in an interesting discussion about the extraction shooter genre generally, as well as the problem with how it's named. They discuss everything from Marathon to Arc Raiders and Helldivers 2 to Escape from Tarkov.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the term 'extraction shooter' may be problematic, according to Sides, it hasn't held back the performance of Arc Raiders, which developer Embark Studios describes as a "multiplayer extraction adventure," as opposed to an extraction shooter. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-officially-a-hit-with-over-4-million-copies-sold-and-a-peak-concurrent-player-count-of-700000-across-all-platforms">It sold 4 million copies in less than two weeks</a>, with a peak concurrent player count of 700,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, it was recently delayed out of 2025 and into 2026 as Bungie works to respond to feedback from playtests. Bungie describes Marathon as a "team-based extraction shooter."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Destiny 2 was namedropped today during Sony's Q2 2025 investors call, and not in a positive way. Lin Tao, CFO (Corporate Financial Officer) at Sony Group Corporation, explained that the game's sales have been lower than expected when Sony acquired its developer, Bungie, thus forcing the Japanese corporation to record an impairment loss of 31.5 billion yen, which translates to roughly $204 million at current exchange rates.</p>



<p><em>Regarding Destiny 2, partially due to the changes in the competitive environment, the level of sales and user engagement have not reached the expectation we had at the time of the acquisition of Bungie. While we will continue to make improvements, we downwardly revised the business projection for the time being and recorded an impairment loss against a portion of the assets at Bungie.</em></p>



<p>Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-acquires-bungie-for-3-6-billion-studio-to-remain-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the acquisition of Bungie in early 2022. They spent the huge sum of $3.6 billion, which analysts like Wedbush Securities' Michael Pachter <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-vastly-overpaid-for-bungie-says-pachter-unlike-microsoft-take-two-for-activision-blizzard-zynga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">believed was disproportionate to the value of the studio</a>. The main objective was for Sony to add live service experts to its portfolio, but it's not really paying off, with Destiny 2's Steam numbers <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-player-count-steam-record-low-ahead-of-star-wars-expansion-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropping significantly</a> and the delay of their next game, the first-person extraction shooter Marathon.</p>



<p>Destiny 2 will try to pick itself up with Renegades, the Star Wars-inspired expansion that goes live on December 2, featuring cool new weapons such as lightsabers. But Bungie's real test will be Marathon, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-release-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slated to launch before March 2026</a>. If it failed, it could spell doom for the once-acclaimed developer. </p>

<p>For its part, Sony can rest easy knowing that Helldivers 2, on the other hand, is doing very well. Following its launch on Xbox, the game continues to attract new players on PlayStation 5 and PC, and its sales have significantly increased year-over-year. Despite several blunders (including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-ceo-shares-learnings-from-concord-failure-reckons-psn-requirement-will-keep-pc-games-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ill-fated Concord</a>), live service revenue accounts for 40% of PlayStation's first-party revenue.</p>



<p>In the Q2 2025 financial report, Sony also <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-shipments-reach-84-2-million-units-ghost-of-yotei-sold-3-3-million-units-first-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that PS5 shipments have reached 84.2 million units, while the game Ghost of Yōtei sold more than 3.3 million units in its first month.</p>

              <p>Black Friday is just around the corner, and early discounts are already dropping in right, left, and center. Those looking to purchase a new laptop for work or entertainment – we’ve got good news.</p>
<p>The 17-inch HP touchscreen laptop, which normally retails for over $3,000, is now going for just $990 on Amazon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5446/">That’s an unbelievable 73% discount, but there’s still more. You will also receive a free accessory kit worth almost $200 with your purchase.</a> Of course, like most big deals, this one is also around for a short time, so it’s best to act fast to grab it. We’re expecting the discount to wrap soon, and there’s no telling if it will be back for Black Friday or Cyber Monday.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5446/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Everything You Need to Get Started Right Away</h2>
<p>Starting off with the accessory kit; it includes Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, an external optical drive, a wireless mouse, and a cleaning cloth. These are all useful add-ons, but Windows 11 Pro steals the spotlight. This operating system is one of the best ones out there in terms of overall experience. Microsoft has packed it with a bunch of security features, productivity tools, and system management options, making it ideal for work professionals and creatives. It’s also more expensive than the Home version, but you don’t have to worry about that here.</p>
<p>As for the laptop itself, you’re getting a massive 17.3-inch HD+ (1600×900) anti-glare touchscreen that delivers clear, vibrant visuals. Colors will pop while staying easy on the eyes. Touch support makes it easy to scroll, pinch, swipe, and type directly on the screen using your fingertips. You can use it to sketch and even take notes when you’re not feeling like using the keyboard.</p>



<p>There’s also an HP True Vision 720p camera with a physical privacy shutter paired with AI Noise Reduction for better video calls. The battery offers up to 9 hours of video playback, meaning you can go a full day without plugging the laptop in. And when you do need to recharge, it goes from 0 to 50% in just 45 minutes!</p>
<p>Powering the device is an <strong>AMD Ryzen 5 7430U 6-core processor with 32GB RAM</strong> for faster and more efficient multitasking. The <strong>2TB SSD</strong> lets you store all your important documents, media content, and programs with ease. Together, these are enough to help you be productive on your busy days where you need to work with multiple applications at the same time, take back-to-back video calls, create presentations, etc.</p>
<p>We highly recommend grabbing the deal as soon as you can, before the retailer pushes the price up for good.</p>
