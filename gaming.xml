                <p>In less than a week, the new Switch 2 console has become the "fastest-selling" hardware globally for Nintendo, as the company reported 3.5 million units were sold in just four days.</p><p>"Fans around the world are showing their enthusiasm for Nintendo Switch 2 as an upgraded way to play at home and on the go,‚Äù Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser said in a press statement following the announcement of the sales milestone. "We are thankful for their response and happy to see the fun they are already having with Nintendo Switch 2 as they explore new features and games that bring friends and family together in new ways."</p><p>This makes for one of the biggest console launches in history, thanks in part to Nintendo ensuring that it had enough stock available to meet the high demand for the device. In fact, according to industry analyst <a href="https://x.com/zhugeex/status/1932624211878818015?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Daniel Ahmad</a>, the number would make the Switch 2 launch <em>the </em>biggest in home-console history. </p><p>In comparison, the Switch reached 2.74 million units sold in its first month and Sony reported that it had shipped--not sold--3.4 million PS5 consoles during the first month that it was available to purchase. It is worth noting that stock shortages were a major problem for Sony at the time. due to various issues like the global semiconductor shortage.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/">Nintendo is predicting that it will sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles</a> during its current business year--ending in March 2026--and it has been reported that this figure might increase to 20 million as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reportedly-using-samsung-chips-as-nintendo-tries-to-meet-demand/1100-6531666/">Samsung is rumored to be manufacturing chips for the device</a>. Overall, it looks like the Switch 2 is off to a strong start, and it'll be interesting to see if it reaches--or surpasses--the current lifetime sales total of the Switch, which stand at 152 million units sold as of February 2025.</p>

                <p>In just under two months since its release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/" data-ref-id="1900-6418358">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has emerged as one of the most unexpected hits of 2025, with <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1927364988219383892" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 3.3 million copies</a> sold since late April. Now, developer Sandfall Interactive has shared a new patch for the game that gives players another chance to fight Simon, one of the most difficult bosses in the game.</p><p>Simon is an optional boss who can be found in The Abyss, and he has very few weaknesses. As part of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/499449376025873686?curator_clanid=3693985" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the 1.3.0 patch</a>, players can now get a rematch with Simon after beating him the first time. Assuming they can beat him, of course. It's not an easy fight by any stretch, and this undead warrior is a challenge even for veteran players.</p><p>Sandfall notes that the current patch addresses nearly 300 bugs that were found in the game, although it only lists a handful in the notes. According to the devs, a "general polish" was added across collisions, terrain, and scripting. The cutscenes should also scale properly across non-standard resolutions after this patch.</p><p>There aren't any new features in the current update, but the developers have acknowledged multiple <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-address-potential-photo-mode-and-more/1100-6531932/" data-ref-id="1100-6531932">requests for a photo mode</a>, even from other members of the team. According to Sandfall, the developers are "investigating mouse sensitivity issues" after this patch. Sandfall has also added a handful of digital items to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/points/shop/app/1903340" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Clair Obscur's Steam points shop</a>.</p><p>Sandfall is already preparing to start working <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unsurprisingly-another-game-from-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dev-is-coming/1100-6531816/" data-ref-id="1100-6531816">on its next game</a>, but the team will also continue to tweak Clair Obscur to solve any lingering issues.

For instance, we know that the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-shipped-45-million-units-in-2020-matches-ps4s-launch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-shipped-45-million-units-in-2020-matches-ps4s-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS5 sold 4.5 million units</a></span> in total by the end of 2020, which works out to across about seven weeks, and rather importantly included the holidays. (Despite being a launch beset by nightmares, from covid to supply chain disasters, it still pretty much matched sales for the PS4 in 2013.) Even more usefully, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ps5-is-biggest-console-launch-in-history&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ps5-is-biggest-console-launch-in-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we also know that the PS5 had outsold the PS4's 2.1 million units in its first two weeks</a></span>, although without a specific number. That was described at the time as the ‚Äúbiggest console launch in history,‚Äù and given the Switch 2 massively beat that figure in less than a week, it‚Äôs safe to say the mantle has been passed on.</p><p>Nintendo stops short of the full boast, but observes this makes the Switch 2 it‚Äôs own fastest-selling device. The original Switch was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/27/15449380/nintendo-switch-worldwide-sales-march&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/27/15449380/nintendo-switch-worldwide-sales-march" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by Nintendo</a></span> as having sold 2.74 million units in its first month, which it then described as it‚Äôs fastest seller, meaning the Switch 2 has absolutely walloped it so far.  (It‚Äôs fun to note that the Wii U sold a total of 3.5 million units over its first six months.)</p><p>Of course, initial sales are not a guaranteed predictor of long-term forecasts, but they do tend to bode well. Nintendo has rather modestly set its predicted sales for the year at 15 million, presumably trying to keep investors within reasonable expectations against <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438">a bemusing market</a></span> that could be flipped upside-down at any point with the latest of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/sea-of-idiocy-economists-say-trump-tariffs-will-raise-price-of-switch-2-and-everything-else/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/sea-of-idiocy-economists-say-trump-tariffs-will-raise-price-of-switch-2-and-everything-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump‚Äôs mercurial tariff idiocy</a></span>.</p><p>Either way, it‚Äôs good times for Nintendo, and a good sign for a gaming industry that is having the shit beaten out of it of late. While the prices <em>aren‚Äôt</em> the same around the world, at the U.S.‚Äôs $450, that would mean sales of over $1.5 billion in less than a week. Now if only there was a new <em>Super Mario</em> game to play on it.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dune: Awakening has seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-coming-to-console-funcom-confirms-as-pc-game-puts-up-huge-numbers/1100-6532326/" data-ref-id="1100-6532326">big numbers</a> on Steam so far--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-lot-of-people-are-playing-dune-awakening-despite-being-in-premium-early-access/1100-6532178/" data-ref-id="1100-6532178">even in its paid early-access</a> period. At the time of writing, now that the game is officially released for all players, Awakening is the 10th-most-played game on the <a href="https://steamdb.info/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam Charts</a>, with a 24-hour peak of 142,000 players. The game also has very positive reviews on Steam, though even the positive reviews note a bit of wonkiness with the game's current state, especially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-settings-fodune-awakening-to-remove-stutters-and-improve-fps/1100-6532153/" data-ref-id="1100-6532153">when it comes to performance</a>.</p><p>Without the extensive early-access period <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-isnt-early-access-but-will-let-you-pay-to-play-early/1100-6530320/" data-ref-id="1100-6530320">often used</a> for this kind of online survival-crafting game, Funcom has been using the paid earl- access period to rapidly patch issues as they arise--including <a href="https://x.com/DuneAwakening/status/1931366318730625479" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">adding new servers</a> as they become necessary.</p><p>The 1.1.0.11 patch notes can be found in full below, but it seems likely Funcom will continue to regularly patch the game as issues arise in its early lifespan.

                <p>During <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest</a>, Microsoft opened the final day with an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a> that threw the spotlight on titles coming to Xbox Series X|S either this year or next. Following the presentation, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer briefly addressed the challenges of "running a good business" while remaining accountable to Microsoft's expectations for the division.</p><p>"Our jobs inside the company is to run a good business," said Spencer during his appearance on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/podcast/phil-spencer-xbox-games-showcase-interview-the-official-xbox-podcast/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official Xbox podcast</a>. "We're accountable to Microsoft for running a good business--a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line. That's kind of a foundation for us. And what that does is it allows us to continue to invest in Xbox for our community of players and creators and that we're doing. It does mean we have to make tradeoffs through the year on things that we're going to invest more in. [And] things that we're not going to invest as much in, because we are the business that we are. But the business is having really good success."</p><p>Spencer touted Game Pass as "having an amazing year" and praised Xbox's first-party games for their performance in 2025. It's worth noting that Spencer has used similar language about running "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/" data-ref-id="1100-6524121">a sustainable business</a>" to explain the closures of studios like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks.</a> The latter was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-saved-by-pubg-publisher-krafton-hi-fi-rush-rights-also-acquired/1100-6525702/" data-ref-id="1100-6525702">successfully revived by its new owner</a>, Krafton, but other studios weren't as lucky and numerous devs lost their jobs.</p><p>Additionally, Spencer has explained repeatedly that the decision to bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and other former Xbox-exclusive titles to PlayStation was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-discusses-bringing-indiana-jones-to-ps5-we-run-a-business/1100-6526011/" data-ref-id="1100-6526011">a business call</a>. That proved to be a fortuitous choice for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-on-ps5-releases-in-april/1100-6529770/" data-ref-id="1100-6529770">Forza Horizon 5</a>, both of which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/microsoft-titles-top-the-charts-for-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-april-2025/2900-6532/" data-ref-id="2900-6532">topped PSN charts in April</a>.</p><p>During his podcast appearance, Spencer said that watching <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keeper-is-the-new-double-fine-adventure-and-it-looks-wild/1100-6532262/" data-ref-id="1100-6532262">Keeper</a> come together for the Xbox Games Showcase "reignited my Double Fine love."

                <p>Gamers may have noticed a recent email about instructions for getting their share of a legal settlement with GameStop. While people are right to be suspicious about emails promising money, this settlement is legitimate. And if you've purchased something online from GameStop in the last five years, then the company may owe you some money.</p><p>Following <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Content/Documents/Settlement%20Agreement.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a class-action settlement</a> filed earlier this year, GameStop <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Content/Documents/Notice.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has put forth $4.5 million</a> to resolve the issue of whether the company improperly disclosed customers' personal information to Facebook via the Facebook Tracking Pixel (now Meta Pixel) without their permission.</p><h3>Who can file a claim for their share of the settlement?</h3><p>There are two primary criteria for getting a share this settlement. Recipients are only eligible if they purchased a video game from GameStop's site between August 18, 2020 and April 17, 2025. Players also need to have maintained a public Facebook profile with their real names at the time the purchase was made.</p><h3>What's the settlement amount per person?</h3><p>GameStop customers who qualify for the settlement can choose between a cash payment of up to $5 in cash or up to $10 as a voucher that can be used on GameStop's site. Players who opt for the former can receive payments through Paypal, Venmo, and Zelle. Those who opt for the voucher will receive the credit through their GameStop account. The voucher will expire one year after it is received.</p><h3>How can a claim be filed?</h3><p>There are two options to file a claim. Customers can either <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Home/SubmitClaim" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fill out this online form</a> or print out <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Content/Documents/Claim%20Form.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this PDF form</a>, complete the requested information, and mail it to the following address:</p><p>GameStop VPPA Settlement Administrator</p><p>P.O. Box 4129</p><p>Portland, OR 97208-4129</p><h3>What's the deadline to file a claim?</h3><p>The deadline to file a claim or to object to the class settlement is August 15, 2025. The date of the final approval hearing is September 18, 2025. All payments and vouchers are expected to be distributed 55 days after the final approval of the deal and the conclusion of any appeals.</p>

As a kid,&nbsp;Katamari Damacy&nbsp;was a weird and wacky sandbox that was so much fun to pick up and play. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/12/17/katamari-damacy-reroll-review/">Returning to it years later</a> helped me appreciate not only the touching story of togetherness that the game culminates in, but the effort that was put into making the simple act of play so perfectly satisfying.The blending of lofty themes with intertwined gameplay didn‚Äôt just elevate the themes, but is still fun as heck to play in it‚Äôs own way. I had high hopes that To a T would take this further. The game does have a poignant and heartwarming message behind it, but the lack of any kind of satisfying or consistent gameplay to go along with it makes this more of a mixed bag than gaming bliss.</p>
<p><iframe title="TO A T | Coming to PC, PS5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S May 28" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E-QlrrC4vFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In To a T, you play as a young child who‚Äôs inexplicably stuck in a permanent T-pose. It isn‚Äôt clear why, but you‚Äôre used to it ‚Äì it‚Äôs a part of your everyday life at this point. Despite some low moments like dealing with bullies who make fun of your predicament, you‚Äôve got a loving dog companion and a bunch of anthropomorphic animal townsfolk who support and cheer you on each day. Before the game has barely even gotten started, its message was already clear, yet the game wastes no time driving it home with a repeating theme song sung by the characters every chapter about how ‚Äúyou are the perfect shape.‚Äù</p>


<p>It‚Äôs beautiful, but it‚Äôs simple, and it also never goes much further from there through the games eight chapters. As you spend each day visiting a talking giraffe who makes you sandwiches, heading to your quaint Japanese middle school, and exploring your bustling suburban town, there‚Äôs little in the way of conflict and nothing new layered onto the initial message of the game by the time you reach that final act. I feel like a young child or someone struggling with their own self-conscious worries will connect with the game and learn a lot from it, I just wish there were more going on with the subtext, or the characters, or the story as a whole to make the destination as worthwhile as the journey.</p>


<p>My bigger issue is that you aren‚Äôt really doing anything specific or particular throughout To a T. There is no consistent or focused gameplay besides the act of running around town and, sometimes, collecting floating pink coins you can exchange for new outfits. Every story scene you trigger in the game leads to a bespoke minigame where the thesis is always ‚Äúdo a very normal thing, except it‚Äôs really hard because you‚Äôre T-posing!‚Äù It‚Äôs charming at first, but not forever. And since each of these scene‚Äôs are different from the last and over before you know it, there‚Äôs no evolving of gameplay concepts or increasing difficulty. These minigames never reach the rage-bait level of Getting Over It with Bennet Foddy, but they also never reach the endless trance mode of Katamari Damacy.</p>
<p>I wanted to love To a T a lot more than I do, but between the basic story and the unfocused gameplay, by the time my four hours with the game were over, I just felt like, ‚ÄúHuh, okay then.‚Äù It isn‚Äôt a bad game by any means, and I think a certain audience will absolutely connect with it in a really impactful way, but after so many years, it just isn‚Äôt what I was hoping for as the next game from Keita Takahashi.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		To a T is a cute game about acceptance and community, but it doesn't do enough to keep it's concept fresh or engaging for the duration of the game, and there's a major lack of enjoyable gameplay to pair with it.	</p></div>

Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250611.html">revealed today</a> that it has sold more than 3.5 million Switch 2 units in the console‚Äôs first four days, surpassing records for any of Nintendo‚Äôs hardware within the same launch period. But the record is more significant than that.</p><p>Daniel Ahmad, director of research and insights at Niko Partners, points out <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1932624211878818015">on X</a> that the Switch 2 is ‚Äúthe fastest selling home video game console of all time.‚Äù It took Sony 16 days to sell 2.1 million PS4 consoles, and six weeks to reach 4.2 million units. The Switch 2 has also comfortably beaten the PS5 launch, which debuted during the pandemic and associated chip supply constraints. It took seven weeks for Sony to sell-through 4.4 million PS5 units.</p><p>It‚Äôs clear that Nintendo was able to meet pent-up demand for a Switch successor by having ample inventory on hand in key markets. Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655361/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-sold-out-walmart-gamestop-target">preorders sold out</a> across major retailers in the US ahead of the launch, but there was still some limited stock on launch day for those willing to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/680294/switch-2-gamestop-launch-event-nintendo-america-ceo">line up at midnight</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/680417/they-just-sold-me-a-switch-2">take a chance</a> in the morning. The threat of price increases from tariffs likely helped goose initial demand, too.</p><p>While the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk">isn‚Äôt the biggest</a> UK console launch of all time and it seemed relatively <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/680251/its-easy-to-buy-a-nintendo-switch-2-in-the-uk">easy for Brits to buy one</a> on launch day, it‚Äôs still the fourth best-selling console in the UK according to data from NielsenIQ.</p><p>Analysts had widely predicted strong Switch 2 launch sales, despite a lack of launch titles for Nintendo‚Äôs latest console. Nintendo‚Äôs record-breaking Switch 2 sales are thanks to a lot of pent-up demand waiting on this new hardware, and Nintendo using that time to build enough units to meet demand.</p><div><p>The real question now is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/677301/the-switch-2s-promising-start-hides-an-uncertain-future">whether Nintendo can keep up this sales pace</a>, and if tariffs and handheld alternatives could slow down sales. Nintendo is aiming to hit its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/663130/nintendo-switch-2-sales-forecast-15-million">goal of 15 million Switch 2 console</a> sales by the end of March 2026, and it‚Äôs already off to a good start with 3.5 million in four days.</p></div><p>The original Switch launched in March 2017 and <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/historical_data/index.html">sold 17.79 million units</a> in its first 13 months on sale ‚Äî more than Nintendo‚Äôs own estimates at the time. The Switch has now sold more than 150 million units over its lifetime, pushing it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605948/nintendo-switch-lifetime-sales-nintendo-ds">close to overtaking the DS</a> as Nintendo‚Äôs best-selling console.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That understated showing extended to the actual ‚ÄúPlay Days‚Äù show floor in Los Angeles, where developers gave press and content creators a chance to try out new games. What made the show so odd on a smaller scale was that I was the only person on-site covering the show for <em>Kotaku</em>. </p><p>I‚Äôve been to Play Days the past three years, and for reasons outside of our control, fewer <em>Kotaku</em> writers have been sent to the biggest American games event with each trip around the sun. As just one person, I was only able to see a handful of games during the event. This means <em>Kotaku</em> unfortunately missed out on a ton of really cool projects, games that I was only able to look at longingly as I passed by them at the show.</p><p>I hope things are different in 2026, but for now, here are the games I played and saw at Summer Game Fest 2025. </p><p><strong><em>This article will be updated periodically as embargoes lift.</em></strong></p></div></div><div><p>I know <em>Mario Kart World </em>is the kart racer to beat right now, and while I can‚Äôt say definitively if Sega‚Äôs latest <em>Sonic Racing</em> game clears that high bar, I can say what I‚Äôve played of <em>Crossworlds </em>is a blast. The big headliners from the show were the crossover characters announced at the showcase, but I didn‚Äôt play as Hatsune Miku, Joker, or Ichiban; I was focused squarely on getting behind the wheel as my guy Shadow the Hedgehog. <em>Crossworlds </em>definitely feels a bit lighter and floatier than other kart racers, but what it lacks in weight, it makes up for in a surprisingly deep customization system that lets you create builds for your vehicles tailored to your playstyle. I was able to add perks like starting races with a specific item to give me an edge at the beginning of a lap, reducing damage when I was on the wrong end of an incoming attack, or even using aggressive gameplay to my advantage by granting myself a boost if I collided with an enemy racer. I‚Äôm interested to see what the meta turns out to be when <em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds </em>launches on Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One on September 25.</p></div><div><p><em>Guacamelee </em>developer Drinkbox Studios‚Äô latest game, <em>Blighted</em>, is unlike anything the studio‚Äôs done before. In the brief time I spent with the action RPG, I was most captivated by its world, in which people can gain memories of the dead by eating their brains. This desecrated land is overrun by horrifying creatures that stand between you and a monster who has begun feasting on the brains of the living and blighted the rest of this world. The game feels reminiscent of <em>Hades</em>‚Äô frantic but strategic combat with an isometric view. Its enemy design is its greatest strength, with several of the monsters I faced requiring me to change up my play style and adapt to the moment. </p><p><em>Blighted </em>is launching in 2026.</p></div><div><p><em>Dosa Divas </em>is the next game from Outerloop Studios, the team behind <em>Thirsty Suitors</em>, one of 2023‚Äôs most delightful surprises. Though I only got to play about 30 minutes of the turn-based RPG, I was already drawn in by its cheeky, timely satire. The game follows siblings Samara and Amani as they face a third sister, who has created a fast food empire so pervasive that it has essentially turned the culture of cooking into a bygone era. The people in <em>Dosa Divas </em>have become so accustomed to convenience that good food created with love and intention is dying out in favor of meaningless slop. That sure does sound like, well, every creative medium right now in the wake of AI-generated garbage and America‚Äôs attempts to eject entire cultures from its borders. A quick and easy approximation of something is no replacement for the potential of the original when it‚Äôs made with heart and soul. This cathartic premise is enough to grab my interest, but its simple yet engaging turn-based combat is also a fun vehicle to ride as I watch this sibling rivalry play out.</p></div><div><p><em>Snap &amp; Grab </em>is one of the more interesting takes on a heist game that I‚Äôve seen. Rather than executing the crime of a lifetime on your own, the game<em> </em>has you scope out a location to plan a course of action for someone else to take in your stead. As world-renowned photographer Nifty Nevada, I was able to freely take photos at a fancy rich people party, yet instead of merely capturing the festivities, I was actually taking photos of the penthouse to chart out a plan for one of my goons to come in and steal a priceless artifact for me. I had access to most places in the home, so I was able to take photos of where guards would be posted and note potential distractions or weaknesses in the security system. If I could account for all those pitfalls, it‚Äôd be a quick grab and dash for my accomplices. As I walked through the penthouse, I noted several other potential setups that I missed in previous runs, so <em>Snap &amp; Grab </em>seems to give you a lot of freedom to chart your own course. I hope it has more surprises in store when it launches next year.</p></div><div><p>Leading up to my appointment, <em>Mixtape </em>was far and away one of the most talked-about games at Summer Game Fest, and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Beethoven and Dinosaur‚Äôs adventure game stars a group of teenagers in the ‚Äò90s creating a playlist for their final night together. Each song on the mixtape is accompanied by what is essentially a playable music video animated in a distinct, <em>Spider-Verse</em>-like, stop-motion-esque art style. Every segment is as unique and memorable as the song that accompanies it. The songs are attached to flashbacks of the group‚Äôs high school antics, and in just the short time I played, each segment was a rolicking good time full of that kind of ‚Äúus-against-the-world‚Äù hope you feel when you‚Äôre a teen who hasn‚Äôt had that optimism beaten out of you yet. I want it now, but I‚Äôll have to wait until the full game is released later this year.</p></div><div><p><em>Absolum </em>was probably my biggest surprise of the show. I went in with no real knowledge, and was kinda disappointed when I had to stop playing it for another appointment. Developed by the team behind <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>, <em>Absolum </em>marries those same pitch-perfect beat-em-up stylings with roguelite runs. It‚Äôs frenetic, stylish, challenging, and has a gorgeous 2D animation style that‚Äôs lovely to look at. I played as an agile character whose base kit prioritized quick, vicious combos, and a grappling hook that let me close distance and tear through enemies with reckless abandon. But <em>Absolum </em>has multiple playable characters with different playstyles that you customize throughout each roguelite run. What I played felt deep, demanding, and rewarding, and I can‚Äôt wait to play more when the game launches on PC, PS4, PS5, and Switch.</p></div><div><p>The old-school <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>games were a blind spot for me for a long time. I played a little of the 3D action titles on the original Xbox and my fair share of <em>Dead or Alive</em>, but as far as the tough-as-nails sidescrollers that started it all, I never saw Ryu Hayabusa‚Äôs origins. Ryu isn‚Äôt the main character in <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>, but his apprentice Kenji is taking the lessons he‚Äôs learned from the OG out into the field with him. <em>Ragebound </em>is a pretty tough and unforgiving sidescroller that can lay you out in a second if you‚Äôre not careful. Its combat is one pillar of that challenge. But its platforming, in which you scale walls, hang from ceilings, and overall use every surface to your advantage in one way or another, tests your spacial awareness while half a dozen enemies are pestering you (or just one enemy you can‚Äôt even damage under normal circumstance is menacingly charging up an attack, preparing to take you out in an instant). It feels like a faithful throwback, and your mileage may vary on whether you‚Äôre up for the task.</p></div><div><p>If you‚Äôve ever played something from Supermassive Games, you probably have some idea what you‚Äôre getting into with <em>Directive 8020</em>. The narrative horror team is delving into sci-fi for the latest entry in <em>The Dark Pictures Anthology</em>, and while I spent probably the least amount of time with it of all the games I checked out (roughly 15 minutes), I did see enough to know Supermassive is still doing what it does best: riffing on different horror genres with difficult choices and consequences for your actions. <em>Directive 8020 </em>shows a space station crew turning against each other in paranoia as an alien force that can transform into anyone infiltrates their group, sowing distrust between them as they try to survive. My time with the game was short but sweet.</p></div><div><p>Vermila Studios‚Äô horror shooter <em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>wears its OG <em>Bioshock </em>influence on its sleeve. But rather than a sunken city, it takes place in a worn-down version of Spain haunted by twisted puppets and mannequins that can only be destroyed by bullets powered by your own blood. It‚Äôs unnerving and atmospheric, and its use of your health bar as your blood-fueled ammo means you have to make every shot count, lest you die while fighting for your life.</p></div><div><p>The farming sim genre can feel a bit oversaturated these days, as everyone chases <em>Stardew Valley</em>‚Äôs success. To stand out in 2025, you‚Äôve gotta have some kind of twist that keeps things fresh. <em>Grave Seasons </em>illustrated that to me in just 30 minutes. The moment that made it click for me was when I was pulling crops out of my garden and found a severed human hand buried in the dirt alongside them. Farming sims are often viewed as a cozy getaway, so <em>Grave Seasons </em>using it as a stage to explore a supernatural murder mystery is the kind of subversive take that carves out space in a crowded market.</p></div><div><p>&nbsp;<em>Relooted </em>was another interesting spin on a heist game that I played in LA, with its bite-sized robberies feeling like brain-teasing puzzles about meticulously planning one swift run from entrance to exit. The game follows an African crew reclaiming stolen artifacts from Western museums, with each member having a skill that makes them crucial to getting these items back where they belong. Your job as the field agent is to assign your team to different stations, so when you grab an item, you‚Äôve cleared a path for yourself to book it once the alarms start blaring. Arranging a perfect getaway feels satisfying, and it helps that <em>Relooted</em>‚Äôs sidescrolling parkour is smooth as hell. I played a few early heists, so I can only imagine how much more elaborate later heists can get, and how crafty I‚Äôll have to be to see them through.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Next year will be the 25th anniversary of the original Xbox, the system that marked Microsoft's entrance into the console wars.

            <p>Nintendo has provided a solution to an issue causing the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>'s battery indicator to display incorrectly.</p>
<p>While some have criticised the new console for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-battery-life-revealed">having a poor battery life</a>, it turns out in some instances the indicator is actually just not showing the correct percentage.</p>
<p>But, there's a fix! <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68272/~/the-battery-charge-indicator-or-percentage-displays-incorrectly-on-nintendo">Nintendo has provided steps</a> "for when the battery amount displayed and the actual remaining battery use don't match". It's easy enough, but does require you to access the console's Recovery Mode.</p>

<p>The steps from Nintendo are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Confirm you're using an adequately powerful AC adapter to charge your console (while the original Switch adapter can be used to charge a Switch 2 directly, it is not powerful enough to charge the Switch 2 when docked)</li>
<li>Confirm that your console has the latest system update</li>
<li>Power off the console</li>
<li>Press and hold down the volume up (+) and volume down (-) buttons, press the POWER Button once to turn the system on.</li>
<li>Keep holding down the volume buttons until the menu for Recovery Mode appears. Navigating to this menu should reset the battery level meter.</li>
<li>Power off the console again by pressing and holding the POWER Button until it turns off.</li>
<li>Power the console back on and monitor the situation</li>
</ol>
<p>Nintendo notes further that if following these steps multiple times does not resolve the battery indicator issue, the console will need to be sent in for service.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/MetroidFREAK21/status/1932218979956691244">One user on X</a> noted their battery jumped from 85 percent to 91 percent after following these steps, so it's worth double checking on your own console if the battery appears to be lower than expected.</p>
<p>For more details on the console's battery, we've got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-battery-life-charge-time">guide on the Switch 2 battery</a> explaining more on its life expectancy.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">Nintendo revealed it has sold 3.5m Switch 2 consoles</a> in its first four days on sale, becoming the fastest-selling piece of Nintendo hardware.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>MindsEye, the game developed by Build a Rocket Boy which launched this week on PC and consoles, is another Unreal Engine 5-powered game that can only hit 60 FPS at 4K resolution using NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation on one of the most powerful GPUs on the market.</p>
<p>A new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> takes a look at how the game developed by the studio founded by former Rockstar North president Leslie Benzies runs on an RTX 5080 at 4K and 1440p resolution, two resolutions the GPU should be able to handle well in most titles. Unfortunately, the game is another Unreal Engine 5 GPU destroyer, as, at 4K resolution, MindsEye barely hits the 60 FPS mark only with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality Mode and Frame Generation, and it's only with Multi Frame Generation that a sort of high refresh rate experience is achievable at that resolution. Things fare only marginally better at 1440p resolution, but seeing the game running only at around the 60 FPS mark at native resolution suggests how no other GPU on the market besides the beast that is the RTX 5090 can properly handle the game in its current state.</p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye - Another UE5 GPU Destroyer | RTX 5080 4K, 1440p DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gIxNsAQh_8k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>No one who followed MindsEye until its release should be surprised to see that the game is launching with plenty of issues. Right before launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">two Build a Rocket Boy chief executives left the studio</a>, and it was widely reported by those who got early copies on consoles that the game was in a very rough state, which the <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">major day one patch</a> improves only marginally.</p>
<p>MindsEye is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

Many of the negative reviews focus on MindsEye‚Äôs performance problems, which appear to be hitting PC gamers hard.

We understand that the current minimum spec requirements are very high, but our engineering team are working around the clock to improve performance on mainstream hardware as well as consoles by integrating the performance improvements in Unreal Engine V5.6. We will provide patch 3 update timing, including these improvements, within the next 24 hours. In addition to the main campaign, we would also value your thoughts on Build.Mindseye.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">MindsEye, led by former Rockstar North chief Leslie Benzies, has endured a tumultuous run-up to release. Last week, Build A Rocket Boy said fans should wait for MindsEye‚Äôs official launch rather than play it before its street date, after early copies made their way into the hands of players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want everyone to experience the story the same way at the same time on day one, without bias," Build A Rocket Boy said in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-calls-on-fans-to-wait-for-official-launch-after-street-date-breaks-a-week-early-confirms-major-day-one-update-for-physical-copies"><u>statement issued in response to early copies being played</u></a>. "This means waiting until the official release date to play through the game firsthand."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mention of bias in the studio's statement sparked speculation that the company was referring back to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments"><u>comments made by its co-CEO Mark Gerhard</u></a>, who suggested there had been a "concerted effort" to "trash the game and the studio" with negative social media posts from paid accounts or bots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-boss-says-he-doesnt-believe-people-are-being-paid-to-post-negative-comments-about-mindseye"><u>IGN subsequently put this claim to Hakan Abrak, boss of Hitman developer IO Interactive</u></a>, the company which is publishing MindsEye. His response: "I don't know. I don't believe that. I don't believe that. I just think the game should speak for itself on June the 10th."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Physical copies of MindsEye also needed a ‚Äúmajor‚Äù update for ‚Äúkey improvements to ensure MindsEye plays as we intended and to meet all the characters at their best.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And just days before MindsEye‚Äôs launch, Build a Rocket Boy‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>confirmed they had left the company</u></a>, sparking concern from the studio‚Äôs fledgling community.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MindsEye Screenshots May 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Steam concurrents do not tell the whole story, of course. MindsEye launched on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S as well as PC, so its true concurrent player count will be higher than that reported on Valve‚Äôs platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MindsEye carries a $59.99 price tag. At launch, there is a ‚Äútightly crafted linear story campaign,‚Äù and what‚Äôs called ‚Äúsingle-player free roam,‚Äù but there are also a number of missions: a horde mode mission called ‚ÄúDestruction Site Shootout,‚Äù and two combat missions (‚ÄúHonor Amongst Thieves‚Äù and ‚ÄúFriendly Fire‚Äù). Also at launch are six races, six checkpoint races, and three drone races. If you get the premium pass, you get an extra horde mode mission and an exotic cosmetics pack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following launch, Build A Rocket Boy said it will deliver a ‚Äúconstant stream‚Äù of fresh premium content monthly, ‚Äúensuring MindsEye is a living, ever-expanding player experience.‚Äù This includes new missions, challenges, and game assets. ‚ÄúThe continuous stream of studio-developed content, combined with the very best of the community‚Äôs own beautiful creations, means that MindsEye will continue to surprise and delight its players for decades to come,‚Äù Build A Rocket Boy added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy also confirmed its 2025 roadmap of content. In the summer there will be community updates, new missions, in the fall new single-player modes, multiplayer, and new missions, and in the winter free roam updates and new missions. Premium pass owners get extra missions and new packs throughout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

For the uninitiated, the Horus Heresy is the Space Marine civil war that took place 10,000 years before the current Warhammer 40,000 setting. It is the foundation of 40K‚Äôs grimdark universe, and reveals how the carrion Emperor ended up on the Golden Throne.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Siege of Terra: End of Ruin is a hugely exciting release for 40K lore fans (the standard edition is available to <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgGjJ?object_uuid=741aa9ae-3a67-4217-a1c4-bdda8e62b07f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">preorder on Amazon</a>), but its special edition is even more enticing. It features a leather-effect cover with gold foil details, gilt page edges, and a metal emblem of a ruined Imperial eagle.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/preorders-jun07-bl-01-eraofruinltd-nkuyovjdyk-1749632718756.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The special edition of Siege of Terra: End of Ruin. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop had signaled the special edition would be available ‚Äústrictly while stocks last,‚Äù and that it would go on sale at 10am UK time on June 10. It also told fans it planned to use a queue system ‚Äúto ensure fair distribution.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this queue system caused chaos, with fans desperate to pre-order the book unable to make progress. Amid frantic messages of complaint across social media, Discords, and subreddits, Warhammer.com suddenly‚Ä¶ stopped. It was offline, and no-one knew why.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anger grew as those who had carved out time to be there for the pre-order launch were left empty handed. Eventually, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WarhammerOfficial/posts/pfbid0NGLkvUafYjdsmFoK6n22Am1hjz3pYwiHczUHdvvT6dXDcF6TPqwzifqyMb2FudFBl?locale=en_GB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Games Workshop issued a statement</a> on the debacle ‚Äî a rare event in itself ‚Äî to say it had brought Warhammer.com offline itself because it had noticed scalpers were bypassing its systems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúScalpers attempted to use bots to bypass our normal safeguards,‚Äù Games Workshop said. ‚ÄúOur eagle-eyed Tech Priests caught this happening in real-time, so we pulled Warhammer.com offline.‚Äù</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/60040181337-blsiegeofterraeraofruin-1749632804963.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Siege of Terra: Era of Ruin hardback remains available. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is that Siege of Terra: End of Ruin is currently unavailable on Warhammer.com, in its place is a page asking for an email for a notification. Games Workshop said the special edition is still coming, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre just absolutely determined that real fans get it.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúAll erroneous orders are being purged,‚Äù Games Workshop continued. ‚ÄúThis is our number one priority. Please forgive us for a delay as we sort it all out.‚Äù</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/gw-1749633025785.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Games Workshop's statement. Image credit: Games Workshop / Facebook.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement has gone some way to calm angry fans who had hoped for a smoother launch of the special edition. Some are calling Games Workshop‚Äôs actions here a ‚Äúsmall victory‚Äù over the scalpers, although there is a healthy dose of skepticism about the company‚Äôs efforts to truly combat the bots. Some are calling on Games Workshop to use a raffle system, as other companies do for their high-profile products, or, even better, force interested customers to pass a Horus Heresy test to prove their worth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, Games Workshop has suffered pre-order problems for years now, and special edition book launches are often plagued by scalpers who go on to sell the products at hugely inflated prices. All eyes are on Games Workshop to see how it handles pre-orders for the Siege of Terra: End of Ruin special edition when they‚Äôre eventually re-launched.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And let‚Äôs remember that Games Workshop is no minnow. In fact, the Nottingham, UK company is doing so well that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-maker-games-workshop-is-doing-so-well-its-giving-27-million-to-its-staff">it‚Äôs handing out ¬£20 million (approx. $27 million) to its staff as a bonus</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop‚Äôs main business is the sale of miniatures fans assemble and paint for use in tabletop wargames, such as Warhammer 40,000. But it is increasingly an IP business, with huge revenue from smash hit video games such as last year‚Äôs <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii"><u>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</u></a>, and animations, such as Amazon‚Äôs Warhammer 40,000 Secret Level episode. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-finalize-deal-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-but-production-may-take-a-number-of-years"><u>Games Workshop and Amazon recently finalized a deal for Henry Cavill's Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe</u></a>, which will involve the creation of films and television series. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-iii"><u>Space Marine 3 is also in development.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Games Workshop.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

It still has the accursed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-how-to-avoid-blue-shells">Blue Shell</a>, of course, which you can <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/yep-it-looks-like-you-can-still-dodge-blue-shells-in-mario-kart-world">thankfully dodge</a> if you know what you're doing.</p>
<p>This weapon has been ruining friendships for years and is one of the many tactics the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-mario-kart-games-of-all-time">Mario Kart series</a> employs to avoid having a single player dominate the race. When used, it dashes to the front of the pack and takes out the lead driver, evening the odds.</p>
<p>However, have you ever wondered what would happen if you throw a Blue Shell when <em>you're</em> in the lead?</p>
<p>Well, wonder no more, as it has been revealed:</p>

<p>This isn't a new feature, as many of you Mario Kart veterans will be aware‚Äîthe Blue Shell can be the cause of amusing 'self-owns' in other entries in the series, as you'll see in the video below.</p>

<p>Still, it's fascinating that I haven't even tried this in all the decades I've been playing Mario Kart games, and I started right at the beginning because I'm an old fart.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's news to you, too? Let us know with a comment.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-nintendo-switch-2-graphics-mods-unlock-framerate-and-increase-graphics-settings-in-select-backward-compatible-titles.1215327/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-graphics-mods-unlock-framerate-and-increase-graphics-settings/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It will be a while until the doors of the Nintendo Switch 2 are open to actual mods and homebrew software, but even so, it's already possible to mod certain backward-compatible titles to run at max graphics settings and increased framerate.</p>
<p>A new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naga</a> showcases Grid Autosport and Alien Isolation running with graphics mods. The first game runs at 60 FPS in Quality Mode at 1080p resolution without dynamic resolution scaling, MSAA x8, Anisotropic Filtering 16x, maxed graphics settings, and a performance overlay that highlights how the Nintendo Switch 2 handles the racing game with maxed out settings. Alien Isolation, on the other hand, runs at 1080p resolution with disabled dynamic resolution scaling and all graphics settings maxed. Unfortunately, the framerate cap couldn't be disabled with the method used by the modder, which involves importing a modded save file where graphics settings have been changed, something that can be done with all games by Feral Interactive, as they all seem to do the same.</p>
<p><iframe title="Graphics Mods on Switch 2 - 60FPS Unlock / Max Quality" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LCVzZTDxdJA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 being so popular, having already become <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/">Nintendo's fastest-selling system to date at launch</a>, it's not surprising to see people already tinkering with the system to discover what can be done outside of what the manufacturer intended. With overclocking and increased RAM, the original system could run <a href="https://wccftech.com/overclocked-nintendo-switch-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-above-60-fps/">demanding games at higher resolutions and more stable framerates</a>, so it will be very interesting to see if something similar can be achieved on the new generation system once modders get full access to it, which is something that will inevitably happen, no matter how much Nintendo will try to prevent it.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now out worldwide, with a few exceptions. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

            <p>Ian Proulx, the CEO of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> developers 1047 Games, has apologised for wearing a 'Make FPS Great Again' cap while talking about the game's battle royale mode on stage at Summer Game Fest. As you might have guessed, the hat drew unfavourable comparisons to US president Donald Trump's MAGA hats.</p>
<p>It'd have been a pretty dumb, controversy-baiting stunt for a games company CEO to pull at any point in recent history, but especially hasn't gone over well given the timing. As the SGF show happened, a large number of anti-ICE protests also began in response to violent immigration raids, and later that weekend Trump <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj93d3r0zz0o">deployed the National Guard onto the streets</a>."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Up until yesterday, Proulx had opted not to apologise for the hat, which he wore while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqhyCGp2uU">taking some shots</a> at the state of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter genre</a> right now, specifically going at the Call of Duty series for repetitive annual releases and wishing for a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> 3. "I‚Äôm not here to apologize but I am here to clarify. This is not a political statement, it is quite literally what it says, so take it at face value," he wrote in a tweet on June 7.</p>
<p>"I don't regret what I said to be candid. I think that I stand by it and my intent is I'm speaking my truth and my intent is to make a great game for everybody," he said of that tweet in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">IGN</a> published yesterday, doubling down on decling to apologise.</p>
<p>Just a few hours prior to that article's publication, however, Proulx u-turned and <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1932502832281694366">posted a video apology</a> Splitgate 2's official Twitter account, admitting that the hat was a publicity stunt.</p>
<p>"It is really freaking hard as an independent studio to break through the noise...at our biggest stage, coming out of beta, we needed something to grab attention, and the honest truth is we tried to think of something, and this is what we came up with," the exec said in the video.</p>
<p>"We did not intend for this to be taken in any political way whatsoever and I‚Äôm not an idiot, obviously I knew there would be some level of controversy," Proulx continued, "But we really saw this as a meme that was kind of stating our truth, which is we do want to improve this genre and we are disappointed with the state of the genre.</p>
<p>"You don't have to believe me, but the truth is I am sorry, and the reason I‚Äôm sorry is because of what this has done to the community...I hate seeing division, and that's what I'm seeing right now on both sides. There‚Äôs division in the community, and for that I am truly sorry."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Towards the end of last month, the co-CEO of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> developer Build a Rocket Boy suggested the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">game's negative reactions up until that point had been paid for in a "concerted effort" against the studio</a>. These bold comments from a studio exec raised a number of eyebrows, to say the least.</p>
<p>Now, the CEO of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>, which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-to-publish-former-rockstar-and-gta-producers-mysterious-blockbuster-mindseye">helming the publishing duties for MindsEye</a>, has shared his thoughts on these claims, stating he does not believe any of those aforementioned negative comments had been paid for.</p>
<p>When asked by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-boss-says-he-doesnt-believe-people-are-being-paid-to-post-negative-comments-about-mindseye">IGN </a>about the discourse surrounding MindsEye's alleged paid-for negative reactions, IO Interactive head Hakan Abrak replied: "I don't believe that. I don't believe that. I just think the game should speak for itself on June the 10th."</p>

<p>While the exec did not elaborate on this specific point further, he did state the MindsEye team - as many developers do - are working on patches for the game.</p>
<p>MindsEye released last night, however it has not been an especially smooth launch for the team. Many social media posts have made the rounds online showing stuttering issues, as well as a number of glitches, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">distorted character faces and unnaturally stretching bodies</a>.</p>
<p>Build A Rocket Boy has said a patch to address performance is in the pipeline, stating its "engineering team are working around the clock"  to implement improvements. We will keep you posted when we know more.</p>

<p>Outstanding. How much bigger Haunted Chocolatier will be than Stardew Valley, what will fill this vast world of hauntings and chocolate, and how players will be able to explore and interact with this world remains a sweet mystery.</p>

<figcaption>Concerned Ape released this early gameplay footage three years ago. Give it a watch and dream of chocolate.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJy7LF789lo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The last major update we got for Haunted Chocolatier is from April this year, when Barone announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-promises-no-more-updates-until-haunted-chocolatier-releases">no more major updates would be coming to Stardew Valley</a>. Indeed, the last year of Barone's life has assumedly been spent sitting at the grindstone, hard at work at their next game while thousands of eager fans peek through the cracks in the walls and floorboards.</p>
<p>These long periods of silence should not be a surprise, with Barone previously stating that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Haunted Chocolatier won't be rushed</a>, and that it was "better to have a good delayed game than a bad game on time". He's right, of course. You can only release Haunted Chocolatier once, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-has-now-sold-over-20-million-copies">given the massive community of Stardew Valley players</a>, it's likely the smart move to make sure everything is made well and with love‚Ä¶ Just like chocolate!</p>
<p>So yeah, while making a joke or two is fun, we wish this ape the best of luck with development. It's ready when it's ready!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's now the third best-selling Street Fighter</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Akuma" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/08ac9e4439953/akuma.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250611.html">has announced</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> has now sold over <strong>5 million units</strong> since its initial release in 2023; a milestone helped considerably by the recent release on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>This makes it the third best-selling Street Fighter game of all time at the time of writing. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/street_fighter_v">Street Fighter V</a> is currently in the lead with a total of <strong>7.8 million sales</strong>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">Street Fighter II</a> for the SNES sits at <strong>6.3 million</strong>.</p>
<p>The company states it "aims to maximize the game‚Äôs userbase" by bringing the game to the Switch 2, and has helped to facilitate this by including cross-play, an initiative that allows players to join online fights across multiple console platforms.</p>
<p>The game hasn't arrived without some controversy, however. Like many third-party releases for the Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/street-fighter-6-somehow-combines-game-key-card-and-code-in-a-box-on-switch-2">Street Fighter 6 is a Game-Key Card</a>, meaning users will need to download the title from the eShop despite owning a cartridge.</p>
<p>The additional content for the Years 1-2 Fighters Edition also isn't included in the download as standard, but rather via a separate code. It's due to expire in two years too, which means that those who buy the 'physical' release at some point in the latter half of 2027 and beyond won't get all of the content advertised.</p>
<p>Capcom has also confirmed that it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/capcom-is-recording-switch-2-game-key-card-purchases-as-digital-sales">considers sales of Game-Key Cards to be digital sales</a>, which honestly makes sense since users are downloading the game from the eShop.</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, Street Fighter 6 is a damn good fighter for the Switch 2. We're not all too keen on the exclusive like gyro controls, but the core gameplay is excellent. We awarded it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">well-deserved score of 9/10</a>.</p>

		<p>As pioneering as the Nintendo Switch was in 2017, its hybrid design enabling a much fuller console experience than most handhelds had managed in the past, and laying the foundations for handheld PCs that have flourished in the last few years, the simple fact of is that its adapted mobile chipset was barely powerful enough for most modern games. This gave rise to a slew of ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù ports to the console, from Doom to The Witcher 3, while even Switch exclusives could end up seriously compromised.</p>
<p>But now here‚Äôs the Switch 2, and just as we‚Äôve seen with Sony and Microsoft‚Äôs consoles since 2016, there‚Äôs so much potential for the Switch 1‚Äôs back catalogue to run better on the new hardware. This comes in a number of forms, with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">paid Switch 2 Editions</a>, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/nintendo-details-12-free-switch-2-game-updates-resolution-frame-rate-hdr-gameshare/">free patches</a>, and then just running basic Switch 1 game code on a more powerful system.</p>
<p><iframe title="How Switch 2 Backward Compatibility fixes a lot of bad Switch frame rates" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ds3mP6OMM9w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It‚Äôs this final category that I find particularly interesting and the focus for today. Despite both systems having ARM CPU cores and an Nvidia GPU, there‚Äôs enough difference in the hardware such that the Switch 2 doesn‚Äôt run Switch 1 games natively. It‚Äôs not emulation either, but is instead running Switch 1 games through a translation layer that remaps CPU and GPU calls to the new architecture. It‚Äôs the same methodology that allows Windows games to run in Linux via Proton on the Steam Deck. Just as there, Nintendo had to test thousands upon thousands of games <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played/">to find any compatibility errors</a>, then trying to fix those, either with patches or under-the-hood improvements for the Switch 2‚Äôs translation layer.</p>
<p>However it‚Äôs come to pass, the improvements can straighten out some really wonky games. The focus of our comparisons is on the docked modes of these games ‚Äì something that‚Äôs more viable to capture and compare, so let‚Äôs start with a real problem child on the Switch 1.</p>

<p>We‚Äôve loaded up the demo for <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/18/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review/">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a></strong>, a game that had some pretty obvious problems on Switch 1, barely holding onto 30fps and often going down to the low 20s ‚Äì and that‚Äôs before considering split-screen. On Switch 2? Well, it‚Äôs a practical 30fps lock, which just makes the game feel so much better and consistent, allowing the Breath of the Wild art style to really shine.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll jump on over, now, to the <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/21/fire-emblem-warriors-three-hopes-review-switch-musou/">Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes</a></strong> demo, which came a couple years later and shows improved optimisation and balance on the Switch 1. In fact, this game came with an unlocked frame rate that very rarely dipped below 30fps. Though‚Ä¶ since it‚Äôs in the mid-30s most of the time, it really should have had a 30fps cap at the time.</p>
<p>But in 2025, we‚Äôre glad they chose not to, because this makes it a fantastic showcase for the Switch 2‚Äôs inherent power bump. Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes is a near perfect 60fps on Switch 2!</p>

<p>A similar example is <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/11/dragon-quest-builders-2-review/">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a></strong>. This game could be really, really punishing on original Switch, especially with more complex custom creations shared online from more powerful platforms. Performance was generally acceptable through the campaign though, the open world gameplay being north of 30fps, but maybe in the low 20s for busy towns, flying around and when lots of NPCs are on screen.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this also comes with an unlocked frame rate, and performance is not far off a straight doubling for Switch 2. In sparse scenes you can get 60fps, though those busier areas and if you‚Äôre flying rapidly across the world do pull the Switch 2 down to the mid-low 50s.</p>

<p>Those have all been 30fps target games, but what about an unsteady 60?</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/14/bayonetta-bayonetta-2-have-found-a-new-home-on-nintendo-switch/">Bayonetta 2</a></strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/14/bayonetta-bayonetta-2-have-found-a-new-home-on-nintendo-switch/"> was already pretty solid on Switch 1</a>, as a port across from the Wii U. There can be minor dips within the arena combat, and let‚Äôs just say that with rare exceptions, Switch 2 evens those minor kinks out quite nicely. It wasn‚Äôt quite as smooth in handheld though, and some areas could exhibit noticeable frame rate drops, which have seemingly been ironed out by Switch 2‚Äôs increased handheld power as well.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/25/bayonetta-3-review/">Bayonetta 3</a></strong> was much more ambitious with the Switch 1 as its base platform and, surprise, surprise, it‚Äôs nowhere near to PlatinumGames‚Äô usual 60fps target a lot of the time. We‚Äôre taking regularly dropping to the low 50s, high 40s, and the most sensational action going all the way down to the 30s ‚Äì cutscenes were once again rendered at 30fps.</p>
<p>But guess what? Switch 2 brings 60fps through and through, outside of those most cinematic moments where PlatinumGames input a 30fps frame cap.</p>
<p>Another problem child from the first party line up was <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-2-review/">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a></strong>. The worst of the issues in this game emerged when playing handheld where the chip stepped down to lower power modes, the dynamic resolution and upscaling getting <em>seriously</em> blurry, but there are also issues when docked, such as some severe pop-in when loading to a new area and performance that could degrade to below 30fps. Thankfully later games and ports made different technical choices to get better image quality and performance, but Xenoblade 2 has been stuck like this on Switch 1.</p>

<p>Playing on Switch 2 comes with a big improvement thanks to an improved frame rate, a better base resolution that‚Äôs noticeable both in handheld and docked, and faster loading of assets.</p>
<p>But the Switch 2 can‚Äôt fix or improve everything. If a game was already pretty well attuned to a 30fps cap, then the only improvements can come from better dynamic resolution scaling.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/06/28/wolfenstein-ii-nintendo-switch-review/">Wolfenstein 2</a>,</strong> for example, is a game that‚Äôs designed to target 60fps on PS4 and Xbox One, but was limited to 30fps on Switch and, as Panic Button‚Äôs second effort with idtech after Doom, it did a pretty good job of sticking to it. This was achieved by much more than just reducing resolution, the texture detail also being significantly reduced, combining to give gives the game a lot of almost putty-like blurriness. Add in hefty motion blur, which is much more of a smear when at 30fps than 60fps, and it makes playing this game feel compromised, regardless of Switch 1 or 2.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 does boost the dynamic resolutions to help quite significantly with blurriness, but the loss of top end detail and being limited to 30fps just doesn‚Äôt feel as good as you‚Äôd want from this series.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a shade ironic that the most tuned and optimised game for Switch can‚Äôt benefit as much from this kind of improvement on Switch 2, while those less optimised titles come good.</p>
<p>In general, this straight backward compatibility offers a fantastic showcase of how the Switch 2 can apply its raw power to last generation games and deliver some tangible improvements. A game with an uneven frame rate can be smoothed out, something with a low dynamic resolution can be improved, and a lot of the most troubled games on Switch 1 will give a better experience on Switch 2.</p>
<p>However, all of the games here would benefit from a Switch 2 patch or a paid Switch 2 Edition release. It would be fantastic to get Age of Calamity running at 60fps, to have Bayonetta 2 and 3 at 1080p in handheld, and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and the rest of the series to remastered for higher resolutions. I know a lot of PlatinumGames fans are also pining for an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/26/astral-chain-review/">Astral Chain</a> patch to lift the 30fps lock, to unchain one of the studio‚Äôs Switch highlights.</p>
<p>We have seen these kinds of patches in other games, and the results there can be pretty fantastic as well, but that‚Äôs for another article‚Ä¶</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 / Xbox Series S" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0d9e139a3bed6/switch-2-xbox-series-s.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>They say that comparison is the thief of Joy-Con ‚Äî or something along those lines ‚Äî but ever since Switch 2's reveal, people have been clamouring to work out how Nintendo's latest matches up against the other consoles on the market. Before launch, the tech experts over at Digital Foundry suggested the console was roughly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZZAr1c0Wqg">in line with Sony's PS4</a>, but Koei Tecmo has recently estimated that it might be even beefier.</p>
<p>That is according to producer Takuto Edagawa, who, in a recent interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/wild-hearts-s-qa-switch-2-is-closer-to-the-series-s-than-ps4/">wccftech</a> about the upcoming Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wild-hearts-s">Wild Hearts S</a>, estimated that Switch 2 might be closer to the Xbox Series S in terms of "raw computing power" than Sony's last-gen system.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of characteristics when it comes to raw computing power, so it's difficult to generalise," Edagawa told the outlet, "but I think it can be thought [of] as closer to the Series S".</p>
<p>We suspected that Switch 2 would never be able to stand toe-to-toe with the likes of the PS5 and Series X, but hearing that developers understand it to be roughly in line with the Series S proves that there has been a pretty substantial upgrade under the hood ‚Äî as if the promise of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> wasn't proof enough.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the wccftech interview, Edagawa revealed that the team has not used NVIDIA's DLSS Super Resolution for the Switch 2 version of Wild Hearts S, though they <em>did</em> implement HD Rumble 2 to achieve "more nuanced vibration without additional costs for adjustments".</p>
<p>Wild Hearts S arrives on Switch 2 on <strong>25th July</strong>, bringing the Monster Hunter-style adventure to the Nintendo hybrid with more beasts and modes, GameChat implementation, and a new four-player multiplayer option.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has confirmed a record-setting launch for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> with over 3.5 million units sold worldwide in the first four days on the market.</p>
<p>This is not only the highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware in the first four days ‚Äì the original Switch only reached 2.74 million units through its entire launch month of March 2017 ‚Äì but also seems to dramatically out-pace Sony and Microsoft‚Äôs best efforts.</p>


<p>We don‚Äôt have an apples-to-apples comparison, but the PlayStation 4 sold 2.1 million within its first two weeks. Sony didn‚Äôt provide specifics, noting that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-11-25-ps5-is-biggest-console-launch-in-history">the PlayStation 5 surpassed that</a>, but the PS5 then largely kept pace with the previous generation through the first quarter to ship 4.5 million through the end of 2020 (its first 7 weeks on sale).</p>
<p>So, let‚Äôs just say that the Switch 2 is the fastest selling console launch.</p>
<p>This record comes with the caveat that the PS5 launched in the middle of a silicon shortage and Sony struggled to maintain supply for the following year. We don‚Äôt know what Sony would have managed to sell if they could fully meet demand at the launch of either PS4 or PS5. Of course, you can only beat the competition that‚Äôs in before you, and Nintendo has done exactly that by ensuring that there is all of this Switch 2 supply ready to go for launch.</p>

<p>It also comes despite all of the criticisms over pricing for the Switch 2 and its tentpole launch title, Mario Kart World. The Switch 2 is more expensive than the original console, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> set a new $80 price point that many fear will become another new standard price point for major game releases. Nintendo has softened the blow somewhat by offering a cheaper game bundle with Mario Kart World included, and that has almost certainly been the preferred SKU.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also fair to say that major tech products will sell out no matter what. We‚Äôll have to see if the Nintendo Switch 2 can keep up the pace and continue to sell better than the original Switch and PlayStation‚Äôs best through the coming months and years.</p>

            <p>Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> is the company's fastest-selling hardware ever, having sold 3.5m units worldwide in its first four days on sale.</p>
<p>This data has been provided by Nintendo itself, following the console's launch last Thursday.</p>
<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 represents the next evolution of Nintendo Switch, and we're very happy and grateful to see it already being embraced by so many players across Europe," said Luciano Pere√±a, CEO and president of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-europe">Nintendo of Europe</a>. "We look forward to seeing players connecting through games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, sharing the experience with friends and family whether near or far."</p>

<p>For comparison, Sony sold 4.5m PS5 units globally in its first quarter back in 2020, so Switch 2 has just a million less but in four days. Microsoft has not shared launch numbers of its Xbox Series X/S console.</p>
<p>Yesterday it was<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-reportedly-nintendos-biggest-uk-launch-but-sits-behind-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs"> reported the console was Nintendo's biggest launch in the UK</a> with the Switch 2 outselling the original Switch by over two to one. However, it's behind the equivalent launches of Sony's PS5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>Nintendo has forecast it will sell 15m units from release until the end of the financial year, meaning it's just under a quarter of the way there in four days.</p>
<p>News of these initial sales comes despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">criticism of the console's high cost</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">price of its games and accessories</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of its launch in Japan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-switch-2-demand-far-exceeds-expectations-in-japan-as-company-president-offers-stark-warning-over-stock">Nintendo warned demand for the console "far exceeds expectations"</a> and warned of stock shortages.</p>

The company stated it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-considering-switch-2-post-launch-price-rise-if-tariff-situation-worsens">considering a post-launch price rise if the situation worsens</a>.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, then, Nintendo is still celebrating a huge launch of its latest console. Have you got yourself a Switch 2? What do you think so far?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> has soared past 142,000 concurrent players on Steam following its full public release.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/">According to SteamDB</a>, the game quickly surpassed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-nears-100k-concurrent-players-day-one">peak established during the five day head start</a> for those who bought the Deluxe or Ultimate edition. Within an hour of the full launch, it blew past 113,000 players.</p>

So what can we infer from seeing Dune Awakening pull this off? Well, a growth of roughly 40 percent in peak players (on a Tuesday no less) indicates a sizable number of players were waiting in the wings for the cheaper version of the game. It's still possible that the game could hit another peak too this weekend, following the trend established by the early launch.

</p><p>It'll be interesting to see to what degree the end game Landsraad and deep desert map can retain players, especially those who may have grabbed it for a romp with friends or a more single player, solitary experience. When you get to the end game, Dune Awakening does a baton pass from a survival game core to more of an MMO server-wide PvP and politics experience. How many of these initial players stick around for this bit, remains a big question.</p>
<p>To celebrate the full launch yesterday, it looks as though the Funcom team were enjoying mini cupcakes at the office, <a href="https://x.com/Tascharoe/status/1932439203641717162">as shown off on social media by one Tascha R√∂√∂sli on Twitter</a>. Launching a video game, especially a big online one like Dune Awakening, is a big task. Why not celebrate a little?</p>
<p>Dune Awakening had previously proved so popular <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-surpasses-elden-ring-nightreign-on-steams-top-sellers">as to dethrone Elden RIng Nightreign from its perch atop of the Steam top sellers page</a> just before its initial release on the 5th June.</p>
<p>If you're looking to jump into the game, why not read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-now-playing">Eurogamer's Dune Awakening preview</a> - it's "the perfect blend of survival, MMORPG, and house envy". </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>One minute you‚Äôre flicking through Steam‚Äôs Next Fest demos, and finding one that looks to be included despite having <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3068230/view/498320947205375622?l=english">come out in May</a>. The next, you‚Äôre desperately firing missiles into the rear end of giant monster truck, a sole red light glaring out from its metallic behind, as though it‚Äôs mega-pissed that it seems to have gotten stuck in a cluster of trees. Given that, it should be easy prey for the ordnance strapped to the bonnet of my very <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mad-max">Mad Max</a>-ish muscle car coated in enough sheets of metal to fence off several allotments.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3068230/Mad_Metal/">Mad Metal</a>, though, an indie game whose murderous enemy cars have minds of their own and move more like automotive animals than simple machines.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The car combat was the thing that drew me to try the demo of solo developer Hakim Elayday‚Äôs work-in-progress metal twister, which fittingly looks to have grown from<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/1gxca8h/made_a_vehicle_combat_game_because_i_was_sad/"> its creator‚Äôs sadness</a> at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-cancels-twisted-metal-live-service-game-as-part-of-mass-layoffs">last year‚Äôs reports</a> Sony had canceled an unannounced live-service Twisted Metal game.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm a simple man, I see the opportunity to slam the pedal to the metal and fire a machine gun while doing some skids, and I take it. As you can imagine, then I was in my element when pretty much right out of the gate, Mad Metal tasked me with chasing down and stopping a train covered in rusty spikes.</p>
<p>Yelling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF3GK_sfPVM">the line</a> from GTA San Andreas as I went, I splattered the engine pulling it with lead until it looked like a chrome colander, and was rewarded with some new car parts. This is the general loop of Mad Metal from what I‚Äôve played of it so far. You drive around an Unreal Engine map that‚Äôs mostly hills littered with light shrubbery and patches of woodland, running into groups of two or three hostile vehicles from various gangs at a time.</p>

<p>Then, the great driving dance of death begins. You and your foes that in some instances seem to lurch around more like hostile creatures than cars orbit each other, firing your ordnance and occasionally smashing together, until one of you explodes. It‚Äôs an absolute blast most of the time, with the loveable jankiness with which it all happens just adding to the blast you can have with it.</p>
<p>There was one point when I was fighting two ‚ÄúMonster Driller ATVs‚Äù - bright yellow armoured 4x4s with three spinning drill bits menacingly protruding from their bumpers - and ended up wearing one as a hat. Its raised suspension meant that my slam into it had wedged me underneath, so I merrily drove around for a bit with my camera clipped into the invisible void of a nonexistent interior, watching as its circular teeth continued to spin away despite their host being out for the count.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a slow time button, which really helps you appreciate fun little touches like the game‚Äôs bushes hastily flattening like frightened possums in response to you launching a flurry of bullets at a camper van. There‚Äôs also a giant metal eye right out of something like 2001: A Space Odyssey or Portal hovering over you the whole time, providing guidance and dropping memey computer sass like ‚Äúhe needs some milk‚Äù when you get exploded.</p>
<p>Overall, at this point Mad Metal‚Äôs a bit of a car crash, in both good ways and bad. The core of it‚Äôs pretty fun, even if getting a kick out of the more ridiculous jank has definitely played a role in that for me. It‚Äôs not got a release date right now, but the demo‚Äôs definitely something.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It rose to number one on Steam‚Äôs Global Top Sellers List (by sales revenue) just 40 minutes after release, with CEO CH Kim said at the time that Krafton planned to ‚Äúfoster" the game as a "long-term franchise IP."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, inZoi's Steam concurrent player count has dwindled since launch, with a 24-hour peak of 1,477. As <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/more-players-playing-16-year-old-sims-3-than-inzoi/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheGamer</a> reported this week, inZoi‚Äôs peak concurrent player count even dropped below the 16-year-old The Sims 3 on Valve‚Äôs platform.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN asked Krafton for comment on the situation, and it responded to dismiss Steam peak concurrent player figures as a barometer of the game‚Äôs success because it is a single-player game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"inZOI continues to steadily generate sales, and as a single-player game, it would be most appropriate to refer to the additional sales count at each major update point as opposed to concurrent player count on Steam in measuring the game's performance,‚Äù Krafton said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The focus on Steam concurrent player numbers has become a hot topic within the industry in recent years, with a number of developers and publishers insisting they don‚Äôt tell the whole story of a game‚Äôs performance, particularly for single-player games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2024, John ‚ÄúBucky‚Äù Buckley, community chief at Palworld developer Pocketpair, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-addresses-dead-game-debate-who-cares-if-theres-only-five-people-playing">said</a> our obsession with the concept of the ‚Äúdead game‚Äù and player counts was unhealthy for the video game industry and gamers. And in April this year, Alex Bolle, production director on Helldivers 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-wants-helldivers-2-to-be-around-for-years-and-years-and-years-to-come-and-what-about-a-warhammer-40000-collab">told IGN</a> that Steam concurrents are ‚Äúa metric among many others.‚Äù</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">inZOI's Best and Most Cursed Creations</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for inZoi, Steam user reviews, which do have a significant impact on a game‚Äôs visibility on Valve‚Äôs platform, remain ‚Äòmostly positive‚Äô for all reviews, but are on ‚Äòmixed‚Äô for recent reviews. As an Early Access game, it has yet to fully release, a point Krafton made in its statement to IGN:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúThat said, Early Access is only the beginning of inZOI's journey, and in many ways our work is just starting. During this phase, the team's top priority is gathering player feedback and continuing the development of the game with more enhanced features, improved performance, and an overall immersive and engaging experience. We're thankful for our dedicated inZOI community and look forward to sharing new content updates over the coming months."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Krafton announced inZOI is coming to the Mac App Store and Steam in August. The Mac version of inZOI is optimized for the latest macOS on Apple Silicon, Krafton said, and takes ‚Äúfull advantage‚Äù of Apple‚Äôs MetalFX and Core ML ‚Äúto deliver the same great gameplay experience as on Windows.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
