            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-sales-data-july-circana<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sales analysis firm Circana has released its US gaming industry sales data for July, and it looks like EA was right to revive its college football franchise (no pun intended).</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1826246890876535220" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the ever-reliable Mat Piscatella on X (formerly Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>was July's best-selling premium game across both PC and Xbox Series X|S. It's also technically grabbed the number two spot;&nbsp;<em>EA Sports MVP Bundle</em>, which is in second place, contains both that game and&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL 25</em>.</p>
<p>In third place, it's&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, no doubt still buoyed by the release of June's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales">really rather successful&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC</a>. Still, no matter how well that DLC sold, it couldn't stop&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>from claiming the win.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-us-sales-data-july-2024.jpg?itok=_j9mLlpw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-us-sales-data-july-2024.jpg?itok=N1bnSu6x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>couldn't quite pip&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>to the post for July.</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, Piscatella's thread notes that&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>has already topped the year-to-date best-seller list, dislodging&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>from the top spot. Not bad at all, considering Circana's data cuts off on August 3rd, meaning&nbsp;EA's game had only been out for around two weeks at that point.</p>
<p>Rounding out the top five are&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/minecraft"><em>Minecraft</em></a>, both of which are pretty reliable sellers across the board. No surprises there.</p>
<p>As you'd imagine,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>also tops both the PlayStation and Xbox premium charts. The game isn't available on Switch, so the number one spot for Nintendo's console was claimed by&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</a>&nbsp;</em>instead.</p>
<p>In terms of player engagement (i.e. monthly active users),&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>topped the PlayStation chart, while&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>dominated Xbox and&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>reigned supreme on Steam.</p>

            <p>Our James recently stormed off to Cologne after having<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-marine-2s-co-op-suggests-it-is-in-fact-jetpacks-that-make-the-dream-work"> one too many kills stolen by Edwin</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-marine-2-shows-off-10-minutes-of-stomping-chainswording-and-a-chaos-tease-for-the-warhammer-40k-sequel-in-extended-gameplay">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>. “I’m never even going to look at another videogame again!”, he declared. Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.</p>
<p>Tips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-2016">Doom 2016</a>,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”</p>

<p>Back in April, Saber Interactive CEO Matthew Karch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/70-titles-are-doomed-to-go-the-way-of-the-dodo-says-saber-interactive-ceo">said that he felt the $70 game</a> was “going to go the way of the dodo. I think the market is going to shift to development which is not necessarily lower quality, but there's going to be an emphasis on trying to find ways to reduce costs.” Whether this means we should expect a bigger focus on monetisation in Saber’s games in the future, Willits is adamant that Space Marine 2 won’t make you feel “like you're getting poked."</p>
<p>“There are shifts and trends in the industry,” he said when asked about the game’s approach to microtransactions. “People don’t want to be sold horse armour anymore. I can say that because I worked at Bethesda. Our fans never thought we ripped them off in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-war-z">World War Z</a>. Focus are great. They kind of let us do what we want.” Space Marine 2’s additional purchases and updates will follow a similar model to World War Z, he says. “You buy a weapon pack. You buy a character pack.”</p>
<p>The actual tangibles here are a little bit muddied at the moment by one of those spreadsheet-requiring slew of editions you all know and love. Ok, deep breath. Currently available on Steam are the following editions of Space Marine 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>A “standard edition” for £55/€60/$60 (with the ‘Macragge’s Chosen’ DLC if you preorder)</li>
<li>A “gold edition” for £80/€90/$90 (Maccy Cheese DLC, 4 day early unlock, season pass)</li>
<li>An “ultra edition for £90/€100/$100 (All that, plus the “Ultramarines Champions Pack”</li>
</ul>
<p>Another deep breath. The Maccy Cheese DLC is some cosmetics. The “Ultramarines Champions Pack” is some more cosmetics. The season pass is “receive armour, weapon and Champion cosmetics from your favourite Space Marine chapters through four phases”</p>
<p>Additionally, Focus brand manager Sylvain Le Roux <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2/no-microtransactions">recently told PCGamesN</a> that “everything you’ll get [in the passes] is purely cosmetic. All of the gameplay additions, whether it’s new missions or new enemies, all of that will come for free to all players.”</p>
<p>So, not too bad at all then. I mean, expensive, yes. And I won’t even start on the early unlock. But there’s no gameplay being held hostage - it’s just a case of letting players decide whether the extra cosmetics are worth the investment. I am sympathetic to the argument that cosmetics are “gameplay” in a sense, but this sits ok with me. Let me know if there’s something I’m missing here, though.</p>
<p>We’ll have more Gamescom goodness soon enough, providing James doesn’t pass out from dehydration before he returns. Apparently it’s impossible to find water that isn’t sparkling out there. I quite like sparkling water, but then again, I also quite liked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crackdown-3">Crackdown 3</a>. Spice Maureen 2 is out September 9th, and it’s anyone’s guess who will emerge victorious when the inevitable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-pvp-multiplayer-video-certainly-has-that-old-timey-gears-of-war-energy">PVP blood match</a> between James and Edwin commences.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/21/xbox-series-x-s-new-console-options-pre-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, Xbox announced three new Xbox Series X console options will launch on October 15, 2024, including a 2TB Galaxy Black special edition.</p>



<p>The other two Xbox console additions include an all-digital Xbox Series X in “Robot White” with 1TB SSD, and a corresponding digital 1TB Xbox Series S in Robot White.</p>



<p>Today’s blog says that these options will also launch on October 29 in select countries after its initial release. It adds that fans can already pre-order the new console options today, though pre-orders in Mexico are “coming soon.”</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Beginning later today, players will be able to pre-order the Xbox Series S – 1TB in Robot White, Xbox Series X – 1TB Digital Edition in Robot White, and Xbox Series X – 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition: <a href="https://t.co/n23huaNBud">https://t.co/n23huaNBud</a></p>— Xbox Wire (@XboxWire) <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxWire/status/1826242853523128386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Fans also have a look at pricing for the new Xbox Series X|S consoles coming in October. </p>



<p>According to the new product page for the Galaxy Black Special Edition, it will come with a $599.99 price tag. The all-digital Xbox Series X in Robot White will cost $449.99, while the new Series S in Robot White is going for $349.99.</p>



<p>Today’s announcement coincided with Xbox’s new Gamescom 2024 livestream, where Xbox is also showcasing a variety of upcoming titles.</p>



<p>In February 2024, Microsoft also teased a “unique” and powerful <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-next-gen-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next-gen Xbox console</a> is in the works. </p>



<p>Last May, a new claim surfaced suggesting that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-claim-suggests-next-xbox-console-will-launch-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next major Xbox console</a> will launch in late 2026. The dataminer claimed that its release could potentially coincide with the release of that year’s Call of Duty as a launch title.</p>

<p>EA Sports College Football 25 was the best-selling game for July 2024, according to the the latest data <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1826246890876535220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from Circana</a>. </p>



<p>The first college football game in 11 years was met with fanfare when it released for Deluxe Edition owners on July 15. In it’s first week alone, the game had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-had-over-5-million-players-in-its-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 5 million players</a>.  </p>



<p>“There was a feeling that we had something special based on the trailer views and interactions online, but the way it’s transitioned to actual sales and players has me lost for words,” Insider Gaming was told by a source <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-response-to-college-football-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around the game’s launch</a>.</p>



<p>It gets better for EA Sports and College Football 25, though. The MVP Bundle that included both College Football 25 and Madden 25 was the second-best-selling title for July, meaning College Football held the top two spots for the month. </p>



<p>As far as the year goes, College Football 25 is also the top-selling game for 2024 as a whole. Up until now, Helldivers 2 had held that spot. The MVP Bundle also is a top seller for the year, coming in at number  5.</p>

                <p>One of the more interesting reveals from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5715/" data-ref-id="2900-5715">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> this week was a trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deadpool-director-making-a-video-game-tv-series-and-its-not-what-you-think/1100-6525800/">Secret Level</a>, an upcoming anthology series built around several famous video games. Armored Core will be one of the games in the spotlight, and for a brief moment in the reveal trailer, it looks like that episode might star everyone's favorite assassin and motorcycle enthusiast, Keanu Reeves. In a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, you can spot a CG version of someone who looks <em>a lot </em>like Reeves in the trailer, something that the official Armored Core X/Twitter account highlighted.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/armoredcore/status/1825978617781723177" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">A new ARMORED CORE saga awaits. Just one of fifteen epic stories from Secret Level, the new revolutionary gaming anthology series coming December 10 on Prime Video. <a href="https://t.co/SHm80ZWqwC" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/SHm80ZWqwC</a></p>  — ARMORED CORE (@armoredcore) <a href="https://twitter.com/armoredcore/status/1825978617781723177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>We're not certain if he's back--in another video game-related project--as Reeves hasn't officially confirmed if he's involved with Secret Level, and the character in the trailer could be someone else who happens to have a passing resemblance to the actor. You'd also imagine that there'd be a bit more noise being made over landing The Matrix and John Wick star to appear in one of Secret Level's episodes, but for now, details on the series are locked up tighter than a pencil supply store when John Wick's in town.</p><p>Reeves has been fairly busy over the last couple of years, as between his feature film roles and cameos in SpongeBob Squarepants movies, he also provided the voice and likeness for Johnny Silverhand in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/" data-ref-id="5000-143160">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and its expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/" data-ref-id="1900-6418116">Phantom Liberty</a>. You'll hear him again in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-adds-keanu-reeves-as-voice-of-shadow/1100-6522667/" data-ref-id="1100-6522667">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> as he's voicing the ultimate lifeform in that movie, Shadow the Hedgehog. Meanwhile, you won't have too long to wait for Secret Level, as the series will land on Prime Video on December 10.</p><p>Developed by Deadpool director Tim Miller and his Blur studio, the show will feature a number of major game franchises like Mega Man, Sifu, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p>

<p>"We run a business. It's definitely true inside of Microsoft that the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. We get a level of support [from Microsoft] that is just amazing in what we're able to go do," Spencer said.</p><p>In terms of that support, Microsoft bankrolled the $75.4 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard--this was Microsoft's largest acquisition by purchase price--by far--in the company's history. </p><p>With that thinking in mind, Spencer said bringing Xbox games to competing platforms is "going to be a strategy that works for us" to achieve that. Spencer also said Xbox games coming to competing systems like PlayStation and Switch is an extension of the changing video game business landscape.</p><p>"As an industry right now, there is a lot of pressure on the industry. It's been growing for a long time, and now people are looking for ways to grow [more]... and for us, as fans and players of games, we just have to anticipate that there is going to be more change in how some of the traditional way that games were are built and distributed," the executive said. "That's going to change. That's going to change for all of us. But the end result has to be better games that more people can play. If we're not focused on that, I think we're focused on the wrong things."</p><p>Microsoft has so far released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-plans-to-launch-these-four-games-on-rival-platforms/1100-6521266/" data-ref-id="1100-6521266">handful of its Xbox games on rival platforms</a>, including Sea of Thieves, Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, and Grounded. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will come next in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-town-name-change<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix will change the name of a town that's become rather unfortunate thanks to current events in the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</em>, it has emerged.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1825925882525151647" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on the Square Enix X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, the town of Isis will have its name changed to Ibis in the remake. I'd imagine the reasons for this are fairly obvious, but just in case they're not, it's likely to avoid any accidental reference to the <a href="https://www.dni.gov/nctc/ftos/isis_fto.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">terrorist group of the same name</a>.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-renames-town-called-isis-in-original-1988-game/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this Automaton Media report notes</a>, the town of Isis is heavily inspired by Ancient Egypt in the original&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3</em>, and Isis is a major Egyptian goddess; she's probably one of the better-known deities in the Egyptian pantheon, alongside the likes of Osiris and Anubis.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-3-remake-isis-town-change.jpg?itok=64cwzDC5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-3-remake-isis-town-change.jpg?itok=LPSPDjqd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest 3</em>'s Egyptian-inspired town will no longer be called Isis.</figcaption></figure><p>Automaton goes on to show its Ancient Egyptian mythology prowess by pointing out that the town's new name, Ibis, also links back not only to the mythology itself but also to the goddess Isis.</p>
<p>The ibis is an Egyptian bird that was "believed to be a manifestation" of the moon god Toth, and Toth helped none other than Isis when she was pregnant with Osiris' heir Horus in Egyptian mythology. Neat, huh?</p>
<p>Of course, the alteration is also a practical one, and the fact that just one single letter is different means that even if you did play the original&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3</em>, the change shouldn't feel too jarring for you.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</em>, it is, believe it or not, a remake of the original 1988 JRPG, which is the third game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>series. Shocking, eh?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-throne-room.jpg?itok=M2_S1UVu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-throne-room.jpg?itok=Q2RAaneN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>will overhaul the original with new visuals and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only will the game feature Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trademark-for-octopath-travelers-hd-2d-filed-by-square-enix">signature HD-2D art style</a>, also seen in games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/triangle-strategy"><em>Triangle Strategy</em></a>, but it'll also feature an improved UI, new animations, and quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701660/DRAGON_QUEST_III_HD2D_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010018" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/9n80pq2dsbp1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch on November 14th.

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z32r8ECNNiA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer</a> released today, Forza Horizon 5 fans got a look at gameplay for the upcoming Hide &amp; Seek mode launching on September 10, 2024. </p>



<p>The announcement kicked off Xbox’s new Gamescom 2024 livestream. Today’s trailer confirms Hide &amp; Seek is a 5v1 game mode where one “Hider” must race to the finish line while five “Seekers” pursue them.</p>



<p>The Hide &amp; Seek mode will be available as a free update for online multiplayer gameplay. It features a ticking clock for Hiders to reach the finish line, as well as gauges for detection and progress. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Hide and Seek - Gamescom Reveal Trailer | Forza Horizon 5" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z32r8ECNNiA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The gauge features allow the Hider to play strategically, hiding “in plain sight” rather than simply trying to outrun opponents.</p>



<p>The new trailer also showcases in-game 4K footage of all the new mechanics. It reveals that the End Zone takes time to become active, and that there are Hider pings so that Seekers can plan and coordinate their efforts too.</p>



<p>Developer Playground Games recently announced that Forza Horizon 4 would be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-4-being-delisted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delisted due to licensing issues</a>. It will go offline in December 2024, and as a result, Forza Horizon 4 beat a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-4-beats-all-time-player-peak-post-delisting-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new all-time player peak record</a> just a day later.</p>

But one short flew under the radar — and it looks like it stars one of the most popular actors on earth.</p><p>The glimpse and you’ll miss it look at the Armored Core animation that’s a part of the Secret Level anthology series includes a snapshot of a character that looks a lot like The Matrix and John Wick star Keanu Reeves. Check it out:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/gvct3zywyaaj9v0-1724242265526.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>If that’s not Keanu Reeves, then I expect his agent will be on the phone to Amazon first thing in the morning demanding a royalty payment. Surely this is in fact Keanu Reeves — the face is instantly recognisable.</p><p>Reeves, of course, is no stranger to the world of video games. Most recently he starred in CD Projekt’s 2020 action RPG Cyberpunk 2077 as Johnny Silverhand. Now, in a surprise move, he’s turned his attention to FromSoftware’s Armored Core, which, while a popular series, is not considered one of the bigger video game franchises around. But then, there are other surprising entries on the Secret Level anthology list. No-one was expecting an animation for Unreal Tournament, for example, or Spelunky, but here we are.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Secret Level will have 15 episodes based on various video games. Here’s the list:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>PlayStation Studios</li><li>Sifu</li><li>Warhammer 40,000</li><li>Unreal Tournament</li><li>New World: Aeternum</li><li>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</li><li>The Outer Worlds 2</li><li>Pac-Man</li><li>Honor of Kings</li><li>Armored Core</li><li>Mega Man</li><li>Exodus</li><li>Spelunky</li><li>Crossfire</li><li>Concord</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Secret Level gamescom ONL 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>A word on the Warhammer 40,000 animation: Games Workshop has confirmed it’s “inspired” by the upcoming video game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a>, which is due out in September. It stars “Titus and the boys” in animated action, which is certainly something for Warhammer 40,000 fans to get excited about.</p><p>The 15-episode Secret Level series premieres December 10.

The LEGO Group has announced six sets will be released on January 1 featuring characters such as Baby Mario and Baby Luigi, Donkey Kong, and Toad.</p><p>While regular Super Mario LEGO has been available for a few years, this will be the first time the beloved kart racing franchise has enjoyed the same treatment. The six sets range in price from $14.99 to $79.99.</p><p>The sets are compatible with the main line of Mario LEGO too, as putting the Mario, Luigi, or Peach from those sets into each kart will prompt new sound and visual effects to emulate a race starting, horn honking, kart drifting, glider gliding, coin collecting, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>LEGO Super Mario: Mario Kart</h3></div></output><p>"With vibrant characters, customisable karts, and unique track items that will pave the way for endless play, these sets will get fans’ creative engines revving as they can turn unexpected surfaces into the ultimate Mario Kart track," LEGO said.</p><p>The cheapest option is the Yoshi Bike at $14.99, a 133 piece set featuring a little blue Yoshi riding a little green Yoshi Bike, one of the vehicles available in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Next up is the Standard Kart at $19.99 and 174 pieces, which comes with a Toad mechanic figure but not a main driver, and is therefore likely meant for the Mario figure from the mainline Super Mario LEGO sets.</p><p>Donkey Kong and DK Jumbo is $34.99 and comes with 387 pieces, Baby Mario versus Baby Luigi is $29.99 and comes with 390 pieces, and Toad's Garage is $39.99 and comes with 390 pieces.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The biggest set is twice that price, coming in at $79.99 with 823 pieces. Baby Peach &amp; Grand Prix is therefore the centre piece of the Mario Kart range, and comes with the start line and track markers alongside three racers: Baby Peach, Lemmy, and Toad.</p><p>Mario Kart sets were teased earlier in 2024 but have only been full revealed now. They're otherwise not particularly surprising, as LEGO and Nintendo are far from strangers with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-lego-nintendo-sets">several collaborations preceding these</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-nintendo-entertainment-system-nes-officially-revealed">A brick-based version of the Nintendo Entertainment System console was one of the larger sets</a>, while the Super Mario line has included myriad different products such as<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-luigi-starter-set-adds-co-op-to-lego-mario"> the Luigi Starter Set</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-lego-super-mario-dry-bowsers-castle-revealed">Dry Bowser's Castle</a>, and even a massive <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bowser-lego-set-mario">2,807 piece Bowser set</a> that connects to the others. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-super-mario-64-playset-revealed">A Super Mario 64 set</a> was also released in 2021.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <p>A game narrator plays an important role, there is no doubt. Just look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Amelia Tyler! This is a role that, indeed, also plays an integral part of the ongoing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> series, and famous names such as Leonard Nimoy and Sean Bean have lent their vocal talents to the franchise.</p>
<p>Now, Bean is passing the narration sword - as it were - on to another Game of Thrones alum for the series' next instalment, Civilization 7.</p>
<p>As revealed in a new trailer, developer Firaxis has announced Gwendoline Christie (or, Brienne of Tarth to some) will be guiding us through the game on its release next year. "Now it's your turn to reimagine civilisation," Christie says in the trailer, "and build something you believe in."</p>

<p>Our Chris has already been hands on with the upcoming strategy game. "Playing Civilization 7 feels, if not quite like donning an old pair of comfortable slippers, then at least a first try-on of a refreshed version from the same designers," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-pairs-seismic-changes-with-a-lovably-familiar-formula">Eurogamer's Civilization 7 preview</a>.</p>
<p>"A group of designers who know precisely what it was about the old pair that made them such well-worn favourites."</p>

<p>According to a recent report by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Tom Warren’s sources have claimed that Bethesda “has been targeting an April 2025 release for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PS5”. However, this release window might change depending on how the development goes.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reports</a> about Indiana Jones and the Great Circle coming to PS5 have surfaced for some time. It surprised many when the developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially announced</a> a PS5 port for the title at Gamescom’s opening night live yesterday. As per the official announcement, the upcoming first-person adventure will be released on the PlayStation 5 in the Spring of 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, MachineGames provided some new information about Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at Gamescom last night. There will be a bunch of puzzles for players to overcome, from “mysteriously locked chambers, complex ancient mechanisms, and ritualistic sequences of challenges to understand and solve.” Skill trees aren’t traditional; players must find ‘Skill Books’ worldwide to learn new skills.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Details about Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s exploration were revealed, explaining how the game has a linear storyline and narrative-driven sequences. Still, players will also find much more open areas for exploration. Additional tools for Indy were revealed, too, along with The Whip. These include the Camera, Journal, Lighter and the Rest. The Rest refers to tools that players can find across the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/aboutus/news/2024/august/lego-super-mario-kart-sets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, LEGO officially announced that multiple new LEGO Super Mario: Mario Kart sets will release on January 1, 2025.</p>



<p>The upcoming sets include Yoshi Bike, Standard Kart, Donkey Kong &amp; DK Jumbo, Baby Mario vs. Baby Luigi, Toad’s Garage, and the Baby Peach &amp; Grand Prix Set.</p>



<p>Today’s blog adds that fans can use separate LEGO Mario, Luigi, or Peach figures to the new sets for more interactive features. These include “audio and visual effects for race-starting, horn-honking, kart-drifting and gliding sounds from the game.”</p>



<p>It also reveals that “players can also use these characters to scan Item Boxes, allowing them to collect extra coins and help boost their score as they finish the race.”</p>

<p>Baby Peach &amp; Grand Prix will be the largest set with 823 pieces and a price tag of $79.99. The smallest set will be Yoshi Bike, featuring just 133 pieces and costing $14.99. So, there’s a decent range of options among the six sets.</p>



<p>LEGO Design Director Simon Kent teased sets that “provide an immersive building experience and capture the heart-pounding action of the beloved video game series.”</p>



<p>The upcoming Mario Kart-themed sets also arrive shortly after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-super-mario-world-shadow-the-hedgehog-sets-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Super Mario World set</a>, which will launch in October 2024. </p>



<p>In addition to LEGO Mario Kart sets, the new blog also teased three new LEGO Animal Crossing sets. Those include Stargazing with Celeste, Leif’s Caravan &amp; Garden Shop, and Able Sisters Clothing Shop.</p>

                <p>At Gamescom this week, Fable creator Peter Molyneux revealed his next game--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peter-molyneux-debuts-new-god-game-masters-of-albion/1100-6525994/" data-ref-id="1100-6525994">Masters of Albion</a>--and he now says it could be his last. In an interview, Molyneux said he expects to be in his late '60s when Masters of Albion is done, and if he were to make another game, he would be in his mid-70s.</p><p>Molyneux told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/masters-of-albion-is-peter-molyneuxs-final-shot-at-redemption-probably" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> he's not guaranteed to live that long. "My life expectancy is measured in days rather than years because of my lifestyle. I smoke and drink and don't sleep enough," he said. "So if this is going to be my last game, what should it be? And the first thing that occurred to me is that I wanted to go home. I wanted to come back to PC and console, and make a game for gamers."</p><p>Molyneux runs the independent studio 22cans, which created mobile games like The Trail and Godus. He said he "got disillusioned with mobile," in part because of how mobile game development requires developers to stick to a specific formula to make money, according to Molyneux.</p><p>"I started to ask… what should I focus on? I was 60 at the time and this realization came to me that this next game could be my last. I am not announcing I'm retiring. I'll be found dead one morning with my head pressed against the keyboard," he said.</p><p>In a separate interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/masters-of-albion-a-new-spin-on-fables-world-from-its-original-creator-gamescom-2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Molyneux talked about how he's able to use Albion in his game, saying it's in reference to a historical term for Great Britain. It is not, as Molyneux sees it, owned by Microsoft via the Fable series.</p><p>"[It's] like saying if you set a game in America, you can't set any other game in America," he said. "So Albion can't be copyrighted. It's the name for England and Wales and that's how we get away with it."</p><p>Molyneux went on to say he honestly doesn't know if Albion can be trademarked. "I mean you would think that the responsible person I should be, I would've spent the last six months in lawyers' offices," he said.</p><p>Microsoft owns the Fable series, and the company previously granted the rights to Flaming Fowl Studios for its CCG Fable Fortune years ago (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-fortune-the-card-collecting-spin-off-of-the-/1100-6473416/" data-ref-id="1100-6473416">the game has since shut down</a>).</p><p>If there are legal consequences, that will come in time. For now, Molyneux said he's excited about Masters of Albion because it "extends and expands" the worlds he made in the Fable series.</p><p>"But it's not actually Fable 5 or anything like that," he said. "If you've played Fable, then definitely Masters of Albion will be familiar to you. One of the things that we have got and we absolutely wanted a nail was the humour. I think in the Fable games, it's not so much about telling jokes, it's more about giving you, the player, the ability to do ridiculous and funny things. And we've got that in Masters of Albion in absolute spades. I think we’re really nailing that."</p><p>In a different interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/masters-of-albion/peter-molyneux-new-strategy-game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>, Molyneux addressed his history of overpromising and underdelivering. He said he is "so, so, so sorry" about how he has "sold games by overpromising" and discussing features that didn't exist as if they did. "I apologize to anyone that got excited and got disappointed," he said.</p><p>"I'm really sincerely sorry to those people. I wasn't doing it because I had a plan. I was doing it out of ignorance really, and now I'm really obsessive about only talking about things I can show," he said.</p><p>Molyneux and 22cans also generated controversy over the game Curiosity: What's inside the Cube? The winner was promised a "life-changing" reward but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-god-who-peter-molyneux-forgot" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ended up receiving nothing.</a></p>

            <p>The Tomb Raider animated series will be making its debut on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> later this year. The show is set to follow on from the events of the rebooted Survivor trilogy, which those who have played the games will know saw Lara Croft lose more than one friend (in fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rhianna-pratchetts-stories-from-the-tomb-raider-reboot">Rhianna Pratchett admitted to me the first game in the series became a "cavalcade of death"</a>).</p>
<p>Now, speaking with <a href="https://nerdist.com/article/tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft-showrunner-tasha-huo-interview/">Nerdist</a>, the Tomb Raider series' showrunner Tasha Huo said Lara will deal with the resulting grief in the first season of The Legend of Lara Croft, so she can finally "start working on other shit".</p>

<p>"This series... really acts as a bridge between the origin story to the Lara that we fell in love with in the '90s, when we first started picking up the games," Huo told the publication. "That Lara was very quippy, very confident."</p>
<p>The showrunner therefore wanted to explore how Lara became that more self-assured version of the series' leading lady, and a TV show was a great medium to do just that. "I think what we got in the Survivor game series was so much humanity from her that was very moving to me as a player, and surprising given the colder Lara that we met in the original series," Huo said. "So for me, it was really cool to be able to explore the more vulnerable aspects of her while still maintaining the strong superhero figure that she is."</p>
<p>Huo furthered: "Lara has been burdened with grief since the '90s, but I feel like she's never fully gotten over it. And I wanted to move past it, to be honest, so that she could start working on other things, but it felt like we still had to address it."</p>
<p>"So in this first season, she is dealing with grief and we watch her power through to figure out how to become her best self after that so Lara can start working on other shit."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-warps-bethesdas-final-frontier-into-full-on-horror<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Space can be a lot of things: beautiful, awe-inspiring, full of hope for mankind's future. But it can also be the setting for some truly spine-chilling horror - and that's what <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>'s upcoming Shattered Space DLC will focus on. It places the base game's creepy House Va'ruun faction - a cult who worship a deity called the Great Serpent - centre stage. (Taking a wild guess, this is probably not going to be one for people who don't like big snakes.)</p>
<p>Shattered Space will see you travelling to the House Va'ruun's homeworld, which has been designed specially to tell the DLC's story. This means, if you decide to venture back out into the stars, you'll be able to return to the DLC whenever you like and pick up the storyline where you left off.</p>
<p>But where does the name Shattered Space come in? Well, as we found out during a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom 2024</a> showfloor presentation this morning, if Starfield's main campaign is about the pursuit of knowledge, then Shattered Space is about the knowledge you should really shut away in a box and never touch.

<p>
  Upon arriving at Dazra, House Va'ruun's capital city, you'll discover that much of it has been lost to a vortex. Space has literally shattered, leaving the citizens searching for survivors and the minor houses who make up their society fighting for control. There's even worries that the Va'ruun Zealots are trying to use the chaos to re-establish their own house...</p>
<p>You'll quickly find yourself caught up in the politics of House Va'ruun. Yet, if you decide to journey across the planet, you'll discover that the vortex's effects aren't just confined to the city's borders. Creatures are emerging from the other side of the vortex and they're certainly not happy to be on an unfamiliar planet. Not to forget about the planet's terrain itself which includes gravity anomalies.</p>
<p>The vibes here are pure space horror - to an extent the base Starfield never really touched upon. And it's interesting, especially off the back of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-gets-release-date">last night's look at the game's sporty new space buggy</a>, to see Bethesda trying different things. There, it was a pitch for the game to be a sort of space-set Forza-inspired off-road romp, with the REV-8 - Starfield's first land vehicle - now available for free. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-review">Starfield didn't land perfectly</a> - but perhaps it can become, as Skyrim has through its modding scene, a staging ground for all manner of other things. Including giant space snake horror. Shattered Space will be released on 30th September for PC and Xbox Series X/S.
