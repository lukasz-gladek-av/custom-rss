            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hi-fi-rush-gets-one-last-patch-before-studio-closure.871698/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157264/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-studio-closure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="NPzQHq">Tango Gameworks will update <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23574584/hi-fi-rush-review-game-pass-xbox-series-x-pc"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a> one last time before Microsoft shuts the door on the studio. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151045/microsoft-xbox-studio-closures-tango-gameworks-arkane-austin-redfall">Microsoft announced earlier in May</a> that it was closing three studios, including <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> developer Tango Gameworks. Shortly after the news of the closures, <a href="https://twitter.com/TangoGameworks/status/1787837929332601189">Tango Gameworks confirmed the game</a> will “remain available and playable everywhere” it's already accessible.</p>
<p id="uP1nCQ">The final patch is expected to fix “minor issues” in <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, and will be deployed later on Wednesday. Tango Gameworks will continue to work in partnership with Limited Run Games to release the physical version of the game. “Thank you all for your continued support,” <a href="https://twitter.com/hifiRush/status/1790728899875213673">Tango Gameworks posted from its X account</a>.</p>
<p id="aXk4gr">Microsoft’s decision to close Tango Gameworks came as a surprise to many in the industry; the Japanese studio surprise launched the game early last year to critical and — what seemed like — commercial success. <a href="https://twitter.com/aarongreenberg/status/1649431572137779203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1649431572137779203%7Ctwgr%5E664a50cfe28361006abf8068a7e0d7e777ff3dac%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fsuccess-cant-save-your-favorite-game-studios-anymore">Xbox marketing director Aaron Greenberg posted on X in April 2023</a> that <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> was “a breakout hit” in “all key measurements and expectations” at Microsoft. Just a day after the closure was announced, Xbox Game Studios lead Matt Booty told staff that Microsoft needed “smaller games that give us prestige and awards” — a message that was surprising to employees, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152137/xbox-hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-matt-booty">according to The Verge</a>, because <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> is exactly that. <a href="https://twitter.com/hifiRush/status/1691846131548913781"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> had 3 million players</a> and won plenty of awards, <a href="https://www.bafta.org/games/awards/animation-2">including a prestigious BAFTA win for its animation</a>.</p>
<p id="04wkBA"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> fans showed their displeasure with the closure by review bombing the game on Valve’s Steam platform — but opposite of how it’s usually done. Review bombing is usually a negative act — people attempting to tank a game’s review score on a platform like Steam. But <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> players added more than 2,000 <em>positive</em> reviews to Steam in an attempt to show Microsoft how much they loved it and to thank Tango Gameworks for their work. Several reviewers commented on the ironic nature of the studio’s closure: <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> is “a power fantasy about tearing down an evil corporation whose executives treat workers like fodder in the endless pursuit of wealth,” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23574584/hi-fi-rush-review-game-pass-xbox-series-x-pc">as Polygon said in its review</a>.</p>
<p id="QpToQ5"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> was originally an Xbox exclusive, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24063938/microsoft-xbox-exclusivity-playstation-5-nintendo-switch">but was released on PlayStation 5 in 2024</a>. It’ll remain available on all current platforms, despite the studio’s closure.</p>

  <p id="HOe9ZG">Cameos: They’re not just videos that actors do in their living rooms for money! In <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24126226/x-men-97-genosha-e-extinction-morlocks-cassandra-nova">its excellent first season</a>, the <em>X-Men </em><strong>’</strong><em>97 </em>writers have had a lot of fun giving viewers little views into the Marvel Universe beyond the X-Mansion. A quick glimpse of Spider-Man here, a conversation between Rogue and Captain America there — it’s a thrilling old-school approach to comic book cameos that signals the scale of what’s happening instead of teasing the potential for spinoffs.</p>
<p id="43BR8Y">Those cameos step up big time in the three-part “Tolerance is Extinction” finale, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24139132/x-men-97-bastion-ozt-operation-zero-tolerance">as the human-machine hybrid Bastion</a> plunges the world into chaos. As a result, we get some neat cutaways to Marvel heroes around the world reacting to a pending apocalypse — Daredevil fighting crime, Doctor Strange mid-surgery — and one that implies something kind of big. Take a look at these two:</p>

<p id="1v3OZl">Marvel animation heads will recognize them as Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson as they appeared in <em>Spider-Man: The Animated Series, </em>which was set in the same continuity as <em>X-Men</em>. What’s notable here is that both MJ and Peter are seen here, <em>together</em>, in a show that’s a sequel to their cartoon contemporary.</p>
<p id="giUxuo"><em>Spider-Man</em> famously ended on a cliffhanger, as escalating threats led to the webslinger bopping his way around the multiverse (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23281477/mcu-multiverse-saga-phase-5-and-6">I know</a>) with Madame Web (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24071362/madame-web-review-post-credits-scene-sequel-teaser-bad">I <em>know</em></a><em>) </em>to find Mary Jane. The reason? Earlier in the series, Peter learns that the Mary Jane he married at the start of the final season was in fact a clone (relatable, as Scott Summers would say), and the real Mary Jane was lost in limbo after getting pulled through a portal two seasons prior.</p>
<p id="eAueMl">So yeah: in a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it scene, <em>X-Men </em><strong>’</strong><em>97</em> gives Spider-Man a happy ending, showing Peter and Mary Jane reunited at last. But there’s a bit more to the story if you’re curious.</p>
<p id="7mmLRT"><em>Spider-Man </em>producer and head writer John Semper has <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/87-a-chat-with-john-semper-jr-part-1/id1331891115?i=1000563186237">spoken quite candidly</a> about his time running the animated series (not a picnic) and how his intended plans to end the series were disrupted by the network wanting to reboot the show into the bizarre <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23718878/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-high-evolutionary-spider-man-unlimited"><em>Spider-Man Unlimited</em></a>. After notably beating <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23742233/spider-man-across-spider-verse-review"><em>Spider-Verse</em></a> to, well, the Spider-Verse with a final story that had his Spider-Man meet multiversal versions of himself, Semper <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/spider-man-animated-series-cast-745604/">left the door open</a> for a final story that would depict Peter’s search for MJ. Over the years, Semper has said varying things about that final story — one version was a journey through history that would include Jack the Ripper — but ultimately, it’s hard to imagine the story ending in anything other than a reunion, even if it was off-screen. </p>
<p id="ieozFz">Well, until now.</p>

Based on the hanging lights in the background and the brown jacket he’s wearing, this is very clearly the dance scene that takes place the night before Ellie’s revenge tour is set into motion. He’s looking at who appears to be Ellie with a sad look on his face. We won’t spoil what’s going on for those who haven’t played the game, but just know the scene is incredibly dramatic.</p><figure id="" data-id="c0a445cccc53b9ea5d6d070265da1026" data-recommend-id="image://c0a445cccc53b9ea5d6d070265da1026" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel being a sad dad." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joel being a sad dad." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Max</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0a445cccc53b9ea5d6d070265da1026" data-recommend-id="image://c0a445cccc53b9ea5d6d070265da1026" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel being a sad dad." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The second photo of Ramsey as Ellie is a bit harder to discern. Ellie is in a winter outfit with a beanie and a fur-hooded jacket. While it’s not a direct adaptation of Ellie’s outfit in the early game segments set in Jackson, Wyoming, it’s likely this takes place during those levels, as that’s the only time in <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>that the weather merits warmer clothing.</p><figure id="" data-id="4df72446863055912df6345d34f3506d" data-recommend-id="image://4df72446863055912df6345d34f3506d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie holding a gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie holding a gun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Max</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4df72446863055912df6345d34f3506d" data-recommend-id="image://4df72446863055912df6345d34f3506d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie holding a gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While that’s not a lot to go on, it does look like the show will play pretty close to the source material for season two.

The portrait, painted by British artist Jonathan Yeo, marks the first official portrait of the king since his coronation one year ago.

Riffing even further on the <em>Dishonored</em> comparisons, another user made a short video of protagonist Corvo stealing the portrait as he does with many in-game pieces of art. </p><p>However, the jokes don’t stop at <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Dishonored</em>. Other comparisons arose, and not all of them were to video games. </p><p>So, all this is to say the portrait’s vibes are rancid in the eyes of the public, and maybe it inadvertently and humorously plays into what many see as the cartoon villainy of the British monarch. Though if I’m being honest, I think the portrait kind of goes hard.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Madden NFL 25 Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-reveals-madden-25/1100-6403229/" data-ref-id="1100-6403229">EA revealed Madden NFL 25 in January 2013</a>, meaning the game skipped being called Madden NFL 14 with that entry. Marking the franchise's quarter-century milestone, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/barry-sanders-named-madden-25-cover-athlete/1100-6407557/" data-ref-id="1100-6407557">NFL legend Barry Sanders was named the cover star for that game</a> after winning a voting contest. The former Detroit Lions running back beat out other Hall of Famers like Joe Montana and Jerry Rice.</p><p dir="ltr">If this year's edition goes ahead with Madden NFL 25 as well, it wouldn't be the first time EA has used the same exact name for a video game. For instance, the publisher had no problem launching Need for Speed in 2015 (a reboot) or even Need for Speed: Most Wanted in 2012, separate from the same-named game in 2005. Additionally, Activision Blizzard has gotten into this habit recently with the Modern Warfare subseries in Call of Duty. Other high-profile titles following this format include God of War (2018) and Saints Row (2022).</p><p dir="ltr">With that in mind, it's likely EA just goes ahead with Madden NFL 25. Over a decade has passed since the 25th-anniversary edition, and it's not like that version is available these days to confuse consumers. It shouldn't be long to find out for sure, though.</p>

As Season 2 shoots are underway, images from filming have begun to leak, but today's images are the first official shots from the upcoming season, which is due out next year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pascal's Joel appears to be in the barn where a very important and intense scene between he and Ellie takes place, while Ellie appears to be inside a wintery location, likely somewhere in the game's beginning where snow is abundant.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check out the first official look at Season 2 of&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>for yourself below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pascal and Ramsey are obviously returning cast members for the series, and they'll be joined by various newcomers in the show next year.&nbsp;<em>Booksmart's&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/01/09/kaitlyn-dever-joins-the-last-of-us-tv-show-as-abby">Kaitlyn Dever will play Abby</a>, while <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/10/hbos-the-last-of-us-young-mazino-cast-as-jesse-for-season-2">Young Mazino joins as Jesse</a>. Manny, Mel, Nora, and Owen will be played by Danny Ramirez (<i>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</i>,&nbsp;<em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>), Ariela Barer (<em>Runaways</em>), Tati Gabrielle (<em>Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</em>), and Spencer Lord (<em>Riverdale</em>), respectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We won't spoil these characters' roles in The Last of Us Part II, which is likely to match their roles in HBO's&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>Season 2, but if you know, you know.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fans of Naughty Dog's Last of Us games eagerly await the second season of HBO's&nbsp;<i>The Last of Us</i>. The first season debuted in January of last year, covering the events of the first game and its Left Behind DLC.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2023/01/27/hbos-the-last-of-us-will-return-for-a-season-2">HBO quickly confirmed the show would be getting a second season</a>, which is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/03/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-2-set-to-premiere-in-2025">set to premiere next year</a>.</p>

            <p>
Final Fantasy 14 is getting an official TTRPG, but it's already sold out and set to receive a second print run.
</p>
<p>
The tabletop game based on the MMORPG was announced last September and is based on the base game A Realm Reborn, allowing players to take on the role of a pre-made Warrior, White Mage, Dragoon or Black Mage, or make their own character from scratch.
</p>
<p>
Its release is later this month, but already sold out and with a second print coming due to popular demand (thanks <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-ttrpg/news/final-fantasy-14-trpg-reprint-after-selling-out">Dicebreaker</a>).

</figure>
<p>
The game remains available to <a href="https://gb.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-xiv-ttrpg-starter-set---wave-2">pre-order on the Square Enix website</a>, priced £50.99. The set contains all the necessary pieces, including books, character sheets, and dice. However, it remains unclear whether the game is based on an existing system like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, or something new.

<p>
It's no surprise, really, that it's proven so popular, considering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-xiv-the-most-profitable-game-in-the-series">Final Fantasy 14 is Square Enix's most profitable game</a>.

</p>
<p>
The MMO proved so popular after Endwalker's release, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-is-so-popular-its-been-pulled-from-sale">game was removed from sale</a>. A sell-out TTRPG requiring a second print is a fitting parallel.

</p>
<p>
The TTRPG also fits with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's new strategy</a>, unveiled earlier this week alongside its latest financial report.

</p>
<p>
While video games struggled to drive profits due to high development costs and underperforming sales, Square Enix's merchandise sector saw a 52 percent increase in profit year-on-year.
</p>
<p>
Square Enix will also "leverage IP across media formats", boosted by an integration with merchandise. In short, expect more initiatives like the Final Fantasy 14 TTRPG in the future.

</p>
<p>For Final Fantasy 14 itself, next expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-everything-we-know-so-far">Dawntrail</a> is set to release next month.</p>

<p>Like last November's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dinkum-summer-sun-update">summer update</a>, you can expect a bunch of seasonal changes, including golden and orange leaves on trees, as well as a brand new weather event.</p>
<p><em>Dinkum</em>'s autumn update also introduces mushrooms that sprout up from the ground around you, and if you harvest them, you'll be able to use them to make brand new recipes and crafting items.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dinkum-autumn-update-hand-trolley.jpg?itok=-LUlayBO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dinkum-autumn-update-hand-trolley.jpg?itok=CJTS6bQE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Dinkum&nbsp;</em>update isn't just bringing weather changes.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it wouldn't be a&nbsp;<em>Dinkum&nbsp;</em>update without some much-needed quality-of-life changes. First and foremost, the new Hand Trolley item is available at John's shop, and you can use it to lug containers around without emptying them first.</p>
<p>If you've obtained a level 3 building license, you'll now be able to create Advanced Crafting Tables, which will draw ingredients from nearby storage chests so you don't have to painstakingly take them out yourself.</p>
<p>Additionally, Bendon says Franklyn "now offers a new contraption" that should make sorting your inventory easier, but you'll need to "give him a shiny disc" to access this ability. Bendon says he wants to leave the mechanics of this exchange as a surprise.</p>
<p>A new Wish Fountain feature has also been introduced, and it brings a number of modifiers you can use to make your island "behave" differently. For instance, you can stop animals from attacking you first, or if you're the warrior sort, you can make them even more dangerous, increasing their loot drops.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-multiplatform-plans-reportedly-don%E2%80%99t-have-a-%E2%80%9Cred-line%E2%80%9D-regarding-which-games-to-bring-to-playstation.871647/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-multiplatform-plans-playstation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xbox multiplatform plans reportedly have no "red line" regarding which games could be released on PlayStation consoles, as they revolve around a simple, short-term mandate.</p>
<p>In a new post shared on <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsofts-quest-for-short-term-dollardollardollar-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows Central</a> today, Jez Corden revealed some new details on the Xbox multiplatform plans, which are known internally as "Latitude". According to the report, these plans have sparked a debate inside Microsoft about whether or not they are a good idea, as Microsoft is pushing for no "red line" regarding which games could be released on competing hardware, including PlayStation consoles. This approach is centered around CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood's mandate to increase every department's margins, but it may end up damaging the Xbox brand even more, especially if franchises like Halo and Gears of War become multiplatform.</p>
<p>As of now, only a few former Xbox exclusives have been released on competing hardware, like Rare's Sea of Thieves, which is selling <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-most-downloaded-playstation-5/">quite&nbsp;well on PlayStation</a>, Obsidian's Grounded, and Tango Gameworks' Hi-Fi Rush. Despite not being cornerstone franchises, their multiplatform release did tarnish the perception of the Xbox brand, alongside <a href="https://wccftech.com/xboxs-sarah-bond-tango-gameworks/">bad communication</a> and the abrupt closure of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/">multiple studios</a>, including the aforementioned Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin, developer of Prey and Redfall. As such, if Master Chief ever ends up appearing on PlayStation, it would most definitely be a massive blow to an already tarnished reputation that Xbox may never recover from.</p>

The documentary, called Game Planet, features a segment on how Capcom captured the physique of its fighters. Character artist Kawade Tsutomu explains that the company assembled a team dedicated to researching how muscles flex, extend, and rest on different martial artists’ and bodybuilder’s frames.</p><p>Once they found a group of suitable models, the team took reference photos of their bodies from “every conceivable angle.” As Tsutomu describes, Capcom wanted a variety of well-trained body types that could demonstrate different muscle and fat distribution among its characters. These nuances are how Ryu and Zangief can both be muscular but have distinct body types, a clear example of how different training methods have different results. The documentary also shows more slender, feminine models that were likely used as inspiration for more agile characters like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-cammy-resin-statue-700-dollars-1851420631&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-cammy-resin-statue-700-dollars-1851420631">Cammy</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-juri-kimberley-new-character-revealed-1849383396&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-juri-kimberley-new-character-revealed-1849383396">Kimberly</a></span>.</p><p>The full documentary is available on YouTube, but if you want to skip to the muscle mommy (and daddy) section, it starts at about the 10:30 mark.</p><p>Knowing that Capcom went to this level of detail during development makes sense, given how much <em>Street Fighter 6 </em>goes out of its way to define its rosters’ distinct disciplines within its world.

<p>Despite its immense popularity within certain circles, NieR: Automata always came across as a niche, cult-classic type of game. It’s a fever dream of a game with so many unique and compelling systems, and that’s what makes its post-apocalyptic world and frantic, action-heavy gameplay so enticing. But we want more. So, is there a new NieR game coming out soon?</p>



<h2 id="h-will-we-see-a-new-nier-game-coming-soon">Will We See a New NieR Game Coming Soon?</h2>



<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nier-veterans-possibly-working-on-new-project-in-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent report</a> originally published by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/yosuke-saito-working-on-new-project-with-yoko-taro-and-keiichi-okabe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>, NieR studio veterans recently started working on an upcoming project. They didn’t state precisely what that project is, but it’s been quite some time since NieR: Automata launched in 2017. If we’re counting the most recent title in the franchise, then NieR Reincarnation, a mobile RPG, didn’t fare well.</p>



<p>While talking about his next project, Saito said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m doing various things with the idea of creating something that does not yet exist. I can’t devote my time to that fully, so most of it has been left to the staff, but it’s turning into something quite interesting. I’m looking forward to the day we can announce it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, something “new that does not yet exist” could reference an entirely new story, either completely separate from the NieR series or within its world. But he continued with the interview, stating:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now. I’ll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, sp please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. That’s all I can say for now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It sounds like it might be NieR, but that’s anyone’s guess for now. We’ll have more information for you as it comes!</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-hack-and-slash-games-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 Best Hack-and-Slash Games, Ranked</a></p>



<h2 id="h-will-2b-star-in-the-next-nier-game">Will 2B Star in the Next NieR Game?</h2>



<p>Seeing as you can play as 2B in the last few NieR games, it’s highly likely that the iconic female protagonist will return. If she’s not the main character, then you can bet she’ll appear at some point in the story.</p>



<p>Of course, nothing, including story details, has been confirmed for the next NieR game, so we’ll have to remain patient for the time being!</p>



<hr>



<p>We’re big fans of NieR and Yosuke Saito in general here at Insider Gaming and are looking forward to more from the NieR universe. For now, check out what else we’re talking about:</p>

It shadow-dropped straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC, and was sold outside the subscription service priced $30. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-review"><u>Hi-Fi Rush review</u></a> returned a 9/10.

Support for the <a title="Platforms > PS4 [26,680 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a> version, which is currently in Early Access alongside PlayStation 5 and PC, will be discontinued, and all users who own the PlayStation 4 version will receive access to the PlayStation 5 version.</p><p>Get the details below.</p><div><p><strong>Removal of Online Requirements</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wayfinder-Update_05-15-24_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>Wayfinder</em> will be removing all online requirements and will be a single-player game with optional three-player cooperative play. No queues, no login, no accounts. You can choose to play solo on your Steam Deck while on the go or engage in peer-to-peer cooperatively with friends from your home PC.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>We realize this is a big shift, but a necessary one to guarantee that the game is around forever. This also means that all progress will not be carried forward due to saves being local and not on a server. This major change will be the basis for what we’re calling <em>Wayfinder</em>‘s “Echoes” update.</p><p><strong>One Price, Not Microtransactions</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wayfinder-Update_05-15-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>Removing the online requirement wasn’t our only major change. The industry has also shifted in recent years. With more and more games coming out, they’re all fighting for player’s time and attention. Players have more to play than ever, and they’re being asked to log into multiple games to check their daily quests, look at a store rotation, and be drip-fed content. Players today are more apt to outright purchase a game they know is full of content and also respectful of their time.</p><p>In the “Echoes” update, we’ll be charging one price—$24.99 USD during Early Access (increasing upon full release). No in-game microtransactions or in-game purchases, just one price. Founders who have already purchased the game will have access, and all the exclusive items included in each pack. Our Founder’s Packs will not be going back on sale. For anyone that supported us by purchasing in-game Runesilver, we’ve converted that Runesilver into a new in-game currency used to acquire exclusive cosmetics.</p><p><strong>Major Gameplay Changes</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wayfinder-Update_05-15-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>These aren’t the only changes, though. We’ve touched every major system in the game, and as a result, the gameplay is not only more refined, but through our various playtests with those outside the studio, the game performs and plays better than before.</p><p>Some of these changes include all weapons becoming randomized drops with various slots, armor now having stats and being collectible, thousands of cosmetics and housing items available to collect, the removal of the grind to get new characters, eased requirements for awakening characters, increased housing item limits, adding four difficulties to choose from, incorporating traditional <a title="Genres > RPG [16,250 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> talents into your progression, and much more.</p><p>This update will also launch with the latest <em>Wayfinder</em>: Grendel, as well as brand-new Hunts and a new Overlands zone (three times the size of our last!) that’s overflowing with content and points of interest.</p><p><strong>When Can I Play?</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wayfinder-Update_05-15-24_005.jpg"></a></figure><p>While we have lots more to share on these changes in the coming weeks, we have always felt that <a title="Genres > Action [1,833 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s speak louder than words. Therefore, we’ll be soft launching the <em>Wayfinder</em> “Echoes” changes on May 31. From that point forward, all online requirements tied to Steam, including all player data, will be removed, and the game will be available for anyone that currently owns any version of <em>Wayfinder</em> on Steam.</p><p><em>Wayfinder</em> will once again be available for purchase on Steam in Early Access on June 11. These changes will come to PlayStation 5 later in the year, and we’ll keep players updated once we have a concrete timeline.</p><p>PlayStation 4 support will be discontinued, with all PlayStation 4 versions being upgraded to PlayStation 5 at no additional cost. In the meantime, PlayStation 4 and 5 players can continue to access the game as normal.</p><p>Relaunching in Early Access on a single platform also allows us to be agile and make changes at a faster pace than before. We plan to leave Early Access later in 2024, but during that time, we’ll be adding gameplay refinements based on feedback, a new Wayfinder, a new location to explore, new expanded housing, and more.</p><p>We’re also formally announcing that <em>Wayfinder</em> will be coming to <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,304 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series X|S</a> during Early Access, and we’ll provide an update on timing later in the year.</p><p><strong>The Path Ahead</strong></p><p>We know that the path to get here hasn’t been easy, and the game has had a rocky past. We also know that this wasn’t the original game that we envisioned or that our fans bought into. When faced with the reality of where we are, we saw our options as shuttering the game fully as other online games have done before or making this pivot and releasing the “Echoes” update. During this process, we quickly came to the realization that we’re making a superior game for both current and future players. We’d love to support <em>Wayfinder</em> for years. We have ideas for additional characters and new content, and we have the intent to do so if the players demand it and <em>Wayfinder</em> finds a new audience.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Sony's PlayStation 5 console is heavily outselling Microsoft's Xbox Series X|S, according to Daniel Ahmad, director of research at <a href="https://nikopartners.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Niko Partners</a>, a firm that aggregates data on video game and console sales.</p><p>4.5 million PlayStation 5 consoles were shipped in the first quarter of 2024, with Sony selling roughly five times as many units as Microsoft's Xbox Series X|S console in the first three months of this year, Ahmad said.

The PS4 sold 60 million units in the same timeframe after its launch, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-names-two-playstation-ceos-says-ps5-growth-is-likely-over/1100-6523439/" data-ref-id="1100-6523439">Sony does not expect that the PS5 will outsell the PS4</a> over the next year when compared to the same point in the PS4's life cycle.</p><p>The report also revealed that digital sales are up in a big way. In 2023, the digital ratio for game software sales on PlayStation consoles reached 70%--a massive increase from 2015, when digital sales accounted for only 19% of game purchases. According to Ahmad, Sony partially attributes the uptick in digital sales to the COVID-19 pandemic, but notes that players were already beginning to lean toward digital purchases over physical purchases in the months prior to the pandemic.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xbox's hardware revenue was down 31% during the January - March 2024 window, according to the company's recent third-quarter earnings report. Xbox's parent company, Microsoft, and the CEO of its gaming division <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-player-who-nuked-phil-spencer-says-it-wasnt-personal/1100-6523305/" data-ref-id="1100-6523305">Phil Spencer</a> have recently come under fire for a number of reasons, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-phil-spencer-reflects-on-recent-mass-layoffs/1100-6522156/" data-ref-id="1100-6522156">mass layoffs</a> at Xbox, changes to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-how-gen-z-is-changing-xboxs-exclusivity-strategy/1100-6522158/" data-ref-id="1100-6522158">Xbox game exclusivity</a>, and most recently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">the closure of of several studios</a>, including Tango Gameworks, developer of several popular games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-evil-within/">The Evil Within</a> series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghostwire-tokyo/">Ghostwire: Tokyo</a>, and 2023's rhythm-based hit, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-studio-may-have-shut-down-but-its-getting-one-final-patch-today/1100-6523465/" data-ref-id="1100-6523465">Hi-Fi Rush</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/hi-fi-rush-is-still-getting-a-physical-release-despite-the-death-of-its-developer/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=hi-fi-rush-is-still-getting-a-physical-release-despite-the-death-of-its-developer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="331" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Just last week, Microsoft announced it would be <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/">closing <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> and <em>The Evil Within</em> studio Tango Gameworks</a>, alongside a few others, much to the despair of pretty much everyone. While Tango Gameworks will soon be no more, it still has a couple of things planned for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-hi-fi-rush-destructoid-tango-gameworks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a></em>, including its previously promised physical release.</p> <p data-characters="470" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="true"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> initially launched as a digital-only title last year, but a couple of months ago Tango confirmed it had partnered with Limited Run Games to launch physical copies. Not just for the Xbox version, but also the PlayStation 5 port, which arrived digitally this past March. I wouldn’t blame people for wondering if Tango’s closure meant the physical release would be cancelled, but Tango has assured via <a href="https://twitter.com/hifiRush/status/1790728899875213673" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a May 15 Twitter post</a> that isn’t the case.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Thank you all for your continued support. </p><p>We’re working to release the physical edition of Hi-Fi RUSH with our partners at Limited Run Games, as well as a final patch to address some minor issues releasing later today.</p><p>❤️</p></div>— Hi-Fi RUSH (@hifiRush) <a href="https://twitter.com/hifiRush/status/1790728899875213673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">It’s still unclear when exactly these physical versions will come out, with Tango only adding that it has one last patch it plans to release later today. Don’t expect anything major from the patch either as Tango says it’ll just address some of <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>‘s lingering minor issues.</p>
 <p data-characters="601" data-current-count="601" data-injectable="true">While it remains a tragic shame that Tango’s future has been cut short, presumably ruling out any potential <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> sequel along with it, it’s good to know that there’ll be an option for those who prefer to own their games physically. It’s also a better alternative than keeping <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>digital-only, since Microsoft could wind up de-listing it, thus rendering <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> forever unavailable. It’s certainly a better outcome than the one <em>Redfall</em> is facing, since it’s stuck as an online-only game and is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-killed-redfall-right-before-arkane-could-save-it-from-online-only-fate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doomed to become unplayable once its servers shut down</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="false">There was speculation that <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> would eventually see a port to the Nintendo Switch, much like other <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xboxs-grounded-and-pentiment-head-to-nintendo-switch/">former Xbox exclusives </a><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xboxs-grounded-and-pentiment-head-to-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Grounded</em> </a><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xboxs-grounded-and-pentiment-head-to-nintendo-switch/">and <em>Pentiment</em></a>. In fact, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073691/microsoft-xbox-games-ps5-nintendo-switch-exclusivity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> outright claimed this would be the case. Now, though, it’s entirely possible any Switch port of <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> will be scrapped. I’m happy to be proven wrong and see Nintendo drop a reveal at its next showcase, or perhaps even save <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nintendo-admits-its-making-a-new-console-in-the-most-casual-way-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the next Nintendo console</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/15/f1-manager-24-preview-making-andrettis-dream-come-true/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Will there ever be an 11th team of the Formula 1 grid again? Andretti is trying their damnedest to make it a reality, but in the meantime, video games are here to let us all live the fantasy of having and managing our own custom team.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 Manager 24 Preview – Create a Team, Mechanical Failures, Mentality &amp; more" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VqW2ED6_pJE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Launching on 23rd July, F1 Manager 24 will bring a new Create A Team option to the career, letting you found a brand new team to join the grid, set liveries, team suit colours, and create a new logo using some solid and pretty comprehensive layering tools. Alongside that, there’s also a background and origin for your team to choose from, giving scenarios that dictate some of the initial financing and the story that you’re telling.</p>


<p>Compared to just hopping into one of the real world teams, you’ve got a few more things to look after through each season, namely sponsors. As you’d expect, these give you a healthy injection of funding, with more on the table if you can hit your goals and targets.</p>


<p>A lot of the UI and general interface will feel instantly familiar to those who played the first two games – as with so many sports game series, there is an evolutionary approach to F1 Manager 24. However, Frontier has made some clear changes to improve and clarify the experience, which is always important for a game that’s going to be stat and menu-heavy. The financial screens now have pie charts to better show the incomings and outgoings of your money. The R&amp;D screens that show your various car attributes and how they relate to other teams now better point you toward the upgrades and areas you could work on to improve performance.</p>
<p>Alongside that is the new Mentality system, which shows how each driver and team member is doing, what they think about you and their general happiness. Are there some changes you can make to improve their mood and get the best from them through a race and season? Well, that’s the mark of a great manager, and you’ll have to make those kinds of decisions if you want to retain your brightest stars and talent.</p>

<p>Or you can look to stars of the future, with the new Affiliates system letting you sign young F2 and F3 drivers to your team while letting them carry on in the lower categories. Through this you can overlook their training and development, guiding their path to the top tier, and hopefully on to championships for your team!</p>
<p>There’s also mechanical failures that can now throw a spanner in the works for you, or any of the AI cars. As someone who lived through the tyre puncture pandemic of Codemasters’ F1 2010, I can tell you that random damage is difficult to accept when actually driving a virtual car, but makes more sense if it’s tied in with car wear, damage and more, as a way to deepen the recreation of reality.</p>
<p>We were put in a particularly extreme example scenario to demonstrate this, with both Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez coming into the Australian GP with a lot of heavy wear on their cars. The likelihood of engine, ERS and gearbox failures was through the roof here, with management the order of the day to simply try and make it to the end.</p>
<p>s</p>
<p>Both cars saw the ERS die, initially with reduced output and eventually with a total system failure. One of the pair then had engine failure reducing power, and with Perez out of the points I figured it best just to retire his car. Of course, Max being Max and the RB20 being the RB20, he was slicing through the field even while I was telling him to seek clean air and not to stress the ERS deployment. It wasn’t quite enough to get him up on the podium, but it honestly wasn’t far off!</p>
<p>Some of this still felt quite work in progress, and there’s some room for improvement between now and launch this summer, or into future games in the series. Dealing with mechanical failures is a neat idea, but you don’t get many additional tools to deal with issues. Some issues won’t be critical and can resolve themselves in time, and you can advise to avoid kerbs, drive in clean air, not use ERS in battle, but that’s the same set of instructions from last year. It would great to see some more specific ways to crisis manage, tell your team to work on a solution, shuffling engine mode and engage mitigations, just as we hear teams doing in real life. I’d even be up for a cheesy Pipe Mania minigame, to be honest!</p>
<p>F1 Manager is steadily growing into the role of capturing all the ins and outs of the motorsports soap opera that is Formula 1. OK, it probably won’t ever capture all the drama and snippy infighting that goes on (and that’s before Netflix comes along to cook up its own narratives), but F1 Manager 24 is bringing a good set of new features, requested changes, and general improvements to the table.</p>

            <p>Hi-Fi Rush studio Tango Gameworks has shared its first social media post since it was shut down by Microsoft last week.</p>
<p>In a message on X, the team thanked its followers for their "continued support". It then reaffirmed what Limited Run Games said last week - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-physical-editions-still-coming-following-studio-closure">planned physical editions of Hi-Fi Rush are still on the cards</a>, despite the studio's change in circumstances. These editions were first announced back in February, for both Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Some of the replies to this post enquired about what will happen when the licensed music in Hi-Fi Rush expires, and while Tango itself has not responded to these questions, others have pointed out that buying physical copies of the game is the best way to ensure preservation.</p>

<p>In addition, Tango Gameworks said the team was working on one last patch for Hi-Fi Rush. This patch will address some "minor issues" that remain in the game. The post ended with one red love heart emoji.</p> <div>

<p><strong>PLAYSTATION 5 AND PC</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Track 01) After reducing QA-1MIL to zero health, a collision issue would occur where players would fall out of the geometry. Chai will now properly fall to the ground, instead of into the abyss.</li>
<li>(Track 01) Fixed an issue during the latter half of the 2D area whereby the camera would not follow Chai when the elevating lift falls.</li>
<li>(Track 02) Corrected a defect whereby if you touched Rekka during her electric charge, your final Rank would not correlate with the Chorus score.</li>
<li>Some issues would occur when trying to use Macaron's Gravity Well while Rhythm Parrying an enemy. Well, this is now fixed!</li>
<li>(Track 03) Cutscenes previously would not play correctly if a Health Tank was consumed during the fight with the HG-0G. Feel free to block a few more hits with your face because this bug is fixed!</li>
<li>Fixed various text issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PLAYSTATION 5</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Track 01) During the "Dodge Attack" tutorial, there was a discrepancy between what Smidge said and the text. The text will now display correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ALL PLATFORMS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Track 01) We also QA'd some other issues during the QA-1MIL fight, particularly around transitions between phases.</li>
<li>Fixed even more text bugs! They just don't stop!</li>
<li>Drink prices adjusted in Vandelay vending machines to reflect local currency conversion.</li>
</ul>

<p>A little over a week ago, Microsoft sent shockwaves through the industry when it announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">it was closing several Bethesda studios</a>, including Redfall and Dishonored developer Arkane Austin, Mighty Doom studio Alpha Dog Games and, of course, Hi-Fi Rush and The Evil Within developer Tango Gameworks.</p>

<p>Many were quick to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arkane-lyon-boss-leads-widespread-condemnation-of-bethesda-closures">condemn this decision by Microsoft</a>, with Arkane Lyon boss Dinga Bakaba calling it a "fucking gut stab". Since then, many fans have turned to Steam to share their praise for Tango Gameworks' rhythm-action game, with recent reviews sitting at an 'Overwhelmingly Positive' average (see image).</p>
<p>For more on the game, our Ed spoke with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-creator-praised-good-situation-in-our-studio-and-freedom-of-risk-taking-a-month-before-closure">Hi-Fi Rush's creative director John Johanas at the BAFTAs earlier this year</a>. "I was just glad we got to produce a game that we wanted to make and it did find an audience," he told Eurogamer during the event. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-takes-home-best-game-and-four-more-awards-at-this-years-baftas">Hi-Fi Rush went on to win the BAFTA for animation</a> after receiving nominations in five categories.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wayfinder-echoes-update-changes-june<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Airship Syndicate has announced a massive overhaul for its online action-RPG&nbsp;<em>Wayfinder</em>, and it's bringing sweeping changes including an offline mode, a premium model, and more.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.airshipsyndicate.com/wayfinder-updates/wayfinder-echoes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Wayfinder&nbsp;</em>website, Airship Syndicate says the changes are geared towards "improving&nbsp;<em>Wayfinder&nbsp;</em>while keeping the game alive forever in a sustainable way".</p>
<p>To that end, the first major change is the removal of all online requirements. You'll now be able to play&nbsp;<em>Wayfinder&nbsp;</em>offline; in fact, Airship Syndicate says it "will be a single-player game" with an optional peer-to-peer three-player co-op component.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wayfinder-echoes-update-scythe.jpg?itok=k7Lb9SM- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wayfinder-echoes-update-scythe.jpg?itok=pq3hGN6Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wayfinder&nbsp;</em>is getting some very big changes soon.</figcaption></figure><p>This change will also mean that all progress will "not be carried forward", since&nbsp;<em>Wayfinder&nbsp;</em>is moving from a server-based model to a local storage system.</p>
<p>The next major change for&nbsp;<em>Wayfinder&nbsp;</em>is the shift from free-to-play to premium. Airship Syndicate says that with more and more games vying for your time, it wants to provide an experience that is "respectful" of that time.</p>
<p>As such,&nbsp;<em>Wayfinder&nbsp;</em>will be a $24.99 one-time purchase after the Echoes update. That price will increase once the game is out of Early Access, but there won't be any microtransactions or in-game purchases.</p>
<p>If you've purchased Runesilver within&nbsp;<em>Wayfinder</em>, your currency will be converted into a new in-game currency that you can use to buy exclusive cosmetic items.</p>

Airship Syndicate says these changes help the game "perform and play better than before".</p>
<p>All weapons in the game are now randomized drops with "various slots", for instance, and armor has been given stats. New characters won't require a grind to get, new difficulty levels have been added, and plenty more changes are also being introduced.</p>
<p>The soft launch for the Echoes update happens on May 31st, when all Founders will be able to play&nbsp;<em>Wayfinder&nbsp;</em>in its new incarnation. The update goes live for everyone else on June 11th.</p>
<p>Airship Syndicate also says it's discontinuing PS4 support for&nbsp;<em>Wayfinder</em>, but all PS4 players will be upgraded to the PS5 version at no additional cost. An Xbox Series X|S version is also planned for later this year.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether Airship Syndicate can turn around&nbsp;<em>Wayfinder</em>'s fortunes with this update, especially after a round of layoffs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/airship-syndicate-layoffs-report">reportedly hit the studio</a> earlier this year.

<p>Windows Central’s Jez Corden has claimed that more Xbox first-party titles are currently in development for PlayStation. </p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsofts-quest-for-short-term-dollardollardollar-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report</a> by Jez Corden, more upcoming Microsoft-owned games (Xbox first-party games) are in development for PlayStation under the codename “Latitude.” While Corden doesn’t go into detail on what exactly these games are, it was said that “they’re potentially obvious games you’d most likely expect.”</p>



<p>The report states that the new change in strategy revolves around Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood’s mandate to increase every department’s margins and that the company is taking a “no red line” approach to what games could make the change.</p>



<p>One game Corden mentions as a possibility is Halo. While it’s not an official report on the series jumping to PlayStation, he mentions that it would make sense after the success of Sea of Thieves of the platform.</p>



<p>In February 2024, Xbox released a ‘Business Update’ to clarify its strategy change, which included releasing four of its games on rival platforms. Those releases have been a tremendous success, and with the current generation of Xbox hardware trailing far behind the competition, it’s not difficult to see why Xbox wants to tap into these audiences.</p>



<p>At the moment, Microsoft is still planning to release new Xbox hardware. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-images-of-white-xbox-series-x-all-digital-leaked-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new white Xbox Series X console</a> has been leaked while the company is working on it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-next-gen-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next-gen Xbox system</a> as well as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-handheld/">possible handheld</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisofts-call-of-duty-rival-xdefiant-ditches-sbmm-says-its-no-fun-at-all<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ubisoft has said its Call of Duty rival <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a> does not feature skill-based matchmaking in its casual playlist.</p><p>For years, skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) has been the hottest of topics within the Call of Duty community, with some proclaiming it ruins the experience, others saying quite the opposite. High-skilled Call of Duty players often bemoan SBMM for chucking them into what they call “sweaty” lobbies full of similarly high-skilled players. Activision has defended its use, insisting skill in matchmaking means all players (regardless of skill level) are more likely to experience wins and losses more proportionately. “We use player performance to ensure that the disparity between the most skilled player in the lobby and the least skilled player in the lobby isn’t so vast that players feel their match is a waste of time,” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-pulls-back-the-curtain-on-call-of-duty-skill-based-matchmaking-and-its-going-nowhere">Activision said earlier this year</a>.</p><p>“Our data shows that when lower skill players are consistently on the losing end, they are likely to quit matches in progress or stop playing altogether,” Activision continued. “This has an effect on the player pool. A smaller player pool means wait times for matches increase and connections may not be as strong as they should be. This can compound over time to create a spiral effect. Eventually, when only high-skilled players remain because lower skilled players have quit out of frustration, the result is an ecosystem that is worse overall for everyone.</p><p>“Game data indicates that having some limitations on the disparity of skill across the players in a match makes for a healthier ecosystem. We also understand that many high skill players want more variety of experience, but often feel like they only get the ‘sweatiest’ of lobbies. We have heard this feedback clearly and will continue to test and actively explore ways to mitigate this concern.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Frankly, skill-based matchmaking means every casual game is repetitive.</p></div><p>Ubisoft, though, clearly has a very different philosophy for its free-to-play first-person shooter, which it outlined in a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/xdefiant/news/73QFbfzYxQbbL4ua8DValH/matchmaking-in-xdefiant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>.</p><p>“The most important thing to know is — there is no skill-based matchmaking in our casual playlist,” Ubisoft confirmed. “We believe that no SBMM is paramount to a fun and varied game experience in the long-term. Frankly, skill-based matchmaking means every casual game is repetitive — constantly repeating matches that are just as stressful and matched as ranked. We believe casual playlist should be fun and no SBMM is the way to do that. If you want that competitive every second counts go all out playstyle — you'll find our ranked mode to your liking.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Ubisoft’s stance on SBMM makes for a clear distinction between XDefiant and Call of Duty multiplayer, and is sure to go down well with a subset of hardcore competitive FPS fans. Ubisoft has been keen to attract disgruntled Call of Duty fans with a number of crowd-pleasing design decisions as it works to wrestle players away from Activision’s behemoth. Indeed, XDefiant developer Ubisoft San Francisco is helmed by Mark Rubin, a former Call of Duty executive producer at Modern Warfare developer Infinity Ward.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisofts-call-of-duty-rival-xdefiant-delayed-indefinitely">After a number of delays</a>, XDefiant’s pre-season launches May 21 on PC via Ubisoft Connect, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. The game is not set to launch on Steam or the Epic Games Store.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-lego-sees-its-gaming-future-in-fortnite<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>The Lego Group's Kari Vinter Nielsen on the possibilities afforded by allowing Epic's players to experiment with the iconic toy firm's digital assets</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Lego has a storied history in the world of video games with a massive back catalogue that dwarfs even some of the biggest publishers in the world. From licenced classics like Lego Star Wars to more recent games based solely on the Lego brand like Lego 2K Drive, the variety is impressive and there have been far more hits than misses.</p>
<p>But now the Lego strategy is changing, with Fortnite its new key area of focus after The Lego Group's parent company Kirkbi pumped $1 billion into Epic Games back in 2022.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/lego-and-epic-games-form-new-partnership-to-create-kid-friendly-metaverse">almost two years of partnership between the two companies</a>, the fruits of the deal are finally starting to show. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/lego-fortnite-is-first-step-towards-epic-and-legos-kid-friendly-metaverse">Lego Fortnite launched late last year</a> and proved to be incredibly popular, even beating the traditional Battle Royale in concurrent players during its launch period. Now the two companies have launched Lego Islands in Fortnite, a platform that allows anyone to use Lego assets to create games within Fortnite Creative or Unreal Engine For Fortnite, provided they stick to Lego's family-friendly rules.</p>
<p>"The vision for the two companies is very similar," says Kari Vinther Nielsen, Head of Play &amp; Creator Growth at Lego Game. "I think Epic Games is a leader when it has to do with digital play, whereas we [Lego] are a leader when it has to do with physical play, so we're building really nicely on top of each other's capabilities."</p>

<p>The launch of the Lego experiences in Fortnite signals a new era for the company's video game portfolio, with the focus now shifting to supporting both Lego and Epic-created experiences and also those that come from the wider community through the tools available. The hope is that some of the Lego-based games devised by the Fortnite community will offer truly new experiences in the Lego universe that have never been available before, and would likely never have been considered in the old way of working.</p>
<p>"We're excited to see what the creators will do with [Lego UEFN tools] because they're going to do things that we hadn't thought of ourselves," says Vinther Nielsen. "If you look at our communities they're amazing at leveraging what our brain can do, and the system in play, for endless opportunities. That's what I'm expecting to see, like, I'm going to see things that I haven't thought I would see. That's the intent here, it is to really learn and evolve what we do within Fortnite."</p>
<p>Opening up the digital Lego brand for anyone to use, within reason, should expand Lego's games offering immensely and the hope is that these experiences can influence the wider Lego games output over the coming years. Of course, successful Lego Islands in Fortnite will generate income for Lego with the company taking a 15% cut of any money the islands make, but the more immediate focus is letting the community loose in the hope they can build completely new ideas that can become major parts of the Lego catalogue further down the line.</p>
<p>"For us, it's actually way more about learning what opportunities are out there, how can we evolve the digital playspace with the Lego brand in the middle," says Vinther Nielsen. "Of course, there needs to be a sustainable opportunity here, but that's not the key objective – it is really to evolve capabilities and opportunities within the Fortnite platform. And also build our brand within the digital space even more, so we can really diversify play and make play available for all kinds of players out there because we're not all the same."</p>
<p>It's not totally out of the question that one of the Lego Fortnite experiences becomes the most popular Lego game ever, and in that event, you can expect Lego to look at how they can support the game and grow it further.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We're excited to see what the creators will do with [Lego UEFN tools] because they're going to do things that we hadn't thought of ourselves"</p></blockquote>
<p>But this isn't just a case of turning over the Lego assets to the wider world and letting them do all the work; the team at Lego is also hands-on and developing their own experiences within Fortnite. The first of these was the Lego Obby Fun Island which launched in February, and you can expect the company to keep producing their own Fortnite experiences going forward.</p>
<p>"I think the [Lego Fortnite experience] that I'm most proud of is actually Lego Obby Fun, because it was the first game we developed ourselves internally," says Vinther Nielsen. "It took us three months to do it, to get our hands dirty with UEFN, we were four people just hammering on with that to get it ready. I love the result of that because it's whimsical, it's fun and it's a game that can evolve into many different directions."</p>

<figcaption>The addition of Star Wars to Lego Fortnite shows the possibility for more brand crossovers, just as with past Lego titles and the main Fortnite game</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For Lego, the focus on Fortnite is taking up a lot of their resources when it comes to games, and the company is betting that this open ecosystem where anyone can use their brand to make games will result in a wider catalogue of experiences for players. But that doesn't mean that the more traditional Lego games we know and love are finished.</p>
<p>"We are still looking at bringing diversified gameplay to the world and to gamers out there, that is our key objective," says Vinther Nielsen when asked about what the future holds for more traditional Lego games. "There are many opportunities [for] how we want to evolve that, but our key priority right now is our partnership with Epic Games, to see where that can take us, while we still evolve around other partnerships within the gaming space. So you will definitely be able to see both [standalone games and Fortnite experiences] in the future."</p>
<p>There's also scope to bring the Lego crossovers that many will be familiar with into the world of Fortnite, thanks to the regular collaborations Epic Games runs with other brands. The first example of this was the launch of Star Wars characters into Lego Fortnite, a continuation of arguably the most well-known Lego game series.</p>
<p>"There's no natural limit to what we can do," says Saxs Persson, EVP of the Fortnite ecosystem. "There's tremendous opportunity down the line to figure out how to make exciting crossovers - if you look at the Fortnite ecosystem in general, it's like Halloween every day. We try not to close any doors here because every new collaboration brings another fresh idea."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-closes-studio-financials<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>publisher Thunderful Games has announced it will close one of its studios as part of an ongoing restructuring effort.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/media/dntkdriv/thunderful-q1-2024-presentation.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial presentation for 2024's first quarter</a>, Thunderful reveals it will close Stage Clear Studios, the developer behind&nbsp;<em>Last Kids on Earth and the Staff of Doom</em>. The studio has also acted as a co-development outfit on a number of other games.</p>
<p>Stage Clear's closure is part of an ongoing restructuring effort that will also see the divestment of Headup, which Thunderful <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-acquires-headup-games-for-11-million-euros">acquired in 2021</a>. Said restructuring effort has already resulted in Thunderful <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-restructuring">laying off around 20% of its workforce</a> earlier this year.</p>

Thunderful says this is partly down to&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld Build&nbsp;</em>sales not improving as the company had hoped.</p>
<p>A number of Thunderful projects have also been canceled; the group says it's either canceled or divested three internal projects and nine third-party efforts.</p>
<p>These include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tinkertown-is-minecraft-meets-zelda"><em>Tinkertown</em></a>, which Thunderful has divested along with Headup, as well as projects codenamed&nbsp;<em>Axe&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Strawberry</em>, the latter of which was to be a&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>title.</p>
<p>Third-party projects Thunderful has canceled or divested, meanwhile, include Headup games&nbsp;<em>Soulslinger&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Symphonia</em>, as well as FuturLab's <i>Ikaro Will Not Die</i>. Several unannounced projects have also been canceled or divested.</p>

<p>Upcoming internal projects include party-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Vendir: Plague of Lies</em>, which is set to launch later this month, plus the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-april-2024">recently-announced</a>&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld Heist 2</em>.</p>
<p>Third-party publishing efforts, meanwhile, include survival sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/aska"><em>Aska</em></a>, "high-speed time-trial racer"&nbsp;<em>Phantom Spark</em>, and 2.5D platformer&nbsp;<em>Replaced</em>, and that's all in addition to a project currently codenamed&nbsp;<em>Peach</em>.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see if any of these projects bear fruit (no pun intended on&nbsp;<em>Peach</em>'s part). Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Thunderful-related.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k24-interview-cm-punk-dlc-future-showcases/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/wwe-2k24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WWE 2K24</a> has been on the market for a couple of months now and developer Visual Concepts is expanding the experience with the game’s first DLC pack. CM Punk made his surprise return to WWE this past November at Survivor Series, and in years past, fans would likely have had to wait over a year to see him in a WWE game, as the deadline for setting the roster for the next game would have passed. Thankfully, that’s no longer the case, as Visual Concepts got to work and managed to get him into the ECW Punk Pack, which also includes Bubba Ray and D-Von Dudley, Sandman, and Terry Funk.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to have a quick chat with longtime WWE 2K producer Lynell Jinks about getting CM Punk back in a WWE 2K game after near decade-long absence, what kind of Punk content we might get in the future, and more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFwwe2k2427.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>I assume you were just as surprised as the rest of us when CM Punk returned at Survivor Series. How quickly were you in the studio making plans to get him in the game?</strong></p>
<p>Lynell Jinks: We'll get, like, maybe like a slight heads up sometimes. Sometimes, not all the time. But [with CM Punk returning] we we're, like, “Oh, man, [we're considering] all of the logistics for, like... how long is this run gonna last? Do we have the video game rights? When can we get them scanned? When can we go into mocap?” But around that time, the game's wrapping up. We're already heading into submission with Microsoft and Sony. So it's pretty much a nonstarter for on disk. But for DLC? That was our first thought. You know, let's get [CM Punk] into the DLC for one and figure out who to surround him with. That's kind of how the [ECW Punk Pack] came about. It's just, you know, who can we surround CM Punk with that makes total sense. And I think we, if you look at our list, did a pretty good job.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the ECW guys are a good fit. Punk has a bit of a modern-day Terry Funk feel to him these days. I'm not so sure about the Sandman though – he wasn’t exactly straight edge! </strong></p>
<p>LJ: When you look at Sandman, when you when you look at our current feature set, when you think about our weapons and our improvements to blood, and blood on the mat, it kind of makes sense from that standpoint, right? Like someone who is kind of synonymous with those things. And you know, it also comes down to who we have. Who we actually have the video game rights to and who the WWE has a video game rights to. So you look at the list. You're like, “Okay, cool. Yeah. This totally makes sense for our game and for the DLC pack.” So it's a combination of things. But I think people are gonna be really happy with it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFwwe2k2428.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>It's been over a decade since we last saw Punk in a WWE video game. What was the process for getting Punk in 2K24. How closely has the team been working with him?</strong></p>
<p>LJ: We have a team that goes out and gets them scanned. I know [Punk's] working with our marketing department to do some cool stuff to [promote] his inclusion of the game, because he's extremely excited. And he's been a great partner for us in in that regard.</p>
<p>When he left I think it was during 2K16. It was, “Ohhh no!” right? Yeah, that one hurt, and he hasn't been back since. When he started doing the [WWE Backstage] talk show thing after Smackdown, we were, like, “Hey, is he free game?” and they were, “No, we still don't have the video game rights.” So, it's something we asked about all the time, 'cause he has a place in all of our hearts on the dev team.</p>
<p><iframe title="WWE 2K24: First Look At CM Punk &amp; Walkout Entrance" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_phoj9ZvYY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>You've shown off Punk's new WWE 2K24 entrance, and it looks great, but it's definitely 2024 Punk with that bit of white in the beard. Some of the superstars in 2K24 have some fun alternate looks, can we expect the same for Punk either this year or in the future?</strong></p>
<p>LJ: You know, I think when you look at our MyFaction mode, that's the perfect place where we could start including things like that. If not for WWE 2K24, then definitely for 2K25, or even a future Showcase or whatever. It definitely opens up the possibilities now that [Punk's] back with the WWE. We always look at, what are some cool inclusions that we could have? Either a flashback scene in story mode, or something in MyFaction, the possibilities are endless. But it's definitely something that the team keeps the keeps asking and pushing and trying to figure out, like, how can we cram these things in, because we're super excited to have them in the game again.</p>
<p><strong>I vote you get Straight Edge Society era Punk in there. That's still a favorite. </strong></p>
<p>LJ: Ahhh, yeah. You could even have a deep cut where he's, like, one of the mobsters in Cena's entourage. There's just so many things that you could do.</p>
<p><strong>That <em>would </em>be a deep cut...</strong></p>
<p>LJ: [Laughs] Pipe Bomb version where he just he's squatting the whole time like Yoda.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFwwe2k2429.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Now that would be a good entrance. You mention Showcase, so could we see a Punk Showcase in the future? I think we're all ready for that. </strong></p>
<p>LJ: Whenever someone comes back to the WWE, we start looking at “Oh man, what's the theme for this year's game?” We don't know if it's this year, next year, two years from now, five years from now, as long as they're part of a Legends deal or part of the roster it opens the door for us to have different ideas and scenarios. So again, we're all just excited to have those conversations.</p>
<p><strong>Last question -- Punk's rocking the 90 rating while Drew McIntyre has an 89. What are the chances Drew drops that into a promo at some point?</strong></p>
<p>LJ: [Laughs] I think there's some legit heat that could be had from it if Punk wants to use that as a carrot and dangle in front of [him] and Drew can get mad. I could definitely see that. I'd love to see it. Any time they talk about our game we feel validated. Especially when they were doing like the ratings reveal during Smackdown and Raw, that's just so cool to see how far we've come.</p>
<p><strong>Good to talk to you as always!</strong></p>
<p>The ECW Punk Pack is part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k24-season-pass-cm-punk-jade-cargill-post-malone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WWE 2K24’s Season Pass</a>, which is included in the game’s $100 Deluxe Edition and $120 Forty Years of WrestleMania Edition, or can be purchased a la carte for $40. The Season Pass will include 5 DLC packs featuring over 25 new additions to the roster.</p>
<p>WWE 2K24 can be played on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5. The ECW Punk Pack can be downloaded as of today.</p>

<p id="ar3mAt">However, Bradley’s got much more up her sleeve than a fish-out-of-water comedy or a star-crossed romance. <em>The Ministry of Time</em> is a twisty, compelling read that takes its (very funny) premise and blends it with a bit of a spy novel, a paranoid thriller, a commentary on identity, and a rumination on the inherited trauma that can come with mixed-race heritage.</p>
<p id="nBLIky">The book is an early <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/may/03/the-ministry-of-time-by-kaliane-bradley-review-a-seriously-fun-sci-fi-romcom">critical</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/05/03/ministry-of-time-kaliane-bradley-book-review/">hit</a> for the summer season, and it’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/mediacentre/2024/the-ministry-of-time">already slated for a BBC adaptation</a> by Alice Birch (Prime Video’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23692870/dead-ringers-tv-show-review-weisz-rachel"><em>Dead Ringers</em></a><em> </em>and Hulu’s adaptation of <em>Normal People), </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23955524/the-curse-nathan-fielder-a24-show">produced by A24</a>, no less. Recently, Polygon spoke to Bradley about what inspired her to write <em>The Ministry of Time</em> (the pandemic) and the many, many things on her mind while writing it.</p>
<hr id="EyANB8">
<p id="Nh6kk4"><strong>Polygon: As I understand it, </strong><em><strong>The Ministry of Time</strong></em><strong> started as a joke during pandemic lockdown, yeah?</strong></p>
<p id="52dh6H"><strong>Kaliane Bradley: </strong>Yes. So it started as just kind of joke, a gift to these friends that I’ve made online, because I got very interested in historical polar exploration — which, you know, is one of those normal things that happen to you during lockdown. You get very deeply interested in something like — I can see you nodding, did you get deeply interested in something slightly deranged?</p>
<p id="sctVi9"><strong>Theme park promotional videos and old TV lineups.</strong></p>
<p id="99jbQv">Then you know! Like, <em>Well, perhaps my brain will only do this now!</em> [<em>laughs</em>] I just thought about polar exploration very intensely, particularly this one expedition, which lots of people thankfully are interested in — it could have been a more obscure expedition, one no one wants to talk about! </p>
<p id="uI7iUC">I didn’t ever intend for this to be a book, just a fun story to make [friends] laugh. And as I was writing, I just kind of did it. The development of the storyline very much came from having to confront what it would actually be like to live with a British imperialist who sincerely believed in the British Empire. So the more serious themes were always present, but the love story, the fish-out-of-water comedy, and the tragic comedy of bureaucracy was always at the heart of it. </p>
<p id="0joug7"><strong>A thing I appreciate about the fish-out-of-water comedy here is that Graham Gore is not a bumbling clown, right? I feel like you see a lot of these kinds of stories and they lean into the fish-out-of-water stuff a little too hard.</strong></p>
<p id="oeHl3D">Yeah, they want you to really laugh at this hapless person. Panicking at the traffic light. </p>
<p id="742xXV"><strong>Exactly</strong>.</p>
<p id="Wx6Fll">All these people — they’re called expats in the book — who are extracted from the past are all <em>people</em> and when even if you are pulled from a different time, a different culture, a different country... people aren’t fools. They will find ways to adapt. </p>
<p id="lC3Epn"><strong>Right but then there’s also Graham Gore’s wit and uh, savvy. </strong></p>
<p id="1PNt9w">[<em>Laughs</em>]<em> </em>I just was <em>really</em> interested in this historical figure about whom there is almost no archival material. If you want to keep up a conversation with a crush who is dead, you have to write! I wanted to hang out with this guy, but there was no way I could do it except by writing a whole conversation.</p>
<p id="RDLJwq"><strong>I also think the book is pretty clear that Graham’s relationship with the narrator is going to take a romantic turn</strong><em>.</em></p>
<p id="uJ44Ok">Absolutely. I <em>definitely</em> did not attempt to hide that!</p>
<p id="ciVimO"><strong>You did wait </strong><em><strong>just</strong></em><strong> long enough before they finally hook up. Although I do love his frustration with the narrator’s ignorance, when he says “I was </strong><em><strong>courting</strong></em><strong> you!”</strong></p>
<p id="K8USvb">Like, <em>What are you talking about? You haven’t pinched my butt once!</em> [<em>Laughs</em>]</p>

<p id="Q7tZ0G"><strong>What’s interesting to me about this collision of history and romance is that both are about contending with the fundamental unknowability of people. There are a lot of tragic things about the narrator in this book, but one of the biggest is that she’s studied Graham Gore so much that she forgets he’s a person.</strong></p>
<p id="fe9Xyz">I think there’s this dangerous idea, that you can intellectualize knowing someone, or someone could become a product of research that you could you could finally be the be all and end all the expert of knowing someone. I really love, by the way, the fundamental unknowability in romance and in history, that’s so good. And now that you’ve expressed it, I feel like that is the illuminating factor in the book.</p>
<p id="RB23d5"><strong>Would you say that extends to the protagonist and how she regards her background? She seems to like have intellectualized her mixed heritage like it’s on a shelf for her.</strong></p>
<p id="HhtbkR">Absolutely. So she is like me, British-Cambodian, mixed race and white passing. And she very much doesn’t want to deal with the inherited trauma of being Cambodian, in an emotional way. She doesn’t want to process any of that, she doesn’t want to have to admit that she is living with inherited trauma, because it just makes things like power, control and ambition more difficult. So she absolutely has this idea that she’s just put her identity on a shelf, she can take it down when it’s useful. And when it’s not, she can just store it. You can’t do that with yourself. She just <em>thinks</em> she can. And that’s going to take her on a very horrible complicated journey.</p>
<p id="bGoLil"><strong>Watching her fall for Graham is a contrast to how disaffected she is otherwise, as a bureaucrat. I read it wondering </strong><em><strong>Am I watching her become subsumed by the State or was she already at the start?</strong></em></p>
<p id="zr7f1i">The very first version of this book I wrote — she was very passive. There was not so much ambition. She was someone who was happy to let things happen to her, because she didn’t want to claim too much responsibility. But of course, that didn’t feel quite right for someone who is in this quite high paid, high-powered job. So I do think she had to become an ambitious person. And she did have to give up bits of herself, to become subsumed in the State.</p>
<p id="OfNiUg">Maybe this is just me, but I do sometimes think that extreme ambition or extreme desire for control tends to result in a kind of sublimation of the self into the desire to be on top. There isn’t even really a conception of a person controlling other people or your relationship with other people. It’s just this blank conception of power. I think having a lot of money makes people a bit bonkers. I think a lot of power makes people a bit bonkers. It smoothes some of their frontal lobe.</p>
<p id="TbPgUo"><strong>It’s so funny talking to you about this book, because I naturally want to gravitate towards the big meaty ideas, but it makes it sound more severe than the experience of reading it is!</strong></p>
<p id="uub6u4">I’m always like, yes, it’s about imperialism! And generational trauma! And how terrible the nation of England is! But it is also about trying to get the Victorian man to give someone a little kiss. </p>

  <p id="tPigxR"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23955474/terminator-netflix-streaming-anime-release-date">Netflix and anime studio Production IG’s take on the Terminator</a> arrives this summer, marking a big year for James Cameron’s killer cyborgs. <em>Terminator: Zero</em> will be a somewhat-familiar time-travelling tale with a twist: While we have our standard future warrior sent to the past to protect humanity from killing machines, there will also be a new protector in the form of an AI designed to battle Skynet’s genocidal ambitions.</p>
<p id="FxVQdp"><em>Terminator: Zero</em>’s hero is an as-yet unnamed soldier sent back in time to change humanity’s fate. She travels from a war-ravaged 2022 to 1997 Tokyo to protect a scientist named Malcolm Lee, who’s developing a rival AI system to fend off Skynet’s attack on humanity. “As Malcolm navigates the moral complexities of his creation,” Netflix said in a new synopsis for the animated series, “he is hunted by an unrelenting assassin from the future which forever alters the fate of his three children.”</p>
<p id="9wUgOV">As Netflix’s first images of <em>Terminator: Zero</em> reveal, Lee’s Skynet competitor is presented as something we haven’t seen in the live-action Terminator films before: a virtual maiden.</p>

<p id="MFMwNb">When it was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/26/22303696/netflix-terminator-anime-series">originally announced in 2021</a>, showrunner and executive producer Mattson Tomlin said the anime series would “approach Terminator in a way that breaks conventions, subverts expectations, and has real guts.” Tomlin’s credits include writing the stories for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/22/21395998/the-batman-trailer-dc-fandome-matt-reeves-robert-pattinson">Matt Reeves’ <em>The Batman</em></a> (and its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23044269/the-batman-2-sequel-announced-release-date-robert-pattinson">sequel</a>) and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/14/21369215/project-power-review-netflix-jamie-foxx-joseph-gordon-levitt-dominique-fishback">Netflix’s <em>Project Power</em></a>. Production I.G, the veteran anime production studio known for its work on series like <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, <em>Haikyu!!</em>, and <em>Psycho-Pass</em>, is lending its creative talents to adapt <em>The Terminator</em> for animation. The eight-episode series is directed by Masashi Kudo (<em>Bleach</em>, <em>Chain Chronicle</em>).</p>
<p id="b32J7X"><em>Terminator: Zero</em> will premiere on Netflix on Aug. 29.</p>
<p id="ILdWNY">Two months later, Terminator fans will get their hands on a big new survival game based on the franchise. Nacon’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24086601/terminator-survivors-survival-game-release-date-nacon"><em>Terminator: Survivors</em></a> will launch in early access on Steam for Windows PC on Oct. 24, just days before the 40th anniversary of the franchise’s launch. <em>Survivors</em> is also coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X at a later date.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/2024-05-15-starbreeze-ab-appoints-a-new-interim-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corporate press release</a> today, the board of Starbreeze officially appointed Mats Juhl as the new interim CEO. They replace Jürgen Goeldner, “who has been nominated as Chairman of the board to the Annual General Meeting.”</p>



<p>Starbreeze, best known for its work on the Payday series, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-fires-ceo-tobias-sjogren/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired its CEO</a> Tobias Sjögren in March 2024. Starbreeze chairman Torgny Hellström stated that “the execution of strategy needs a different leadership.”</p>



<p>The decision followed a rough launch for the series. It took weeks for Starbreeze to finally introduce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payday-3-first-patch-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a crucial patch</a> for serious issues that players experienced at launch.</p>



<p>In February 2024, Starbreeze released a report admitting that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-payday-3-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Payday 3 underperformed</a>. A statement explained that “Payday 3’s sales and player activity are currently at significantly lower levels than we would like.”</p>



<p>The new interim CEO Mats Juhl has served as the CFO at Starbreeze since 2020. Today’s press release adds that they previously held senior positions at a variety of places. </p>



<p>As an interim CEO, Juhl will only have the role “until a permanent replacement is presented.” At this time, Starbreeze did not confirm exactly why Mats Juhl is taking on the new role. The board said it will continue a “close collaboration” with Juhl during the transition period.</p>



<p>Starbreeze is currently working on a new Dungeons &amp; Dragons <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payday-developer-is-making-a-dungeons-and-dragons-live-service-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live service game</a>, expected to release sometime in 2026.</p>

<p>With so many different monthly subscription plans and passes to consider, you must be wise in choosing which to keep and which to ditch. Is Xbox Game Pass worth it these days? Do you get enough value from Xbox Game Pass Ultimate? Let’s dive in and find out!</p>



<h2 id="h-is-xbox-game-pass-worth-it">Is Xbox Game Pass Worth It?</h2>



<p>Whether or not Xbox Game Pass is worthwhile remains subjective. If you pay for a monthly subscription, do you feel like you’re getting your money’s worth? If you’re on the fence about paying for a subscription, consider your gaming habits. Do you switch games often? Do you want to play and beat as many video games as possible? If you answered yes to either of these questions, Xbox Game Pass is worth it in 2024.</p>



<p>Despite the trouble surrounding Xbox recently, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-shutting-down-four-studios-including-tango-game-works-and-arkane-austin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous studio closures</a>, their monthly game subscription service still provides value. You’ll find a lot of AAA day-one video game releases occurring monthly, and the backlog of available titles continues to grow and change over time.</p>



<p>Plus, you can play Diablo on Xbox Game Pass nowadays! With their recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-season-4-loot-reborn-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 revamp</a>, it’s phenomenal with a controller!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-xbox-game-pass-tiers">What Are the Xbox Game Pass Tiers?</h2>



<p>There are so many questions surrounding gaming subscription passes, as it appears like every publisher has a brand-new monthly sub coming out. For instance, how much is Xbox Game Pass Ultimate? Let’s explore the various tiers of Xbox Game Pass:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PC</strong>
<ul>
<li>Standard: $9.99</li>



<li>Ultimate: $16.99</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Console</strong>
<ul>
<li>Core: $9.99</li>



<li>Ultimate: $16.99</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Both</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ultimate: $16.99</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Overall, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is the better deal, especially if you love playing a wide variety of games in a month. Whether you’re a completionist or working through a neverending backlog of games, Ultimate provides you with opportunities. It features hundreds of games and day-one releases, plus you’ll receive additional discounts and perks for being a member.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-cancel-xbox-game-pass">How to Cancel Xbox Game Pass</h2>



<p>There are numerous ways to cancel Xbox Game Pass, including from the app and your console.</p>



<p>To cancel Xbox Game Pass on the console:</p>

For example, you might put together "pon" and "der" to make ponder in Quartiles. However, stringing together longer terms leads to high point totals, and new puzzles will become available daily.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4303270-apple-news-plus-quartiles-puzzle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303270" data-ratio="1.3996937212864" data-width="1306" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4303270-apple-news-plus-quartiles-puzzle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303270"></a><figcaption>Quartiles sees players stringing together two- to four-letter tiles to create words. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4303270-apple-news-plus-quartiles-puzzle_inline.jpg.large_2x.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Quartiles follows Crossword and Crossword Mini, the first puzzle games for Apples News+ that were introduced with the iOS 17 update. These experiences are separate from Apple Arcade, another subscription that can be bundled (called Apple One) with Apple News+ starting at $20 per month.
