		<p>There’s a new PS5 system software update available now that’s bringing some big (and some long overdue) features to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> console, including a new Welcome hub, party sharing and the wide launch of personalised 3D audio profiles.</p>
<p>The Welcome hub is a new customisable space that is available today for “select players” in the US, and will be rolling out over the next few weeks for the rest of the world. This brings customisable widgets and backgrounds to the PS5 home screen, so you can forefront features like battery monitoring, your personal trophy collection and more whenever you boot up the console. This should make for a much more engaging alternative to the old Explore tab – you’ll also be able to set your own background here, for a much needed personal touch.</p>



<p>Then there’s party sharing, which lets you send out chat links on other platforms and have them bring other people directly into a voice chat, both via their smartphone app and via PS5, and whether they’re in your friends list or not. It’s just another little route for establishing links between people, and will be rolling out gradually over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>And then we have features that were in testing with the most recent beta system update. Personalised 3D audio for headphones and earbuds is the big one here, helping you to tune the 3D spatial audio to your specific hearing. This has been something in the pipeline ever since the PS5 launched, though back then Sony considered taking photos to scan people’s ears – something that Apple and others do for Bluetooth earbuds.</p>

<p>Here’s what it will look like:</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 UI | Personalised 3D Audio Profile setup" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QhZzPyc-Zas?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s also adaptive controller charging on the PS5 Slim and upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, which is kind of nice, and per-user Remote Play settings.</p>
<p>The update is available to download right now, though as mentioned, some of these features will be rolling out more gradually over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Ballistic Moon confirmed that Until Dawn will include NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3. To be more specific, the upscaling components of each technology are updated to version 3.7 and 3.1, respectively. In addition, both will support NVIDIA and AMD Frame Generation techniques to deliver optimal frame rates. By the way, you'll have the option to unlock the frame rate on your PC.</p>
<p>Until Dawn was always meant to be a highly cinematic game, and owners of ultrawide displays will be happy to learn that both 21:9 and 32:9 aspect ratios are fully supported here. The graphics have also been enhanced thanks to ray traced shadows, reflections, and ambient occlusion. Finally, PC users will get the full DualSense experience if they own the PS5 controller: the haptic feedback will let you feel the heartbeat of the characters during the Don’t Move sequences, while Adaptive triggers allow you to feel the weight of your choices and experience more realistic resistance when pulling the trigger of firearms.</p>
<p>Until Dawn is out on October 4.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-coaster-2-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Frontier has announced the&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>release date, and the second game in the studio's theme park management series is landing later this fall.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.planetcoaster.com/news/2024-09-12/planet-coaster-2-coming-pc-and-console-november-6th-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster&nbsp;</em>website,&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>arrives across PC and consoles on November 6th, and you can pre-order both the Standard Edition and the Deluxe Edition of the game right now as well.</p>
<p>Picking up the Deluxe Edition nets you ten extra rides that Frontier says are "perfect for bestowing a classic theme and feel" upon the parks you create. All pre-orders, whether Standard or Deluxe, will also get three bonus rides as part of their pre-order.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/planet-coaster-2-release-date-water-park.jpg?itok=alPe9V98 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/planet-coaster-2-release-date-water-park.jpg?itok=HIIUwfL9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>arrives in November to make you wish it was summer.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-coaster-2-announced">originally unveiled in July</a>. As the name suggests, it's the second&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster&nbsp;</em>game, following on from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-coaster-has-sold-1-million-copies">very popular</a> predecessor, which was released in late 2016.</p>
<p>As you might imagine,&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>will once again let you manage your very own theme park. You'll be able to design your own rides, set up facilities however you like, and give your guests the theme park experience of their lives.</p>
<p>Naturally, the sequel will also boast a number of new features and improvements over its predecessor. First and foremost among these is the ability to build new water rides, including flumes, swimming pools, and more.</p>
<p>Frontier is also promising "next-level customization" that utilizes brand new building and pathing tools, allowing you to build a park that looks exactly like the one in your head.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>will also let you build and work on parks with friends "using a shared cross-platform save", and the Franchise Mode will let you collaborate directly with other players as well.</p>
<p>In short,&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>is angling to be the definitive theme park sim, so you'd better watch out,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/park-beyond"><em>Park Beyond</em></a>.&nbsp;<em>Planet Coaster 2&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009610" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/planet-coaster-2/9PK5WS0HXQKQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on November 6th.</p>

What is the purpose of these ruins? Why are so many strong monsters guarding them? Will my editor forgive me for not thinking of a third question? <em>(You’re fired—Guides Ed.)</em> Read on to unravel the secrets behind at least two of those questions below.</p><h2 id="h2422"><a id=""></a><strong>How to complete the Traces of the Ancients and Nemesis Takedown quests in <em>Visions of Mana</em></strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="cc735db1415fb83d599849a657f16a0e" data-recommend-id="image://cc735db1415fb83d599849a657f16a0e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some treasure hunting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Some treasure hunting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc735db1415fb83d599849a657f16a0e" data-recommend-id="image://cc735db1415fb83d599849a657f16a0e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some treasure hunting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As you progress through the game, you can mostly ignore the ruins you find until you accept the <strong>Traces of the Ancients</strong> quest in Illystana. This quest will task you with finding all eight ruins before you can report back to the quest giver. Note that this quest is <em>not</em> retroactive. Ruins you passed by before will need to be revisited, and you won’t be able to tell which specific ruins you have or haven’t visited. The quest will only tally how many ruins you’ve visited in total.</p><p>Fortunately, all you have to do is step foot near the ruins and watch the short cutscene play that gives you the name of the location. You don’t actually need to step inside after this point, especially if you don’t want to anger any dangerous enemies. You’ll keep uncovering new ruins after your stay in Illystana, so this isn’t a quest you can complete right away.</p><p>After you complete Traces of the Ancients, you’ll receive the <strong>Nemesis Takedown</strong> quest. This is where things get tricky. You’ll have to go back to each ruin and fight through all the groups of high-level enemies inside. For every group you defeat, a torch will light up, which will eventually unlock a secret area where a Nemesis monster lurks. These Nemeses will have a few lackeys by their side, so make sure you can deal strong single-target and AoE damage. Strategies for each Nemesis will change, but as long as you can exploit elemental weaknesses and use buffs and debuffs to bolster your defenses, you should fare well.</p><p>Defeating each nemesis will unlock one of eight powerful endgame weapons for you to use. These easily rank as some of the best equipment in the entire game, so the reward is well worth the effort. As an aside, <strong>Nemesis Takedown progress <em>is</em> retroactive</strong>. Any fights you happen to beat before accepting the quest will remain defeated and count towards your overall quest completion.</p><h2 id="h2423"><a id=""></a><strong>All ruin locations and rewards in Visions of Mana</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="0d681367e0297fd79fa60278c48aef41" data-recommend-id="image://0d681367e0297fd79fa60278c48aef41" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Combat within the ruins." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Combat within the ruins." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0d681367e0297fd79fa60278c48aef41" data-recommend-id="image://0d681367e0297fd79fa60278c48aef41" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Combat within the ruins." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re looking to clean up either of the aforementioned quests, or you’re wondering if there’s a specific weapon you want to hunt down first, <strong>below you’ll find where you can find each ruin and the weapons they hide inside</strong>.</p><p><strong>Charred Passage</strong>: Mortal Twiliance - Spear, Val</p><p><strong>Aery Passage</strong>: Mystic Revelunge - Spear, Careena</p><p><strong>Lefeya Drifts</strong>: Mystic Ragevise - Fist, Careena</p><p><strong>Fallow Steppe</strong>: Etherial Shiftcane - Cane, Morrley</p><p><strong>Pritta Ridge</strong>: Spirit Acriscythe - Scythe, Palamena</p><p><strong>Ahrvet’s Pasture</strong>: Spirit Treadstep - Boot, Palamena</p><p><strong>Khaswia Moors</strong>: Arboreal Paraquell - Umbrella, Julei</p><p><strong>Zawhak Desert</strong>: Arborial Blossomer - Hammer, Julei</p><p>Additionally, the <strong>Traces of the Ancients</strong> quest will award you with 2,200 Lucre, 3 Parpoto Oils (heals the party for 250 HP each), and the <strong>Lucent Beam</strong> Ability Seed (a mid-level light magic spell). <strong>Nemesis Takedown</strong> will give the <strong>Respect for the Ancients</strong> Ability Seed, which increases the damage of normal attacks by 30 percent in exchange for 3 percent of your HP. “Normal attacks” refer to your basic attacks and not your heavy or special attacks, so make sure you only give this to a character who can make good use of it.</p><h2 id="h2424"><a id=""></a><strong>How to defeat the ruins early in Visions of Mana</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="680c8844b9020de8ed5997cf5cd8271b" data-recommend-id="image://680c8844b9020de8ed5997cf5cd8271b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Careena's class strike, with a giant explosion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Careena's class strike, with a giant explosion." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="680c8844b9020de8ed5997cf5cd8271b" data-recommend-id="image://680c8844b9020de8ed5997cf5cd8271b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Careena's class strike, with a giant explosion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Obviously, these ruins are designed to be completed near the end of the game (around chapter seven or eight). However, it’s absolutely possible to complete them as low as level 30, even on Hard Mode. If you’re up for the challenge and aren’t afraid to die a few times, here’s the party composition that worked for me.</p><h3 id="h2425"><a id=""></a><strong>Val</strong></h3><p><strong>Edelfrei</strong>. Having a dedicated tank doesn’t <em>seem</em> like it’d help that much at first. However, armed with the <strong>Provoke</strong> Ability Seed, enemies will tend to get confused in their AI and won’t necessarily rush at the rest of your party and pick up quick kills. I like the Dryad-driven Edelfrei class because the healing from the wood elemental vessel gives Val some natural HP regen, assuming he can tank a hit or two. You may also consider the <strong>Paladin</strong> class if you can effectively keep Val shielded, especially if you get the Mortal Twiliance first.</p><h3 id="h2426"><a id=""></a><strong>Careena</strong></h3><p><strong>Divine Fist</strong>. Class strikes are ridiculously powerful in <em>Visions of Mana</em>, and the Divine Fist class ignores a chunk of your enemies’ Defense stat whenever she uses one. This helps out a lot against these otherwise bulky enemies, since even a level 30 Careena with Ability Seeds that amplify class strike damage can take out a massive chunk of these level 50+ enemy health bars.</p><p>What’s more, the class strike gauge fills whenever your party takes damage, even if it’s from a killing blow. If the enemies are one-shotting your party, you’ll quickly have another class strike to use as a counter attack. Remember to bring lots of Cups of Wishes!</p><p>If you need more support, you may consider using <strong>Julei</strong> with the <strong>Hunter</strong> class as your class strike user instead. However, I have not tested the damage potential Julei has here, so your mileage may vary.</p><h3 id="h2427"><a id=""></a><strong>Morley</strong></h3><p><strong>Nightblade</strong>. Just a ridiculously powerful class overall, and probably the best class to play throughout the majority of <em>Visions of Mana</em>. A 20 percent boost to Critical Hit damage and a 70 percent boost to Critical Hit rate is <em>bonkers</em>, especially since you can equip Ability Seeds to further strengthen that damage and make that Crit Rate effectively one hundred percent.</p><p>Morley attacks so fast that he can potentially stunlock enemies, and the Moon elemental vessel gives Morley yet another form of crowd control. Even if he starts out inflicting insignificant damage, the right combination of buffs and debuffs should let Morley inflict damage way above his pay grade.</p><p>From here, you don’t need to make any dramatic changes in terms of battle strategy. Each fight has similar mechanics to any other overworld fight you might encounter, albeit against high level monsters. Some enemies will resist Fire and other elements you may have been banking on, so you’ll either want to swap in different party members or save those fights for last.</p><p>Underleveled players can and will burn through their items during these fights, but Lucre is fortunately abundant enough that this shouldn’t be an issue. Otherwise, just make sure to charge your class strike gauge before each battle so you can inflict a lot of damage right out the gate. Elemental breaks also help a lot too!</p><hr><p>If you are taking these fights on at low levels, note that <strong>you’ll get a lot of experience from each group you clear</strong>. I strongly suggest using any EXP-boosting items as you complete these battles to maximize your gains. Good luck battling these baddies!<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’re working on something,” Hawk said. “That is the first time I’ve said that publicly. </p><p>“It will be something the fans will truly appreciate.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/27/hawk-main-1711550956739.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Tony Hawk.

The series has been dormant since 2020's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-remake-review">well-received</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2</a>, a set of remakes developed by Activision-owned studio Vicarious Visions before it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-developer-vicarious-visions-blizzard-entertainment">absorbed into Diablo developer Blizzard in 2022</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-plans-for-pro-skater-3-4-remake-were-abandoned-after-blizzard-merger">Speaking in 2022</a>, Hawk said a follow-up remake collection was planned (Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4) before Vicarious Visions merged with Blizzard, but the dream died when Activision failed to find a video game pitch from other developers it was happy with.</p><p>“[Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4] was the plan, even up until the release date of [1 and 2],” Hawk said. “We were doing 3 and 4, and then Vicarious got kind of absorbed, and then they were looking for other developers, and then it was over.</p><p>“The truth of it is [Activision] were trying to find somebody to do 3 and 4 but they just didn’t really trust anyone the way they did Vicarious.</p><p>“So they took other pitches from other studios, like, ‘what would you do with the THPS title?’ And they didn’t like anything they heard, and then that was it.</p><p>“Who knows? Maybe when the dust settles, we’ll figure it out. You never know. I never would’ve thought we were going to do 1+2, 20 years later.”</p><p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater released on PSone on September 29, 1999, and went on to sell millions of copies and spawn subsequent sequels. As well as working with Activision on something new video game related, Tony Hawk is making a kids-focused animated TV show called <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-kids-focused-animated-tv-show-is-called-skatebirds">Skatebirds</a>, a title inspired by Hawk’s ‘Birdman’ nickname.</p><p><em>Photo by Sean M.

He went on to say: "I can call Flappy Bird a success of mine. But it also ruins my simple life. So now I hate it."</p><p>Now, Flappy Bird is set to return, with an expanded version aiming for launch by the end of October across multiple platforms including web browsers, and an iOS and Android version planned for release in 2025. But this new Flappy Bird isn’t from Nguyen, it’s from ‘The Flappy Bird Foundation,’ which is described as “a new team of passionate fans committed to sharing the game with the world.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Flappy Bird 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The Flappy Bird Foundation said it has acquired the official Flappy Bird trademark from Gametech Holdings LLC, a U.S. company that appears to have previously held the trademark after an abandonment claim, as well as the rights for the original game and character from Piou Piou vs. Cactus, the mobile game that supposedly originally inspired the Flappy Bird character.</p><p>The Flappy Bird Foundation is already talking about future Flappy Bird releases, which will debut new game modes, characters, progression, and massive multiplayer challenges.</p><p>Michael Roberts, the “chief creative” behind Flappy Bird’s return, said: “We are beyond excited to be bringing back Flappy Bird and delivering a fresh experience that will keep players engaged for years to come. We have big plans for our little Bird!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Kek, the developer of Piou Piou, is also involved, and commented: “Today is a milestone not just in gaming but for me personally. It’s so cool to see how influential Piou Piou has been for developers and hundreds of millions of gamers over the years. It’s incredible to work alongside such a dedicated team of fans and creators who are truly passionate about changing the industry narrative and together bringing the original Flappy Bird back to life.”</p><p>There is no mention of Dong Nguyen in The Flappy Bird Foundation’s note to press.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playstation-5-pro-tests-most-fervent-fans-loyalty<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image via Sony. All other images via Omdia.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PlayStation 5 Pro will carry a launch price tag coming in just shy of $700, representing a 75% increase on both the nominal price of its last-gen predecessor PS4 Pro, and a 56% premium on the PS5 Digital Edition. By comparison, PS4 Pro launched at the same launch price as PS4.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While this makes PS5 Pro’s pricing unprecedented for Sony, it is not unexpected. Historically, console manufacturers typically release cost-reduced hardware to address more price-sensitive late adopters – such as 2016’s PS4 Slim ($100 cheaper) and 2019’s Switch Lite (also $100 cheaper).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet the cost per transistor has not come down on key components such as the CPU this generation. This has had the knock-on impact of 4Q23’s PS5 Slim hardware revision releasing at either the same or a higher price than 2020’s PS5, depending on SKU and territory.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a result, hardware ASPs this generation to date have tracked above the previous generation (see Figure 1). On top of this, in 2024 Sony has de-emphasized utilizing regular discounting as a means of growing the PS5 installed base in a bid to preserve the profitability of its hardware.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Figure 1: ASP of PS5 hardware has remained notably higher, gen-on-gen, than PS4</span></span></p><p>Source: Omdia Games Hardware Database</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PS5 Pro is squarely targeted at PlayStation’s most engaged audience">PS5 Pro is squarely targeted at PlayStation’s most engaged audience</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PS5 Pro’s $700 price point makes it an aspirational device aimed at players who desire the very best experience. Platform holders have historically catered to this small but highly engaged audience in the past with niche systems that lay adjacent to popular home console platforms, such as 1991’s Neo Geo AES ($649 or $1502 in real terms) and 1993’s 3DO ($699, or $1512 in real terms).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The difference today is that the premium “Pro” consoles are mid-gen refreshes – they are additive to what are existing, thriving console platforms. In the case of PS5 Pro, it will still sit alongside an active installed base of PS4, PS4 Pro, and PS5 players – of which their software and services boast significant interoperability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Figure 2: Pro consoles accounted for just 13% of combined PS4 and Xbox One installed base by end of 2019</span></span></p><p>Source: Omdia Games Hardware Database</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s also not the first of its breed – Sony has already had a run of history with PS4 Pro. Omdia data reveals that just 1.8 million PS4 Pro systems were sold in its launch year, 2016. By the end of its fourth calendar year on the market, 2019, the 13.9m units of PS4 Pro sold accounted for under 15% of the overall PS4 installed base.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similarly, Omdia’s historical console hardware data reveals that the equivalent Microsoft system, Xbox One X, also only accounted for just over 10% of installed consoles following the same timeframe. Combined, both “Pro” machines only accounted for just over 13% of the installed base of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles (see Figure 2).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite PS4 Pro’s comparatively competitive pricing, then, it was always an enthusiast device – a stark contrast to previous mid-generation upgrades such as Game Boy Color, DSi, and New Nintendo 3DS. And Sony has usage data on PS4 and PS5 players that will have pinpointed a large enough highly engaged portion of its audience that would make PS5 Pro a worthwhile endeavor to pursue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Figure 3: Total addressable market across PlayStation consoles largely static gen-on-gen</span></span></p><p>Source: Omdia Games Addressable Market Metrics Database</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s this engagement that is key to understanding Sony’s strategy with PS5 Pro. With the active installed base of PlayStation users remaining static as it transitions between generations (see Figure 3), Sony has focused its attention on increasing lifetime spend per console. This has materialized in the following ways:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PS5 Pro is another means for Sony to either target the highly engaged – or allow the highly engaged to self-select themselves into the PlayStation ecosystem.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And yet despite the above, Omdia does not anticipate PS5 Pro to sell in the same volumes as its predecessor. PS4 Pro not only launched at a comparatively lower price point, but coincided with both the adoption of 4K TVs hitting a critical mass. It also launched simultaneously alongside PlayStation VR, a more compelling platform than current-generation successor PS VR 2.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PS5 Pro will not be enough to reverse PS5’s sales volume declines in 2024">PS5 Pro will not be enough to reverse PS5’s sales volume declines in 2024</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As PS5 approaches its fifth full year on the market without a single permanent price drop, the absence of key first-party blockbuster games throughout 2024 coupled with a prolonged cross-generation period has led to PS5 entering its decline phase a year earlier than PS4 did in its cycle.</span><br></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Omdia’s preliminary console forecast estimates that even in a best-case scenario, sales volumes for PlayStation 5 would still decline by 17% in 2024, when compared with 2023.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Right now, PlayStation 5 Pro is set to launch alongside the casual-friendly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lego Horizon Adventures</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which is currently the only confirmed major first-party title slated for the holiday season. By comparison, PS4 Pro launched in close proximity to fan favorite first-party triple-A games such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Uncharted 4, The Last Guardian, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gravity Rush 2.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PS5 Pro is also arriving in a development landscape where the gestation period for triple-A games is longer and more costly than it was in the previous generation. This has materialized as a sustained cross-generation period in the PS5’s cycle, where publishers have only recently begun leaving behind the last-generation systems for their triple-A games. Yet at the same time, 2024 has also been a quiet year for such major releases.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sony does, however, have an opportunity to ride off the halo effects created by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto 6, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">which is expected for release in 2025</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">The game is expected to launch exclusively on console platforms, with a PC release coming at least a year later. This would leave PlayStation 5 Pro as the premier place to experience what is one of the most hotly anticipated games in the modern age. If Sony is smart, it should strike a marketing deal with publisher Take-Two to promote the game alongside its new console.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PS5 Pro will prove an interesting case study for the console market due to its notable contrast against its predecessor PS4 Pro. That older system was a defense strategy against the moving baseline of PC gaming hardware and an answer to the adoption of 4K TVs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, PS5 Pro is razor-focused on an audience which wouldn’t think twice about moving to PC. But at its $700 price point, the stakes will be high for PS5 Pro to deliver a tangible benefit to this audience in the three-four years before Sony begins its transition to PS6, especially in a generation that has delivered fewer exclusive blockbuster games than the last.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Analyst, Games, Omdia</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">James is part of Omdia’s games team, specializing in the markets for PC and mobile gaming.

<p>Chemical Agents comes complete with some "seriously deadly toys", including stratagems, utilities, emotes and more.</p>
<p>On the Warbond's release, players will be able to get their hands on the likes of the TX-41 Sterilizer, the G-4 Gas grenade (which will "cover the whole area in a cloud of noxious fumes") and the new utility P-11 Stim Pistol.

<p>If you want to update your overall look, there will also be new armor and capes to adorn your Helldiver with. These include the Standard of Safe Distance cape and the Patient Zero's Remembrance cape. It may be true that not all heroes wear capes, but these ones do!</p>
<p>Emote wise, you are looking at the Natural Gas Extraction emote, which will allow your squad to pull your finger. For those moments of victory, meanwhile, there is an emote simply known as Ew.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2's Chemical Agents Premium Warbond is set to release later this month, on 19th September. Further details can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/12/helldivers-2-the-chemical-agents-warbond-launches-sept-19/">PlayStation Blog</a>. </p>

            <p>Unity has cancelled the controversial Runtime Fee for use of its game engine tools, which charged developers for each game install, with immediate effect.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-reveals-plans-to-charge-per-game-install-drawing-criticism-from-development-community">pricing plan was introduced in September</a> last year and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indie-developers-react-to-astonishing-scumbag-move-of-unitys-new-install-charge">heavily criticised by game developers</a>, calling it an "astonishing scumbag move" among other responses.</p>
<p>Today, in a <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee">blog post</a> from new president and CEO of Unity Matt Bromberg, the company announced it will revert back to a traditional subscription model "after deep consultation with our community, customers, and partners".</p>

<p>Bromberg described the company's aim of "democratising game development" by allowing games to be built by anyone.</p>
<p>"However, we can’t pursue that mission in conflict with our customers; at its heart, it must be a partnership built on trust," said Bromberg. "I’ve been able to connect with many of you over the last three months, and I’ve heard time and time again that you want a strong Unity, and understand that price increases are a necessary part of what enables us to invest in moving gaming forward. But those increases needn’t come in a novel and controversial new form."</p>
<p>Now, Unity Personal will remain free and the current revenue and funding ceiling will be doubled to $200,000 USD, meaning more developers can use Unity at no cost.</p>
<p>For its Pro and Enterprise packages, Unity will revert to a traditional subscription, with pricing and qualifying annual revenue thresholds increasing from 1st January 2025.</p>
<p>"Cancelling the Runtime Fee for games and instituting these pricing changes will allow us to continue investing to improve game development for everyone while also being better partners," concluded Bromberg.</p>
<p>After announcing the introduction of the Runtime Fee, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-reportedly-considering-cap-on-hugely-controversial-per-install-fees">Unity considered adding a cap</a> to the fees and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-announces-significant-changes-to-its-controversial-new-pricing-plan">announced significant changes</a> along with an apology.</p>
<p>A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-retiring-from-company-weeks-after-pricing-controversy">CEO John Riccitiello left the company</a> following the pricing controversy. At the start of 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-starts-2024-by-laying-off-1800-employees-as-part-of-ongoing-reset">Unity laid off 1,800 employees</a> as part of an ongoing "reset".</p>
<p>That reset continues today with these pricing changes. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-appoints-former-ea-and-zynga-exec-as-new-ceo-following-pricing-controversies-and-layoffs">Bromberg was appointed as CEO in May</a> this year, following positions at EA and mobile developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/zynga">Zynga</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-runtime-fee-canceled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unity has announced that it's canceling its controversial runtime fee policy, reverting instead to a seat-based subscription service while also increasing prices for Pro and Enterprise customers.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://unity.com/blog/unity-is-canceling-the-runtime-fee" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a blog post</a> on the official Unity website, company CEO Matt Bromberg says the decision to cancel the runtime fee was made "after deep consultation with our community, customers, and partners".</p>
<p>Bromberg goes on to say that his company's mission to "democratiz[e] game development" can't be achieved if the company is "in conflict with our customers", and that price increases, while necessary, "needn't come in a novel and controversial new form".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unity-runtime-fee-canceled-ui.jpg?itok=yOSdLhYX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unity-runtime-fee-canceled-ui.jpg?itok=MwT-QOpr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Unity is canning its controversial runtime fee policy.</figcaption></figure><p>Unity Personal, the lowest tier of Unity's pricing model, "will remain free", and the revenue and funding ceiling will be doubled from $100,000 to $200,000. Additionally, the Made with Unity splash screen will be optional for games made using Unity 6, which <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/introducing-unity-6-the-next-major-release-of-unity/933629" rel="noopener" target="_blank">launches later this year</a>.</p>
<p>Things are a little different for the Pro and Enterprise models, however. Pro subscriptions will jump by 8% to $2,200 per year, effective from January 1st, and if your game has more than $200,000 in revenue and funding, you'll need to use this tier.</p>
<p>The Enterprise tier, meanwhile, is for customers with more than $25 million total revenue and funding. The price of this tier will jump by 25%, but Blomberg says he and his company will contact customers on this tier in the next few days "to discuss customized packages".</p>
<p>Unity says it'll return to this pricing structure every year to decide whether it needs to be increased or not, but that if the Editor changes "in ways that impact you", you can keep using the previous version "as long as you keep using that version".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-builders-journey-unity.jpg?itok=O0Za3oRK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-builders-journey-unity.jpg?itok=tWzde9zN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Unity has been used to create all kinds of games, including&nbsp;<em>Lego Builder's Journey</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly what Unity's controversial runtime fee is (or was), it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-developers-outraged-after-major-pricing-change">a policy announced</a>&nbsp;last year that charged developers based on the number of installed copies of their game.</p>
<p>As you can probably imagine, indie developers reacted with outrage;&nbsp;<em>Garry's Mod&nbsp;</em>developer Garry Newman estimated that he'd have paid the engine "about $410k more" for&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>, for instance, while indie dev legend Rami Ismail said the changes made developing in the ecosystem "a straight-up financial risk" on a number of levels.</p>
<p>Unity quickly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-apologizes-for-confusion-and-angst-due-to-runtime-fee-policy-promises-changes">apologized for the "confusion and angst"</a> it had caused developers, promising changes to the policy, which it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-announces-revised-pricing-policy-following-massive-backlash-from-developers">announced a few days later</a>. Those changes didn't scrap the runtime fee, but they did make it a little less punitive for smaller developers.</p>
<p>The controversy saw then-CEO John Riccitello <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-retiring-after-runtime-fee-controversy">stepping down from the company</a>, and Unity subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-layoffs-core-business">laid off a huge number of workers</a> in January this year. That move may or may not be related to the runtime fee controversy, but said controversy certainly can't have helped.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see if these changes restore trust in Unity among the developer community. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/eu-organization-says-premium-currency-is-purposefully-tricking-gamers.979218/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/eu-organization-premium-currency-complaint<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An EU consumer watchdog organization has submitted a complaint to EU authorities regarding the use of premium currency in games, which the organization says "maximizes consumers' spending" and constitutes "manipulative spending tactics".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/press-releases/consumer-groups-denounce-video-games-manipulative-spending-tactics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release summarizing the complaint</a>, BEUC (Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs, otherwise known as the European Consumer Organization) says games like&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>engage in "unfair practices" via their premium currency systems.</p>
<p>The group's director general,&nbsp;Agustín Reyna, says the group has "identified numerous cases where gamers are misled into spending money", and that "deceptive practices must be stopped". BEUC is calling on the EU to "ensure that traders play by the rules" and provide safe environments for gamers and children.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eu-premium-currency-complaint-beuc-minecraft.jpg?itok=EZolaEL6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eu-premium-currency-complaint-beuc-minecraft.jpg?itok=_440aACX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>is one of the games BEUC says is engaging in unfair practices with regards to spending.</figcaption></figure><p>BEUC says it's identified four main problem areas with regards to premium currency in gaming.</p>
<p>The first is that consumers "cannot see the real cost of digital items" when premium currency is sold in bundles or the price of the currency is not transparent. The group therefore recommends all in-game purchases be displayed in real-money terms.</p>
<p>According to the group, companies that claim players prefer in-game currency "are wrong"; BEUC says its data shows consumers "find this unnecessary step misleading" and would prefer simply to use real money for their purchases.</p>
<p>Third, BEUC says consumers "are often denied their rights" when making premium currency purchases, and that publishers often tie these purchases to "unfair terms favoring game developers".</p>
<p>Finally, the group says children are "even more vulnerable" to the unfair practices it's complaining about. It points to data showing that children in Europe make around&nbsp;€39 worth of purchases per month in games (that's about $43).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-eu-complaint-premium-currency-beuc.jpg?itok=n6j5dFz6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-eu-complaint-premium-currency-beuc.jpg?itok=PFHBEn7X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sorry,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, but you're in BEUC's crosshairs as well.</figcaption></figure><p>BEUC's full report makes a number of recommendations to combat this problem, including assessing a potential ban on premium currency sale for in-game and in-app purchases, as well as "stricter transparency requirements" in EU consumer law and "stronger consumer protection and regulation".</p>
<p>If this seems like a waltz we've danced before, that's because it is, specifically with regards to predatory practices implemented with systems like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/uk-asa-loot-boxes-ea-jagex-miniclip">loot boxes</a>, microtransactions, and battle passes.</p>
<p>In-game monetization, especially in single-player games, is becoming a dirty term among players, leading to games like&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-no-microtransactions">pledging not to include any</a>&nbsp;(although that doesn't stop games like&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-capcom-statement">locking features behind microtransactions</a>, bizarrely).</p>
<p>If you'd like to, you can read BEUC's <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/sites/default/files/publications/BEUC-X-2024-061_Monetising_play_Regulating_in_game_and_in_app_premium_currencies.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full report here</a>. Of course, it's not legally binding right now; it remains to be seen whether EU authorities will make changes based on this report or not, but its conclusions are pretty compelling.

<p>It’s been more than one year since the launch of Starfield, and we’re finally getting the game’s first story expansion pack. It’s a big one, delving into the mysteries of Va’ruun, with countless new locations and mechanics to explore. For those excited about the prospect of more space exploration, here is everything we know about Starfield Shattered Space!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-shattered-space-release-date">What is the Shattered Space Release Date?</h2>



<p>You don’t have to wait long to play the first Starfield expansion; Shattered Space launches on <strong>September 30</strong>. As far as we know, there is no advanced access for buying the expansion early, so everyone who purchases the DLC will receive it on the same day.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-does-shattered-space-cost">How Much Does Shattered Space Cost?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you purchase Shattered Space separately, it costs <strong>$29.99</strong>. However, buying the Starfield Digital Premium Edition for $99.99 includes the expansion and a few other in-game goodies, including the soundtrack and cosmetic weapon skins. If you previously bought the Premium Edition, you <strong>do not need to buy</strong> Shattered Space again! It will be automatically added to your library on release!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-shattered-space">How Big is Shattered Space?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bethesda hopes to reignite the fan base with its first Starfield expansion by offering an expansive story to explore. Shattered Space includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>More than 50 all-new locations across Va’ruun’kai</li>



<li>Brand-new grenades, which you can now craft</li>



<li>Additional enemies and creatures, such as Redeemed and Vortex Horrors</li>



<li>The return of the Zealots, Spacers, and Crimson Fleet</li>
</ul>



<p>That said, it’s unclear precisely when the expansion will take place in the game. It appears that Va’ruun’kai is an end-game planet meant for high-level characters with considerable time in the game. If that’s the case, it will prevent many new players from accessing the content straight away. Surely, however, Bethesda thought of that.</p>



<p>In any case, Shattered Space is a story-based expansion, though as you can see from the 50 new locations promised, it’ll offer considerable exploration opportunities, too.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-will-shattered-space-be">How Long Will Shattered Space Be?</h2>



<p>There are no official confirmations from Bethesda regarding the length of Shattered Space. However, some estimates place it between 7 to 10 hours to complete. You can stretch out your time in the new content by exploring all 50 unique locations, the entire planet of Va’ruun’kai, and interacting with every new character. But if you solely want to focus on the story content, I would estimate around 8 hours. I could be wrong, and I’ll happily eat my words and update this piece once we know more!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-platforms-is-shattered-space-available-on">What Platforms is Shattered Space Available On?</h2>



<p>Like the base game, Shattered Space will launch on PC and Xbox Series X|S. There’s still no word on whether Starfield is coming to PS5, and it’s doubtful they will backport the game to Xbox One or PS4.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-shattered-space-the-last-expansion-for-starfield">Is Shattered Space the Last Expansion for Starfield?</h2>



<p>No! At least, we certainly hope not. Previously, Todd Howard said they intend to release annual story-based expansion packs for Starfield well into the future to extend the game’s lifespan. They didn’t want to leave everyone hanging for a decade, like with Skyrim, while awaiting their next major release.</p>

Other ducks may be looking to steal your items from under your beak, so protect your territory! Build a giant base, team up with friends to hunt, or simply steal from other ducks. The possibilities are endless in this persistent-world survival shooter filled with ducks, guns and never-ending quacking.</p><p><strong>New in Early Access</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>New Horizons</strong> – Ducks love migrating to new areas! To ensure our feathered friends have access to exciting new types of weather, desert and snow biomes will be added to the game.</li><li><strong>Dexterous Ducks</strong> – Updated animations for holding, shooting, and gathering will be added (at the cost of the ducks losing telekinetic control of weapons and objects).</li><li><strong>The Iron Age (for Ducks)</strong> – A brand-new, extra-large furnace is on its way, specifically designed to smelt large amounts of ore and create Chainsaws and Jackhammers, some of the new tools coming in early access.</li><li><strong>New Weapons</strong> – Our feathered physicians have told many ducks never to use alcohol while operating heavy weaponry. To ensure this never happens, a Distillery is being added to the game along with a recipe for Molotov cocktails, as well as Bazookas (a new raid weapon which will replace the old boring grenade launchers).</li><li><strong>Watery Resources</strong> – Platforms have appeared on the water’s surface. No one really knows where they came from, but ducks can gather supplies from them.</li><li><strong>Dynamic NPC Behavior</strong> – The human NPCs (Non-Plumed Characters) will become smarter, faster to act and more aggressive.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="DUCKSIDE | Everything new In the FINAL beta | Early Access Release Date" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CE8epjJo6w0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ahead of its launch next month, Sony has revealed a few more details on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/until-dawn/" data-ref-id="5000-616356">Until Dawn</a> remake's PC release, including its system requirements and recommended specs. Similar to the PC ports of other PlayStation Studios games, Until Dawn will benefit from advanced graphical features, customizability, and accessibility features. Developer Supermassive Games has designed the remake to run on a variety of PC configurations, with presets ranging from a 720p 30fps mode that uses low graphical settings, up to a 4K 60fps mode.</p><p>For the least-demanding presets, you'll be able to experience the interactive horror game with an Nvidia GeForce 1660 or a Radeon RX 470 graphics card. If you're aiming for a consistent 1080p 60fps experience, you'll need to have a GeForce RTX 2060 or Radeon RX 6600XT GPU installed and at least 16GB of RAM. For anyone looking for a stable 4K 60fps mode using very high presets, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/12/until-dawn-pc-features-and-specs-revealed-out-october-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Supermassive recommends</a> a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti or a Radeon RX 6900XT GPU.</p><h2>Until Dawn PC Minimum and Recommended Specs</h2><hr><table dir="ltr"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Preset</strong></td><td><strong>Low</strong></td><td><strong>Medium</strong></td><td><strong>High</strong></td><td><strong>Very high</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Average performance</strong></td><td>720p 30fps</td><td>1080p 60fps</td><td>1440p 60fps / 4K 30fps</td><td>4K 60fps</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Intel Core i7 4790K / AMD Ryzen 5 1500X (or similar processor with AVX support)</td><td>Intel Core i5 8600 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</td><td>Intel Core i5 8600 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</td><td>Intel Core i7 11700K / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 / Radeon RX 470 (or equivalent card with minimum 6GB VRAM)</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 / AMD Radeon RX 6600XT</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800XT</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti / AMD Radeon RX 6900XT</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>8GB RAM</td><td>16GB RAM</td><td>16GB RAM</td><td>16GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>70GB on SSD</td><td>70GB on SSD</td><td>70GB on NVMe</td><td>70GB on NVMe</td></tr><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 10, 11</td><td>Windows 10, 11</td><td>Windows 10, 11</td><td>Windows 10, 11</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><p>The common thread between all the available graphical options is that you'll need an SSD with 70GB of storage capacity available--and an NVMe one specifically for the higher graphical presets--a fairly large amount of space but thankfully <em>much </em>less demanding than the chunk of storage that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-specs-revealed-along-with-hefty-storage-requirement/1100-6525645/" data-ref-id="1100-6525645">God of War Ragnarok will require</a>. If you've got the hardware to support the game, Supermassive says you can expect ultrawide monitor support, cinematic aspect ratios, a curated set of ray-tracing features, and both upscaling and frame-generation support through Nvidia DLSS 3.7 and AMD FSR 3.1.</p><p>Full DualSense controller support on PC will also be available, and Supermassive says you'll be able to feel the heartbeat of the characters during intense sequences alongside several other haptic feedback features.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/until-dawn-remake-is-out-october-4-puts-it-on-collision-course-with-silent-hill-2/1100-6525780/" data-ref-id="1100-6525780">Out on October 4</a> for PS5 and PC, Until Dawn is a remake of the 2015 game and features a substantial number of changes to make the game feel more cinematic in nature. Remade entirely in Unreal Engine 5, the game features updated character models, environments, interactable props, visual effects, and animations. Supermassive has also upgraded its gore effects, as the game features "realistic real-time fluids" and more convincing injuries for its cast.</p><p>This is just one of several horror games launching in October, and fans of the genre can also play the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-will-let-you-turn-off-ui-apply-old-school-90s-filter/1100-6526267/" data-ref-id="1100-6526267">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-quiet-place-game-finally-revealed-and-it-looks-terrifying/1100-6524309/" data-ref-id="1100-6524309">A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadows-of-the-damned-is-getting-remaster-12-years-after-it-was-released/1100-6514997/" data-ref-id="1100-6514997">Shadows of the Damned remaster</a>.</p>

The feature will be gradually released to other regions outside of the US, starting with Japan and select countries in Europe, then the rest of the world.</p>

The change isn't happening in a vacuum. Unity is also raising prices on Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise subscriptions, and according to CEO Matthew Bromberg, it's part of a plan to "become a fundamentally different company."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's a bold statement for the chief executive of a publicly-traded firm to make. But given what the organization has been through, it may be warranted. Unity has spent the last two years </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-is-cutting-1-800-jobs-in-the-name-of-profitable-growth-">laying off employees</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-pro-and-enterprise-plans-are-going-up-in-price">raising prices</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and implementing policies like the Runtime Fee, all to the chagrin of developers, some of whom have claimed it's fallen behind on maintaining the quality of the engine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an interview with Game Developer, Bromberg pitched a vision of the company that doesn't rely on moves like those to boost profitability, saying that Unity's goal going forward is to "have its head on straight," and be a better partner to help developers make great games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unity is once again, promising to be better at listening">Unity is once again, promising to be better at listening</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The last two years of speedbumps for Unity (which included that time former CEO John Riccitiello said some developers are '</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-is-sorry-for-calling-devs-fucking-idiots-regrets-using-crude-language">fucking idiots</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">') were often followed by company executives telling customers the company wasn't </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-exec-admits-company-wasn-t-listening-enough-to-devs-over-runtime-fee">listening</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> enough to game developers. Bromberg deployed a version of that line in that conversation, saying the company needs to "be better at listening" in the future.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-is-killing-its-controversial-runtime-fee" target="_self">Exclusive: Unity is killing its controversial Runtime Fee</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Runtime Fee reversal is an outcome of that process, he said. He apparently spent his first 100 days at the company speaking with Unity customers, which include the popular Unity game engine and its affiliated marketing and monetization platforms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When pressed about feedback from employees, many of whom reportedly raised concerns internally about the impact of the Runtime Fee and how it could hurt Unity users, Bromberg said the same listening process has been taking place inside the company. He said this decision followed a cross-functional group of employees weighing in on where the company should go.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He also acknowledged ongoing concerns about Unity's stability and tech debt, a growing concern among developers frustrated by Unity's rising prices while still experiencing quality-of-life issues with the engine. He said a key goal for Unity is to make a "stable, well-performing" product that will make the company a better "partner" for developers who use it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some, like Godot cofounder Juan Linietsky, have pointed out to Game Developer that Unity's IPO-driven acquisition spree saddled the company with new tools it would be responsible for maintaining for high-value customers. Bromberg said Unity has also been looking at that challenge, and referred to its decision to to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-is-eliminating-265-jobs-and-terminating-weta-fx-partnership">end its partnership with Weta FX</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as one example of how it can ease the technical load it had taken on (here, with the cost of 265 jobs).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There is progress we can make on integrating some of the capabilities those acquisitions provided into our core flow of game building," Bromberg said. For now, there will be a renewed focus on improving and maintaining Unity 6 as a reliable game development tool.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unity's shift is also about &quot;getting back to where it began&quot;">Unity's shift is also about "getting back to where it began"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bromberg's description of Unity's future seemed far afield from Riccitiello's promise of making the best "Real-time 3D" (often shortened to RT3D) engine for companies across the world, which implied a future where Unity would be extensively used outside the world of game development. He repeatedly referred to his past experience as a game developer, and painted a picture of the company working closely with developers to give them the tools they needed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity will be doing so with stronger competition. Tools like open-source game engine Godot have become more popular with developers in the last year, with Godot in particular </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.godotes.com/issue-51-almost-there/">biting at Unity's heels</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as a leading engine used in game jams.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's unclear what, if anything, Unity will be directly adapting from developers' increased enthusiasm for Godot. Bromberg did say he doesn't take developers' trust for granted, and that the company "wants to get better" to retain that trust.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want everyone to want to use Unity," he said, also acknowledging that the company is in a competitive market and it will need to labor under pressure from competitors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Addressing concerns investors may have about the company not having revenue from Runtime Fee-generated revenue in the future, Bromberg said the "simple, predictable pricing" the company has laid out will provide "more than enough growth" for the company with its pricing model.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity's previous far-reaching promises of game engine growth previously extended all the way to the US government, with the company signing some contracts with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-signs-multi-million-dollar-contract-to-help-u-s-government-with-defense">technology firms</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and companies like Lockheed Martin, BAH to provide support for the United States defense projects. Developers concerned their use of the engine could in some way support weapons manufacturing or wartime software development have maintained criticism of Unity for making these agreements, largely to little avail.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bromberg held firm on said contracts. "My view in general is that it is not inappropriate for American companies to have business with the American government," he said. Developers might raise their eyebrows at how that comment goes further than the Department of Defense.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The U.S. government aside, Bromberg's pitch seemed squarely aimed at Unity's original customers: the game development community. He and his peers will have a chance to make that pitch next week at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://unity.com/events/unite">Unite 2024 in Barcelona</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where he said he sees a chance to "take a breath, clear the decks, and reconnect" with customers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After two years of conversations with Unity executives, there was another interesting shift in Bromberg's rhetoric worth noting. Previously, Unity execs Marc Whitten and Jim Rearden referred to Unity users as "creators," alluding to a wide range of customers that went beyond game developers. The phrase seemed to align with Riccitiello's established vision of Unity as an "RT3D" tool versus its role as a game development tool.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bromberg didn't use that phrase, going instead back to "developers" and "customers," more generic terms describing those who use Unity. It also doesn't appear in Unity's blog announcing the Runtime Fee reversal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The absence of the term may mean nothing, but it may be one sign Unity is re-narrowing its vision to first and foremost, serve a business focused on making games, not generalized 3D software.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If developers report a better relationship with Unity in the months and years ahead, it will certainly be a sign that Bromberg's strategy is working. The challenge will be—as it long has been—to ensure that strategy us profitable and sustainable for the company, so that sustainability can be a strong foundation for the game development community.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Update: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">This story has been updated to clarify Unity's contractual relationships with the United States Government.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

		<p>The theme parks of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/10/planet-coaster-console-edition-review-ps5-ps4-xbox-one-series-x/">Planet Coaster</a> are ones of pure joy. Here, during our very first hands on with the sequel, the vibes were immaculate, and it’s heartening to find that at least in this crucial way, nothing much has changed. That’s it though, as Frontier are ascribing to the bigger, better, wackier and wetter school of sequel-building, pushing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a> straight to the top of our park-building wish list.</p>
<p><iframe title="Planet Coaster 2 | Gamescom Water Flume Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L_y0yRk00YI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>Planet Coaster 2, much like its predecessor, aims to capture the wonderful world of the theme park. Rich Newbold, Game Director sets out, “We wanted to build on the amazing foundations of the first game, allowing players a place to build those amazing dream theme parks and water parks and combine them with the amazing coasters.”</p>
<p>It’s water parks that are the watchword here, and through our hands-on time we focused on the key addition of lots of water-based fun and frivolity. That means lots of pools, lots of waterslides and, somewhat unsurprisingly, lots of changing rooms too. The team had to step in early on to point me in the right direction when all of my theme park visitors were standing aimlessly at the ladder to a particularly tall flume – “They need somewhere to change!” they explained. Once I’d found and placed the relevant building things swiftly became right with the world as my digital visitors could now slip into something a little less concealing, and immediately leap into the nearest pool. Here, a half-naked customer is a happy customer.</p>


<p>Richard says, “We wanted to add that great experience of going to a water park into the game. All of those amazing fun days that the team have had, or people in the community, of going to a water park, and experiencing all those things that water parks have: those big swimming pools with wave machines and jets (which you can build in Planet Coaster 2), the lazy rivers and all the amazing different types of flumes, and all the special pieces that you have on the flumes, have been inspired by the amazing days we’ve had.”</p>
<p>You can customise your rides and features more than ever before here, right down to the individual components of different buildings. If you want to remove a balustrade from a building, or just take the whole roof off, you can, and that’s before you alter the colour of every component or swap out the statue on the top.</p>
<p>Just as with the original, the controls and building tools are straightforward and welcoming for both newcomers and younger players, but if you want to be particular, there’s untold levels of depth to help you craft a park that looks truly incredible. There’s been key improvements to the path tools, with more options to dig deeper into both your control over and the laying of those crucial pathways, ensuring that your visitors can get where they need to, but also that it looks exactly how you envisioned it as well.</p>

<p>Planet Coaster 2 looks simply lovely, and the addition of water-based rides and scenery just pushes things even further. The water sloshing around in each of the pools and pouring out of the flumes looks so inviting that at times you might wish you were actually able to visit the park you’ve created. It’s unequivocally bright, colourful, and characterful, with each of the visitors and the other characters you encounter, captured in the chunky, distinctive style that Frontier have honed over the years.</p>
<p>Structurally, there’s a lot here that’s shared with the original game, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/22/planet-zoo-review/">Planet Zoo</a> as well, with the central campaign taking you through a series of different park scenarios and having you solve a specific set of problems. Our playthrough saw our somewhat hapless colleague caught up in some kind of park-based hazing, with a rival park owner hiring our services in an attempt to show us up. Obviously, we didn’t let that stand, but it was nice to see the light humour still running through the campaign, and providing something a little bit different amongst all of the park building.</p>
<p>And there’s <em>so much</em> park building to do. Outside of the central campaign, there’s the sandbox mode, which is likely where the most dedicated fans will spend most of their time, utilising the never-ending funds they have on tap to make something spectacular and without constraints. We only had a short couple of hours to get our park started, but I was undeniably happy with what I’d been able to make in that space of time.</p>

<p>There’s a bunch of new themes and landscape options, and the Resort and Mythology options let you turn your park into a mini-Olympus (with water slides), or simply your dream vision of a spectacular waterpark. Whichever you choose, Planet Coaster 2 gives you the tools to make it one of a kind.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to get into the nitty-gritty, Planet Coaster 2’s Blueprints mean that you’ve immediately got access to a fantastic set of pre-made rides – many of which have come from the community – so you can still create a sprawling park oasis, but in record time. Richard told us, “There’s those people who really want to get down to the detail, and there’s tools there for that, but the Blueprints are there for people to very quickly get their theme park up and running. But, if you want to, you might want to customise those Blueprints, so they might also be a great first step for people to make a good theme park.”</p>
<p>It’s clear that Planet Coaster 2 comes from a place of love, and Senior Producer Adam Woods picks up on that. “We’re massive theme park fans, and we knew what we wanted to add to the second game, as well as listening to the community. A big shout out to the team, because I think you can see the passion, the enthusiasm, the expertise that comes out in the game, because we’re theme park fans.”</p>

<p>Everything here supports that idea. You just can’t come away from Planet Coaster without a massive grin on your face, humming the cheerful tunes that accompany your park building, while dreaming of your next step on the way to park-building nirvana. You might as well prepare now, as Planet Coaster 2 is going to provide the park-building ride of your life. No judgement if it turns out to be the lazy river.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-2-13-releases-on-pc-adding-amd-fidelityfx-super-resolution-3-support/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Patch 2.13 for Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty is officially being rolled out on PC, adding support for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 with Frame Generation. The official Cyberpunk website has the<a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/50818/patch-2-13" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> full list of changes being made</a>, and it will most likely affect those who use mods for their game. This happens in any game, where <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-optimized-path-tracing-mod-40-performance-improvement/">mods</a> typically end up broken from an update. However, since this update is focused on adding support for AMD FidelityFX as well as Intel Xe Super Sampling, it feels like it'd be unlikely to disturb any mods.</p>
<p>For those who want to know more about how AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 impacts your game, they have made an article that explains it all. In short, it combines image upscaling with frame generation technology so that you can have the smoothest possible gaming experience by generating high-resolution frames at fast frame rates. This option can be enabled or disabled depending on whether you feel your game could benefit from the technology. There is additionally a separate setting to enable FSR Frame Generation.</p>
<p>To be able to use FSR Frame Generation in game, you have to have AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 upscaling enabled. CD Projekt Red has decided to keep support for both FSR 2.1 and FSR 3 so that players have as much flexibility as possible when it comes to choosing the visual quality and performance for their gaming session. The website states, "this allows them to experiment and find what fits their gaming style best."</p>
<p>While AMD FSR 3 is compatible with&nbsp;<span>many different GPUs, other system requirements must be met for it to be able to be utilized. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/technologies/fidelityfx/super-resolution.html#tabs-c1d1ec273c-item-683977caaa-tab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD website</a> has a list of all GPUs that are compatible with it, so you can check whether your rig will be able to utilize the technology</span>.</p>
<p>To get the most out of AMD's FSR 3 capabilities in Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty, it's recommended that the game run at a baseline of 60 FPS. Lower frame rates make visual artifacts more prominent and can cause frame pacing issues if you enable them.</p>
<p>To have the most visually stunning experience, CD Projekt Red also recommends playing on a higher refresh rate monitor (120 Hz and above), as using a lower refresh rate monitor can lead to frame time issues.</p>
<p>If using this technology is something that you want to pursue, making sure your GPU drivers are up to date is imperative. Below are the versions you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD: 32.0.11037.4004</li>
<li>NVIDIA: 556.12</li>
<li>Intel: 32.0.101.5972</li>
</ul>

Now, “The Flappy Bird Foundation Group” will relaunch the game on Android and iOS in 2025.</p><p>But it’s unclear whether the original creator of <em>Flappy Bird</em>, Dong Nguyen, is a part of the game’s relaunch. <em>The Verge</em> reached out to Nguyen with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back. His account on X and the website for his game development company don’t show any recent updates. The Flappy Bird Foundation said it acquired the rights to the game from Gametech, LLC, which isn’t associated with Nguyen.</p><p>Following <em>Flappy Bird</em>’s sudden shutdown in 2014, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5401552/the-weird-world-of-flappy-bird-clones">clones started flooding app stores</a> while companies attempted to snap up its trademark. Even though <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/flappy-bird-creator-bringing-game-back-this-summer-76325/">Ngyuen expressed interest</a> in relaunching the game at the time, Apple’s App Store rules may have prevented him from doing so. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/create-an-app-record/remove-an-app/#:~:text=Removed%20apps%20can%20only%20be,ID%20can't%20be%20reused.">Under the rules</a>, developers lose ownership of an app’s name when they remove it, and they can’t relaunch it under the same name if another developer is using it.</p><p>Still, as someone who was a big <em>Flappy Bird</em> player back in 2013, I’d love to see the game brought back to life.</p><p>While the new game will feature the original <em>Flappy Bird </em>character, future updates will introduce new game modes, characters, and “massive multiplayer challenges.” The <a href="https://flappybird.org/">new <em>Flappy Bird</em> website</a> shows what we might expect, with a new “rivals” mode where you can challenge 99 other players and another that has you shooting birds through basketball hoops. There are some new characters as well, like “Peng” the penguin, and the rainbow mohawk-sporting “Quirky.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
