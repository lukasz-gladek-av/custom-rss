			<p>Black Myth: Wukong was the success story of August in the games industry; that much is certain.&nbsp;<span>The debut title from Chinese developer Game Science&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-sells-a-whopping-10-million-copies-in-just-three-days-surpassing-industry-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> 10 million copies in three days and crushed Cyberpunk 2077's record for the highest player concurrency on Steam registered by a single player game.</span>&nbsp;CD PROJEKT's game reached 1.05 million concurrent players at its height, while Black Myth: Wukong, no doubt thanks to the massive Chinese community, has peaked at 2.41 million players, ranking second in the all-time peak concurrency Steam chart only behind PUBG: Battlegrounds.</p>
<p>The game was launched on PC and PlayStation 5, but not Xbox. At Summer Game Fest 2024, when Game Science opened pre-orders, the developer also <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delays-xbox-series-sx-version-opens-pre-orders-on-pc-ps5-shares-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a delay for the Xbox Series S|X version. Early on, there were whispers of a potential timed console exclusivity deal signed by Sony, although Microsoft did not <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-comments-on-xbox-black-myth-wukong-delays-doesnt-want-to-comment-on-possible-exclusivity-deals-from-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comment</a> on that rumor. However, last week, several insiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-memory-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that the real reason was a technical one, specifically a memory leak issue.</p>
<p>Forbes was able to get a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/03/microsoft-confirms-black-myth-wukong-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-comments-on-exclusivity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> from a Microsoft spokesperson, who denied there were any such issues that they were aware of.</p>
<p><em>As we have said before, we’re excited for the launch of Black Myth: Wukong on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms. We'd prefer not to comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders but we can confirm that the delay is not due to Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us.</em></p>
<p>The situation remains confusing, to say the least. Is there a soft exclusivity deal for a set period of time? It's hard to say at this point. However, Black Myth: Wukong still has no release window for Xbox. Meanwhile, a rumor from earlier this week <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hints</a> there could be two DLCs for the game before the inevitable sequel goes into production.</p>

			<p>KONAMI is publishing a new game called Deliver At All Costs. A top-down action title developed by Far Out Games, a small indie studio started a few years ago in Gothenburg, Sweden, by three students, Deliver At All Costs is set in 1959 and sees players step into the shoes of Winston Green, a courier transporting 'unconventional cargo'. Here's the official overview provided by the developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plow through the city across highly destructible environments, wreaking havoc in a wide variety of vehicles. Take on bizarre deliveries and missions each with its own unique play style and mechanic. From delivering a giant flailing Marlin to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion, always expect the unexpected.</li>
<li>Explore an intricately designed world with large semi-open environments both on foot and in your vehicle. Be careful not to upset the citizens, though - they will respond to your actions in the most unpredictable ways…</li>
<li>Amidst the chaos and destruction, embark on a story of mystery and intrigue divided into three acts, with a cast of distinct and memorable characters. Witness Winston’s journey as he spirals downward into the depths of insanity.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the 1950s with aesthetics and evocative music paying homage to the classic era. Featuring 1950s design elements, an original soundtrack, radio ads, English voice acting and a UI fitting of the times - all capturing the essence of what made the 1950s iconic.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-casting-of-frank-stone-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Developer Supermassive Games once dared us to survive until dawn, now the interactive slasher movie specialist wants us to be dead by daylight in The Casting of Frank Stone. This story-based spin-off of the popular asymmetric multiplayer sneak-and-slash ‘em up attempts to flesh out a backstory for the malevolent source of all evil in the Dead by Daylight universe, known as The Entity. However, aging, quicktime event-heavy gameplay, dismally superficial combat, an underdeveloped cast of characters, and a complete absence of scares make for a six-hour slog that’s barely worth staying up past your bedtime for.   </p><p>While Dead by Daylight’s character roster has swelled to include a who’s who of nightmare-haunting horror icons like Leatherface from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and even walking internet memes like Nicholas Cage, The Casting of Frank Stone features an entirely original cast of villains and potential victims. This is very much to its detriment, since barely any of them leave much in the way of a lasting impression. Main monster Frank Stone (Miles Ley) certainly strikes an imposing figure in the story’s prologue, but he’s nowhere to be found for significant stretches after that. Instead, we’re saddled with a truly unremarkable cast in a tepid tale that pinballs back and forth between the filming of a low budget horror movie in an abandoned Cedar Rapids steel mill in 1980, and a clandestine meeting of strangers in an isolated English manor in the present day. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Casting of Frank Stone Review Screens</h3></div></output><p>In both time periods, the plot takes a surprisingly long time to travel short distances, with only small amounts of horror and very little stress to be found amidst meandering conversations between the playable cast of eight characters. With the exception of the likeable Linda (Lucy Griffiths), whose dry sarcasm provides some welcome laughs on occasion and who is thankfully present in both eras, the rest of the leads are saddled with dialogue that’s often clunkier than a piano solo from Freddie Krueger, and forced into relationship contrivances that aren’t given enough time to evolve. In particular, the love triangle between teenagers Jaime (Andrew Wheildon-Dennis), Chris (Rebecca LaChance), and Robert (Idris Debrand) feels rushed and leaves little space for any believable tension to develop between them, which meant that I never really agonised over steering any particular character into the arms of another with my choices.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I barely batted an eyelid while each leading man was turned into a bleeding man.</p></div><p>In fact, so little did I invest in the fates of these partially-formed players that I barely batted an eyelid while each leading man was turned into a bleeding man as the bodycount built up in the story’s second half. It’s here that the Entity’s cosmic power is properly unleashed in both the present and the past, and although there were admittedly some interesting revelations to be uncovered about this malevolent creature and how its evil is pulling Frank Stone’s strings, it all gets pockmarked by a muddled mix of confusing multiversal wormholes and glaring plot holes. All told, this sloppy and scare-less horror story feels less like a mandatory bit of backstory for fans and more like one long, unnecessary and unskippable cutscene to lead into any given Dead by Daylight multiplayer match.   </p><h2>Bad Manors</h2><p>While it may be messy and not the slightest bit memorable, The Casting of Frank Stone’s story certainly has a lot of branching paths, and so too does its environments. Unfortunately, while the dingy, subterranean tunnels beneath the Cedar Rapids steel mill and the gloomy, gilded hallways of Gerant Manor certainly ooze plenty of atmosphere, they just aren’t all that interesting or intimidating to explore. What’s worse, they’re reused far too much – over and over again I found myself plodding past the same bits of scenery like I was a member of Spinal Tap desperately searching for the stage entrance. I spent the vast majority of my time tapping through basic button prompts in cutscenes, so it felt especially limiting that when I was occasionally given full control of a character I was so rarely given anything interesting to see or do. </p><p>There are some simple survival horror puzzles to complete like pushing crates or finding keys and, in one of a number of nods to the core Dead by Daylight experience, you do get faced with the occasional generator in need of repair in order to power up a lift or door. However, whereas the process of fixing these straightforward mechanisms in Dead by Daylight is transformed into fits of heart-pounding panic since you’ve got a murderous Michael Myers from Halloween homing in on your position, here the absence of any stalking threat means they’re robbed of any real urgency and are instead just more basic quicktime events to be obediently ticked off. It’s neat that they’ve incorporated the Dead by Daylight skill check prompt here, but it does little to enhance the actual interactions in any meaningful way.</p><p>While I never struggled to repair its generators, I wish someone had taken the time to fix The Casting of Frank Stone’s inability to generate scares. Outside of life or death cutscene-based decisions, the rare enemy encounters are otherwise trivialised by a powerful weaponised camera that transforms from Super 8 to supernatural. There’s only ever one Entity-powered Frank Stone specter to face off against at a time, and all you need to do is train the camera’s viewfinder on them and hit record to sap them of all their life force. Their presence is always clearly signposted, and as a result they never got the drop on me nor did they ever get remotely close enough to pose any form of threat – I’m not sure if they’re even able to perform any attacks since they effectively stayed at a comfortable wide shot in my viewfinder; never a killer close-up. Dead by Daylight might be capable of some truly terrifying stalker escapes, but The Casting of Frank Stone is about as stressful as a spa bath in comparison.  </p><h2>Dead by Design</h2><p>Of course, since this is a Supermassive Games adventure, some of the characters can and likely will die. But in my experience of The Casting of Frank Stone, this was either because I was perfectly happy to let them go, or because I was having a sip of coffee and was too slow to reach for my controller during an unexpected and evidently majorly consequential cutscene junction. Roughly half of the cast of playable characters perished before I rolled credits, and although I was pleased to see that some of those executions were ripped straight out of Dead by Daylight – such as the piercing of a certain victim onto the sharp end of a dangling hook – I can’t say that any of these unmemorable meatsacks met their sudden deaths in any particularly inspired or shocking ways. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Once the campaign is completed, you unlock a Cutting Room Floor feature that allows you to trace each branching story path backwards and hop back into specific scenes, allowing you to pick up a story thread and twist it in a new direction by making a different decision and seeing how things play out. It’s a nice feature if you want to experience all possible outcomes, however I wish it was a little more flexible – in order to prevent one character death I was forced to replay six scenes in the lead up to the moment that decided their fate, rather than just hopping directly to that critical decision and going from there, which seemed annoyingly cumbersome. </p><p>Still, this branching chapter select is certainly handy if you want to go back and find any Dead by Daylight-inspired collectibles, with signature killers like The Trapper and The Clown shrunken down into adorable, Chuckie-sized plushies and hidden throughout each setting. This is in addition to numerous other nods to the multiplayer murder sim, like The Huntress’ rabbit mask I found on a shelf in Cedar Rapids’ curiosity shop. Dead by Daylight diehards will likely get a kick out of discovering all of these, but whether they make it worth playing (let alone replaying) a pretty forgettable horror story depends on how fiercely loyal your fandom may be. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Tristan's Favourite Horror Games</h3><p>Intensity in ten entries.</p></div></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>The Casting of Frank Stone’s repetitive, time-hopping horror tale is packed with dozens of character choices to consider, but really the most important decision that Dead by Daylight fans need to make is whether or not a sub-standard, six-hour story is worth sitting through purely to spot the odd recognisable weapon or slight reference to the source material’s lore. I would argue it’s not, since no single stretch of this sluggish and forgettable horror show ever comes close to matching the frantic amounts of fun to be had in a single, 15-minute Dead by Daylight trial. Unable to match the intensity of its murderous multiplayer inspiration and lagging well behind Until Dawn and The Quarry as a standalone story, The Casting of Frank Stone is a second-rate interactive slasher that just can’t hack it. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Though both handhelds are FPGA devices that will accurately replicate the performance of games on original hardware, they have different design philosophies. The Chromatic is dedicated to making you feel like you're playing your childhood Game Boy or Game Boy Color, while the Pocket takes a broader approach.</p><p>For example, the Chromatic's goal is to mimic the pixel structure and color accuracy of the GBC. It has a 2.6-inch screen has 160 x 144p resolution--the same specs as the Game Boy Color. But no need to feel bad for your eyes, as you will actually be able to see what's happening in your game without needing perfect lighting conditions or an accessory that unevenly illuminates your Game Boy. The Chromatic has a backlit IPS screen made of scratch-resistant, anti-glare glass.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Analogue Pocket has a 3.5-inch glass display with 1600 x 1440p resolution and 615 pixels per inch. It makes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/analogue-pocket-review-the-best-way-to-play-game-boy-games/1100-6498917/" data-ref-id="1100-6498917">Game Boy, GBC, and GBA games look absolutely stunning</a> with Analogue's custom pixel perfect filter. You can change the filter to mimic specific Game Boy models, from the chunky DMG to GBC to the backlit GBA SP and more.</p><p>The Chromatic is strictly for Game Boy and GBC games, whereas the Pocket supports GB, GBC, <em>and</em> GBA out of the box, and adapters are sold separately for Game Gear, Atari Lynx, TurboGrafx-16, and Neo Geo Pocket Color carts. FPGA cores can be added via microSD, so you can play other platforms as well with a bit of tinkering. As a result of wider platform support, the Pocket has four face buttons and two triggers, whereas the Chromatic can get by with two face buttons and a D-pad.</p><p>Though we haven't had a chance to try the Chromatic, the build materials for the shell and buttons sound promising. Its buttons are made of PBT, a durable thermoplastic used for keycaps on high-end mechanical keyboards. The shell is made of magnesium alloy and shaped just like the original DMG Game Boy. Even the start and select buttons mirror the diagonal design of the Game Boy. ModRetro claims the case is "virtually indestructible," which could inspire some creative drop tests.</p><p>One pretty darn cool thing about the Chromatic is its battery versatility. It comes with three AA batteries and runs for 24 hours before you need to replace them. Rechargeable AA batteries are supported, too, and you can charge them via USB-C. If you don't want to deal with regular batteries of any kind, you'll also find a rechargeable lithium ion battery pack in the box.</p><p>Other notable features include video out for capturing gameplay on your PC, a link cable port for multiplayer, 3.5mm audio jack, and an IR sensor, which is used for select multiplayer features like receiving Mystery Gifts in Pokemon Gold and Silver. All multiplayer features are backwards compatible with original hardware.</p><p><strong>ModRetro Chromatic specifications</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Price</strong> - $199 for first edition bundle with Tetris cart</li><li><strong>Compatibility</strong> - Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Chromatic cartridges</li><li><strong>Display</strong> - Backlit 2.56-inch IPS LCD (sapphire crystal glass)</li><li><strong>Resolution</strong> - 160 x 144p</li><li><strong>Size</strong> - 5.2 x 3 x 1.2-inch, 6.2oz</li><li><strong>Shell</strong> - Magnesium alloy thixomolded shell</li><li><strong>Buttons</strong> - PBT face buttons and D-pad</li><li><strong>Battery</strong> - 24 hours with 3 AA batteries, lithium ion rechargeable battery pack</li><li><strong>Audio</strong> - internal speaker, 3.5mm headphones</li><li><strong>Ports</strong> - link cable, 3.5mm audio, USB-C with video out</li><li><strong>Multiplayer</strong> - via backwards compatible link cable, IR sensor</li><li><strong>Colors</strong> - Gray (GameStop exclusive) | Six other colors available at ModRetro</li></ul></div>                      </div><p>If you don't have a Game Boy library, more <a href="https://modretro.com/collections/games" rel="nofollow ">Chromatic carts are available to purchase separately</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2-campaign-length-explained.971382/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-campaign-length/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>While a single-player campaign certainly isn’t the focal point for a horde shooter, especially when it includes PvE and PvP game modes, it’s nice knowing you’ll get your money’s worth on all fronts. That said, here’s what we know about the Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 campaign length!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-the-single-player-campaign-in-space-marine-2">How Long is the Single-Player Campaign in Space Marine 2?</h2>



<p>You certainly shouldn’t expect a massive campaign of epic proportions, but it’s a comfortable size for a weekend romp. It takes approximately<strong> 8-10 hours to finish the campaign</strong> in Space Marine 2 on standard difficulty settings. If you lower the difficulty, it may take less time. If you increase the difficulty, expect up to 12 or so hours to finish the story mode.</p>



<p>Furthermore, as you can play through the campaign cooperatively, having a human partner by your side instead of the AI should help you finish the main missions a little quicker.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-pve-missions-does-space-marine-2-include">How Many PvE Missions Does Space Marine 2 Include?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can expect approximately five to six PvE missions on launch, with more to come in the future, as per the studio’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">year one roadmap</a>. Like in World War Z, PvE missions will likely be highly replayable in Space Marine 2. As you’ll want to unlock much of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-customization-details-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s cosmetics</a>, including weapons and armor skins, you’ll likely play through each mission repeatedly to score points or currency necessary to unlock equipment. That’s how things worked in World War Z.</p>



<p>Of course, alongside the campaign and PvE missions, there’s also the PvP game mode, which will extend the lifespan of the third-person action game for many. If PvP isn’t your thing, there’s nothing wrong with moving on to another game while waiting for more PvE missions to release!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-nintendo-switch-chargers-to-power-your-console.971343/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-charger<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The Nintendo Switch is the most popular console out there. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-switch-2-waiting-in-the-wings-nintendo-believes-the-og-switch-has-plenty-of-sales-left-in-it">Over 140 million units have been sold</a> to date worldwide, and the system is still pushing forward despite its age. With such a big presence in the market, there are naturally thousands of options to choose from when it comes to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-accessories">Switch accessories</a>. That is especially true for chargers, as you cannot use your Nintendo Switch without one!</p><p>Whether you've just recently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-times-to-buy-a-nintendo-switch">bought a Nintendo Switch</a> or recently lost the charger it came with, we've got you covered on which chargers are actually worth picking up. Whether you're constantly on the road or searching for something to use at home, check out our top picks for the best Nintendo Switch chargers below.</p><p id="best-overall"><h2 data-toc-title="Best Overall">1. Anker 67W USB-C Wall Charger</h2></p><h3>Best Overall Charger for Nintendo Switch</h3><div id="206651" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Anker 67W USB C Wall Charger</h3></p></div><p>The Anker 67W USB-C Wall Charger is our pick for the best overall Nintendo Switch charger. At 67W, this charger is capable of charging your Switch in both handheld and docked mode. You can use this with either mode, which isn't the case for other chargers on this list outside of the official Nintendo Switch AC Adapter. </p><p>A big benefit of the 67W is this charger's use beyond the Switch console. You can use this to charge an iPhone, MacBook, laptop, and more. This can be a life saver when traveling, as you'll only need one charger block. It's worth mentioning that you will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-usb-c-chargers-2024">need a USB-C cable</a> with this charger, as Anker does not provide one. </p><p id="best-official-charger"><h2 data-toc-title="Best Official Charger">2. Nintendo Switch AC Adapter</h2></p><h3>Best Official Charger for Nintendo Switch</h3><div id="206520" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Nintendo Switch AC Adapter</h3></p><div><p>You can't go wrong with old reliable.</p></div></div>The Nintendo Switch AC Adapter is by far the best official charger for Nintendo Switch. This is the same exact charger that's bundled in with every Switch system, so it's easy to order a replacement if needed. Outputting at 39W, the Nintendo Switch AC Adapter connects to any 120V outlet with no issues.<p>Since the charger is made specifically for Nintendo Switch, you will never have to wonder or worry about a potential compatibility mismatch. Sometimes, using a third-party charger can hurt your charging port, or even brick your system if you aren't careful. Staying official when it comes to chargers is always recommended, with the exception of reputable and reliable third party brands like the ones we've listed here.</p><p id="best-portable-charger"><h2 data-toc-title="Best Portable Charger">3. Emperor of Gadgets Portable Power Bank</h2></p><h3>Best Portable Charger for Nintendo Switch</h3><div id="195733" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Emperor of Gadgets Portable Power Bank</h3></p><div><p>Top off your Switch with a 10,000mAh portable battery that straps onto it while offering a built-in USB-C and additional ports to charge other devices. </p></div></div>As outlined in our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-portable-charger">best portable chargers</a>, the Emperor of Gadgets Portable Power Bank is the best portable charger for Nintendo Switch. This device has the ability to directly clip on to the back of your system, so there's never any worry of a dangling cable tied to a power bank. While it adds some noticeable weight, the power bank is nowhere heavy enough to make long playing sessions uncomfortable.<p>The Emperor of Gadgets Portable Power Bank features a 10,000mAh capacity with an output of 15W, which is perfect for charging your Nintendo Switch while in use or in rest mode. Based on the Nintendo Switch power draw, you should be able to get around 10 extra hours of playtime depending on the game, which is a significant increase from the built-in Switch battery.</p><p id="best-battery-case"><h2 data-toc-title="Best Battery Case">4. Newdery External Battery Station</h2></p><h3>Best Battery Case for Nintendo Switch</h3><div id="181248" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>NEWDERY External Battery Station</h3></p><div><p>This case has an integrated 10,000mAh battery to keep the Switch topped up without interfering with your gameplay. </p></div></div>The Newdery External Battery Station is our pick for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-battery-case">best battery case for Nintendo Switch</a>. This case provides a 10,000mAh battery in addition to the Switch's built-in battery, allowing for up to eight hours of additional playtime in handheld mode. If you're someone who exclusively plays in handheld mode or likes to travel, this can be an absolute game changer, especially when you're in the middle of an RPG like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-2-review">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a> or <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.<p>Beyond battery life, the Newdery External Battery Station is simply comfortable to hold. The grip behind the Joy-Cons is extended, allowing for all players to be comfortable during long play sessions. Additionally, the case features a built-in kickstand, which reveals a compartment to store extra game cartridges on the go.</p><p id="best-car-charger"><h2 data-toc-title="Best Car Charger">5. PowerA Nintendo Switch Car Charger</h2></p><h3>Best Car Charger for Nintendo Switch</h3><div id="206591" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>PowerA Nintendo Switch Car Charger</h3></p></div>The PowerA Nintendo Switch Car Charger is the ultimate charger if you're ready to break out your system on the road. First, the cable itself is braided, which is essential for use in a car. Plastic cables are often easily broken through regular wear and tear, but braided cables will last twice as long usually. Additionally, this product is officially licensed by Nintendo, meaning that you can trust the charger without worry of overvolting or damaging your system.<p>This cable is 6 feet long, which should be plenty to reach in either the passenger seat or backseat even. The 5V connector will plug into any 5V adapter, which is present on almost every single car manufactured. Whether you need to charge the Nintendo Switch itself or a <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-pro-controller">Pro Controller</a>, the PowerA Nintendo Switch Car Charger is perfect for a speedy charge in the car.</p><h2>Nintendo Switch Charger FAQs</h2><h3>What type of charger works best for Switch?</h3><p>The regular and <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-oled-model">OLED Nintendo Switch model</a> draw <strong>a max of 18W of power at a time</strong>, while the Nintendo <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-switch-lite">Switch Lite</a> draws 13.5W. While this is the limit of the system in handheld mode, the official Nintendo Switch charger included with the system allows for up to 39W of power draw. This is largely used when the system is docked or charging controllers through the USB ports. </p><p>As a result, the Nintendo Switch is unable to draw more than the wattage outlined above. This means that even if you use a 65W charger or above, your Switch will not draw more than the 18W it needs to charge. </p><h3>Do Joy-Cons need a separate charger?</h3><p>Fortunately, the Switch Joy-Cons do not need any charger to charge. They will receive power from the Nintendo Switch itself, which is charged through the USB-C port. So, you only need to purchase one charger for both the <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-joy-cons">Joy-Con controllers</a> and Nintendo Switch.</p><p>It is important to note, though, that the Joy-Con can only be charged when attached to the side of the Nintendo Switch. These controllers do not have a USB-C port, therefore you cannot use a Switch charger to charge them. If you'd like to charge the Joy-Con when not attached to the Switch, you will need to purchase a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-gets-official-joy-con-charging-stand-over-7-years-after-launch">Joy-Con charging dock</a>.</p><p><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

                <p>Later this fall, BioWare and EA's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-4-given-official-name-dragon-age-dreadwolf/1100-6504067/" data-ref-id="1100-6504067">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> will finally give gamers a look at how the world of Thedas has changed in the decade since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review/1900-6416222/" data-ref-id="1900-6416222">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> took place. But if the latest extended gameplay preview is any indication, Thedas hasn't been changed for the better. However, the storytelling of the game itself appears to be more refined.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-watch-22-minutes-of-exclusive-gameplay-diving-into-exploration-and-more-ign-first" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, The Veilguard co-directors Corinne Busche and John Epler hosted a 22-minute gameplay video that takes place deep into the story. In this side quest, the player character, Rook, agrees to help his companion, Davrin, complete a personal mission of revenge. The directors also pick up two additional side quests to procure medical supplies for the Grey Wardens and to locate a few of their missing members. This was meant to illustrate that these missions are more organically placed in the story, rather than unrelated events.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGMMK2I30-o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xGMMK2I30-o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Additionally, the Crossroads is no longer a place of refuge thanks to the war between the game's antagonist, Solas, and the gods. Rook and his companions have to fight their way through the area before they arrive at Hossberg, an area that has been overrun by the Blight.</p><p>Thanks to the Blight, the Darkspawn enemies are much more formidable in this preview, and Rook even perishes at one point before getting revived. The directors noted that they are giving the companions more autonomy in their character arcs, as demonstrated by Davrin separating himself from the player's party to go on ahead to confront his nemesis, the Gloom Howler.</p><p>Among the other details, faction shops--including the Grey Warden's--can be upgraded to give the players more enticing rewards. The areas are also designed to be revisited after the missions, if gamers are interested in searching for hidden secrets and treasures. </p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on October 31.</p>

            <p>
Battletech, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadowrun">Shadowrun</a>, and The Lamplighters League developer Harebrained Schemes has announced its first project since parting ways with Paradox Interactive last year. It's a "post-cyberpunk survival horror RPG" called Graft and it's heading to PC.
</p>
<p>
Graft's story unfolds in the depths of a decaying continent-sized space station known as the Arc, home to forgotten technologies and unsettling wonders. Players must brave its horrors as they traverse "massive chasms, labyrinthine techno-catacombs, and self-replicating corridors", facing enemies in combat - including "ancient experiments, monstrous abominations, and relentless agents of a mad AI" - and Grafting as they go.
</p>
<p>
This is pretty much exactly what it sounds like, requiring players to scavenge body parts from fallen opponents and graft them onto themselves in order to alter their physical form, gaining new abilities and powers as they do. But Grafting a part also infuses players with its previous owner's memories, creating what Harebrained calls a "haunting interplay of survival, transformation, and self-discovery".

<p>
"Form alliances, build trust, and face the reality that anyone still living could be both an ally and a threat," teases the studio. "Your decisions will shape your journey and determine the fate of those you encounter...  Will you escape the Arc with your humanity intact, or become something else entirely?"
</p>
<p>
There's no hint of a release date for Graft, but Harebrained is currently aiming to launch it via the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/graft-c7e6c4">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3141390/GRAFT/">Steam</a>. It'll be the studio's first release since last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-lamplighters-league-review-rip-roaring-tactical-adventure-let-down-by-dreadful-real-time-stealth">flawed by entertaining</a> turn-based strategy game The Lamplighter's League, which publisher Paradox Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">later declared a $22m flop</a>.
</p>
<p>
That announcement was followed by the news Paradox was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-and-harebrained-schemes-parting-ways-following-the-lamplighters-league-flop">parting ways</a> with Harebrained Schemes - which it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-interactive-acquires-battletech-developer-harebrained-schemes">acquired back in 2018</a> following the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battletech">BattleTech</a> - with the publisher retaining the rights to The Lamplighters League, BattleTech, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/necropolis">Necropolis</a>, and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadowrun-trilogy">Shadowrun Trilogy</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-shows-that-the-triple-a-pivot-to-live-service-was-always-doomed.971319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-shutdown-offline-refund-ps5-pc-live-service<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Concord</em>, the latest game in Sony’s ongoing live service salvo, came out a week and a half ago. Already, the writing was on the wall. There was no buzz. It just didn’t have the juice. Still, nobody was prepared for what happened today: <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony announced</a> that it plans to pull the game from stores and offer refunds to anybody who bought it. <em>Concord </em>was smothered as it clambered out of the cradle – the ultimate object lesson in what happens when triple-A behemoths commit to live service for live service’s sake, despite the ever-increasing production demands of big-budget video games.</p><p><em>Concord </em>faltered for many reasons. Despite what the most irritatingly ill-informed people on the internet are saying, <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1831005817702670526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diversity didn’t do it in</a>. Instead, eight years ago the game set off down what would become an impossible path, iterating on hero shooter concepts that were in vogue at the time and arriving looking polished but <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/concord-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feeling rusty</a>. In the time since <em>Concord </em>began development, <em>Overwatch </em>rose and fell, the battle royale boom redefined multiplayer shooters and petered out, extraction shooters became a thing, and an endless procession of competitive shooter hopefuls crashed and burned while a small handful – <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> among them – carved out enduring fiefdoms.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Concord </em>entered a massively competitive playing field feeling dated on day one, having to justify itself not just against other shooters, but popular live service games in general, whose audiences only tend to rove <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-concord-failure-sony-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when their friends start sniffing at greener pastures</a>. This is why Sony’s plan to release 12 live service games by 2026 – which <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23954006/sony-playstation-live-service-games-marathon-last-of-us-factions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got cut in half late last year</a> – never made much sense. Live-service games do not automatically print money. On the contrary, between regular upkeep and constant streams of new content, they are hugely costly, as <a href="https://x.com/cecianasta/status/1831050133439758576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even titans like <em>Roblox </em>can attest</a>. Attracting an audience – especially with no immediately-apparent hook beyond triple-A production values – is hard, and keeping it is even harder. Perhaps Sony imagined one or two smash live-service hits would ultimately balance out the odd miss here or there, but at this scale – with so many careers on the line – that’s an unconscionably risky gamble.&nbsp;</p><p>This is hardly a problem exclusive to competitive live-service games. <em>Starfield</em>, which shared a similarly lengthy incubation period to <em>Concord</em>, launched last year feeling like it emerged from a time capsule. <em>Suicide Squad</em>, which attempted to satisfy lovers of both traditional narrative-driven games and live-service grind-a-thons, only succeeded in <a href="https://aftermath.site/suicide-squad-discourse-impressions-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letting everyone down</a>. Layoffs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently followed</a>. The latter found itself clinging to the wreckage of basically the same Titanic as <em>Concord</em>: Beyond triple-A production values, it couldn’t justify its own existence.&nbsp;</p><p>And yet, it’s little wonder why major video game publishers keep trying to squeeze blood from this particular stone. With triple-A games taking <a href="https://aftermath.site/big-budget-game-development-is-not-sustainable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more time, money, and manpower than ever to make</a>, they want the biggest, longest-lasting return on investment possible. But big publishers’ approach to live service is an unsustainable solution born of unsustainable development practices. The arms race to make bigger, longer games – with more <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-stealth-bugs-ubisoft-1851637931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impossibly-detailed hallways</a> that most players won’t even blink at – is a dead end. It has been all along. Papering over that with a business model that only <em>appears </em>to generate infinite revenue will not, in the overwhelming majority of cases, fix this fundamental problem. Most games in this mold will struggle to break even, and even the success stories will fall into <a href="https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-controversy-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the live-service death spiral</a>, a miasmatic pit of community toxicity that burns out developers and inspires reactive design decisions over anything truly inspired or forward thinking.</p><p>This is not to say that new live-service games cannot succeed; you just have to be creative about it in ways that big companies are loath to embrace. Most indies now launch ambitious, community-driven games in early access – <em>real </em>early access, where major features and chunks of content are missing, rather than money-grubbing “pre-order now!” early access that does not actually allow for feedback or substantial changes before release. Valve, which played a pioneering role in giving developers the tools to do this, is now taking cues from the scene it’s cultivated, stealth-dropping its own hero shooter, <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-deadlock-verge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Deadlock</em></a>, in earlier-than-early access and attracting a sizable player base in the process.&nbsp;</p><p>But this approach is antithetical to major publishers’ addictions to secrecy and long lead times, as well as endless marketing drip feeds and elaborate pre-order bundles. Moreover, it still doesn’t address the elephant in the room: Big-budget game development is not sustainable, nor does it serve an apparent need. Games don’t have to be enormous; most players only experience a fraction of them. Triple-A fidelity has become a fool’s errand; <a href="https://aftermath.site/call-duty-modern-warfare-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games from more than a decade ago</a> still look great now. Developers at envelope-pushing studios like <em>Spider-Man</em> developer Insomniac <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-hacked-files-tell-us-about-the-studio-behind-spide-1851115233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do not believe players notice</a> the fruits of billowing budgets -- at least, not enough to make the additional investment worthwhile.</p><p>It’s <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-want-shorter-games-with-worse-graphics-and-im-not-kidding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a cliche</a> to ask for shorter games with worse graphics, but I don’t think there’s any other <em>actual </em>solution to this problem. Triple-A games have become too costly, both in terms of money and a harder-to-measure though far more important human toll. As <em>Concord </em>and <a href="https://aftermath.site/bungie-layoffs-destiny" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other games like <em>Destiny 2</em></a> have shown us, live service is not a silver bullet. In fact, it can <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exacerbate these issues</a>. Every major release is now a potential catastrophe – a bomb waiting to go off, the fuse of which was lit the better part of a decade ago. The triple-A video game industry can’t go on like this. If it keeps blowing up its own foundations, it will destroy itself. Change is still possible, but as we’ve learned from <em>Concord</em>, it needed to happen yesterday. That’s no longer possible, so I guess we’ll have to settle for tomorrow.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://dragonquest.square-enix-games.com/games/en-us/dragon-quest-123-hd2d-remakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> has been in the works for quite some time, and it took a few years since its announcement to get a first proper look at the very first entry in a series of remakes that will allow players to experience the entirety of the Erdrick trilogy on modern gaming hardware. With the game right around the corner, Square Enix offered us a chance to try out the game during Gamescom in a short session that did not fail to show how the game is setting out to be among the best HD-2D games ever released.</p>
<p>The Gamescom 2024 demo threw players a few hours into the adventure into the town of Romaria, specifically in the Monster Arena, which has been overhauled for the remake to allow players to have a more active role in monster vs monster combat. Winning matches will provide the hero and his companions with some useful items, so I expect more than a few players will be spending quite a few hours here trying to get all the rewards.</p>
<p>Once I was done with my business at the Monster Arena, I had the chance to explore the town of Romaria, and speak with the king, who enlists the hero to recover his crown from the thieves that stole it. After accepting the task, I explored the town a little more, stocking on supplies, purchasing better weapons and gear for my party members, and appreciating the excellent recreation of the town in the HD-2D style. The game as a whole looked lively and positively vibrant, especially on the Nintendo Switch OLED, where the colors really looked incredible.</p>

<p>Despite having accepted the request of the king, I decided to wander around and see what else the Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake demo had to offer. I ended up exploring a few dungeons briefly in the surroundings of Romaria and fighting against a few enemies. The original game's turn-based combat system has been left virtually untouched, though now the characters appear on screen when choosing commands. Some welcome additions include the ability to speed up combat, which is sure to help the game's pacing considerably, though I found the encounter rate to be fair, for the most part, and the ability to set up tactics and change auto-battle settings, which should make random encounters even faster to complete. As one of my party members came with the new Monster Wrangler vocation, I was able to briefly try some of its abilities out, and it felt powerful enough. Difficulty, in general, was on the low side, but that was most likely caused by the leveled-up characters that were provided for the demo. The final game will feature multiple difficulty settings, so players will easily be able to tailor the general difficulty level to their skill level.</p>
<p>Having only played through Dragon Quest III years ago, I really can't say if there have been big changes to locations, treasure chest locations, and the like in the remake, but even so, it is undeniable that Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is likely going to set a new bar for faithful remakes of classic JRPGs. Thankfully, it won't take much longer to be able to delve deeper into the story of Ortega and his child, as the game launches in just a few months, on November 14th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch worldwide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-series-to-consume-more-power-than-40-series/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The upcoming NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 series, including the 5080 and others, is rumored to consume more power than the current 40 series, with up to a 33% increase in power consumption in some of the graphics cards. </p>



<p>It has been rumored for quite some time now that the GeForce RTX 50 series would consume more power, but a well-trusted leaker recently revealed on Twitter that the new graphics cards most definitely would require more energy to run.</p>



<h2 id="h-twitter-leaker-reveals-that-geforce-rtx-50-series-will-consume-more-power-than-40-series">Twitter Leaker Reveals That GeForce RTX 50 Series Will Consume More Power Than 40 Series</h2>



<p>The GeForce RTX 4080 and other cards in the 40 series already consume quite a bit of power when in use, meaning the 50 series will really be pushing the boundaries with power consumption.</p>



<p>This has already provided a bit of backlash amongst NVIDIA GeForce fans, as many wish for the company to work on efficiency over power consumption.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>“I know someone who got the details of GeForce of Blackwell recently,” said kopite7kimi, a Twitter leaker. “Both of them have some increase in power consumption, with higher SKUs.”</p>



<p>Then when a comment on his post said “I say 550W for 5090,” the leaker responded with “more.” This would mean more than a 100W increase from the 4090, which was at 450W. We are looking at some heavy increases in power usage for these new graphics cards.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-the-50-series-release">When Will The 50 Series Release?</h2>



<p>As of now, there is only a tiny bit of information out there regarding the NVIDIA GeForce 50 series. Despite the rumors that power consumption will be quite high, we do know that there is a possibility we will see the graphics cards showcased at CES 2025, next year.</p>



<p>For now, though, tech and gaming enthusiasts will have to wait for more additional details on the 50 series.</p>



<p>Stay tuned to Insider Gaming for more tech news.</p>

<section><p>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is a confident reminder that this 13-year-old cult classic still has life in an era of gaming that tends to take itself a bit too seriously.</p></section>

                <p>Shadows of the Damned is a game where protagonist Garcia Hotspur's gun is called the Boner, and he refers to vine-like blockades in the hell as "demon pubes." It's a game that confidently wears its video-game-y-ness on its purple leather studded sleeve, right next to Joy Division's lyrics "Love Will Tear Us Apart" painted in thick white paint. From demonic enemies whom burst with collectible diamonds after shooting their heads off, to bosses covered in big, obvious "please-shoot-here" weak points, Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered isn't just a reminder of its brash conviction in knowing its a video game or how un-seriously it takes itself, but a window into how far and <em>how little</em> video games have come since its original release in 2011.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with GameSpot at Gamescom 2024, producer and Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami said, "[Shadows of the Damned] is aware that it's a video game, and it's not trying to be something else. There's a lot of games these days that tend to take themselves a bit too seriously."</p>

<p dir="ltr">When considering the state of action-horror games of recent, like last year's Resident Evil 4 remake or Alan Wake 2, there's an attention to detail and believability that both games feature in their combat and graphics. Both games have lifelike movement that add a sense of weight to your actions, offering realistic feedback regardless of if you're getting a hatchet to the face or shooting a hole through an enemy's head. The graphical fidelity of both games creates believable worlds that closely mirror our own. Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered has similar traits to both Resident Evil 4 remake and Alan Wake 2--the over-the-shoulder perspective, fending off enemy monstrosities, and even some puzzle elements--but it accomplishes it with a brighter color palette, cartoonish animations, and a don't-give-a-shit attitude that evokes its own flavor of confidence.</p><p dir="ltr">Shadows of the Damned adapted many of those traits from the original Resident Evil 4, also produced by Mikami, but it actually has more in common with Alan Wake 2 in terms of combat design. Both Alan Wake 2 and Shadows of the Damned require cleansing its enemies of a darkness-like presence before being able to deal damage, as well as have a dedicated melee attack and a dodge button. The difference is that Shadows of the Damned isn't mirroring a world we currently live in--instead, it's a colorful and vibrant hellscape, where you're drinking sake to heal yourself and feeding strawberries to demon babies to unlock doors.</p><blockquote data-size="large"><p>A lot of games, especially now with the specs available, they go for this sort of hyper-reality. We don't really care about hyper-reality.</p><cite>Goichi "Suda51" Suda</cite></blockquote><p dir="ltr">It was through this lens that it first occurred to me how little has actually changed in the action-horror genre in terms of combat over the last 13 years--an entertaining notion given how often some players regard the standard game-design practices from that era as "arcade-y."</p><p dir="ltr">"I feel that 13 years ago, when we were making the original [Shadows of the Damned], there were a lot of things in game development that were kind of just a given at the time," Mikimi-san explained. "'This is how you make games, this is what games are supposed to be like.' A lot of things have changed since then. There's a lot of stuff in Shadows of the Damned that's a lot more casual and comical, and it's just easy to enjoy without trying to take the game too seriously, or without the game taking itself too seriously as well. So hopefully that's something that'll resonate with modern-day players as something that isn't maybe seen as much as it used to be, because back in the day, that's just how video games were."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4361179-damned_screenshot_19_068eadd5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4361179" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4361179-damned_screenshot_19_068eadd5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4361179"></a><figcaption>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4361179-damned_screenshot_19_068eadd5.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Writer of Shadows of the Damned and founder of developer Grasshopper Manufacture Goichi "Suda51" Suda weighed in on the current state of realism in games today, saying, "I feel that a lot of games these days try really hard to go for a sense of reality. A lot of games, especially now with the specs available, they go for this sort of hyper-reality. We don't really care about hyper-reality."</p><p dir="ltr">For Grasshopper Manufacture, its philosophy is to present the game in "the most expressive way possible," according to Suda.</p><p dir="ltr">While Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is getting a 4K overhaul to its resolution, it's hard to distinguish the game's visuals from its original 2011, and it's better off for it. The game's reliance on bright colors and exaggerated character movements has allowed it to stand the test of time. While deft art design can have that lasting effect, game design tends to show its age with time. But to my surprise, Shadows of Damned: Hella Remastered seems to be holding its own in this corner of the ring as well.</p><p dir="ltr">In the 30 minutes I played, I saw a wide array of enemy types, varied environmental puzzles, and a clever use of its light and dark mechanics that kept me on my toes. The whole chapter was carefully paced, and felt considerably honed in. All these elements were in the original, too, but I had forgotten over the 13 years since I last played it. It was a welcoming surprise--a feeling that Suda himself had as well when returning to his 2011 cult classic.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's definitely things that have changed the way I view the game and the things that I think I pick up on when I'm looking at the game now," Suda-san said. "One thing looking at the game now: I actually feel that it was a lot more well-made than I felt when it originally came out."</p><p dir="ltr">"We've got another project we're working on at the moment," Suda continued. "It's a new IP, and since we're working on that while also doing the remaster, you end up sort of comparing and contrasting. So when working on this new IP, going back to work on the [Shadows of the Damned] remaster at the same time, there's definitely things I picked up on now that I maybe didn't pick up on back at the time. Like, 'Oh, hey, this is maybe something we could have done a bit better, or this is something we could have changed.' And conversely, 'Oh, hey, this is something we can maybe take and kind of tweak to fit the new IP.'"</p><p dir="ltr">According to Suda, that was a "big nope" for Grasshopper Manufacturer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4361190-ss_73110f7c7c918d44d41659e03ed1ffd36004997e.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4361190" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4361190-ss_73110f7c7c918d44d41659e03ed1ffd36004997e.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4361190"></a><figcaption>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4361190-ss_73110f7c7c918d44d41659e03ed1ffd36004997e.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"One of the main reasons that we wanted to put out the remaster was to get it on as many platforms as possible. Originally it was only on PS3 and Xbox 360, and if it was only gonna be on Origin, then that defeated the purpose, because it would further limit the number of people who would be able to play it."</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn't until Grasshopper Manufacture partnered with its current parent company NetEase--and after Origin was no longer a major focus for EA's distribution--that the studio was able to work out a deal that granted it both the rights for the remaster and the game's distribution.</p><p dir="ltr">Until now, Shadows of the Damned was only playable if you have a physical copy of the game, which severely limits its availability for new players to access the cult classic. Thankfully, Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is expected to release October 31 for all modern platforms and PC.</p>

            <p>
Vampire: The Masquerade's trilogy of New York themed visual novels is set to conclude next Tuesday, 10th September, with Reckoning of New York on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.
</p>
<p>
Vampire: The Masquerade – Reckoning of New York, from developer Draw Distance, wraps up a tale that began with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-the-masquerade-coteries-of-new-york-reveals-new-details-on-its-telltale-like-adventure">2019's Coteries of New York</a> and continued a year later in Shadows of New York. This time around, the story unfolds against a backdrop of the modern-day city, where "the delicate balance of power hangs by a thread".
</p>
<p>
"Navigate the treacherous waters of vampiric politics as you contend with the ever-shifting landscape between the Camarilla and Anarchs," teases Draw Distance. "In a city where every move could mean the difference between unlife and final death, will you carve out your own destiny amidst the chaos or will your ambition spell your doom?"

<p>
Reckoning of New York promises a journey of "discovery and deception" from two different perspectives, as well as a range of new gameplay mechanics. "Harness the powers of Disciplines to overcome challenges or evade the relentless pursuit of Hunters hot on your trail," explains Draw Distance. "But beware the insatiable Hunger that gnaws at your very being, threatening to unleash the primal Beast within."
</p>
<p>
Vampire: The Masquerade – Reckoning of New York will be available for <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/vampire-the-masquerade-reckoning-of-new-york/9mwqhhn14b2r">Xbox One</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10009973">PlayStation 4</a>, Switch, and PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2658720/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Reckoning_of_New_York/">via Steam</a> when it launches on 10th September.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-fallout-76-update-launches-milepost-zero/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-passes-20-million-players-milestone-bethesda-is-planning-future-games/">Fallout 76</a> has been released, with players now able to explore Milepost Zero, a completely free update for Fallout 76 players across all platforms. This update introduces Legendary Crafting as well as a new C.A.M.P. feature called Best Builds, as well as tweaks to the combat system to make it more enjoyable. In addition to these updates, there will be a new questline for Fallout 76 players to explore in Milepost Zero, where they have to go on a trek with their Brahmin and begin a caravan delivery service in Skyline Valley.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout 76 - Season 18: Milepost Zero - Country Road" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MXrFWx_jwKo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new questline will be named "A Bump in the Road," which, as explained above will take players on the journey to have their own delivery service across the Shenandoah region while having to fight off raiders and creatures. On this questline, players will get to recruit companions of varying professions where you can then go on to build your own personal outpost where you get rewards.</p>
<p>For players to be able to utilize Legendary Crafting, they will need to be able to obtain the Mods that can be equipped onto the gear by either trading the Legendary Mod with another player or by scrapping Legendary items that you don't want that have the desired mod on them. This will allow players to upgrade their gear and give them better utility from their upgrades.</p>
<p>In addition to Legendary Crafting, the Best Builds system allows players to submit, visit, and rate other players' C.A.M.P.s.</p>
<p>One of the final things to be added to this Fallout 76 update is Season 18: Country Road. in this season, players can unlock new rewards from the Seasons pages such as the Blue Ridge Power Armor as well as Weapon Points and new themed C.A.M.P items.&nbsp; This new update comes with a four-month road map with the next major update and season coming in December. Before that, players can expect to see the Fallout Day Festivities taking place in October and the invaders returning in November, making it a stacked quarter for Fallout 76 players.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>To showcase the latest update, Bethesda Softworks has released a trailer just over a minute that shows players what to expect from the Milepost Zero update. <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6a0zxH7H8KwFTa5b0OlFxJ/season-18-milepost-zero-country-road" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The community calendar</a>, which is available on the Bethesda website for players to look at, goes into more detail about some of the events players can expect in the near future.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/head-of-valorant-esports-reveals-teams-in-talks-to-join-vct-partner-leagues/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/head-of-valorant-esports-reveals-teams-in-talks-to-join-vct-partner-leagues.971268/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/head-of-valorant-esports-reveals-teams-in-talks-to-join-vct-partner-leagues/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<figure></figure>


<p>The VCT is known for partnering with big Valorant esports teams, as Riot Games partnered with 30 different teams across three different leagues back in 2022. The esports teams partnered with VCT back then signed four-year contracts, with the chance to possibly resign in 2026.</p>



<p>Riot Games, though, could choose to sign different teams instead. </p>



<h2 id="h-vct-to-possibly-partner-with-new-valorant-esports-teams">VCT To Possibly Partner With New Valorant Esports Teams</h2>



<p>While there is still more than a year left before the 30 teams partnered with the VCT’s contracts expire, Riot Games is already looking at different esports organizations that they now consider to be first in line to join VCT’s partner leagues.</p>



<p>Leo Faria, the Global Head of Valorant Esports, made it known on social media that the company has its eye on quite a few teams for 2026 when it will be time to create new contracts.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>“Teams still need to meet our criteria for partnership, but there’s no question that orgs in Challengers are the first in line whenever slots open up,” said Faria.</p>



<p>With quite a bit more competition ahead of Valorant teams in the future, there is still the possibility that new teams and players enter Challengers and catch the eye of Riot Games. </p>



<p>Currently, The Challengers League has quite a few teams involved, with players from various countries around the world.</p>



<h2 id="h-valorant-challengers-2024">Valorant Challengers 2024</h2>



<p>As of now, the 2024 Challengers League has some of the biggest teams in Valorant esports on its roster. With many tournaments to be held over the next year, though, we could see other teams qualify their way into the spotlight, possibly giving them a chance at getting a VCT partnership in 2026.</p>



<p>Some large names, such as TSM, are a part of Challengers: North American Split. Will we see many large teams as such acquire VCT partnerships in 2026? Or will the league feature many unexpected teams?</p>

<p>Have you seen how positively gorgeous Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 looks? From a distance, you can watch as many hundreds of Tyranids flow from the jungles to assault your position. But up close, everything oozes detail. It’s going to take a powerhouse of a gaming computer to run this one. Or is it? Here are the Space Marine 2 PC requirements!</p>



<h2 id="h-warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2-system-requirements">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 System Requirements</h2>



<p>On the low end, running Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 on PC doesn’t appear too troubling. There are many gaming laptops that should handle the horde shooter relatively easily. But on the high end, you’ll want a beefier system to ramp up the graphics so that you can check out the Tyranids in all their inhuman glory.</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i5 6800K / AMD Ryzen 5 2600X</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 / AMD Radeon RX 580</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 75 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 75 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<p>Do you think your system can handle the game?</p>







<h2 id="h-what-warhammer-games-to-play-while-you-wait">What Warhammer Games to Play While You Wait</h2>



<p>Whether your current gaming PC can run the game or not, you might find yourself itching to do battle with heretics and Xenos in the Warhammer universe. In that case, here are a few recommendations to play while you wait for the Space Marine 2 release date:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine</strong></li>



<li><strong>Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor – Martyr</strong></li>



<li><strong>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</strong></li>



<li><strong>Warhammer: Vermintide II</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>While you don’t have to play Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine before Space Marine 2, it’s highly recommended as you’ll encounter numerous characters, including our main character, Titus, from the first game.</p>
