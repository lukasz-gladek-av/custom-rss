			<p>Starfield launch on PlayStation 5 could be imminent, judging from a recent finding that's been making the rounds online today.</p>
<p>As reported on the<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1jb6ldu/they_have_added_the_playstation_logo_to_a/"> Starfield subreddit</a>, a new work-in-progress Creation to add decals to the main ship is listed on the <a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/5eb39a17-916a-4220-85ff-b710174e184f/WIP___Ship_Decals/details">Creations website</a> with a PlayStation 5 logo. Heading over to the Detail tab also shows PlayStation console availability for the mod, suggesting that the PS5 logo hasn't been added by mistake and that the game is inching closer to its PlayStation 5 release.</p>

<p>As<a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-keeping-games-off-other-platform-xbox-series-s-handheld/"> keeping games off of other platforms is not Xbox's path</a>, there's little doubt that Starfield will eventually make the jump to PlayStation 5. The game's PS5 version has been rumored to be in the works for a while and could definitely be part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-will-get-exciting-things-later-this-year-says-bethesda/">"lots of exciting things"</a> that have been recently teased for the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">Starfield</a> launched back in 2023 on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S and was expanded last year with the Shattered Space DLC. While the expansion's story is among the best available in the game, the DLC leaves something to be desired, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Starfield Shattered Space expansion leaves a lot to be desired. While it introduces a more focused and engaging story compared to the base game, the average map and quest design, along with the lack of new features, turn the adventure in Va'Ruun'kai into a bit of a slog rather quickly. Although the tighter focus is welcome, the Starfield experience as a whole needs something more substantial to reach its full potential.</em></p>

            <p>
In my hectic pursuit of a scoop, I have spent a non-zero amount of today peering at a smudgy image of a London bus sign from a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tides-of-annihilation">Tides Of Annihilation</a> trailer, trying to work out whether the new gooner-baiting Arthurian slasher has screwed up its portrayal of Britain’s public transport network. If it had, you’d best <em>believe</em> that’d be a headline. I’d have broken the internet with it. “Never mind turning the Dread Knight Mordred into a waifu,” I’d have written, hissing like a kettle. “Those absolute tourists at Eclipse Glow Games have made a mockery of the sacred N19 route from Finsbury Park to Clapham Junction.”
</p><!--more-->
<p>

Unfortunately for journalism, I can’t quite decide whether the sign is accurate or not, so instead I’m here writing that Tides of Annihilation’s bossfights seem fun. Boss, bus – probably an amazing play on words to be had there, but no time, no time, for there are flying golden swords to dodge, atomic axes to parry, and carpets of lightning to jump over. The trailer is below – it comes from <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/100-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-games-apps-new-games-revealed/?linkId=100000348094054">a GeForce blog</a> detailing something called “DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation”. If memory serves, “DLSS 4” is the daytime circular between Archway and Blackfriars, but I’ll defer to the expertise of our hardware editor.

It's a bit of a numbers-fest, isn't it? I don't see the point of a frame-rate over 60, myself. You might need some narrative context. Fortunately, there’s another, longer trailer from a couple of weeks ago that gives you more of an introduction to ivory-mannered heroine Gwendolyn, and features an extended bash with the aforesaid Mordred. This is the one that has the suspicious bus sign in it. Skip to about 2.50 if you're interested, and let me know if you have a breakthrough. There could be a Pulitzer in this.

<p>
If you’re not able to watch either video - possibly because you’re on a London bus right now and don’t want the driver to see footage of that bus sign and become enraged – the short take on Tides of Annihilation (which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tides-of-annihilation-brings-devil-may-crys-speed-and-god-of-wars-scale-to-post-apocalyptic-arthurian-london">announced just last month</a>) is that you’re fighting a bunch of demi-gods from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avalon">Avalon</a> in a city that has been pancaked by extra-dimensional invaders. Gwendolyn gets DMC-style dodges, combos, parries, grabs and juggles, plus the ability to summon spectral Knights for specific combat roles – there’s a big fiery one for brutish punching, an ice one that’s great for launching, a green one who’s best at a distance, etcetera. 
</p>
<p>
Apart from the regular street fights and boss battles, there are gauntlet-run platforming bits that wreak havoc upon the laws of physics. Sometimes you’re running along a wall as buildings fold together like tectonic plates, sometimes you’re brawling on the ceiling in a lake of gore. There are also vast stone colossi that must be clambered on and tamed. I’m not moved by the game conceptually but it does look like a laugh. There’s no release date yet – here’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3292470/Tides_of_Annihilation/">the Steam page</a>.

The time savings over an entire playthrough still probably wouldn’t amount to even an entire frame.</p><p>If the APU rates keep going up, however, it could eventually amount to a more tangible difference, especially for tool-assisted speedrun bots that fans use to decipher optimal routes for beating old games and to see what’s possible within games when the limitations of a human player are removed. And who knows, in 50 years maybe the ceramic resonator will start doing other weird things, assuming old SNES consoles still work at that point.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Ubisoft is reportedly considering launching a new venture that will hold some of the company's most popular IPs, and that could be part-owned by other companies besides shareholder Tencent.</p>
<p>According to a new report from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/assassin-s-creed-creator-ubisoft-is-said-to-seek-gaming-backers?leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the French publisher is looking to establish a new entity that will include some of the publisher's biggest IPs, like the Assassin's Creed series, and is considering selling a minority stake in this new venture. Potential bidders, who have already been contacted and asked for preliminary bids before the end of the month, include current Ubisoft shareholder Tencent. Everything, however, is still under consideration, and plans could change, according to people familiar with the situation.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have heard that Ubisoft is considering<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-founding-family-and-tencent-are-considering-a-new-venture-using-some-of-ubisofts-assets/"> starting this new venture</a> that would hold some of its most lucrative IPs. Back in January, however, it seemed like only Tencent would be involved in this new venture which would allow the Guillemot family to retain control of the publisher.</p>
<p>While it hasn't been said outright, there's little doubt that Assassin's Creed Shadows' performance on the market will have a big impact on Ubisoft's future. The new entry in the series set in Feudal Japan, which is said to be the most <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gamescom-preview-the-most-visually-advanced-assassins-creed-to-date/">visually advanced entry in the series to date</a>, will launch next week on March 20th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

I’d describe it as roguelike-ish; you pick a starting character with certain attributes and a specific weapon, and you’ll level up that weapon, other weapons, and other items as you collect gems by defeating enemies. Your weapons fire automatically, so you mostly just have to worry about picking up experience and items while avoiding baddies.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/4/23292852/vampire-survivors-cheats-secrets-menu-0-10-update-spells">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTY0MTQ=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/5/22960148/vampire-survivors-game-pc-mac-italian-names-lore-head-canon">My big fat Italian vampire-slaying family</a></h2><div><p>I was floored as soon as I got to the main menu of <a rel="sponsored" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1794680%2FVampire_Survivors%2F"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>. I knew this hot indie darling sounded up my alley when I heard it described as a reverse-bullet hell blended with a roguelike, but I was not prepared for it to hit so close to home. While the main menu looks low-rent and the Castlevania-inspired aesthetics seems at first like a poor imitation, what stopped me in my tracks was the starting character. Antonio Belpaese: the first in a lineup of four Belpaese family members and a menagerie of other characters with incredibly Italian-sounding names. Even before playing a minute of the game, I was enthralled by my namesake taking the lead. As I struggled through the first few runs and slowly unlocked more characters, I felt like this game represented me and my big Italian-American immigrant family in a small way that elevated the whole experience like few games I have ever played.</p><p>When people talk about <em>Vampire Survivors,</em> it’s all about how much fun the mechanics of the game are and how it’s blown up on Steam for the cheap Early Access price of just $3. The gameplay is indeed exceptional. You try to survive an onslaught of increasing numbers of baddies using only auto-firing weapons, slowly improving your arsenal with pickups and passive power-ups. It’s a roguelite that gives that dopamine hit as the numbers go up and is completely devoid of a story, but it is rich in culture. Specifically, my family’s culture.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/5/22960148/vampire-survivors-game-pc-mac-italian-names-lore-head-canon">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTY0Nzk=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/19/22941145/vampire-survivors-early-access-steam-pc-mac-luca-galante">Slaying monsters in Vampire Survivors is like walking through a casino</a></h2><div><p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> is an Early Access roguelike on Steam that has completely sunk its teeth into me.</p><p>Each round starts simply: you have just one weapon to take on a few baddies.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/629678/zombies-run-marvel-move-six-to-start-layoffs-fitness-tech<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Six to Start, the company behind Zombies, Run! and Marvel Move, has laid off all but two of its staff, <em>The</em> <em>Verge</em> has learned. The news was delivered last week to staffers in a Zoom call, in which they were told that parent company <a href="https://www.olivex.ai/">OliveX</a> could no longer afford to keep Six to Start afloat and would shut down the company if they can’t find a buyer. Laid-off staffers were also served redundancy notices, which <em>The Verge</em> has confirmed.</p><p>The <a href="https://zrx.app/">ZRX: Zombies, Run!</a> app is an immersive fitness game that plops walkers and runners into audio-based storytelling. When enemies, be they the undead or Marvel villains, “chase” you, you’re encouraged to pick up speed. At the end of an episode, you can also collect items to trade for badges or in-game buildings. First founded in 2012, the app says it has about 10 million users worldwide.</p><p>Such immersive storytelling games, especially <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23686893/marvel-move-six-to-start-running-fitness">Marvel Move</a>, are expensive to produce. They involve writing storylines, hiring voice actors to perform the material, and artists to create graphics. One source with knowledge on the matter noted that it’s unlikely the app will completely shut down for now, as there are plenty of loyal Zombies, Run! players and subscribers. Instead, it’s likely OliveX is trying to massively lower costs by slashing or completely pausing new content, relying on the hundreds of episodes still in the archive. OliveX is apparently actively looking for buyers, and there may already be interested parties, the source says.</p><p>OliveX first acquired Six to Start in 2021, but another source, speaking on condition of anonymity, claims Six to Start staffers clashed with both OliveX and its owner, Animoca Brands. The games’ anti-capitalist themes were at odds with the parent companies’ aims to create crypto and NFT projects. The source claims that working under OliveX was “agony.” To date, there have been no NFTs within any of Six to Start games.</p><p>It’s unclear what will happen for ZRX: Zombies, Run! subscribers in the short-term. While there is an extensive library of content, part of the draw was regular releases of new episodes. <em>The Verge</em> reached out to OliveX and Six to Start for comment, but did not immediately receive responses.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>No one likes to be in a car accident, but it happens. Maybe the "accident" part is your fault, maybe it's someone else's fault—or maybe it's the conditions. It's often a mixture of everything and anything. </em></p><p><em>Cars are (sometimes) beautiful but dangerous metallic beasts. Every time you step inside one, whether as driver or passenger, you are entering into an agreement with everyone else on the road: be cool, be safe. </em></p><p><em>But it's not a real agreement! People do stupid shit all the time! </em></p><p><em>The nature of that stupid shit, and what role we play in it, is what Rob and Patrick started thinking about after recording Remap Radio.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> So Rob, while recording the podcast this week, a story popped into my head while you were talking about <em>Keep Driving</em> but there wasn’t an appropriate time to bring it up. In <em>Keep Driving</em>, you talked about how a choice at the start of the game about how “close” you are with your parents determines how likely your in-game parents are to respond to a phone call for help, aka the game’s way of offering you a way to continue without the run starting from scratch.</p><p>My dad was an angry where-the-<em>fuck</em>-were-you stickler when it came to coming home at curfew.&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah, sure, there was a “legal” curfew that technically went hand-in-hand with this, but my dad wasn’t exactly worried about the cops pulling me and my brother over, he just couldn’t fall asleep until we were home. If you were late—or <em>close</em> to late—it ensured you were getting berated after walking in the door. No, this did result in a change of behavior where my brother and I came home early. Instead, we’d race home minutes ahead of curfew and eat the beration.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, I started driving a few years ahead of cell phones—you know, the dinky flip phone era where you could, at best, run a version of <em>Snake</em>. I’m hanging out one night with my first girlfriend and like clockwork, push how long I’m out to the brink. No one could blame me. No berating could have gotten me out sooner. But the route home is quiet and predictable, and I know how long it’ll take if I hit the lights wrong and a few minutes are added to the drive back.&nbsp;</p><p>What I didn’t account for—or really, what I ignored—was the rain outside. It wasn’t pouring, though. This wasn’t a storm but the light trickle you get used to during a midwest summer.&nbsp;</p><p>Rob, you learn about hydroplaning when you’re in drivers school, but there truly is no way to understand how elements like rain, snow, and wind are going to impact the driving experience until you have your first “oh shit” moment as it feels like the vehicle is starting to slip away.</p><p>I distinctly remember the critical error in question. At a stoplight, the water pitter pattering down on the windshield, I slammed on the gas. It was over instantly. You’re not supposed to do that.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, my car swerved back and forth before coming to a stop basically straight ahead—but not after skidding alongside a telephone pole. Thankfully, I did not hit the telephone pole, but where the car ended up kinda looked like it was parked, except there was no driveway and the car had busted through a fence. There weren’t any cars out at this hour, especially in this weather, but the few that <em>were </em>around simply drove past me. I was in an accident and couldn’t get any help.</p><p>I was, thankfully, uninjured and no one else was involved in the accident. But I was also scared shitless. Without a cell phone, I walked to a nearby convenience store, dialed 1-800-COLLECT, and yelled “MOM DAD I WAS IN AN ACCIDENT” when the prompt to say who’s calling came up. My mom picked up the phone, asked where I was, and I went back to waiting in the rain.&nbsp;</p><p>Minutes later, both of them showed up and we called 9-1-1 together. And there was no yelling.</p><p>Most people have some kind of accident when they start driving. How about you, Rob? And how did that conversation, if it happened, go over with your parents?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@jwvein?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Janusz Walczak</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Most American drivers are poorly trained and prepared. Because you’re right, most people are not going to have any preparation for how bad conditions are going to affect a car’s handling, and what to do when you start to lose control of a car. In the driver’s education program I took part in, I think I did three practice drives in compact sedans that just happened to be in perfect dry weather in the summer. The exam to get my license was easier than all those drives. Driving anything other than a small car four-cylinder car, night driving, non-asphalt surfaces, rain, snow, ice… all those things were things I confronted in uncontrolled real-world conditions. There are expensive driving programs where they do expose you to handling a car on wet, slick road surfaces, but those are usually run as adjuncts to performance driving programs for amateur or aspiring racers. The foundational expectation of American life is that just about everyone will get a license, and they will keep that license barring exceptional proof of their unfitness.</p><p>I grew up being motorsports-crazy, and driving games are probably the genre I have played the most through my life. My father also commuted in and out of Chicago every day on the Bormann, Ryan, and Kennedy expressways. He saw enough harrowing stuff that he wanted to make sure I was prepared and had the correct responses programmed before I ever sat behind the wheel. I remember sitting with him in his Pontiac Grand Prix whooshing into Chicago during a heavy rainstorm and him easing off the gas and sliding out of the left lane, and extending a finger to point at cars streaking past through the lake-sized puddles on the Ryan. Calling attention to the way the water was collecting around the tires and spraying out of the treads, he explained the physics of hydroplaning and how it would start happening before I could really feel it, and how the key was not to panic once I realized the car couldn’t completely be steered. I don’t think I was even 13 at this point. Between little driving lectures like that and just the time spent in racing sims like <em>Indycar Racing</em>, I was pretty well-drilled in things like regaining control of a car in a slide, or how to be smooth on the throttle and brakes.</p><p>So I ended up coming through a lot of early real-world tests unscathed. I encountered a few “heart in mouth” moments commuting around Green Bay when I lived in Wisconsin, where blizzards could dump far more snow on the roads than the plows could hope to keep up with and you’d find yourself stuck in trains of overconfident Cheeseheads all churning at high speed through unplowed snow in the tire-tracks of the cars ahead. I saw someone driving slightly erratically on the Mass Turnpike, just drifting slightly in their lane, and was already letting them get further ahead of me when they clipped a guardrail and spun out in front of me. That impressed the hell out of MK, let me tell you, because from her perspective it looked like I had been able to see the future.I think I’ve gotten like four speeding violations and been involved in zero accidents or collisions since I started driving. Now that record is skewed by the fact that I log fewer hours on the road than most people, but I also think there’s a phenomenon where the more experienced you get, the more cautious you become. If I can’t see the sides of the road up ahead or if the road rises a bit before coming to a dip, I just assume there’s a speed trap nearby and make sure I’m not doing “pull me over” speeds. That means I’m rarely doing “pull me over” speeds at all, though. I remember my dad gave me a radar detector at one point and the result was I basically never went above the speed limit at all because it was constantly flagging <em>possible </em>sensors and police radios. Eventually I threw the thing in the glovebox and never looked back.</p><p>Likewise, the thing I fear most on the road is other people’s mistakes. I’m good at spotting people who are going to be trouble, even if I don’t fully know why. Something about the car they are driving, a way I’ve seen them move, will just scream, “Oblivious! Road rage! Phone screen!” and I’ll try to avoid being in a position where I won’t be able to react if they do the most dangerous and incompetent thing imaginable.</p><p>That’s what scares me these days: the thing you just couldn’t see coming or couldn’t possibly react to. Years ago some friends of MK’s were killed in a head-on collision because someone in the midst of a psychiatric episode (or so they claimed) hit them from behind at over 120 MPH and launched them across the median into another car with another family in it. I think about them every few weeks, about making Christmas cookies with them, about the mementos we still have from them that we can’t bring out because looking at them is too painful. </p><p>I wonder if I, or anyone, could have avoided it. If there was a moment where you could spot what was coming in your mirror and get out of the way, or prepare to take the hit in a less devastating fashion.&nbsp;</p><!--members-only--><p>I don’t think there was. I think there are limits to what alertness and reflexes can save you from. Ultimately, you’re dependent on other people having at least a modicum of awareness and responsibility for their own safety and others’. The person who just rockets down the road, their car an unguided missile in their hands? Or the trucker who fumbled a water bottle and had it roll behind their brake pedal before he plowed into MK’s car? I don’t have advice for avoiding those people. I just have advice on how not to be that person.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@kholopkin?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Kyrylo Kholopkin</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>All my dad did was drive when he was younger, because he was a salesperson. He was a good, safe driver—maybe why he was so paranoid about us driving, too. (I’ve asked my mom if she thinks he would have been more or less paranoid in an era of “tracking” kids via phones, and mostly she thinks it would have made him <em>more</em> paranoid to track a little blue dot.)</p><p>I bring this up because an incident that’s stuck in my mind is a time when he came to pick me up from college. I could’ve taken the bus up north, but he seemed to like the drive and it gave us a chance to catch up amidst the lengthy drive through central Illinois’ cornfields. As we left school, a <em>massive </em>rain storm blew through, the kind where your windshield wipers cannot keep up. It was the one time I saw my father just say “screw it” and pulled over until the rain slowed.</p><p>I’d never seen my dad blink like that before, you know? I watched as he grumbled, other cars passing us by, and passing quiet judgement over other people, knowing it was a poor decision.</p><p>I feel you about the dangers of other people, or what’s out of your control. My mom was in a major accident a little over a year ago, where a traffic camera showed her, out of nowhere, going from a normal driving speed to something north of 90 miles per hour. She slammed into an intersection, totalled her car, and somehow she was the only one with any real injury. (Even that, thank god, was a broken collar bone and a broken foot, both of which herald naturally.) The police and doctors determined it was a “medical incident,” which is to say they don’t think she did anything wrong, but months and months later, we don’t know <em>what</em> happened. A stroke? Maybe? Maybe. Nothing’s happened since, as her medical paperwork inches through the state.&nbsp;</p><p>This was someone who never enjoyed driving to begin, so an excuse to stop isn’t unwelcome.&nbsp;</p><p>My kids enter a world where driving is changing. Some cars are driving themselves. Other cars are kind of?? driving themselves. Whatever they drive will have useful sensors to help them navigate danger(s), amidst distracting screens that make doing basic car tasks much harder.</p><p>When my oldest was born eight years ago, right around the time when dipshits like Musk started saying fully automated driving was “around the corner,” I actually wondered if it was possible she was entering a world where she wouldn’t really need a drivers license. She will, it seems, but it feels like the dangers she’ll face are ones that, in some ways, I won’t be as familiar with.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@ort?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Bram Van Oost</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>There’s always been a school of thought that the more you automate on a car, the less safe it becomes. Manual transmission die-hards argue (and I don’t know the actual evidence, so don’t hold me to this) that a stick shift just makes certain kinds of accident almost impossible. Your mother’s, for instance: if she had a lapse behind the wheel and the car is a manual, she probably can’t hit the speed she did. She’d have missed the shift, the rev limiter would have kicked in, and she’d have been going slower in the intersection. It’s harder to have an accident where you don’t know you were in drive rather than reverse, or you thought you were hitting the brake but hit the gas instead, because there is so much more happening than just hitting a single pedal to make the car move.</p><p>Driver assists concern me because they introduce ambiguity that strikes me as very dangerous. When I’m driving, I’m driving. Eyes sweeping between the mirrors and the road, hands on the wheel. But if I have a car that can, and indeed marketing for it encourages me to let it, drive itself? Not completely, I’m still responsible for intervening if I spot trouble, and the manual maybe has a disclaimer that says the car requires the supervision of a driver, but also I don’t really have to be driving, just making sure <em>it’s </em>driving well? That’s a recipe for disaster! There’s less for me to do as a driver, so I’m going to be bored and disengaged from the task. But also the car probably can’t be trusted to handle the kind of hazards that can appear suddenly. It also introduces weird ambiguity: it can feel very strange when a car’s traction control and anti-lock brakes are both going, now just imagine you see trouble coming and want to drive on the shoulder to avoid it, but the car wants to maintain position and just hit the brakes. Who is the better judge? It doesn’t really matter, the point is both attempts to avoid the collision might require full commitment. If you are trying to do one thing and intervene over an automatic system trying to do another, the car is not going to take either approach efficiently.</p><p>Those systems will probably save some people from inattentive drivers, but they’re also going to create so many more people who have terrible, tuned-out driving habits that I think they’re going to make roads less safe overall.</p><p>There’s an article I probably think about every few weeks since I read it. It’s this Vanity Fair analysis of how <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/business/2014/10/air-france-flight-447-crash?srsltid=AfmBOorf9kWfiyPCMC4AVDw1y6aPm3WC3ZfN-Kh0HiI6xdV3g6MZTrrf&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>that Air France flight crashed in the Atlantic </u></a>about 10 or 15 years ago. Plane didn’t break, weather wasn’t bad. The autopilot flew the plane into some conditions where it was operating near a stall, where it can’t generate enough lift to maintain altitude. The autopilot wanted to pitch the nose down to gain speed and lift, which is the correct and flight school 101 thing to do. The pilot, however, heard a stall warning and then saw the plane losing altitude, so he tried to throw it into a climb. That <em>did </em>stall the plane and caused it to fall like a rock out of the sky. On the one hand it was obviously pilot error, but one of the points made in the article is, it was an error that only happens when the pilot has become completely disengaged from the task. There’s a point where if you put enough automatic systems in something like a plane, you shouldn’t have a pilot anywhere near it because there won’t be enough for them to do to maintain preparedness to make good decisions. So where is the point you stop putting in automatic safety enhancements because they start removing the most powerful safety system of all: a well-trained and alert human operator? Where is the point where you can say a machine is safer without anyone running it at all?</p><p>I don’t think we’re going to answer these questions before we’ve substantially unleashed chaos on the roads, because so much of this is being driven from a product development standpoint rather than a safety standpoint. Every time you hear about Tesla owners eating shit “testing” their car’s self-driving capabilities, you’re basically hearing about a rogue car company letting people turn public roads into a beta test. And the whole industry is following suit. They’ve spent decades making cars that are bigger, heavier, and immeasurably less fun to drive, and sent them onto congested public roads that have made everyone’s commute miserable no matter where they live. Daily driving is boring and frustrating and just about everyone would rather spend that time reading a book or doing work so now cars are being marketed with the promise, “Don’t worry, you barely have to bother driving this piece of shit.”</p><p>That’s not going to go well, but it’s coming regardless. My advice: get your kid some sim time, and pose some scenarios to them when you’re driving around. Imagine the person in the next lane over suddenly does the most-boneheaded thing possible. How can you avoid being swept up in it? Because that training will be good no matter if the bonehead is a drunk driver, a bad driver, or a glitchy robot.</p>

No, you’re lying, of course you haven’t, which is the secret sauce that makes <em>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii</em> such a unique, wild ride. The argument between whether ninjas or pirates were cooler is over when you can get you a game that basically does both. God, remember back in the day when the internet was full of fun arguments over who’d win between ninjas and pirates and not, “Is this AI video of the president sucking Elon Musk’s toes like he’s trying to drink from the right grail proper resistance praxis?” We used to be a society, I swear.</p><p>Anyway, point is, thanks to the good folks at Ryu Ga Gotoku, we don’t have to choose which of our wild, lawless fantasies to live out. Although, because it’s a <em>Like A Dragon</em> game, it does mean there’s all sorts of little quirks to account for that you probably wouldn’t think you’d have to deal with turning to a life of piracy. Thankfully, we’ve got you very much covered with a few starter tips to help you hoist the colors high.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-recommend-id="image://3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Combat in the game, with our character glowing purple." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Combat in the game, with our character glowing purple." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-recommend-id="image://3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Combat in the game, with our character glowing purple." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As per usual with <em>Yakuza/Like A Dragon </em>games, the opening minutes are quite generous when it comes to showing you the ropes of the combat, but even though <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>shows you how to do Majima’s air juggle combos, they don’t quite emphasize just how much of a boon it is to your entire moveset. For the first two chapters or so, use it because it’s cool. Later chapters, though—especially on those Devil King islands where there’s 100 dudes attempting to shove a cutlass up where dead men tell no tales—<strong>getting an enemy up in the air is the linchpin of your fights when it comes to creating some distance.</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-recommend-id="image://811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Upgrade Ability screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Upgrade Ability screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-recommend-id="image://811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Upgrade Ability screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Compared to a bunch of the other titles in the series,<em> Pirate Yakuza</em> is pretty generous early on when it comes to giving you enough money and Reputation to enhance yourself. Obviously, boosting Majima’s attacks and health are no-brainer purchases you’ll never regret, but the lure of the awesome-looking Heat attacks isn’t easy to ignore. We’re not saying don’t buy any of those, but firstly, many of the other enhancements are far more crucial (and cheaper) early on, and secondly, Heat actions are bound by highly specific situations here. A fair few are only really applicable when you’re raiding an enemy ship, in fact. If there’s a very specific combat situation/button press you find yourself in, go for it. But shop smart.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-recommend-id="image://cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Crew Formation screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Crew Formation screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-recommend-id="image://cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Crew Formation screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Once you get some shore leave in Honolulu, you’re basically going to be awash in recruits for your ship within about an hour. There’s no downside to letting everybody aboard, but when it comes to who you should squad up with, you’re gonna need to plan for the future.</p><p>Early on, Jason Rich and Masaru are gonna be permanent fixtures in your crew. You’ll get them the earliest, but their stats stay relatively strong through the entire game. More importantly, though, is that they’re the first characters who can be boosted up to level 40. The problem with a lot of the randos you find out in the world is that even the ones with high stats might cap off at level 20. Those are crewmates who you want in there for a good time, not a long time. Have a backup character you can evolve. If you can be patient, and grind a bit before continuing the main story (the Coliseum in Madlantis is perfect for this) <strong>I recommend having a crew of all lvl 40-capables before getting into the weeds of Chapter 3</strong>, where the difficulty spikes. Speaking of…</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d5eab2ed79e33ad8634c8c2ccbc36e84" data-recommend-id="image://d5eab2ed79e33ad8634c8c2ccbc36e84" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our hero shoots a baddie in the belly with a very silly amount of fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Our hero shoots a baddie in the belly with a very silly amount of fire." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d5eab2ed79e33ad8634c8c2ccbc36e84" data-recommend-id="image://d5eab2ed79e33ad8634c8c2ccbc36e84" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our hero shoots a baddie in the belly with a very silly amount of fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once you finally land in Honolulu, the more typical <em>Like A Dragon</em> experience takes over for a while. Most of it’s a direct copy-paste from<em> Infinite Wealth</em>, but in terms of sheer money-making potential, <strong>the bounties are the best and most reliable money maker in the game</strong>. You’ll see the pink handcuffs dotted around the map, but right off the bat, after you take down your first one and leave the bar, there’ll be a guy worth $16,000 right down the block. You’d think with that high a price tag, you’re about to face Malenia, Blade of Miquella, but in reality, the price tags tend to correspond with the amount of health they have rather than difficulty. Hell, there are bounties worth $4k that are more of a pain in the ass due to the sheer numbers of enemies. Point being, don’t be afraid to go on safari for these guys when you’re low on cash, and don’t be afraid to take on big fish.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-recommend-id="image://c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mighty ship battle with a lot of fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A mighty ship battle with a lot of fire." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-recommend-id="image://c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mighty ship battle with a lot of fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Of course, it wouldn’t be a proper pirate game without some great ship-to-ship combat on the high seas, and sure, you could just position your flank and fire away like a loser, but this is <em>Like A Dragon</em>, things can get so much wilder than that. For starters, yes, anyone who played <em>Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</em> will have no problem picking up on the fact that you can ram straight into other ships for massive damage, only here they’re actually boosted by fuel tanks that can t-bone other boats to pieces in a heartbeat.</p><p>The real fun begins when you start messing with weapon loadouts, where the typical pirate ship cannons can get upgraded, and in terms of bang for buck, <strong>the flamethrowers are ridiculously overpowered in the early chapters</strong>, able to melt down most enemy ships in seconds.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-recommend-id="image://fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A map screen from the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map screen from the game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-recommend-id="image://fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A map screen from the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>About halfway through the game, you’re introduced to one of the other major threats roaming the waters around Hawaii: The Devil Kings. Once you beat their initial quest, all of their hideouts open up to be raided. It’s gonna be tempting, especially after the first too-easy ones to just take whatever’s available, and sweet baby Jesus you need to slow your roll, because the difference in difficulty from the early hideouts vs the four-skull ones is vast, without leveling up way above normal.

Yes, it requires Majima leaving the captain’s wheel to fire, but given just how much range it has, using the rockets as a bespoke sniper rifle has more utility than you think, especially later on when you start seeing ships with depth charges, and distance is much more at a premium. By that point, as well, you should have Majima’s grappling hook, which gives you a grapple point on your ship up to the crow’s nest, where you can get an even better view.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-recommend-id="image://90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The whole gang gathered together on board the pirate ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The whole gang gathered together on board the pirate ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-recommend-id="image://90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The whole gang gathered together on board the pirate ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The critical path of <em>Pirate Yakuza</em> will endear you plenty to your main ride-or-die characters like Jason, Noah, and Masaru, but as mentioned before, these are also the characters you’re gonna carry with you the entire game. As such, giving them priority attention above everyone else pays dividends like crazy. That’s not just because they have the best-written storylines, but they start out with such high stats that prioritizing them early generally means you can stick them in one position right from jump, and they’ll evolve faster the rest. For most of them, it means keeping them happy and fed while on the ship, and bringing them on raids. For Noah, that means taking in the optional conversations dotted around Honolulu early and often. For Noah’s tiger cat, Goro, though, that means visiting Nele Island just as early and often with the fancy pet food.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The last decade alone has seen a major shift in how entertainment is produced and consumed, and while the future isn't set in stone, Avengers: Endgame and The Electric State directors Joe and Anthony Russo have predicted that "linear visual storytelling" is in for a big shake-up once Gen Z becomes the dominant consumers of media. In a new interview, the duo explained how the future of entertainment could be dominated by projects that embrace both gaming and traditional formats to tell a story.</p><p>"We are in the biggest transitional moments in the history of linear visual storytelling," Joe Russo said to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/avengers-doomsday-directors-1236161664/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. "It's very hard to say in this moment where it’s going because a lot of that is going to be dictated by the taste of Gen Z once they become the dominant consumers. And I don't know that anyone knows what their taste is yet because they have been trained on a completely different model of consumption than we are used to. I expect radical change, I expect immersion, I expect a blending of virtual and linear, gaming and linear."</p><p>The Russos are already experimenting with a two-pronged approach to their projects, as The Electric State has a companion game scheduled to arrive later this month. The directors have also mentioned how they're "open" to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avengers-directors-are-open-to-doomsday-and-secret-wars-video-games/1100-6529915/">having video games developed based on their next two Marvel movies</a>, Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars. This also lines up with <a href="https://za.ign.com/joe-russo/162274/news/gaming-will-dominate-the-future-of-storytelling-avengers-endgame-director-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">previous comments by Russo</a> about how he believes the future of entertainment will be dominated by gaming.</p><p>Another example of how entertainment is evolving to appeal to Gen Z can be seen in the recent reveal of ZA/UM's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-getting-a-total-re-imagination-for-mobile-this-summer/1100-6530112/">Disco Elysium re-imagining for mobile</a>. The studio recently revealed how it wants to make the game playable in short bursts, as the game has been redesigned to fit smartphone screens in vertical mode and it has been enhanced with "360-degree scenes" and brand-new audio so that it can feel more immersive.</p>

                <p>Revealed by Konami in 2022, Silent Hill f received a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-cinematic-trailer-brings-small-town-horror-to-japan/1100-6530124/" data-ref-id="1100-6530124">new cinematic trailer</a> this week--though no release date was announced. Showing off a chilling small town in Japan and its lead protagonist, student Shimizu Hinako, it looks like another terrifying entry in the beloved franchise. If you're excited about the chance to finally dive in, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F1C14LY8,B0F1BXGKR4&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorders</a> are now open at select retailers. Silent Hill f will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC at launch.</p><h2>Silent Hill f Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>No official preorder bonuses from Konami have been revealed yet, though an announcement is likely arriving at a later date. Keep in mind that most retailers don’t make you pay for your item until it ships--so you're free to preorder now, then swap up your choice if there's a retailer-exclusive bonus that catches your eye. For now, you can get a <strong>free $10 gift card for preordering at Best Buy.</strong></p><p>There's still a lot we don't know about the game, so expect another big announcement in the coming months. For now, we know that Silent Hill f will be the first game in the series to take place in Japan. Shimizu Hinako will find herself in a strange, unsettling version of her hometown of Ebisugaoka, and she'll need to confront a series of twisted creatures and challenging puzzles if she wants to make it out alive.</p><p>In the meantime, consider checking out Silent Hill 2.

For a project like this, it's easy to have too many limitations or not enough. Early on, we decided, for example, that we would stick to a 32-color palette and some simple color rules, but we wouldn't be very strict on the number of sprites on the screen.

How did the overarching narrative of UFOSOFT affect the design of some of the other games? The design of the collection as a whole?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the most part, we massaged the designs of our games into the right place as we went along without having to make many drastic changes over the course of development. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Barbuta</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was already a primitive-feeling game to begin with, but after we decided it would be UFO Soft's first game, we pushed that existing feeling even more. We always started with games we simply wanted to make for ourselves.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges came from creating an overarching narrative of sorts within all of the works? How do you tell the story of a fictional developer across their varied works?</span></span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/making-a-life-in-the-funky-plant-filled-world-of-starship-home" target="_self" data-discover="true">Making a life in the funky, plant-filled world of Starship Home</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We drew from a lot of references for UFO Soft's history, including real life video game history and our own development experiences. It was something that we discussed and kept in mind throughout the process, and we made efforts to draw out similar themes and recurring ideas as we worked (like overlapping characters and locations, for example). But we only tied the story together fully toward the end once we had most of the pieces (the 50 games) in place. Jon, in particular, did a lot of work tying the narrative together in that final stage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you choose the games you wanted to make for this project? What thoughts went into creating so many different play experiences? Into making sure each game felt unique in its own way?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We—Jon, Eirik (Suhrke), and I—started by brainstorming game ideas and we all had a lot of ideas we wanted to try making. Later on, we were joined by Paul (Hubans), Tyriq (Plummer), and Ojiro (Fumoto), who also contributed their own ideas. Everyone on the team has their own stylistic quirks and we celebrated those differences—so it wasn't hard to make the games feel unique from one another. There was a natural instinct to draw out what made each game stand out and put that at the forefront.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Collecting these games in a single package feels a bit like downloading a library of ROMs for an old console - this sense that you're suddenly drowning in an excess of games and can idly drift through them, seeing what grabs you from names, screenshots, and play. What appealed to you about capturing a journey of discovery within </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>? Into capturing that particular kind of time spent delving into the unknown world of a game company or console?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That feeling of discovery is something everyone on the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team cares deeply about. For me, it started with learning about games, and as I grew older, I started to get more and more interested in the history of games and their development, too. It's become a pursuit I enjoy as much as playing or making games and I wanted to capture it within </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. But it wouldn't feel genuine if we simply led players around the collection and pointed them at things. There had to be real exploration involved.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> took a great deal of time to develop (8 years) and required many developers to make many separate games. How did you maintain your motivation and drive across the many years it took to make the game? How did you keep up creativity and mental clarity while working across multiple different games and needing to make each feel like a separate, full title as opposed to a minigame?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It really helped to work with creative people that share a similar passion for the artform. We were also passing our games around a lot, and with 50 games there was always something new to experience. One day I'd be doing some design and programming on a game I was directing and the next day I might be testing someone else's game or helping them polish the graphics. Or maybe someone would send me a build of a game that I hadn't played in a long time and I'd realize that it improved a lot! While there were a fair share of challenges over the years, the development of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> often felt like a very long game jam between friends inspiring each other back and forth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What do you hope the player takes away from this fictionalized snapshot of an era in game development?&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most gratifying things for us has been seeing players get interested in genres or styles of games that they never thought they'd be into (or perhaps didn't know existed!). We've also seen some younger players who were not around for the 80s and 90s get interested in wanting to explore that era. We're happy any time </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sparks up excitement for games and history like that.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-reportedly-considering-new-gaming-entity-for-core-ip.1134735/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft--report-new-gaming-entity-core-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>studio Ubisoft is reportedly considering creating a new gaming-focused business entity that will include some of its core IP, including the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>Per a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/assassin-s-creed-creator-ubisoft-is-said-to-seek-gaming-backers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> (which is behind a paywall), Ubisoft has contacted some of its shareholders, including Tencent, to see if they have any interest in purchasing a minority stake in the new venture.</p>

<p>Bloomberg, which cites "people familiar with the situation", says that no final decision has been made as yet and that considerations are still ongoing. If this report is true, though, it's probably part of Ubisoft and its shareholders' ongoing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report" rel="nofollow">exploration of options</a> regarding what has been a pretty rough time for the studio recently.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-new-gaming-entity.jpg?itok=GVElqXqh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-new-gaming-entity.jpg?itok=in6gTTpI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is reportedly considering creating a new entity for its core gaming IP.</figcaption></figure><p>Back in September, Ubisoft announced it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">delaying upcoming flagship RPG&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></a>, and as part of the same report in which the delay was revealed, the company also acknowledged that open-world game&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>had underperformed.</p>

<p>Following that announcement, an activist Ubisoft shareholder <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change" rel="nofollow">called for "strategic and structural change"</a> at the company, and Ubisoft's woes continued to mount with employee strikes, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lawsuit-data-policy" rel="nofollow">data policy lawsuit</a>, and, uh, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-nft-game" rel="nofollow">weird NFT game launch</a>.</p>

<p>As part of its fiscal report for the first half of last year, Ubisoft revealed it was effectively <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">hemorrhaging money</a>, and the studio would go on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">shut down FPS&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">XDefiant</a>&nbsp;</em>and close down <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">three of its locations</a> in an effort to cut costs.</p>

<p>Whether or not the new venture would solve any of these problems remains to be seen, but it seems like an attempt to spin off the more successful elements of the business in order to drum up interest and value.</p>




<p>As for what effect the new entity would have on Ubisoft's strategy with regards to its games, that remains to be seen. After all, let's not forget Ubisoft hasn't officially confirmed this move, nor has it been finalized according to Bloomberg's sources. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Saber CCO’s recent statement hints that Star Wars KOTOR Remake is still in development.</p>



<p>Tim Willits, Saber Interactive’s Chief Creative Officer, recently shared some information on the games they are working on. Willits stated on <a href="https://x.com/TimWillits/status/1900374508113961250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> that the studio is currently working on several games across different genres; however, all the games Saber has spoken about are “still in development.” This statement has led many to speculate that the KOTOR remake is still in development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Details about the KOTOR remake have been scarce since the game was confirmed in 2021. Since then, Embracer Group has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kotor-remake-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoken about</a> all the games in development “as of May 24, 2023.” The list included the likes of Tomb Raider (final title TBC), Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine II, Remnant 2, Ride 5, and Star Wars: KOTOR remake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have not received concrete details about the Star Wars: KOTOR remake or an official confirmation from developers. The original KOTOR was released in 2003, and players had to become the last hope of the Jedi Order and master the power of the Force to save the Republic. The game has a unique Star Wars RPG experience with unique characters, creatures, vehicles, and planets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>KOTOR encourages players to learn to use the Force and wield 40 different powers while building their lightsaber. Players get to explore some of the most popular regions in the franchise, including Tatooine and the Wookiee homeworld Kashyyyk. Several customisable characters can be added to your party, and there are eight enormous worlds in the player’s starship, Ebon Hawk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Star Wars Eclipse developer is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-eclipse-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unaffected by Netease’s restructuring</a>. Also,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-star-wars-collab-heresy-act-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Destiny 2 recently</a> received Star Wars skins. What are your thoughts on Saber Interactive’s CCO suggesting that a KOTOR remake is still coming?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Donkey Kong Jungle Beat is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, March 14, 2025. Below, we take a look at how the unusual platformer had a spark unlike anything else in the series.</em></p><p dir="ltr">When fans think of the Donkey Kong series' platforming games, it's easy to consider the timeline as one that began with Rare and its groundbreaking CG graphics in the SNES era before the baton was eventually picked up by Retro Studios with Donkey Kong Country Returns. In Nintendo's history of wacky and inventive ways to play games, there is perhaps nothing quite as bizarre as Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, released in North America in 2005 for GameCube, which gave the iconic ape a stopgap to remember in between the Rare and Retro eras.</p><p dir="ltr">The credit can't all go to the Kyoto company though, quite literally so because this was in fact the debut of its newly established EAD (Entertainment, Analysis and Development) Tokyo studio designed to attract new talent from Japan's capital. Even the technology that's front-and-center in Donkey Kong Jungle Beat wasn't created by Nintendo but rather Namco in its 2003 music spin-off Donkey Konga.</p><p dir="ltr">The DK Bongos felt like a natural extension of drumming in its popular Taiko no Tatsujin series. While a microphone also detects hand claps, it otherwise follows rhythm game conventions of tapping the drums of clapping in time to notes on screen.</p><p dir="ltr">Call it another example of lateral thinking, but the strange minds at EAD Tokyo, led by Super Mario Sunshine co-director Yoshiaki Koizumi, somehow came up with an unconventional way of using this controller, all while taking Donkey Kong back to his side-scrolling fundamentals.</p><p dir="ltr">Rather divisively, Jungle Beat eschews many of the staples from the Donkey Kong Country series--no rolling jumps, no collectible jigsaw pieces or KONG letters, not even Diddy Kong--in favor of a simple story where DK goes through different kingdoms battling evil kings from across the animal kingdom in a bid to come out as the top banana.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6dw0F8_zz8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S6dw0F8_zz8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The stripped-back approach was in service of the simpler controls. Beating the left or right drum individually makes DK move in that corresponding direction--rapidly to make him move faster, while beating both together makes him jump. Meanwhile, clapping your hands sends out a shockwave that stuns enemies caught in the radius, collects nearby bananas, and interacts with objects like vines and catapults. Helpfully, this also mitigates the need for exact precision.</p><p dir="ltr">While the game garnered some criticism over being more simplistic and lacking in the secrets and challenge of the Country series, Jungle Beat is anything but easy. What makes it replayable is its score-attack system. Rather than just getting to the end of a level, it's about earning as many bananas as possible, and the way to get more bananas is by earning more beats. For instance, you could just walk and jump to collect the bananas onscreen, but if you clap, the shockwave collects them all around you instantly, which in turn increases your beat score.</p><p dir="ltr">Defeating enemies and interacting with objects also gains beats, but the real trick is performing all these actions together while airborne, which builds up a combo. The higher the combo, the more beats and bananas you get--one way of gaining more beats is not from bananas but flowers. At the end of each kingdom, your banana total also determines your rank, where you're awarded a crest for bronze, silver and gold, which is important as it's also how you unlock more levels in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Rather than a world map made of different levels that culminate in a boss fight, each kingdom is made up of two levels and a boss battle, which have to be completed before you're scored. However, you can't collect any more bananas during the boss battles, some which include rival Kongs that take the form of one-on-one brawls where you have to avoid a punch at the right time before bashing the drums for a counter.</p><p dir="ltr">It then ups the stakes, as you try to avoid getting hit, which causes you to lose bananas, which also counts as your health. Having hundreds means the game is incredibly generous when it comes to life, but there's nothing worse than having racked up over 800 bananas (the number required for a gold crest in the first two stages) only to mess up against the boss and drop a rank.</p><p dir="ltr">While this simple control scheme still allows for some interesting maneuvers like backflips and wall jumps, the execution isn't without its flaws. Even if the instruction manual warns that the bongos are highly sensitive, in the heat of playing Jungle Beat, it's all too easy to beat the drums so hard (especially when it feels like a beat hasn't been registered) that the microphone mistakes it for a clap instead, while even a brief session is likely to leave your palms sore from so much clapping. But even though you can technically play with a regular GameCube controller, and some would argue using the C-stick triggers shockwaves with more precision than hand claps, that would also largely rob the game of its unique charm.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking back, Jungle Beat might be more of a curio before Retro picked up the baton years later, while EAD Tokyo arguably went on to far greater feats, its next project being all-time classic Super Mario Galaxy. Yet with its design to make a more approachable game that could appeal to more players with a unique control scheme, you can see that kind of thinking as a precursor to the Wii's philosophy. It did receive a Wii port sans bongos. And while it may not have resulted in a sequel, I can't help but think that it was influential in its own way. I wouldn't be surprised if the streamers who beat Dark Souls with a dance mat or a banana hadn't come across Jungle Beat first.</p><p dir="ltr">With Retro focused on the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4</a>, there's been speculation that Nintendo is once again internally developing a new Donkey Kong game, which would make sense following the opening of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-will-join-universal-studios-japan-in-spring-2024/1100-6519697/" data-ref-id="1100-6519697">Donkey Kong Country area in Universal Studios' Super Nintendo World.</a> Whatever the future holds, I can only hope that it contains ideas even a fraction as bananas as Jungle Beat's.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>'s next patch, 7.2, will release on Tuesday 25th March.</p>
<p>As always, the new patch - titled Seekers of Eternity - will extend the story with new quests and dungeons, a new raid in The Arcadion, a new trial, and more. You can see what's to come in the trailer below - who's the boy with the blue hair?</p>
<p>However, the anticipated Cosmic Exploration and Occult Crescent field operations modes will follow in slightly later patches: the former in patch 7.21 on 22nd April, and the latter in patch 7.25 on 27th May.</p>

<p>The news was shared by director and producer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fydpys-4P4w">latest Letter From The Producer stream</a>.</p>
<p>Highlights from the stream include this look at the flamboyant raid boss coming to The Arcadion a week after patch launch:</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-patch-72-due-end-of-march-with-even-more-final-fantasy-9-references">mentioned in the previous Letter From The Producer</a>, the 7.X series will continue with references to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a>. However, it's the Occult Crescent field operation that's perhaps most intriguing.</p>
<p>On a separate island, players can explore the field together to fight monsters and bosses, with a different levelling system based around knowledge collecting. The difference between your level and that of enemies will influence damage dealt and taken, and if incapacitated, players will lose experience points when not revived, which could ultimately result in a loss of knowledge level.</p>
<p>Players will also have a secondary support job to boost their abilities, with classes similar to those in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-v">Final Fantasy 5</a>. This field operation looks to provide a fresh twist on the MMO's co-operative gameplay.</p>
<p>Cosmic Exploration, meanwhile, is a new activity for crafters and gatherers, with new moons arriving with each new patch to explore. Players will explore moons, gather resources, and build bases in a communal experience - its story is all about building a spaceship launching base.</p>
<p>Ahead of the livestream, Yoshida was interviewed by Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202503/36244">Famitsu</a>, where he stated this patch would be the largest to date. That will please fans who have burned out on the game since the release of Dawntrail.</p>
<p>Other smaller changes Yoshida mentioned include being able to use a mount while running and a new jog mechanic once your sprint runs out in cities and safe areas, both of which will aid with the speed of exploration.</p>
<p>Further, Yoshida told Game Watch he was initially skeptical of including so many Final Fantasy 9 references in Dawntrail and these following patches (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-14-yoshi-p-was-initially-unsure-about-referencing-final-fantasy-9-in-dawntrail/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>"Regarding FF9 elements, I was rather torn... At first, I thought it might be best to distance ourselves a little from homages to FF9 and was going to go with that approach," he said.</p>
<p>"FF9 is a masterpiece, and everyone has a strong emotional attachment to it, so I wanted to avoid consciously pulling the story too much in that direction. However, I now think that the current flow of the story is appropriate in light of future developments."</p>
<p>Of course, series fans will be aware of rumours of a Final Fantasy 9 remake, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is yet to officially reveal any such project.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Square Enix revealed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-series-has-now-sold-over-200m-copies-worldwide">Final Fantasy series has now sold over 200m copies worldwide</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-considering-fresh-business-to-own-assassins-creed-and-other-big-franchises-co-owned-by-others-like-tencent<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ubisoft is considering the launch of a fresh business unit, part-owned by outside companies, that could manage its biggest video game brands.
</p>
<p>
That's according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/assassin-s-creed-creator-ubisoft-is-said-to-seek-gaming-backers">new Bloomberg report</a>, which claims that Ubisoft shareholder <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> is being considered for a minority stake in the new venture.
</p>
<p>
The move would likely include lucrative franchises such as Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six and Far Cry. These series would then be owned by this new entity, rather than Ubisoft directly. 
</p>
<p>
This business tactic could see Ubisoft's new entity valued higher than the company itself currently, Bloomberg's report states. At the same time, the Ubisoft mothership would remain owned by its founding Guillemot family - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets-report">something that has reportedly been a sticking point in discussions over Ubisoft's future</a> so far.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">Ubisoft confirmed it was undertaking a strategic review to help right-size the business</a>, following years of falling share prices and a string of disappointing game launches - most notably including big budget new hope <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.
</p>
<p>
The company's next big bet, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, has been delayed twice to ensure it arrives next week in the best possible state.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">Ubisoft has cut jobs repeatedly across the business</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">and closed several studios</a> - including its UK based Leamington team. Overall, the company has cut its total staff from 20,279 people in 2022, to 18,666 in September 2024, before its most recent round of redundancies.
</p>
<p>
"As we mentioned during our Q3 sales, the review of various transformational strategic and capitalistic options is ongoing," a Ubisoft spokesperson told Eurogamer this week. 
</p>
<p>
"The Board has established an ad-hoc independent Committee to oversee this formal and competitive process, so as to extract the best value from Ubisoft's assets and franchises for all stakeholders. Ubisoft will inform the market in accordance with applicable regulations if and once a transaction materialises."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-for-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s.1134675/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-konami<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami and developer NeoBards Entertainment have officially revealed&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>, the newest entry in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>series of psychological horror games.</p>

<p>The game was first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-and-more-all-but-confirmed" rel="nofollow">revealed back in October 2022</a> as part of a&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>Transmission showcase, but at the time, Konami didn't show much more than a short teaser trailer hinting at some of the game's concepts and story elements.</p>

<p>Now, Konami has fully unveiled the game, although we still don't know exactly how it will play since the debut trailer mostly seems to consist of narrative setup and cinematic cutscenes rather than actual moment-to-moment gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-f-revealed-hinako.jpg?itok=dEf64WpE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-f-revealed-hinako.jpg?itok=5nv9pSg4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>has officially been revealed by Konami.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will focus on Hinako Shimizu, a young girl who lives in the remote Japanese town of Ebisugaoka. Of course, this being a horror game, Ebisugaoka is "consumed by a sudden fog", turning Hinako's home into a "haunting nightmare". Sounds like&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>alright.</p>

<p>Konami says&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>will have you "solving complex puzzles and confronting grotesque monsters" as you navigate the foggy streets of Ebisugaoka. It also looks like the town will transition between its regular appearance and a classic&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>-style haunted otherworld, which seems to have a strong floral motif this time around.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>right here. It's more of a mood piece than an informative trailer; while you won't find much gameplay, you can see what kind of direction Konami and NeoBards are heading in with the game.</p>




<p><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>will boast writing by visual novel scribe Ryukishi07, who's best known for the&nbsp;<em>When They Cry&nbsp;</em>series. Music will, of course, be handled by longtime series composer Akira Yamaoka.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>news, Konami revealed back in January that the Bloober Team-developed&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">surpassed two million sales</a>. The two studios are currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip" rel="nofollow">working together on another project</a>, although we don't yet know if it's a&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>game or not.</p>

<p><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but when it does launch, it'll be coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947440/SILENT_HILL_f/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-72-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7-2-release-date-revealed.1134672/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-72-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2, which will bring more raids, a new dungeon, and more later this month.</p>

<p>Per the recent Letter from the Producer showcase,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2 officially launches on March 25th (which, coincidentally, puts it one day before the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-5-release-date" rel="nofollow">release of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.5</a>, so it's going to be a busy couple of days if you play both).</p>

<p>As <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7-2-march" rel="nofollow">previously revealed</a> by Square Enix,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2 will continue the post-<em>Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>narrative and pick up where <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-71-release-date" rel="nofollow">Patch 7.1 left off</a>, and it will also bring new raid encounters, as well as the new Occult Crescent activity, which is set to continue the legacy of&nbsp;<em>Shadowbringers</em>' Bozja or&nbsp;<em>Stormblood</em>'s Eureka.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7.2-release-date-raids.jpg?itok=elf4Qwc6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7.2-release-date-raids.jpg?itok=BL-nOJpu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s Patch 7.2 launches on March 26th.</figcaption></figure><p>As usual, the new story will bring with it a new dungeon, the Underkeep, for you and your friends (or randoms!) to explore, and you can also expect four more Arcadion raid encounters to test your mettle, as well as a trial to face during the main story.</p>

<p>The real star of the show this time around, however, is the Occult Crescent, a new Field Exploration activity that you can take on alongside many other&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>players. It won't be arriving until Patch 7.25, though.</p>

<p>Patch 7.2 will also bring with it a new Unreal-difficulty Hells' Kier trial, in which you'll be able to take on a significantly more powerful Suzaku. This one's going to take all your skill (probably).</p>

<p>The full patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2 have not yet been released, but you can likely expect them closer to the update's launch, so you'll need to wait a little bit to see whether they've nerfed Dark Knight. Knowing my luck, probably.</p>




<p><em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2 launches on March 26th. The game, and its latest expansion&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail</em>, are available to play right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/39210/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ardenfall">Ardenfall</a> is almost cheeky in how close it is to a classic 'thesda game," Alice Bell wrote of the demo to this open-world <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> back in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/is-this-indie-fantasy-rpg-the-morrowindlike-youve-been-looking-for">Aliceful year of 2023</a>. She also asked me about my own propensity for game discovery in my staff writer interview, to which I replied she knew I was OK at it because she nicked the idea for the Ardenfall article from a comment I left. Good taste, Alice, and good taste, me: Ardenfall is great fun. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154960/Ardenfall/">It's had a demo kicking</a> around since 2022, and now it's set for an early access release this year.

<p>Ardenfall is notable for its lack of marauding 'go here next' fingers. Instead you'll navigate its world through NPC hints and the original signposting itself, signposts. There are factions, conversation stats, quest reactivity, all that good stuff. As for combat, here's reliable old mate Steam with the goods:</p>
<blockquote>"Choose your weapon. Now choose another. If you are stuck, there’s always more options to get you out of a bind - a throwing potion, a single use spell, or a throwing knife of fire may do the trick. A mage specialized in summoning may spawn a great beast to do their bidding, while a thief may toss a potion of silence on their targets to ensure a clean kill".</blockquote>
<p>It's from sixteen-strong Spellcast Studios. That number includes voice actors, and they've been working on the game for seven or so years now. I imagine a good chunk of that time was spent on making every NPC killable, charmable, or stealable-fromable. Time well spent, say I.</p>
<p>*The official RPS term for 'trailer'. Unless Edwin ends up editing this, in which case I have no idea how that got there. <em>["troll-troll", morelike - Ed]</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Square Enix has announced a crystal-shattering sales milestone for the Final Fantasy franchise. Worldwide, the RPG series has now topped 200 million copies sold, with the achievement apparently coinciding with the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series surpassing 5 million units sold.</p><p dir="ltr">The official Final Fantasy account <a href="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1900396747647754617" rel="nofollow ">on X</a> shared the Ifrit-sized accomplishment for the series. The post also thanks players for "wherever you joined us on our adventures." The RPG franchise began in 1987 with the original Final Fantasy, with the most recent mainline addition being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/" data-ref-id="1900-6418081">Final Fantasy XVI</a> in 2023. Last year saw the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, and the remake made its way to PC at the beginning of this year. In fact, the game starring Cloud Strife and crew <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sets-a-new-record-for-the-longtime-series/1100-6529033/">set a Steam concurrent-players record for the series</a>. The PC release has also led to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth becoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/#1">one of 2025's best-selling games so far</a>. It's an intriguing development after Square Enix noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-says-final-fantasy-16-and-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-didnt-meet-sales-expectations/1100-6526552/" data-ref-id="1100-6526552">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Final Fantasy XVI failed to meet sales expectations</a> in September.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1900396747647754617" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series has sold over 5 million copies worldwide, and the Final Fantasy series has now sold over 200 million copies across the globe!<br>Wherever you joined us on our adventures, thank you. <a href="https://t.co/6eoIoDBXh0" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/6eoIoDBXh0</a></p>  — FINAL FANTASY (@FinalFantasy) <a href="https://twitter.com/FinalFantasy/status/1900396747647754617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series--consisting of the first six mainline games in the franchise--originally launched on PC and mobile devices in 2021. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-collection-is-coming-to-consoles-on-april-19/1100-6513014/">Square Enix then brought the Pixel Remaster series to Switch and PS4</a> in April 2023, with an Xbox Series X|S release happening in 2024. Speaking of Microsoft, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xivs-full-xbox-release-date-confirmed-alongside-free-game-pass-expansions/1100-6521644/">Final Fantasy XIV finally arrived on Xbox Series X|S</a> last year, too. The MMO's success has actually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-will-bring-more-games-to-xbox-after-final-fantasy-14s-success/1100-6526160/" data-ref-id="1100-6526160">led to Square Enix promising more of its games for Xbox</a>. </p><p dir="ltr">The Final Fantasy franchise hitting 200 million copies sold puts it in rarefied air. For example, earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/capcoms-best-selling-game-franchises-of-all-time-and-whats-next-for-each/2900-6294/#20">Capcom revealed that the company's best-selling franchise is Resident Evil</a> with 176 million copies sold, followed by Monster Hunter with 108 million. Meanwhile, Call of Duty is in a whole other stratosphere with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/">the FPS franchise passing 500 million copies sold</a>. There's also the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sales-reach-99-million-units-on-switch-alone/1100-6527600/">Pokemon series, which has sold 99 million units on Switch alone</a>.</p>
