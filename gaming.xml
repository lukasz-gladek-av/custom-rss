From a practical standpoint, this is helpful during the character creation process if you want your Rook’s body to look a certain way, it’s easier to do that when their shirt is off. <em>Game Informer</em> asked if there would be nudity elsewhere in the game, to which director Corrine Busche responded, “This is a mature RPG.”</p><p>As for whether or not <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> will follow <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-genitals-character-customization-options-1850616353&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-genitals-character-customization-options-1850616353"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3's</em></a></span> example and include genitalia, BioWare apparently told <em>Game Informer </em>the studio wants fans to discover for themselves. That isn’t a resounding “yes,” but it’s a weirdly evasive answer if it’s “no.” Not to say that it’s impossible that they would avoid giving a direct answer if it’s disappointing news, but that’s also just setting yourself up for backlash if you tease discovering something that’s not there. Notably, you can customize your Rook’s bulge in the character creator, but it remains to be seen if that goes anywhere beyond how their underwear fits them.</p><p>Nudity has become a pretty standard affair in BioWare games over the years.

Once in development, the project took on party game elements and “casual-friendly mechanics,” but Riot Games ultimately decided to walk away, in part because of the perceived failure of <em>MultiVersus</em>, a Warner Bros. crossover fighter that made a massive splash in 2022 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/multiversus-return-review-fps-laggy-locked-characters-1851506741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-return-review-fps-laggy-locked-characters-1851506741">but then went offline for months before relaunching to much less fanfare</a></span>. </p><p>Around 80 people were apparently working on <em>Pool Party</em> up until its cancellation in May. Now some have been reassigned while others were laid off. “We always have a number of projects in various phases of R&amp;D, and spinning projects up and down happens multiple times a year,” a spokesperson for Riot told Klimentov. </p><p>Riot Games is still working on a 2v2 <em>League of Legends </em>fighting game planned for release in 2025 called <em>2XKO</em>, and it also has an MMO based in the universe in development. Since the MOBA blew up, there have also been autobattlers and card-based spin-offs, as well RPGs, indie action games, and platformers all based around <em>League</em> characters. Riot Forge, the division responsible for publishing these games developed with outside studios, was shut down earlier this year amid 500 layoffs.</p><p>For its part, <em>MultiVersus</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/multiversus-review-smash-bros-batman-1851572599&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-review-smash-bros-batman-1851572599">remains a fun game trapped in a terrible free-to-play grind</a></span>. There’s nothing stopping Warner Bros. from eventually turning it around but it’s clear its needs a new model to build off of. Still, it would be cool to see more companies take a stab at the platformer fighting genre. Maybe a <em>Dragon Ball Z </em>game could be the one that cracks the<em> Smash Bros.</em> code. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This headset is slimmer with better ergonomics than the Quest 2, making it more comfortable to wear. Dual 2,064 x 2,208 LCDs with a 120Hz refresh rate ensure crisp, smooth visuals, while pancake lenses, a wider 110-degree field of view, and other optical improvements make for a better viewing experience.

It delivers a sort of augmented reality, thanks to the stunning almost 4K displays that use 12 cameras to track the world around you and put it right into your eyes. Interacting with the headset involves mostly gestures using not only your fingers but your eyes; it’s not always consistent though still something to marvel at.  </p><p>Now, the Apple Vision Pro doesn’t offer VR games at the moment, but there are a few Apple Arcade games designed for the Vision Pro that use augmented reality, interacting with the space around you. If you’re looking to watch movies or take advantage of Apple TV’s immersive video, be prepared for wildly realistic, reality-bending experiences. When you want to work, you can place your <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-macbooks-to-buy"><u>MacBook</u></a> screen on the Vision Pro, as well as messages and other windows all about the space around you for easy access. </p><p>Admittedly, this headset isn’t perfect, from its exorbitant price tag to the less-than-comfortable design and lackluster battery. But the Apple Vision Pro demonstrates the exciting possibilities of how we will be interacting with this technology down the road. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/09/13/vlcsnap-2022-09-13-16h10m51s464-1663111134487.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Headset and sense controllers of the PlayStation VR2</figcaption></figure></output><h2>4.

Coming in at $550, this VR headset costs more than the console itself, but all the features on offer, from the built-in tracking cameras and eye tracking to the two tactile Sense controllers with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, make it worth the splurge. And unlike the original, the setup is simple, as you just plug in a single USB-C, do a bit of calibration, and you’re ready to go. </p><p>After you’ve got everything configured and the PlayStation VR2 resting comfortably on your head, you’ll enjoy 4K OLED panels offering HDR, a 120Hz refresh rate, and 110-degree FOV for some super smooth, gorgeous images to keep you immersed in the action. You’re truly getting PC-level VR in a headset with more features and better specs than many pricier PC VR headsets, like the Valve Index and HP Reverb G2. However, you, unfortunately, can’t play any of the expansive library of PC VR games or even a majority of the original <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-psvr-games">PSVR games</a> on this new headset, so you’re limited in what you can play currently.</p><p><em>See more </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-headset"><em>PS5 headsets</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>5.

If you want to play some of your PC VR games, this headset lets you do so wirelessly via a WiFi 6/6E connection. You can also hook it up directly to your <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-pc">gaming PC</a> via USB-C, which means you can lose the swappable battery pack on the back of the device, making the headset lighter with more of a glasses-type vibe. </p><p>The Vive XR Elite operates at a smooth 90Hz, and with a 1,920 x 1,920 pixels per eye resolution, it almost eliminates any screen door effect. Headphones on the headset deliver spatial audio for greater immersion in the action. Of course, you also get full motion tracking with four cameras and a depth sensor, and it comes with two motion controllers. However, the high cost is somewhat hard to justify, given many of its feature match the Meta Quest 2, which is less than half the price. </p><h2>6.

It's perfect for titles like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-alyx-review"><u>Half-Life: Alyx</u></a>.

To determine which VR headset is right for you, keep these key things in mind:</p><h3>Platform</h3><p>The best VR headset is the one you can (and will) actually use. If you already have a beefy gaming PC, or are willing to spend serious cash to buy or build one, and you have space in a room large enough for room-scale VR, grab a SteamVR headset, which will give you the best experience, overall.</p><p>If you want the ability to play on a standalone system without a PC or you want a flexible setup where that is an option – get the Meta Quest 3.</p><h3>Games</h3><p>If there are any exclusive games you want to play, that is another huge factor. Buying the excellent PSVR2 will get you access to a bunch of great exclusive <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-heads-on-guide-to-the-playstation-vr2-games-to-consider-first-updated">PSVR2 games</a>, but that doesn’t do you any good if you want to play Half-Life: Alyx. </p><p>Moreover, buying into the PSVR2 means you will be dependant on Sony to release more games and support it, while the PC-centric nature of the other platforms gives you more flexibility in how the headsets can be used.</p><p>SteamVR works on basically all of the PC-based headsets, which is great. Meta also has some exclusives, and although they may be playable on SteamVR devices with <a href="https://github.com/LibreVR/Revive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Revive</u></a>, there is no guarantee. The Apple Vision Pro doesn't even offer VR gaming at the moment, while only a select few Apple Arcade games let you take advatage of augmented reality on the headset. </p><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/07/Valve-Index-720x405.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3>Resolution &amp; Refresh Rate</h3><p>Performance is always incredibly important in gaming, but this can actually impact your health, too. While low resolutions can result in the “screen door effect,” which makes things look worse, poor frame rates and resolution can also cause eye strain and even motion sickness. While these normally occur at refresh rates lower than 90Hz, your mileage may vary. </p><h3>Stationary vs Room-Scale</h3><p>The most immersive VR experience is the room-scale one. Being able to move about freely (called “six-degrees of freedom”), jump, crouch, and move around lets you truly experience the wonder of VR. Realistically, not everyone has room, or the ability, to participate in that.</p><p>If you have limited mobility, or don’t have room in your home, options that only track head movement instead of body movement is the way to go. This is perfectly suited towards watching movies, and similar activities.</p><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2018/04/OculusGoProductShot-720x480.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3>Tracking System</h3><p>Much like the difference between Station VS Room-Scale, the tracking system is also really important and it will influence how your headset feels to use. </p><p>The Meta Quest 3 and more use inside-out tracking, which means the headset tracks your movement using cameras and sensors built into the headset. This means you don’t have to set up external cameras around your room, but it also means it’s less accurate.</p><p>If you are operating in a smaller space, or are a more casual user, inside-out tracking might be for you. If you want the best experience and have access to extra room, pick a headset with external tracking.</p><a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2019/07/HTC-Vive-Wireless-Adapter-720x405.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3>Wired vs Wireless</h3><p>This originally wasn’t a choice at all. The first VR headsets had cables, but lately more and more wireless options are becoming available. Like many of the other choices on this list, this basically comes down to “freedom” vs “performance.” </p><p>While wireless sets mean you won’t trip over a cable, and you can wander more freely in a larger space, wires aren’t that obtrusive once you get used to them, and they will give your headset higher bandwidth, which generally means the best resolution and image quality. Having a wire also means you don’t have to worry about headset batteries running out.</p><p>If that is important to you, picked a wired set, although there are several very high quality sets that can be used both wired and wirelessly, which is a great way to go if you aren’t sure what you want.</p><p>VR has tons of promise, and not just in the gaming space. As the years go on, you may be able to attend concerts for all of your favorite bands, visit other planets in our solar system, and more, all from the comfort of your own home. Follow our guidelines, and we hope you’ll discover a whole new frontier of entertainment, education, and more.</p><h2>VR Headset FAQ</h2><h3>What's the Difference Between VR and AR?</h3><p>Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are terms often thrown around in the gaming world but have some distinct differences. </p><p>AR is a much more accessible technology, as almost anyone with a smartphone can use it. With AR, you get virtual features in the real world, often through your phone or headset’s camera. One of the best examples of an AR game is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/pokemon-go-review"><u>Pokemon Go</u></a>, where you use your phone's camera to navigate through the real world, and virtual elements, such as Pokemon or PokeStops, appear. You can even interact with these elements through your device. But, of course, they are not actually physically in front of you. Augmented reality is just adding to your current surroundings. Apple's Vision Pro uses AR in extremely fun and innovative way. </p><p>VR uses some aspects of AR but takes things to another level by eliminating the real-world setting. Instead, your entire world is computer generated, so it doesn’t matter where you’re actually physically located. All of your surroundings are replaced, and what you see is controlled by a computer system. Therefore, headsets block out the real world, blindfolding you for a fully immersive experience. Some great VR game examples are Half-Life: Alyx, which places you in a dystopian sci-fi universe, or the PSVR 2 version of Gran Turismo 7, where you’ll be residing in the cockpit of a car. </p><h3>What's a Good Meta Quest 3 Alternative?</h3><p>The Meta Quest 3 appears to be in a league of its own with its standalone functionality, impressive motion tracking, and budget-friendly price. That means finding a suitable alternative is a challenge. </p><p>Of course, you could go with the Meta’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/ynbxr?object_uuid=5be0d017-7638-49d9-8db6-ad3144c5483d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>Quest Pro</u></a>, but it’s pricey and not even meant to play games. The  <a href="https://zdcs.link/nJpx4?object_uuid=5be0d017-7638-49d9-8db6-ad3144c5483d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>HTC Vive XR Elite</u></a> offers similar specs to the Quest 3 and even lets you play PC VR games wirelessly over a WiFi 6/6E. However, the astronomical $1,000 price is hard to justify when you get very few extras and can snag the Quest 3 for $500.  </p><p>That leads us to our best Meta Quest 3 alternative: the <a href="https://zdcs.link/LY40P?object_uuid=5be0d017-7638-49d9-8db6-ad3144c5483d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>Pico 4</u></a>. The Pico 4 and Quest 2 have a lot in common, as they’re both standalone wireless headsets, run on a similar processor, and support PC VR. A longer battery life, lighter design, more clarity, and a wider field of view even give the Pico 4 a slight edge over the Quest 3. But as great as the Pico 4 sounds, it has limited availability in the US, sometimes making the reasonably priced headset more expensive stateside. If you decide to grab the Pico 4, be sure to do research and shop around before purchasing. </p><h3>What VR Doesn't Need a PC?</h3><p>The majority of VR requires a PC to function, which can be difficult if you don’t have a powerful computer ready to run these often graphically intensive games or want freedom in where you play. Luckily, there are a few standalone VR headsets and options that run on other devices. </p><p>You can use <a href="https://zdcs.link/7LnE4?_ga=549648315.1689878480&amp;object_uuid=5be0d017-7638-49d9-8db6-ad3144c5483d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>Meta Quest 3</u></a> and the whole lineup of Meta headsets without being connected to a PC thanks to powerful processors. But if you’re looking to play some PC VR offerings, you can always link Meta Quest to your PC. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/LY40P?_ga=549648315.1689878480&amp;object_uuid=5be0d017-7638-49d9-8db6-ad3144c5483d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>Pico 4</u></a> is another great standalone option similar to the Quest 3. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/3y0GV?object_uuid=5be0d017-7638-49d9-8db6-ad3144c5483d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>HTC XR Elite</u></a> is also ready to run VR apps and games sans a connection. </p><p>Those with a PlayStation 5 can grab <a href="https://zdcs.link/yNXmJ?_ga=549648315.1689878480&amp;object_uuid=5be0d017-7638-49d9-8db6-ad3144c5483d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>PlayStation VR2</u></a> for a truly spectacular VR experience, though you can’t use the headset with PCs. There are also a few <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-smartphone"><u>smartphone</u></a> VR options, like the <a href="https://zdcs.link/xmRxP?_ga=549648315.1689878480&amp;object_uuid=5be0d017-7638-49d9-8db6-ad3144c5483d&amp;t=article" target="_blank"><u>Atlasonix VR Headset</u></a>, but don’t expect too much from these <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-budget-vr-headset"><u>budget VR headsets</u></a> that use your phone’s screen. </p><p>Of course, Apple's Vision Pro is an extremely powerful standalone device. But it'll easy integrate into the Apple Ecosystem and connect to MacBooks for an innovative way to work on your devices. </p><h3>Does the Nintendo Switch have VR?</h3><p>Yes, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-oled-review"><u>Nintendo Switch</u></a> has VR and a handful of VR games, but it's relatively simple and lackluster compared to what the VR headsets are capable of on this guide. </p><p>For the Switch, you’ll usually rely on the device's own screen and slot it into a headset. One of the most popular options is the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/08/24/nintendo-labo-variety-kit-review"><u>Nintendo Labo VR Kit</u></a>, which features fun-shaped cardboard designs that you create yourself. Otherwise, you’ll find slightly more robust options with straps. There is a convoluted process to using the Switch with a more high-tech VR headset. However, it’s quite complicated and requires additional hardware. So, if you’re looking for a more immersive experience when playing the gaming handheld, you’re better off grabbing one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-headset"><u>best Nintendo Switch headsets</u></a> than seeking out VR. </p><h3>What’s Happening to Windows Mixed Reality? </h3><p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features?ranMID=24542&amp;ranEAID=kXQk6*ivFEQ&amp;ranSiteID=kXQk6.ivFEQ-6pAo6xZ0fzKuurNjBeYk_Q&amp;epi=kXQk6.ivFEQ-6pAo6xZ0fzKuurNjBeYk_Q&amp;irgwc=1&amp;OCID=AIDcmm549zy227_aff_7593_1243925&amp;tduid=(ir__otcxelxkeskfdjffe90lummxmn2x9ezjbgvr0xpp00)(7593)(1243925)(kXQk6.ivFEQ-6pAo6xZ0fzKuurNjBeYk_Q)()&amp;irclickid=_otcxelxkeskfdjffe90lummxmn2x9ezjbgvr0xpp00" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Microsoft has announced it will be forgoing support of Windows Mixed Reality</u></a>, its virtual and augmented reality platform, in a future Windows software release expected in late 2024. This will include both the Portal app and SteamVR driver, which are necessary for the Windows Mixed Reality headsets to function. The VR headsets should continue to work with Steam until late 2026. After that, there will be no updates or technical support.</p><h3>When Do VR Headsets Go on Sale?</h3><p>Although some of the best VR headsets never actually get discounted, there are generally a few times a year when you can find discounts on popular models. One of the overall best shopping events for VR discounts is <a href="https://www.ign.com/events/amazon-prime-day">Amazon Prime Day</a>, which takes place in July every year. After that, <a href="https://www.ign.com/events/black-friday">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday tend to have the best overall deals consistently. Both events tend to primarily offer <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-meta-quest-deals">Meta Quest deals</a>, but sometimes other headsets are avaialable at a discount.</p><p><em>Brian Barnett writes reviews, wiki guides, deals posts, features, and more for IGN.

			<p>NetEase's free-to-play survival game Once Human is out now on PC, available for download via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> or <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/once-human-b5c576" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>. We've been following it ever since it <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-receives-a-new-trailer-at-pc-gaming-show-2023-preview-pc-beta-test-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed up</a> on PC Gaming Show's 2023 Preview in late 2022. Over time, Once Human garnered a sizable following, becoming Steam's fifth most-wishlisted upcoming game and the most-played demo at the latest Steam Next Fest.</p>
<p>It's early to judge its success, but the game has already <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2139460/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broken into Steam's Top 10 chart</a> with over 131K concurrent players. We'll have to wait at least until the weekend to evaluate its peak potential, though. Meanwhile, let's recap what it is all about. The setting is firmly in the so-called 'New Weird' genre, and the developers have cited SCP Foundation, Lovecraftian Horror, and post-apocalyptic aesthetic in general as inspirations.</p>
<p>The premise is that a mysterious alien substance known as Stardust has contaminated Earth, reducing the planet to a post-apocalyptic state and turning life as we knew it into a twisted nightmare. Players, however, step into the role of Metahumans, who can resist the contamination and use Stardust to get more powerful. That said, this is still a survival game, so you must take care not to consume polluted food or water, as that would reduce your Sanity. When your Sanity drops, your max Health drops accordingly.</p>
<p>At launch, the world of Once Human includes five regions, five factions, and over fifty types of Deviants spread across more than one hundred Strongholds. Fans who played the previous test events will be able to continue the main storyline in the new "Blackheart" region, where players will encounter new enemies and uncover more secrets of the apocalypse, as well as a host of new open-world side quests. Lowe will also feature more Deviant challenges, including Identity V and Paper Doll from the Onmyoji series.</p>

<p>Building your own Sanctuary is a major feature of Once Human. These homes can be constructed anywhere in the wilderness and decorated to your liking. Players will be able to safeguard their hard-earned treasures behind walls and protect them with an arsenal of defensive weapons.</p>
<p>Servers support up to 4000 players, a much higher count than the average survival game, allowing players to form alliances or wage war on others. On that note, a new PvP mode called Highway Pursuit has been added to the game, offering special reward vehicles and providing attacking players with valuable loot if they seek it out. However, entering the vicinity of each vehicle will enable PvP, so players are advised to take caution when others are nearby.</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch of Once Human, pre-registered fans can claim the AKM skin "The Call of the Giant Octopus," a Meta's Cap, a piece of furniture, and a pair of Dragon Fist gloves. New players can complete missions or invite friends to join in order to receive gifts including cosmetic items and accessories.</p>

			<p>If you've been looking for a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/sleight-of-hand-is-a-neo-noir-stealth-sim-featuring-a-betrayed-witch/">future-noir</a> detective game, keep your eyes and ears out for Nobody Wants to Die. IGN recently released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8nEFbaXBZE">10-minute exclusive gameplay </a>video showing off some of the features you can expect to see when the game releases on July 17.</p>
<p>Taking place in New York in the year 2329, the game guides you through an alternate universe where technology has advanced enough to offer humans eternal life. In this universe, humans' memories can be stored in memory banks or transferred between bodies. However, there is a hefty price to pay if you want to be able to participate.</p>
<p>Critical Hit Games has been developing this game in Unreal Engine 5, giving way to beautiful graphics that coincide with a dark, twisty story. You get to play as a detective who has to find a serial killer who is targeting the elite citizens of the city. However, it's not as cut and dry as it looks, as you must decide between good and evil.</p>
<p>Nobody Wants to Die has been in development for four years, with its release date just around the corner. At the time of writing, there are only seven days left until the release of this game, where you can play it on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>You will step into the shoes of a hardened detective who must navigate the paths of right and wrong while uncovering clues. You will also experience a dystopian thriller setting that will keep you on your toes, even when you feel like you're safe.</p>
<p>For fans of intense, sci-fi environments with beautiful graphics, you'll want to keep your eyes on Nobody Wants to Die. Some features feel similar to BioShock's, while others have a similar vibe to L.A. Noire as you rely on heavily advanced technology to record clues and keep track of it all to begin piecing together the case.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nobody Wants to Die - 10 Minutes of Exclusive Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L8nEFbaXBZE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite the imminent release date, the PC system requirements for Nobody Wants to Die haven't been announced yet, but we'll keep an eye out and let you know once they are available.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-an-inconsistent-vacation.924138/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-inconsistent-vacation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From its its initial reveal, the latest <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4e4302ba-dbe4-4f53-915c-e32c80a8c922" href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a> expansion <em>Dawntrail</em> has had some lofty expectations to live up to. It’s the follow-up to a decade-long story arc, which ended strong with <em>Endwalker</em> (despite some issues post-launch.)</p>
<p>And, going into <em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em>, I knew that this would be a more subdued expansion — one that sets things up for the decade to come rather than a bombastic finale. However, even with my lowered expectations <em>Dawntrail</em> still manages to stumble in a number of unfortunate ways.</p>
<h2><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-story.jpg?itok=wfBp4KjW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-story.jpg?itok=jEc6Kh4- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture></h2>
<h2>Heading West</h2>
<p><em>Dawntrail</em> sees the Warrior of Light heading west to the continent of Tural. Here, they must help Wuk Lamat — a character introduced at the tail end of <em>Endwalker</em>’s patch content — become the next leader of Tuliyollal, otherwise known as the Dawnservant.</p>
<p>This objective is the main focus of <em>Dawntrail</em>’s early story, with the player accompanying Wuk Lamat across the various zones of Tural as she competes in the Dawnservant competition. Her rivals in the race to the throne are her brothers Koana and Zoraal Ja, along with the loudmouthed two-headed Bakool Ja Ja.</p>
<p>It’s a far cry from the world-ending stakes that often accompany the Warrior of Light’s journey, with only a hint of danger along the way. This was something I was more than fine with since it almost mirrors the calmer beginning of <em>A Realm Reborn</em>. While you have lots of achievements under your belt, you’re relatively unknown in this new region</p>
<p>Wuk Lamat is absolutely the main focus of this expansion, making her presence known during most of your time in Tural. The Warrior of Light ends up taking a backseat, acting as more of a mentor figure but still getting their time to shine on occasion.</p>
<p>While I can absolutely see why this setup would annoy some people — we have been saving the world for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d8bf02e4-0300-4945-b202-cd234d7225e4" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/final-fantasy-xiv-decade-journey-event-tokyo">over 10 years now</a> — I was personally on board with this different style of story.</p>

<p>However, there are a few things that I think <em>Dawntrail</em> gets wrong that squander this narrative’s potential.</p>
<p>For starters, Wuk Lamat is meant to be treated as someone that means well, yet doesn’t have that much life experience. But at times she often comes across as a little too ignorant, basically not knowing things that the Warrior of Light learns within a few hours of arriving in each area.</p>
<p>The process of becoming a Dawnservant also ends up being a little uninteresting. Each part of the challenge is designed to have the participants learn more about Tural, such as working with the locals to tame an alpaca or cook a regional dish. I get the idea behind it — it’s an easy way to give the player more info on a new region.</p>
<p>My issue with it is that you often learn things that should have been basic knowledge to someone in Wuk Lamat’s position. If she was so dead set on becoming the next Dawnservant and following in her father’s footsteps, then naturally you’d also want to learn more about the place you’d like to rule ahead of time.</p>
<p>Again, her lack of knowledge is not something that’s completely ignored by the story. The problem is that, with how quickly she learns things during <em>Dawntrail</em>, the fact that she basically knew nothing beforehand comes across as strange.</p>

<p>Another issue that also pertains to Wuk Lamat is that, frankly, she’s present for far too much of the story. Sure, she’s essentially the main character of the expansion, yet it takes away screen time from basically everyone else.</p>
<p>This is most felt with both Erenville and Krile. For Erenville, this expansion could have been a good way for the game to give more time to a character that was only briefly present in <em>Endwalker</em>. For Krile, you’re led to believe that she’ll end up being an important character that ties into upcoming events.</p>
<p>In reality, neither really gets the time they need for their respective arcs. Erenville at least has some time to shine, though he’s mostly relegated to commenting on Wuk Lamat’s troublemaking — ironically, you get to spend the most time with Erenville during the one section where Wuk Lamat is barely present.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Krile’s whole plotline is seemingly ignored for 90% of the main story. Her goal of finding out the truth behind her grandfather’s journeys in Tural is pushed to the side outside of the occasional mention. And when it does become the focus, it’s all resolved without that much fanfare.</p>

<p>Without going into spoiler territory, <em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em>’s main plot also ends up falling into <em>Stormblood</em>’s familiar pitfall: it tries to tell multiple stories without having enough time to deal with each. Conflicts are started and resolved within a few levels, because that’s all the story structure has time for.</p>
<p>The Dawnservant section comes across as an abridged version of a previous draft due to ending partway through the expansion. In fact, this might be why the competition plotline is used at al,l since it had to be crammed into half an expansion.</p>
<p>From there, what comes after is also not quite given the time it needs. This partially plays into the problems I mentioned earlier with Erenville and Krile — the former does get a section of their own, but it’s tied to a zone that almost feels like filler at the same time.</p>
<p>In the end, I did like seeing some of the new zones and characters across Tural, even if the actual plot didn’t do much for me. Even Wuk Lamat wasn’t that bad, despite the overexposure and some questionable voice direction for the English dub. However, it’s definitely one of the weaker aspects of <em>Dawntrail</em> for me, and I don’t think the patches will improve things.</p>

<h2>Better Battle Content, Despite Some Strange Job Design</h2>
<p>On the more positive side of things, dungeon content is better than it’s ever been.</p>
<p>For a while now, it’s felt like dungeons in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> have been playing it a little too safe. Not just in terms of their layouts (dungeons are still essentially just one long line), but in mechanics. Many bosses in <em>Endwalker</em> would throw out a few different mechanics, and then just loop the same thing again.</p>
<p>In <em>Dawntrail</em>, most of the bosses have more going for them. Mechanics will be remixed for the second half of a boss encounter, and many of them require you to think much faster than before.</p>
<p>You’re obviously not getting anything too extreme (regular dungeon content is designed to be cleared by most skill levels) though I’m happy to have some more engaging content even while leveling.</p>
<p>This extends to the 8-player trials as well, or at least the latter two. Rather than just having a couple of mechanics that don’t evolve, you’re required to keep an eye on how things change later in the fights. It definitely seems like the design team for battle content is trying to challenge players a little more, even if it took five expansions to get to that point.</p>
<p>I’m especially looking forward to <em>Dawntrail</em> raid series The Arcadion, which has the potential to be some of the game’s best battle content if handled right. Hopefully, it lives up to the improvements seen across battle content in the base version of the expansion.</p>

<p>On the other hand, job design is in a strange spot. For some like Summoner, they basically stayed exactly the same (I have no idea what the idea was behind Solar Bahamaut.) Others got some noticeable changes. For Astrologian, the card changes bring it a little closer to the original <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8feee6a6-07ff-44fc-ad5c-26f4edddb08e" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-heavensward-review-children-of-land-do-you-hear"><em>Heavensward</em></a> design (with less RNG).</p>
<p>In the case of Black Mage, changes to rotations and MP regeneration have put the job in a strange spot. So much so that <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/207465951b427acd5cb6e7514a951dacfe30a6c8">changes are already planned</a> for an upcoming patch, which also includes tweaks to Monk and tank enmity generation.</p>
<p>The overall design choice behind jobs in <em>Dawntrail</em> is mostly just to add extra skills that don’t require any extra buttons on your hotbars. Most just transform existing moves into new ones, adding the end of existing combos or buff skills.</p>
<p>In general, I think most existing jobs aren’t much better or worse than in <em>Endwalker</em>. It’s surprising to see that moves with positional damage bonuses are still in the game — for a time, it seemed like these would go away entirely — and I do like some of the additions yo jobs like White Mage and Warrior received.</p>
<p>When it comes to the two new jobs, Pictomancer and Viper, it’s a mixed bag. Pictomancer has ended up becoming one of my new favorite jobs to play. The painting mechanic gives it an identity without being overly complicated to understand, with lots of big damage attacks to make up for downtime.</p>
<p>Inversely, Viper is somewhat underwhelming (though still strong.) Its combos are unique in the sense that you change back and forth between two buttons that transform after each hit. You also have speedy attacks in a similar vein to Monk and Ninja, with many buttons to hit during your burst phases.</p>
<p>But outside of animations — including some cool combined dual-blade attacks — I mostly feel that the transforming combos don’t add that much new to the table.</p>

<h2>A Realm Reborn, Again</h2>
<p>Another key aspect of <em>Dawntrail</em> that applies to all players is the visual changes that have started with the expansion’s launch. Character models have received noticeable touch-ups, the new zones have more detail than before, gear sets are more detailed, and you can even dye (certain) equipment between two dye channels.</p>
<p>This is still a work in progress, as most earlier content is still yet to receive these changes. It can be a little jarring seeing the new character models combined with older gear — in fact, even some of the new characters are using gear with pixelated textures. But for the most part, the team has done a good job of touching up a decade-old game for newer audiences.</p>
<p>While it might still be a few years before everything is improved, and it obviously won't match the visuals of modern-day non-MMO titles, I like what I’ve seen so far.</p>
<p>Oddly, while the game improved visually across the board, the audio seems to have suffered a little bit. Not in terms of music, as <em>Dawntrail</em>’s OST is consistently excellent and keeps up the quality shown throughout each expansion. Instead, it’s the English voice acting that I have some gripes with.</p>
<p>Early <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> was a little weird with English voice acting, some were great but mostly a bit inconsistent. This has improved over the years, with only the occasional outlier bringing it down. With <em>Dawntrail</em>, we seem to have gone back to the inconsistency seen from the early days of <em>XIV</em>.</p>

<p>That’s not to say there isn’t some excellent voice acting, especially when it comes to characters from the non-playable races. Mamool Ja like Bakool Ja Ja and Zoraal Ja are excellently voiced, and many side characters get some quality voiced scenes.</p>
<p>But as mentioned earlier, Wuk Lamat has some weird direction in the English dub. Normal voiced lines are generally quite good, but when it comes to shouts and emotional scenes, she just falls flat. For other characters, there’s occasional strange dialect choice, mispronunciation of terms, or even poor audio quality.</p>
<p>Naturally, a lot of this might not apply to the other languages (Japanese presumably being the most consistent as the source material.) It’s just a shame to see the English voice acting regress in some ways, when other areas continue to improve.</p>

<h2>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>Endwalker </em>was always going to be a tough act to follow, and I’d say that <em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em> falls short in the story department. Though with the main conflicts wrapped up, it does at least mean that the patch content could bring something different to the table.</p>
<p>At the very least, battle content seems to finally be trying to challenge players, even ones that aren’t attempting the Extreme-tier encounters and beyond. I’m looking forward to seeing more dungeons and trails in the following years, along with some of the teased side content that is set to release in later patches.</p>

<p>The esports industry is changing all the time. It seems that every time a new competitive game is released, it has the potential to become a solid esports-focused title with a thriving community. Even if you’re a die-hard fan of the industry, there might be more esports games than you realise. In this guide, we’re breaking down the best esports games in the business, so if you’re looking for something new and intensely competitive to follow, you’ll know where to head next.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-esports-games-right-now">Best Esports Games Right Now</h2>



<p>In no particular order (because we don’t want to cause a fight), let’s take a look at the top esports games on the market.</p>



<h3 id="h-counter-strike-2">Counter-Strike 2</h3>



<p>By numbers alone, Counter-Strike 2 is one of the most popular and iconic esports games in the business. It has been a spearhead of the industry for almost twenty years, and it has given way to some of the most valuable tournaments in the space. It enjoys rampant popularity on PC, with the game consistently sitting at more than one million concurrent players.</p>



<h3 id="h-dota-2">Dota 2</h3>



<p>Dota 2 is a leading MOBA that’s considered one of the most prestigious esports games ever made. It’s the home of one of the most valuable esports tournaments ever – The International. At one point, The International boasted a prize pool worth $40 million, a sum that has only just been beaten by the Esports World Cup ($60 million).</p>







<p>If you’re an esports fan, you’ll have heard of League of Legends, even if it’s not your kind of game. As the number one MOBA title in the world, League of Legends enjoys a vibrant and diverse esports ecosystem made up of superstar players who regularly compete to win millions of dollars. It’s a truly international game with a stunning following.</p>



<h3 id="h-call-of-duty">Call of Duty</h3>



<p>Call of Duty is one of the most popular first-person shooter franchises ever made. It’s more than twenty years old, and since 2010, it has been growing as an esports game. As one of the most prolific franchises in gaming history, Call of Duty enjoys a player base of tens of millions of players, and the competitive side of the series is rich and well-storied. It’s worth stressing that Call of Duty is an umbrella term covering the multiplayer game, Warzone (battle royale) and Call of Duty Mobile.</p>



<h3 id="h-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</h3>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege has been around since 2015, and it’s often considered one of the best esports games <strong>without any doubt</strong>. It has an immense schedule consisting of major tournaments, regional leagues, and a massive international event with a multi-million-dollar prize pool. It’s one of the tougher games for casual players to get into, but it’s a stellar esports game with a bulky following.</p>



<h3 id="h-fortnite">Fortnite</h3>



<p>Fortnite is a household name through and through, but did you know it’s also a prominent esports game? For years, Fortnite has led the charge in the battle royale space, with Epic Games promoting a well-organised and popular esports ecosystem packed with cups, tournaments, and championship-grade events.</p>



<h3 id="h-valorant">VALORANT</h3>



<p>VALORANT was released in 2020 as Riot Games’ attempt to dominate Counter-Strike, and to give the game credit, it has done very well. Since being released, VALORANT has become one of the top esports games in the world, pulling in millions of viewers and skyrocketing in terms of viewership and overall value. </p>



<h3 id="h-overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</h3>



<p>Overwatch 2 has had a hard time, that much is certain. However, Blizzard is intent on turning things around after revitalising the game’s esports scene, scrapping the Overwatch League and inventing something fresh: the Overwatch Champions Series. It’s a great competitive game with some marvellous mechanics, and that’s why it makes this list.</p>







<p>Another great battle royale esports game, Apex Legends enjoys a prestigious spot in the industry thanks to the Apex Legends Global Series, the game’s top-tier tournament ecosystem. Apex Legends is one of the oldest battle royale titles in the business, and there are visions to keep it running for decades – which means it’ll remain as a solid esports game for just as long.</p>



<h3 id="h-pubg">PUBG</h3>



<p>PUBG, and by extension, PUBG Mobile, is a brilliant battle royale game that has an electric esports scene. It’s loved by millions worldwide and is constantly being updated and tweaked – content in the game changes all the time and things are kept as fresh as possible. It has a year-long schedule that’s packed with events both small and massive, which is great for esports fans.</p>



<h3 id="h-rocket-league">Rocket League</h3>



<p>Rocket League is a brilliant entry-level esports game with an easy-to-understand ecosystem. It might be tough to master Rocket League, but watching it unfold on-screen takes very little in the way of understanding. It’s like soccer in that respect. Rocket League went free to play a while ago and soared in popularity, which means there’s a dense pool of competitors out there.</p>







<p>ML:BB is a mobile-based MOBA released in 2016 by a subsidiary of ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. It boasts engaging visuals, a solid gameplay loop, and a nice skill gap, all of which have empowered the game and enabled it to become one of the best esports titles in the world. It has risen to popularity with ease and is regarded as one of the best mobile esports games around.</p>



<h3 id="h-fgc">FGC</h3>



<p>FGC stands for ‘Fighting Game Community’, and it’s a term used to highlight several titles in the genre, from Street Fighter to Tekken, and from Mortal Kombat to Dead or Alive. It’s a hugely popular niche with millions of fans, and watching an FGC match unfold is a thing of beauty, with intense battles exploding on the screen no matter what game is being played.</p>



<h3 id="h-starcraft">StarCraft</h3>



<p>StarCraft (and StarCraft II) popularised RTS esports games over a lengthy period, with many holding firm in the claim that StarCraft II is the <strong>peak </strong>of the genre. While competing titles rose and fell, StarCraft stayed at the top of the table, and today, more than a decade after StarCraft II was released, it still takes centre stage at some of the biggest tournaments in the business.</p>



<h3 id="h-free-fire">Free Fire</h3>



<p>Free Fire is a free battle royale title with immense chops in the esports industry. It once held the record for the most-watched esports tournament ever, before it was dethroned by 2023’s League of Legends World Championship. In 2019, Free Fire became the most downloaded mobile game ever, which is a testament to the title’s insane popularity.</p>



<h3 id="h-honor-of-kings">Honor of Kings</h3>



<p>Honor of Kings is another superstar MOBA, and while it doesn’t compete with the likes of League of Legends, it’s easily one of the best esports games by player count alone. It has a thriving esports scene and has been running for almost a decade, which means it has legs in the industry and has ‘survived’ this long as a competitive title.</p>



<h3 id="h-hearthstone">Hearthstone</h3>



<p>Hearthstone might not be the first title that comes to mind when you think of ‘esports games’, but it’s a legitimate game in that space. It’s a free online card game rooted in a fantasy universe – the Warcraft universe, in fact. It’s from Blizzard, which is a company that knows esports through and through, and by total prize money awarded, it’s a bigger esports game than VALORANT or Apex Legends.</p>



<h3 id="h-halo">Halo</h3>



<p>Halo has had a tough time with viewership in recent years, but there’s no doubting the strength of the series’ origins. It’s considered one of the OG esports games; one of the titles that helped to popularise the industry and turn it into what it is today. Many hardcore Halo competitors gravitated to Call of Duty eventually, presenting a glorious opportunity for fans to switch between the two franchises.</p>



<h3 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h3>



<p>Plenty more esports games exist, and the industry wouldn’t be where it is without them. Here are some of the games that didn’t land a full spot on the list that still matter:</p>



<ul>
<li>Super Smash Bros.</li>



<li>NBA 2K</li>



<li>EA Sports FC</li>



<li>Gears of War</li>



<li>Rennsport</li>



<li>Madden</li>



<li>NHL 2K</li>



<li>Warcraft</li>



<li>World of Warcraft</li>



<li>SMITE</li>



<li>Chess</li>



<li>Brawlhalla</li>
</ul>

<p>So far, we’ve witnessed a rather rough launch and a mixed response to Once Human’s launch on PC. It’s an open-world survival game from developer Starry Studio with an otherworldly horror twist on the usual fare. But it’s also a bit messy right now. The team is working diligently to iron out any issues for the community, but many still have questions about when they can play. Namely, do we know the Once Human PlayStation 5 release date?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-once-human-coming-to-ps5">When is Once Human Coming to PS5?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, there is no official release date for Once Human on PlayStation 5. Developer Starry Studio may wish to port the survival crafting game to consoles, including the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, but it will take time.</p>



<p>For now, the studio aims to focus on the PC launch and then the mobile launch, where they intend to release the game on Android and iOS. There’s currently zero word about a console release, though.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-once-human-on-ps4">Is Once Human on PS4?</h2>



<p>As for the game launching on last-gen systems, it’s still in the cards. The hardware could easily hold up well enough for Once Human, as it’s not an overly demanding game. However, it still falls under the “no current plans” category for the team. </p>



<p>As of right now, you cannot play Once Human on PS4 or PS5; it’s only available on the PC. Is it entirely possible for the game to be released elsewhere? Of course! Will it happen? There’s no telling just yet.</p>



<p>The moment we know more about a console release date for Once Human, we’ll let you know! </p>



<hr>



<p>Despite the launch day issues, Once Human managed to score <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/once-human-brings-in-more-than-100000-players-on-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 120,000 players on day one</a>!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dog-speedrun-sgdq-peanut-butter-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At this year’s Summer Games Done Quick speedrun marathon, Peanut Butter did it again. And this time, he upped the ante. The Air Bud of video games <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2FZKJ4QBdA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speedran <em>Ken Griffey Jr Presents Major League Baseball</em></a>, but unlike his remote performance <a href="https://aftermath.site/speedrunning-dog-interview-peanut-butter-agdq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during January’s Awesome Games Done Quick event</a>, he did so in-person/dog, amidst the potentially-distracting din of a live audience. The crowd went absolutely ballistic as Peanut Butter cracked a homer to seal the deal. But the big day wasn’t without its hiccups.</p><p>It is one thing for a dog to press buttons and eat treats from the comfort of his own home; it’s something else entirely to get an excitable pup to repeat that performance in front of a horde of screaming people. But <a href="https://x.com/JSR2gamers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JSR</a>, the speedrunner and electrician who’s spent years teaching Peanut Butter how to game, had faith that he could pull it off. The man-dog duo would just need to eliminate as many distractions as possible. SGDQ’s organizers helped by restricting access to the room after the run began, to provide “<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/events-conferences/summer-games-done-quick-is-restricting-access-to-one-of-tonights-events-to-provide-the-most-comfortable-environment-for-the-speedrunner-because-the-speedrunner-is-a-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most comfortable environment</a>” possible for PB.</p><p>Everything was going according to plan. Then somebody fell over.</p><p>"I asked [organizers] to keep staff and photographers away from PB's backside during his run, as PB gets distracted when he knows people and goings on are behind him,” JSR told Aftermath. “Of course, 15 seconds before we went live, somebody tripped and fell [onto] the stage. If you watch the run back, PB was very distracted during the first inning."&nbsp;</p><p>It was a less-than-ideal turn of events, but JSR had prepared Peanut Butter for all eventualities.&nbsp;</p><p>"To prepare for SGDQ, my buddy Chrispy and I took him to PetSmart to train in front of dogs and puppies, as well as his house where he has four small children living with him,” JSR said. “If PB can perform with screaming kids throwing objects five feet from him, I knew that [the] GDQ crowd wouldn't be any trouble for him."</p><p>While things got off to a dicey start, Peanut Butter locked in after the first inning. The rest, as they say, is dogstory.</p><p>“After that initial shock of the stage trip, which admittedly had me worried he wouldn't perform, he was wonderful!” said JSR. “It was what we trained for, and he performed admirably and almost perfectly. By the end of the game, he had more energy and vigor than he usually does. That was the most energetic he's ever been near the end of the game. I assume it's because he was feeding off the crowd in the vibe, but whatever it was, he was getting stronger as the game went on.”&nbsp;</p><p>This culminated in Peanut Butter’s end-of-game home run, a moment so iconic that it made both <a href="https://x.com/TannerOfDaNorth/status/1809604281672376515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sportsnet</a> and <a href="https://x.com/POLSVOICE11/status/1809388889259274731" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESPN</a>. Immediately after, Peanut Butter scampered into the crowd to receive hundreds or perhaps thousands of pets while chants of “PB” echoed through the room. For a dog, it’s hard to imagine a better outcome – and not just because dogs lack our capacity for pre-visualizing hypotheticals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>JSR</figcaption></figure><p>But it does raise an obvious question: What’s next? Now that Peanut Butter has climbed his Everest, where does he go from here? As far as JSR is concerned, the sky’s the limit. In part this is due to Peanut Butter’s formidable intelligence and composure, but it’s also because he’s working with a new, hyper-versatile dog controller that cost around $1,500 to construct.</p><p>"We built it with multiple configurations in mind," said JSR. "There are 29 holes where a button can be placed, [though] not at the same time; the max amount at once is 21. This affords us a plethora of different options for a setup. Now, we can do multi-button inputs, PB can do two inputs at once, and much more."</p><p>JSR isn’t entirely sure which game he’ll have PB focus on yet, but he’s got “a few” options in mind. One possibility? An all-too-fitting speedrun of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM7IdCa6NNo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Silent Hill 2</em>'s secret dog ending</a>.</p><p>"I've successfully been able to do a run myself, and during that ordeal I figured PB would probably be able to do it too," said JSR. "The inputs are quite simple."</p><p>For now, the canine sensation is taking a much-deserved break after the weekend’s hooplah, but soon he’ll begin training to overcome his next big challenge.</p><p>“Chrispy and I are going to start working with him soon,” said JSR, “and we're hoping for something even bigger and better.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sometimes talking to a new <em>Dragon Age </em>fan can feel like walking on eggshells until you get a sense for where they fall on the community’s most hotly debated topics. Are they an <em>Origins </em>purist? A Templar apologist? Are they insistent that you must play every single one of <em>Origins</em>’ DLC packs for the full experience?

Each <em>Dragon Age </em>game has a different protagonist, and that trend is continuing into <em>The Veilguard </em>as Rook replaces the Inquisitor from <em>Inquisition</em>. However, the Inquisitor’s story is nowhere near finished by the time <em>Inquisition</em>’s over, and it’s only made more personal for them at the end of the <em>Trespasser </em>DLC. However, I know that suggesting that the Inquisitor should have been the protagonist fighting Solas in <em>The Veilguard </em>will inevitably get you responses pointing out how <em>Dragon Age </em>has always changed protagonists and to question if that’s effective or not is to question the natural order. So no matter how unsatisfying a former protagonist’s role in the continuation of their own story is, do not suggest that there is a better way, because someone will try to explain away your concerns.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4021affd6421c5289e357e50279bc3d8" data-recommend-id="image://4021affd6421c5289e357e50279bc3d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varric holding Bianca." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Varric holding Bianca." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4021affd6421c5289e357e50279bc3d8" data-recommend-id="image://4021affd6421c5289e357e50279bc3d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varric holding Bianca." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Look, everyone has their preferred characters in a party-driven RPG, and sometimes you might not align with the perceived consensus.

But you could also argue that it’s a fascinating microcosm of game design that even if it does bring the pacing of <em>Origins </em>to a screeching halt, it’s worth respecting—no, no, the meme must live on.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7ed1953e128128ef2b50ce5b96231981" data-recommend-id="image://7ed1953e128128ef2b50ce5b96231981" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anders defends another mage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Anders defends another mage." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ed1953e128128ef2b50ce5b96231981" data-recommend-id="image://7ed1953e128128ef2b50ce5b96231981" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anders defends another mage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/GoggleboxQuotes/status/1153736715980484614&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/GoggleboxQuotes/status/1153736715980484614" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“We all like a bad boy though, don’t we?”</a></span></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/GoggleboxQuotes/status/1153736715980484614&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/GoggleboxQuotes/status/1153736715980484614" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Yeah, not a fucking terrorist.”</a></span></p><p>There is at least some nuance to the event in which Anders, <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s possessed revolutionary mage, blows up a church and sparks a war between the mages and templars.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-best-available-handheld-gaming-pcs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Over the last two years, a trend has emerged that doesn’t appear to be going anywhere, anytime soon. I’m talking, of course, about the handheld gaming PC. </p>



<p>From Valve’s Steam Deck that really brought the market to the mainstream to the ASUS ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and upcoming MSI Claw, there are plenty of options on the market for consumers. The worry becomes that it can start to get overwhelming when deciding which option is the best for your needs.</p>



<p>To help you figure out what best suites you, we’ve taken a look at the available devices (no, the Nintendo Switch doesn’t count for this) and put together reasons to either purchase or avoid each handheld gaming PC.</p>



<p>One thing to note, these are all devices that are currently available and have been used by those at Insider Gaming. The MSI Claw, OneXPlayer OneXFly, and more will be added after it’s been used and tested.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-valve-steam-deck">Valve Steam Deck</h2>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Specification</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>CPU</td><td>4-core, 8-thread AMD Zen 2</td></tr><tr><td>GPU</td><td>8-core AMD RDNA 2</td></tr><tr><td>Display</td><td>LCD: 7-inch 1200 x 800 LCD 60Hz<br>OLED: 7.4-inch 1280 x 800 90Hz HDR OLED </td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16 GB LPDDR5</td></tr><tr><td>SSD</td><td>Starting 256GB NVMe SSD (LCD)<br>Starting at 512GB (OLED)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>1.47 lbs</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>11.73″ x 4.6″ x 1.92″</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>Starting at $399.99 for LCD<br>Starting at $549.99 for OLED</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam Deck</a> was the first major player to the market, and it remains one of the best. A Linux-based device, the Steam Deck doesn’t have the same drawbacks that other handheld PCs available have to deal with. There’s no Windows bloat that takes up space, and it’s a lot more friendly to get set up right out of the box.</p>



<p>It’s not the most powerful device, and some games will struggle. But that’s to be expected for a price as low as $399. Some games won’t be able to run at full settings and there are extra steps for games to be labeled as “Steam Deck Verified”. I will say though, most games I’ve played like Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, Lords of the Fallen, and more have had no problem running.</p>



<p>If simplicity and a quick setup is high on your list, then the Steam Deck is a no brainer. And with the OLED version available, one of the biggest problems I have is no longer the cast. The only other real problem I still have with it is its battery life. Depending on the game, I’m lucky to get 90 minutes out of a full charge. You’re also limited to playing just Steam games if you don’t want to learn how to get Battle.net, PlayStation Plus, etc. up and running on your machine. So that could turn some people off.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-lenovo-legion-go">Lenovo Legion Go</h2>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Specification</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>CPU</td><td>AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme</td></tr><tr><td>GPU</td><td>AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme</td></tr><tr><td>Display</td><td>8.8-inch 2560 x 1600 144Hz</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16GB LPDDR5X</td></tr><tr><td>SSD</td><td>512GB SSD</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>1.41 lbs without controllers<br>1.88 lbs with controllers</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>11.76″ x 1.6″ x 5.16″</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>Starting at $699.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/handheld/legion-go/len106g0001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lenovo Legion Go</a> may be the most underrated of the available handheld PCs. To me, it’s the most comfortable of the devices available. The way it just sits in your hands and feels natural helps make longer game sessions feel like nothing. For me, it was hard to go back to the Steam Deck because of the comfort level I had with the Legion Go</p>



<p>What <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lenovo-legion-go-wants-to-be-the-handheld-pc-for-all-gamers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sets it more apart</a> from other handheld PCs are the detachable controllers. It gives off major Nintendo Switch vibes. It gives more flexibility in how you want to play, which helps those who can’t sit there holding the handheld.</p>



<p>It’s a Windows 11 machine meaning you have to do your standard login and utilize the Windows task bars, menus, etc. in order to get to your games. That said, because it’s Windows, getting Battle.Net, Ubisoft Connect, and other launchers installed and set up is a piece of cake. It’s a great option for those that have games on different launchers and want the flexibility of the detachable controllers.</p>



<p>One thing to be aware of is how bulky the Legion Go is. It’s not heavy, but it’s big, sitting at 11.76 inches long. That said, it’s not a turnoff unless you have really small hands or, maybe, want this for a child.  Also, it features a 1600p display which may require you to mess with in-game settings quite a bit to get your games to look the way you want.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-asus-rog-ally">ASUS ROG Ally</h2>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Specification</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>CPU</td><td>AMD Ryzen Z1/Extreme</td></tr><tr><td>GPU</td><td>AMD Ryzen Z1/Extreme</td></tr><tr><td>Display</td><td>7-inch 1920 x 1080 120Hz</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16GB LPDDR5</td></tr><tr><td>SSD</td><td>512GB-1TB NVMe SSD</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>1.34 lbs</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>11.02″ x 4.37″ x 0.83</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>Starting at $499.99/ROG Ally X is $799.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It’s been on the market for a year now and the ROG Ally X is here, showing that ASUS isn’t playing around with its effort on the market. Another Windows 11 system, the ROG Ally offers the same features from a software standpoint as the Legion Go. What will set it apart is your preference of the above specifications and the feel of the device.</p>



<p>As our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-good-asus-rog-ally-one-year-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grant Taylor-Hill said</a>: “It’s a sleek device that has a nice splash of RGB front and centre, which appeals to the gamer in all of us. The face buttons are a good size and are tactile, and the whole setup is made to mimic an Xbox or a PlayStation controller, right down to the sloped triggers and large, curved shoulder buttons.”</p>

The developer has since responded and implemented a change to make the player experience more enjoyable.</p><p dir="ltr">At launch, players were only allowed to create one character in Once Human. The game doesn't allow characters to be deleted, so players were upset to find themselves committed to only one character and asked for the option to be able to create multiple characters to use across different servers.</p>

<h2>Zenless Zone Zero - how to redeem codes</h2><p>Your codes for ZZZ freebies don't do anything if you don't know how to redeem them. First, let's go over that step. There are two ways to redeem ZZZ codes: one on the internet and one via the game itself. If you'd like to do it right from inside the game, open up the More Features menu and select Redemption Codes, which will then allow you to enter the code(s) you have and immediately receive the rewards.</p><p>Alternatively, you can also enter ZZZ codes in a web browser. Go to HoYoVerse's website and find the <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/redemption" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zenless Zone Zero redemption code page here</a>. You may first need to log in if you haven't before, but then the process is just as simple as it is on mobile.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330999-screenshot2024-07-10141422.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330999" data-ratio="0.55242566510172" data-width="2556" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330999-screenshot2024-07-10141422.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330999"></a><figcaption>Here's where you can redeem codes in ZZZ.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4330999-screenshot2024-07-10141422.png"></figure><h2>Zenless Zone Zero codes list</h2><p>Now that you know <em>how</em> to redeem them, let's go over all the codes you can use today and what they'll give you in exchange.

            <p>
Classic side-scrolling beat-'em-up Double Dragon is being reimagined in 3D by Arc System Works, the fighter-focused studio behind the likes of Dragon Ball FighterZ and Guilty Gear.
</p>
<p>
Double Dragon (for those needing a quick history refresher) first made a splash in arcades back in 1987, and has seen numerous sequels, spin-offs, and crossover releases - for both arcade and home systems - in the years since. Arc acquired the rights to the series in 2015, and would go on to release Double Dragon 4 in 2017, albeit to a fairly lukewarm reception.
</p>
<p>
While Double Dragon 4 and last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/double-dragon-gaiden-rise-of-the-dragons-out-this-summer">Secret Base-developed Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise Of The Dragons</a> both leaned heavily on the series' retro lineage, sporting a 2D pixel art aesthetic, Arc System Works has now announced a modern reimagining that'll shift the series into 3D.

<p>
As revealed in the latest issue of Japanese gaming magazine Weekly Famitsu and <a href="http://ryokutya2089.com/archives/77375">reported by ryokutya2089.com</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/arc-system-works-is-working-on-a-new-3d-double-dragon/">VGC</a>), Arc's new series instalment - appropriately titled Double Dragon Revive - is due to launch next year on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.
</p>
<p>
Details are limited, but it'll apparently feature modernised controls and difficulty options, plus classic series characters - including the Lee brothers, Roper, and Abobo - all reimagined in 3D. You can get a glimpse its visual overhaul in the screens below.

Eurogamer contributor Simon Parkin wasn't entirely convinced by Double Dragon 4's slavishly archaic rhythms when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/double-dragon-4-review">reviewed</a> Arc System Works' first original Double Dragon effort back in 2017, so perhaps a more modernised refresh is exactly what the series needs. Expect to hear more ahead of Double Dragon Revive's PlayStation, Xbox, and PC release next year.

Much like he was in that initial encounter, Radahn is an imposing figure who towers over you and wields weapons so massive that they’d make an NBA player feel small. He looks like he hits hard as hell, and somehow manages to hit even harder. Radahn is not a joke. </p><p>Fans of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fromsoftware-ransomware-hack-elden-ring-bloodborne-2-1851564840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fromsoftware-ransomware-hack-elden-ring-bloodborne-2-1851564840">FromSoftware</a></span>’s deep catalog of punishing RPGs have likely come to expect bosses like Radahn from the expansions to these games. One of the hardest bosses in the original <em>Dark Souls </em>was Artorias of the Abyss, who was added to the game in their eponymous DLC. In my opinion, the most riveting fight in <em>Dark Souls 3 </em>is that against Slave Knight Gael at the end of its final DLC, <em>The Ringed City</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-fromsoftware-rpg-goty-ps5-the-doll-1849659930&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-fromsoftware-rpg-goty-ps5-the-doll-1849659930"><em>Bloodborne</em></a></span>’s best fight, and one of FromSoft’s best encounters ever, is the Orphan of Kos at the end of its <em>Old Hunters </em>expansion. FromSoft expansions have always provided some of the very best fights found in these games, not to mention some of the most difficult.<br></p><p>Radahn, however, is seemingly on another level. It’s not really a matter of him being too technically demanding. His difficulty seems to stem from the fact that he’s straight-up unfair.<br></p><p>Radahn’s busted nature has everything to do with his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adU0HMKjDoM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adU0HMKjDoM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">horrendous hitboxes</a></span>. Hitboxes, for those who may not know, can best be thought of as an aura around certain characters and animations. When a hitbox on one character collides with that of another, that informs the game that a hit has connected.<br></p><p>On the <em>Elden Ring </em>subreddit, someone shared a video of their fight against Radahn and paused it to highlight how they had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dygok7/spoiler_dont_trust_the_boss_animation/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dygok7/spoiler_dont_trust_the_boss_animation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taken damage <em>before</em> a swing</a></span> had even connected due to Radahn’s immense hitbox. And theirs isn’t the only story like that. Elsewhere, players are taking damage in the middle of an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1dzhrcx/why_can_the_endboss_hit_you_midroll_tho/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/onebros/comments/1dzhrcx/why_can_the_endboss_hit_you_midroll_tho/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">otherwise perfect dodge roll</a></span>, or catching strays from a stomp attack while clearly standing outside of its area-of-effect. Radahn is unfair for a number of reasons, including some unpredictable and seemingly undodgeable attacks, but the fact that he can deal damage in places he shouldn’t is probably a step too far.</p><p>Some players have taken to calling this the return of <em>Dark Souls 2 </em>hitboxes, which were notably egregious. In response to one of the aforementioned Reddit posts, a user joked, “Close enough welcome back <em>Dark Souls II </em>hitboxes,” while another dubbed the DLC “Scholar of the Erdtree” in reference to <em>DS2</em>’s DLC-inclusive re-release, <em>Scholar of the First Sin</em>. I could sit here and try to regale you with the ins and outs of what folks mean when they invoke that title, or I could point you to this very handy reference.</p><p>What’s funny is that, upon release, <em>Elden Ring </em>was actually acclaimed for some of the ways in which it <em>is </em>nakedly similar to <em>Dark Souls 2</em>. Some saw the new game as a triumphant reclamation of the tenets that were buried by the older’s tepid reception, such as powerstancing (or dual-wielding). Many see <em>Elden Ring </em>as <em>Dark Souls 2</em>’s big brother of sorts, or like a spiritual successor to the black sheep of the <em>Souls </em>games, so it’s hilarious to see the comparison finally invoked in a negative way.</p><p>Radahn doesn’t appear to be alone in this unfairness either. Other players seem to have pieced together that quite a few bosses benefit from the unfair advantage of excessively generous hitboxes, including Messmer’s snake and Rellana, who at one point does a sweeping sword attack that apparently generates a hitbox across the arena before the swing has even come out.</p><p>Radahn in particular has a certain set of players asking for FromSoftware to balance the fight in their favor, which is ironic considering his history in the base game. When <em>Elden Ring </em>launched, Radahn’s boss fight was widely criticized for its difficulty. The complaints got far enough that FromSoft <em>did </em>patch the encounter, which reportedly made the fight fairer, except it also unintentionally paved the way for players to erect an idiotic hierarchy. At the top of it were those who had beaten the “harder” version of the fight prior to it being nerfed, and at the bottom were those who played and beat the fight after. I wonder how many of those at the “top” are pleading for the developers to tune down Radahn now.</p><p>Considering the fact that Radahn has been patched before, I could see FromSoft doing it at least one more time. The studio did recently patch out a strategy that made the fight easier, but it also made a balance change beforehand that eased up on some of the DLC’s difficulty, so there’s really no way to know which direction the team will go in.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
