" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> might not have a release date yet, but Konami has released some new screenshots of the upcoming remake and the game looks awesome. </p><p><em>MGS3</em>'s remake was first announced back in May 2023. Since then we’ve seen some gameplay, some trailers, and some screenshots of the impressive-looking remake of the 2004 entry in the stealth action series<em>.</em> That game was initially released on PS2 and while I think it still looks great today thanks to some really smart art and style choices, there’s no denying that this remake looks more “realistic.” </p><p>On August 26, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/26/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-hands-on-report/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/26/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-hands-on-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony and Konami released 10 new screenshots</a></span> for the upcoming remake via the PlayStation Blog. These new looks at the game come alongside a slew of previews from folks who got a chance to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-delta-remake-performance-mode-60fps-1851631819&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-delta-remake-performance-mode-60fps-1851631819">the first 90 minutes of <em>MGS Delta Snake Eater</em></a></span><em>.</em> According to those previews, the game is basically the PS2 classic, but with a fresh coat of Unreal Engine paint. And that sounds pretty good to me! </p><p>In the new screenshots released by Konami on Monday, we can see all the detail that is being packed into the remake. Sure, you can argue that the PS2 original still holds up, I think it does, but it’s impressive to see such photorealistic depictions of <em>MGS 3 </em>locations, characters, and moments. I don’t think the upcoming remake will replace the original <em>MGS3</em> at all, but as a new spin on the classic stealth action game, it sounds exciting.</p><p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> is set to arrive sometime this year for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/core-keeper-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="105c7ebb-da58-479d-946e-31c72eea19d1" href="https://techraptor.net/games/core-keeper"><em>Core Keeper</em></a> is an exciting mash-up of <em>Terraria</em> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f896d9a3-1981-402e-9f6e-c0b67ed170cd" href="https://techraptor.net/games/minecraft"><em>Minecraft</em></a>. A sandbox adventure, it mixes farming, exploration, and open-world building in a pixel art top-down world. Featuring a compelling story, unique areas, and epic bosses to face down, it offers hours of content for those wanting a different mining experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Core Keeper</em> offers tons of content with over 10 different biomes to explore, each with their own specific resources and enemies. Just getting through the main storyline and defeating the nine different bosses can take upwards of 30 hours. That doesn’t include completing collections, taking on side bosses, building a creative base, or adventuring through the endgame biome, The Passage. For players who want a game that has plenty of bang for the buck, <em>Core Keeper</em> is a solid title.&nbsp;</p>

Your character will start in the dirt biome, but quickly expand into the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="463ddf9e-fce0-47ad-87f9-b33517bcebd6" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/core-keeper-clay-caves-biome-guide">Clay Caves</a> with the Larva Hive and the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="feebb9da-b498-426b-bb53-e3a00c001842" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/core-keeper-forgotten-ruins-biome-guide">Forgotten Ruins</a>. From there, even more variety is found as you travel through a lush jungle, hit the sands with the beach, and mine through rock walls to find the scorching desert. Within the areas are different monsters, vegetation, and ore formations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story itself is an interesting one and is a fun play on Alice falling down the rabbit hole. You end up underground and are looking for a way out. This underground is closer to what you’d find in <em>Journey to the Center of the Earth</em>, versus an actual cave system. First, you need to power the mysterious Core that you appear near, then vanquish more bosses to help the Core out. The ending has quite a twist, and without spoiling, is definitely worth hunting down all the souls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way bosses are found in the game makes the combat experience more rewarding. You need to farm resources to attract most of the creatures to a specific location or along a path they regularly travel. That doesn’t mean you won’t see them flying above you or swimming below your boat. It does mean you'll need to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e3e21d0d-ff28-47c5-a777-48cb0a33554e" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/core-keeper-monster-farm-guide">farm monsters</a> to call the bosses, even when their shadow follows you. It also means you can defeat them multiple times if you want to challenge yourself or run out of their unique loot.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/core-keeper-ancient-forge.jpg?itok=jNbdoOfN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/core-keeper-ancient-forge.jpg?itok=aol8hARe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>All elements of the title are enhanced with the ambient music and sounds that are present as you explore. Popping bubbles on the beach, squelching when facing slimes, and roaring when hitting a boss all add to the immersion. The music tracks are calming and chilling, depending on where you are, and aid in bringing the game to life.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like all sandbox games, the main downfall of <em>Core Keeper</em> is you can end up grinding for resources, especially towards the endgame. Mining for ore, farming specific monsters, and even getting to the areas you want to reach, can add significant time to your playthrough. If you’re someone that doesn’t like grinding or doing the same actions for a length of time, you still want to check out <em>Core Keeper</em>, but should look into <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b83999b8-753b-41f0-9a88-581efe78884c" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/core-keeper-guides-guide-hub">various guides</a> to get those items efficiently.</p>

This is especially the case with the inclusion of world seed and difficulty editing. You can create an easier world for your solo game, but an extremely hard world for playing with friends. You can increase the resources, reduce the possibility of grinding, or decrease certain game aspects you dislike. The customization really brings <em>Core Keeper</em> to the next level when it comes to investing in a game you can continuously play.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Core Keeper Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, Core Keeper is a solid mining sandbox game with some survival mechanics mixed in. It has hours of content to explore, multiple bosses to fight, and an interesting storyline to pull you along. There’s endless creativity on display and it’s worth every penny.</p>
<p>Whether you’re looking for a new game to dive into for long gaming sessions or want something that’s easy to pick up and put down, <em>Core Keeper</em> is the title for you.</p>

                <p>GameSpot checked out the life simulation title InZoi at Gamescom, getting up to hijinks like burning down an apartment, forgetting to eat, and riding every single ride at a beachside amusement park.</p><p>In InZoi you manage both individual "Zois" (think Sims) and the world itself. Each Zoi has personality traits which shape their life goals. You can also customize a daily schedule, letting you manage multiple Zois at once more easily. In contrast to The Sims, you can swap between Zois at any time.</p>

      </div>
<p>As for broader management of the in-game world, you can customize the world's appearance down to furniture and decoration choices. You can also tinker with broad aesthetic sliders, which can make the world more apocalyptic or switch it between biomes. You can even change the general "personalities" of AI-controlled Zois to generally make them amorous, argumentative, inconsiderate, and more.</p><p>The game has a free-roaming structure a la The Sims 3, compared to the lot-based structure of other Sims games. You can leave your apartment or home to explore the rest of the city in a car or on foot. While you can do whatever you want, there is an overarching goal to help the Zois live moral and fulfilling lives. If you succeed, your Zoi will ascend to heaven. If you fail, your Zoi will haunt the city as a ghost. However, you can help ghosts move on by doing more good deeds.</p><p>Take a look at the embedded video for more details. InZoi will launch in early access on PC at a to-be-announced date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-ban-list-update-bans-nadu-from-modern<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has updated their <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> ban list. This is a notable update since the ubiquitous card game's banned and restricted list was updated back in June, which was in the middle of its major competitive scene. This new update is part of a new schedule that coincides with major tournaments, and it contains some notable bans.</p>

<p>In an official blog post, Wizards of the Coast explained the update to their <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> ban list schedule. The post begins with updates to the game's different formats, showing cards that have been added or removed from the banned and restricted list.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-ban-list-update-grief-card-artwork.jpg?itok=I9125zqZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-ban-list-update-grief-card-artwork.jpg?itok=m8n6qRYB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Standard, Alchemy, Historic, Timeless, and Brawl formats are unchanged. In Pioneer and Explorer, <em>Amalia, Benavides Aguirre</em> and <em>Sorin, Imperious Bloodlord</em> are banned. <em>Grief</em> has been banned from Legacy. Vintage format has added <em>Urza's Saga</em> and <em>Vexing Bauble</em> to the ban list. Lastly, <em>Grief</em> and <em>Nadu, Winged Wisdom</em> are banned from Modern.</p>
<p>In the rest of the post, WOTC explains changes to when they will be announcing <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> ban list updates. It acknowledges and apologizes for the issues that come with announcing a ban list during the week of Pro Tour, leading to a breakdown of logistics and player comfort during that time.</p>
<p>Going forward, ban list updates will be aligning with the Regional Championship and Regional Championship Qualifier seasons. This will allow for better adjustments to the competitive play environment and more time to collect and analyze play data. It also means there will be fewer update lists&nbsp; The next one is scheduled for December 2024.</p>
<p>As for the bans themselves, the most notable one is <em>Nadu, Winged Wisdom</em> from Modern format. In a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/on-banning-nadu-winged-wisdom-in-modern">separate post</a> dedicated to discussing the ban, Michael Majors stated the card was "a logistical nightmare" and "a design mistake."</p>
<p>A mistake that was demonstrated during the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/are-modern-horizons-3-collector-boosters-worth-it" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Modern Horizons 3</em></a> Pro Tour where decks built around <em>Nadu</em> had a 59% win rate thanks to several dangerous combos. Infinite mana, shutting down and sweeping opposition. Furthermore, these combos would slow games to a crawl since implementation required a high number of permanents changing zones.</p>
<p>The updated <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> ban list goes into effect today.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-fans-are-ready-to-have-their-hearts-broken-again-by-tuesdays-nintendo-direct<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"46th time's the charm."</h2></div><section><p>A pair of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-and-indie-world-showcase-announced-for-tomorrow-august-27">back-to-back Nintendo Directs</a> have been announced for tomorrow, one focused on indie games and another focused on larger, third-party partners.</p><p>Which means that Hollow Knight fans are once again preparing for inevitable heartbreak if Hollow Knight: Silksong doesn't appear.</p><p>If you've somehow missed this entire saga, Hollow Knight: Silksong is the eagerly-awaited sequel to  2017 Metroidvania Hollow Knight. Hollow Knight was adored by critics and fans alike (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/22/hollow-knight-review">we gave it a 9.4/10</a>), so in 2019 when developer Team Cherry <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/14/hollow-knight-sequel-announced-for-pc-and-nintendo-switch">revealed a sequel</a>, it was met with enthusiasm.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>When Silksong was revealed, it didn't come alongside a release window. But ever since its 2019 unveiling, fans have been foaming at the mouth waiting for it to officially come out. We <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/hollow-knight-silksong-16-minutes-of-gameplay-midgame-at-e3-2019">actually saw</a> the game in action back in 2021, and it's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-trailer">cropped up</a> with <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/hollow-knight-silksong-pc-gaming-show-video">new trailers</a> a few times since, but still no word on when it'll actually drop. At one point, Xbox <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-release-window-next-12-months">appeared to confirm</a> that Silksong would drop before June of 2023, but then that didn't happen. Earlier this year, the game <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-got-an-xbox-store-page-on-april-fools-day-and-fans-dont-know-how-to-feel">got an Xbox store page on April Fools Day</a> of all days, and you can imagine how that went over. There was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-fans-crushed-as-summer-showcases-pass-with-no-silksong-announcement">nothing at any of the major summer showcases in early June</a>, and then <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-not-be-at-opening-night-live-geoff-keighley-confirms">Geoff Keighley had to head folks off</a> before gamescom Opening Night Live and tell them Silksong wouldn't be there either.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just to get this out of the way, no Silksong on Tuesday at ONL. <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamCherryGames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@TeamCherryGames</a> is still cooking. <a href="https://t.co/FlQHlc26zo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/FlQHlc26zo</a></p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1824923122929119364?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The result of this long wait is that every single time there's a games showcase of any kind - a Nintendo Direct, an Xbox or PlayStation showcase, anything Keighley puts on - fans immediately start talking about Silksong. Will it show up? Will they be disappointed again? Almost every time, there's a seeming consensus it won't be there, but that vibe tends to come alongside a kind of desperate longing to be wrong. We're seeing it now, with tomorrow's Nintendo Direct. There's a ResetEra poll where, at the time of this writing, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/poll-will-silksong-make-an-appearance-at-the-indie-direct-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-on-august-27th.963666/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">86% of voters are saying Silksong won't be present</a>. We've got tweets:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If there was ever a time for silksong the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell would be it <a href="https://t.co/h7M8pKZnEI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/h7M8pKZnEI</a></p>— TAHK0 ☕️ (@TAHK0) <a href="https://twitter.com/TAHK0/status/1828070449571680633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>There's<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1f1qvja/surely_this_time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> this increasingly desperate meme</a>:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/26/image-18-1724696567671.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image Source: Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1f1qvja/surely_this_time/">https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1f1qvja/surely_this_time/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p>So will Silksong be at either Nintendo Direct even tomorrow? We have no idea. Team Cherry's been coyly quiet, probably because the studio is focused on the game and can't get hung up on giant internet mobs of people begging them for news. Perhaps this will finally be the event that calms the Silksong storm and gives us a firm date to hope for. Or maybe we're due for several more years of Silksong-less winter.</p><p>Good luck tomorrow, everyone.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/towerborne/" data-ref-id="5000-590951">Towerborne</a> is a pretty drastic departure from the Banner Saga series, developer Stoic Studio's impressive set of story-driven strategy games. But even with just a short look at it, it's easy to see some of the familiar Stoic DNA in Towerborne. It carries a beautiful art style that recalls a hand-drawn aesthetic, similar to Banner Saga, and that gives it a powerful vibrancy.</p><p dir="ltr">I played a short demo of Towerborne at Xbox's recent Gamescom event in Los Angeles, which gave a very quick look at its moment-to-moment combat gameplay. Towerborne is a side-scrolling co-op action-RPG that takes its inspiration from beat-em-ups. There's clearly a lot of inspiration being drawn from old-school arcade entries in the genre, but Towerborne separates itself through a combat system that includes a variety of combos and special moves, offering something a little deeper than just mashing buttons.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 7 Minutes of Towerborne Co-Op gameplay | gamescom 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">First, Towerborne lets you adjust your fighting style based on the weapons your character uses, and from the sound of things, you can change those weapons frequently to give yourself new options. I teamed up with another journalist to run through the demo, starting with a character who dual-wielded daggers. The fighting style for that character was pretty fast and frenetic, slashing away at close range and mixing in kicks for heavy attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">Each character has access to light and heavy standard attacks, which can be linked together to create combos that trigger different attack animations. For instance, I could cut up opponents with my daggers using light attacks, or fire off a heavy combo with a series of kicks, but linking them together triggered a new set of combos in which I could kick some enemies up in the air.</p><p dir="ltr">The combo ability was even more notable for the second character in the build who carried a heavy club with two hands. The blunt end of the club contained something like a furnace that could be used to belch flame and set enemies on fire with certain attacks. Light attacks jabbed with the staff end of the club, while slower heavy attacks swung the club around for big damage. The combination of light and heavy, however, caused the character to take a knee and start using the club like a shotgun, belching flame and setting enemies ablaze. In addition to the damage done by the attack, the flaming enemies also burned for a short period, demonstrating that your weapons and their abilities can have a lot of different uses against enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to standard attacks, you charge up special abilities that are specific to your weapons, all of which run on cooldown timers. My dagger character had a special ability that allowed her to throw a knife at an enemy and then teleport to its location to start an attack, making it easy to cross the battlefield and kick off a fight. I could also throw a series of daggers ahead of me for big damage against a single target, or leap into the air and throw daggers downward, with the knives lingering in the ground to hurt opponents who walked across them. The strongest attack in my arsenal was a magic area-of-effect attack that would cause a massive explosion after a short period. Leaving the trap behind was great to catch small enemies as they charged toward us.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4357417-towerborne_gameplay6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4357417" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4357417-towerborne_gameplay6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4357417"></a><figcaption>Weapon choices seem to drastically change how a character fights in Towerborne.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4357417-towerborne_gameplay6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The club character had some similar moves, one which caused him to spin around like a top and slam enemies with the club for extended damage, and another that had him leaping in the air and blasting the ground with flame to create a damaging effect. Instead of a magic explosion, his AOE attack caused the ground ahead of him to erupt in a straight line.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo's level was a short one, with the two of us working our way across grasslands, fighting off enemies like moles and bandits on our way from right to left. Occasionally, we'd fight off multiple waves that would keep coming, requiring us to smash up an enemy spawn point like a tent. It's fairly standard beat-em-up stuff, but with the variety of moves Towerborne offers in combat, alongside a dodge quickstep and a roll, the game takes on more of a feeling of an ARPG played from a side-scrolling viewpoint. And like in an ARPG, the combat loop in Towerborne puts a big focus on finding the right times to maximize the effectiveness of your abilities and managing their cooldowns.</p><p dir="ltr">The final moment of the demo culminated in a big boss fight with Pangojira, a huge pangolin creature flanked by a bunch of smaller burrowing monsters. With the two of us, we naturally gravitated toward dividing the labor of the fight--focusing on the boss when possible, and splitting up to take out the smaller enemies as they appeared. If we were quick, we could stop the smaller enemies from attacking at all by hitting them as they were burrowing out of the ground, knocking them out in one hit. That became an important way to manage their numbers, as the game would throw what felt like 30 pangolins at us at a time. In addition to the boss, it could be tough to manage, especially because each pangolin could weather a pretty significant beating before dying.</p><p dir="ltr">The boss itself rolled out the kinds of attacks you might expect to see in a beat-em-up like this. It would jump around the arena, sending shockwaves across the ground that we needed to jump over, or throw rocks into the air that would fall all around the battlefield and force us to dodge away. It attacked pretty frequently, too, which meant that it was important for us to get our hits in as fast as possible before getting clear of its very long reach. Towerborne punishes you if you're not paying attention--big hits will send you flying, leaving you stunned on the ground for a while.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4357421-towerborne_pangofight3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4357421" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4357421-towerborne_pangofight3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4357421"></a><figcaption>Pangojira will absolutely clobber you if you're not paying attention.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4357421-towerborne_pangofight3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Movement is a bit clunky and slow, too, which means that you can't rely on just running and dodging to get around enemy attacks; instead, you have to watch your opponents, understand how they move, and anticipate their biggest and fastest blows so that you have enough time to get clear of them.</p><p dir="ltr">If we hit the pangolin boss hard enough, however, we could stun it for a bit, allowing us to deal massive damage with all our abilities. The pyroclast could also use its abilities to set the boss on fire for a little extra chip damage, as well. We tended to divide our labor between me, with my daggers, cleaning up the little guys, while my partner laid into the boss with his harder-hitting moves. There were a few points where the fight got a little hairy--take too much damage and, like in most games, you'll drop to your knees, requiring either a teammate to revive, or burning what seemed to be a spare life to revive yourself. For the most part, though, smart use of our special moves was enough to keep the arena clear of enemies while we whittled down the boss's health to finish it off.</p><p dir="ltr">Our look at Towerborne was pretty brief, focusing only on moment-to-moment combat. We know Towerborne has a lot of live-game systems, is heavily focused on chasing loot, and has a very Destiny-like feel for a lot of its systems--Bungie alumni are among the development team and a few of the choices that evoke the decade-old MMO.</p><p dir="ltr">What we saw, though, has promise. It took a bit to get used to the game, especially in its movement and dodge systems, which are slower than you might expect and thus aren't conducive to twitchy, reactive play, instead requiring you to be more deliberate about how you engage enemies. But that's also in keeping with the arcade beat-em-ups of the '90s that Stoic is riffing on, and the ARPG additions to the gameplay like lots of special moves, alongside deploying interesting combos you can use to exploit enemy weaknesses, feel like smart updates to classic gameplay, at least in our short look at it.</p><p dir="ltr">Towerborne is set to release on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox Game Pass on September 10.</p>

			<p>It's not long until the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-trailer-revealed/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Open Beta</a> is available, with Early Access being available to those who pre-ordered the game and Game Pass subscribers accessing the Early Access period between August 30 and September 4. However, those who don't fit that criteria will be able to access the Open Beta, which is available on September 6 through September 9. If you plan on getting stuck into the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 open beta, you'll need to know the PC requirements.</p>
<p>Luckily, those on console won't need to worry about requirements. However, if you're a PC user, you must ensure your computer can run it. It's pretty well known that Call of Duty games can be quite a burden on your system, especially with how big the downloads are for Call of Duty games. This is something that they are planning on working on so that download sizes are smaller and more tolerable for players. However, we are still a way off of that.</p>
<p>Below are the minimum and recommended PC requirements to be able to get stuck into the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Open Beta.</p>

<p>The minimum requirements listed for the Black Ops 6 Open Beta will most likely be to run the game at 30 FPS consistently throughout gameplay with settings on low or medium at a push.</p>
<p>The recommended requirements are for those who want to play the game consistently at 60 FPS on high settings. However, they have noted that in some situations, the FPS may drop, so your settings may need to be tweaked to make the Black Ops 6 Open Beta run smoothly.</p>
<p>In addition to these settings, you'll need at least 149 GB to download the Open Beta. Considering it's most likely gated content, that is a hefty download size, and doesn't account for the full download size of the actual game upon release date. Currently, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933620/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Steam page</a> doesn't even have the system requirements available other than players needing to have a phone number linked to their Steam account to play the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-trailer-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest game in the Call of Duty franchise is due to release on 25 October 2024. As the date looms closer, more details about the game are surfacing, including a new trailer showcasing Black Ops 6 multiplayer. So far, there have been mixed responses regarding what players got to see in the two-minute trailer. However, there are plenty of fun ways to kill people in the game, which is garnering a lot of attention from Call of Duty fans.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Multiplayer Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GYG_h-L-K2E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Even those who have sworn off the franchise for years are now considering making a comeback from what was revealed in the trailer. It showed off a lot of intense action, from barging through the doors and sliding across the floor while aiming at your opponent to receiving a hatchet to the chest. There are many different ways to execute your opponents, with Treyarch speaking out about some of the features of Black Ops 6, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-direct-omnimovement-campaign-zombies-release-date/">such as omnimovement</a>. For those who prefer a solo experience, there is also the promise of an open-ended campaign or zombies for those who want a more nostalgic experience.</p>
<p>Black Ops 6 now provides the option to use fallen soldiers as a meat shield when on the battlefield, allowing you to rest your gun on their shoulder and take aim at your opponents. As with previous Call of Duty games, there will be helicopters that you can shoot at lower ground targets from, as well as calling in an airstrike to a chosen location.</p>
<p>Those eager to get stuck into the Black Ops 6 multiplayer can expect to see 16 new maps to battle on, as well as the classic prestige system and a Gunsmith for you to customize your weaponry.</p>
<p>If you have pre-ordered Black Ops 6 or have an active Game Pass subscription, you'll be able to get stuck into the Early Access period from August 30 through September 4. Don't panic though, if that group of people doesn't include you. You'll also be able to get a glimpse at what to expect from Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 in the Open Beta which runs from September 6 through September 9.</p>
<p>While Black Ops 6 takes place in the Gulf War, the multiplayer is separate from that setting, with the setting looking significantly more modernized. Instead, the battles take place <a href="https://screenrant.com/black-ops-6-multiplayer-zombies-campaign-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between factions</a> named Rogue Black Ops and Crimson One, respectively. There will be 12 Operators for players to choose from, with six Operators being available per faction.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/grumpys-key-escape-from-tarkov/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Any long-time veteran of Escape From Tarkov will tell you that it’s a game less focused on PvP and more on the loot. When you engage in PvP, it’s because you want their loot. When you scour the map for hidden rooms and keys, it’s because you want loot. Well, there’s one loot location throwing people for a loop. Here is where to get Grumpy’s Key in Escape From Tarkov!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-grumpy-s-hideout-key">How to Get Grumpy’s Hideout Key</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>To acquire Grumpy’s Hideout Key, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-ref-in-escape-from-tarkov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you must first unlock Ref</a>, raise his trader level to two, and then barter with him. To reach level two, you must raise his level to 0.25 and reach level 15 yourself. </p>



<p>Once you’ve met these requirements, interact with Ref and trade him x1 Lega Medal for Grumpy’s Hideout Key, which has five uses. Use them wisely!</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-grumpy-s-hideout">Where to Find Grumpy’s Hideout</h2>



<p>Once you obtain the key, head to Interchange. Once there, you can find Grumpy’s hideout inside the power station to the northeast of the map, near the Power Plant Extract. </p>



<p>Head inside the Power Plant on the main floor to the back corner of the room. There, you’ll spot a white door leading into a small square shack-like structure against the wall. You may unlock this door using the key.</p>







<h2 id="h-loot-you-ll-find-in-grumpy-s-hideout">Loot You’ll Find in Grumpy’s Hideout</h2>



<p>Inside Grumpy’s Hideout, you’ll find a Green Keycard, odd loose loot, x2 Jackets hanging on the walls, and x1 Sports Bag. Furthermore, there’s a chance for:</p>



<p><strong>Weapons</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>CMMG Mk47 Mutant</li>



<li>Desert Tech MDR</li>



<li>Lone Star TX-15 DML</li>



<li>SIX MCX Spear</li>



<li>AWS VAL</li>



<li>SIG MXC .300</li>



<li>FN SCAR-H</li>



<li>HK416</li>



<li>FN P90</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Armor</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Altyn Bulletproof Helmet</li>



<li>Crye Precision AirFrame Helmet</li>



<li>Ops-Core FAST MT Super High Cut Helmet</li>



<li>Peltor Tactical Sport Headset</li>



<li>Walker’s XCEL 500BT Digital Headset</li>



<li>Peltor ComTac IV Hybrid Headset</li>



<li>LBT-6094A Slick Plate Carrier</li>



<li>HighCom Trooper TFO Body Armor</li>



<li>BNTI Zhuk Body Armor</li>



<li>BNTI Ghzel-K Body Armor</li>



<li>DRD Body Armor</li>
</ul>



<p>While armor will keep you alive, the weapons make this hidden loot room worthwhile. Many come with various modifications, allowing you to strip them for parts to sell or customize your gun. Better yet, add the whole kit to your stash!</p>



<hr>



<p>Now that you’re stockpiling loot for the latest season, let’s ask the tough questions. For instance, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-ever-coming-to-steam-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when is Escape From Tarkov coming to Steam</a>?!</p>

All your current <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> characters sheets are once again safe with the publisher no longer forcing updates to newer versions of spells, weapons, and magic items.</p><p>Last week, as a part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24180843/dont-call-it-6th-edition-though-well-all-probably-do-that">the updates to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition</a> — collectively known as the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23728470/dnd-dungeons-dragons-6e-5e-changes">2024 revision</a> — the publisher announced that it would update D&amp;D Beyond, the tabletop RPG’s official digital toolkit that players use to reference content and create characters using a host of official and third-party sources. The update would add the new 2024 rulebooks to the toolkit, mark outdated content with a “legacy” badge, and change players’ character sheets to reflect all the new rules and features. </p><p>That last part is critical to understanding why some <em>D&amp;D </em>players (including my own dungeon master) spent the last 72 hours in a state of panic. Though some of the 2024 revisions are essentially cosmetic in nature — for example, “races” will be updated to “species” — other updates like the ones to weapons, spells, and magic items fundamentally alter the game. Wizards of the Coast would have essentially overwritten every user’s character sheet with the new information whether they wanted it or not. </p><p>“All entries for mundane and magical items, weapons, armor, and spells will also be updated to their 2024 version,” Wizards said in its initial announcement.</p><p>The publisher did say that players would have the option to continue to use the 2014 version of spells and magic items. But doing so requires using the game’s homebrew rules. which aren’t known for being user-friendly. </p><p>To put this in perspective, think of it like owning a car. Imagine that after 10 years with one car, learning its ins and outs, the manufacturer decides that when it rolls out the latest model of your car, it’s going to magically change your car to the new model, too. Now, though your car is essentially the same, it doesn’t work like you’re used to. And when you ask the manufacturer if you can go back to your old car, it says you can but that you’ll have to manually restore it yourself.</p><p>Thankfully, Wizards of the Coast isn’t in the car business, and after a weekend of backlash on social media, the company will no longer force the new changes on players.</p><p>“We misjudged the impact of this change, and we agree that you should be free to choose your own way to play,” <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1806-2024-d-d-beyond-ruleset-changelog-update">Wizard’s said in its latest announcement</a>. Current character sheets will only be updated with new terminology while the older versions of spells, magic items, and weapons will be preserved. Also, players who have access to both the 2014 and 2024 digital versions will have the option to use both when creating new characters.</p><p>Essentially, Wizards of the Coast is doing what it should have done in the first place: simply adding the new content and giving players the choice to opt in. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-factions-future/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-2-will-add-more-factions-if-the-community-want-them.963957/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-factions-future/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Last week, I had the opportunity to sit down at Gamescom with Ian Proulx, Co-founder and CEO of 1047 Games, to talk all things Splitgate 2. We’ve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-new-details-anti-cheat-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compiled some of that interview here</a>, in which Proulx discussed Esports, Anti-cheat, and other updates. </p>



<p>But now that I’ve returned home after walking almost half a marathon a day at Gamescom, I’ve listened back to our interview again. </p>



<p>1047 Games is very focused on making Splitgate 2 the best game it can be (as it should be), and the sentiment conveyed in our interview was that this will be achieved through community feedback. Several times, Proulx mentioned a ‘Community First’ approach, which was refreshing and comforting to hear. You see, I am a massive fan of the original Splitgate. Its simplicity and mechanics made it fun, and after the announcement of the second game, I was somewhat perplexed about the game’s new direction. </p>



<p>Fortunately, I did have the opportunity to play the game a couple of weeks ago. Although my initial concerns have been squashed, I still wanted to ask those all-important questions that the community has expressed concerns about since the game’s initial announcement. </p>



<p>One of the most significant changes in Splitgate 2 compared to its predecessor is the introduction of Factions. After my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-is-a-solid-sequel-but-with-a-big-esports-influence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on time with the game</a>, I found that the Faction-based system worked well, but I did want to know about Splitgate 2’s live-ops model and when, or if, that live-ops model includes the addition of more factions in the future. We often see live service games with characters, heroes, factions, or whatever you want to call them balloon into an unnecessary amount after a couple of years. For example, Apex Legends has gone from eight characters to launch to 25, and sometimes, such additions feel like they are implemented just for monetization rather than gameplay and quality. On this and on the addition of more factions, Proulx said,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think we want to go to 10 factions [for example], you know? I think like one of the problems, and one of the problems we’ve thought through is, how do we prevent bloats from happening? You know, you play a lot of games where just over the years, it gets crazy and unsustainable, and so I think that’s part of the motivation for going classes versus heroes. Is there a world where we add more classes, like sure, is there a world where we don’t? Yes.</p>



<div><p>Genuinely we don’t know which direction we’re going to take it. I think a lot of it is like, let’s launch this game and let’s see with the community wants you know? If adding a new faction is what the community wants, we are in a position where we could do that, but maybe they just want new guns, and they don’t want new abilities or equipments or anything.</p><p>So maybe we’re just building on these three factions and that’s a great thing about how we’ve structured our company and just our mindset, like we’re very nimble. Were very ready to pivot, we’re very ready to take feedback and roll with it.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p><br>So there you have it: if the Splitgate 2 community wants more Factions, it’ll happen. I did try to squeeze Proulx a little further to ask if they’ve already considered or thought about future Factions and their abilities, but for now, he said the team is entirely focused on the core game for launch. </p>

<p>I like knowing precisely how well my system will run upcoming games. Numerous benchmarks are available to test performance, but nothing beats information straight from the developer. In this, we finally have the Black Ops 6 system requirements on PC, including the long-rumored storage size!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-black-ops-6-system-requirements-on-pc">The Black Ops 6 System Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>To prepare for the upcoming beta for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Activision finally unveiled the PC system requirements for the game. They align with what we expected, and thankfully, the overall storage space requirements are somewhat more manageable!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i5-6600 / AMD Ryzen 5 1400</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 / GTX 1650 / AMD Radeon RX 470</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 149 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>



<li><strong>Internet</strong>: Broadband Internet Connection</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i7-6700K / AMD Ryzen 5 1600X</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti / RTX 3060 / AMD Radeon RX 6600XT / Intel Arc A770</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 149 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>



<li><strong>Internet</strong>: Broadband Internet Connection</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-how-big-is-black-ops-6">How Big is Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Now that we have official PC system requirements available for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, we know the game doesn’t weigh in at over 300 GB, as initially rumored. Instead, you require just 150 GB of space for the game. Unfortunately, it’s still absolutely massive, but that’s how many AAA titles are heading these days.</p>



<p>That said, if you already have Call of Duty HQ and Warzone installed on your computer, you can download Black Ops 6 for a measly 78 GB! Impressive!</p>

Not entirely. The upcoming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has taken about 5-6 years of development, so it's clear the Japanese developer/publisher is still taking the same big, risky bets on triple-A games that many of its peers are.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But unlike its peers, Capcom isn't suffering massive losses and stumbling through avoidable layoffs. It </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/capcom-hits-new-record-for-sales-and-profits-in-2023-2024-financials">smashed sales records in 2023</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and is still </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/net-sales-down-at-capcom-but-company-on-track-to-meet-financial-targets">sailing strong through 2024</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, despite having no major upcoming releases until </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> lands in 2025. It's a little surreal to watch a company that once </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/capcom-shuts-down-i-dead-rising-i-developer-capcom-vancouver">stumbled badly with its North American operation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> now seem like a pillar of stability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What is it doing right? According to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game director Yuya Tokuda, executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, and art director Kaname Fujioka, there isn't one practice propelling the studio along. But as they explained in a conversation at Gamescom 2024, there's a unique culture of communication across development of the widely-used RE Engine, among game developers on different games, and between developers and sales teams across the globe, that make its blockbuster strategy stand out in a turbulent 2024.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="RE Engine is made to serve many games">RE Engine is made to serve many games</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The technical Swiss Army Knife at the heart of Capcom's development process is RE Engine. Though the name references the long-running Resident Evil series it was first created for, it's been used since in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon's Dogma 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Street Fighter 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Devil May Cry 5</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and even </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The engine follows in the footsteps of MT Framework, Capcom's first studio-wide game engine that debuted in 2006's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Rising</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Framework's legacy lives on in other ways too, according to Tsujimoto. "We're greatly focused on multiplatform releases at Capcom, and we need an engine that can work across multiple [types of] hardware," he said. MT Framework was a "great porting engine," and its strengths there were replicated for RE Engine's development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Today, the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> teams and other Capcom developers work "right alongside" the RE Engine engineers, and benefit from a "fast feedback loop" to request features or bugfixes slowing down development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That seems simple enough on its face, but Capcom isn't the only game company to mandate use of a single internal engine. At companies like EA, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/frostbite-labs-is-ea-s-new-skunkworks-for-developing-future-tech">the practice</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-frostbite-engine-was-too-hard-to-manage-according-to-former-bioware-gm/">been blamed</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for slowing down development on games not in based in the genre the engine was created to support. The difference, Tsujimoto explained, is that no single game or franchise has the final say on updates to RE Engine.</span></p><p>Image via Capcom.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have the flexibility to work with them on a priority list," he said. If the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team makes a request that the team can't immediately accommodate, they aren't told "no," they're brought into a conversation about the pipeline—one they can participate in because they're aware of every other game in development and their technical needs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In fact, having developers at Capcom in constant conversation with each other is a common practice. From the way he described it, there doesn't seem to be a habit of siloing teams away from each other on secret or need-to-know projects. "Our teams all work closely together, even across different titles," he said. "We're able to share ideas and discoveries and technology with each other."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That sense of cooperation extends as far out as the sales teams in Japan and across the globe. Tsujimoto seemed to nod at the fact that the Monster Hunter series' massive sales numbers come from regions outside the US and Japan, saying the company has developed a "tight-knit" relationship with the teams marketing and distributing the game across those regions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Close relationships between game developers and salespeople are slightly unusual—but the series' ever-growing popularity seems to be shaping the production process in a number of impactful ways.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Is five years too long to make a game like ">Is five years too long to make a game like <span>Monster Hunter Wilds?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though not all of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' developers have been on the project for all 5-6 years of its development (Fujioka, the art director, said the team also worked on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Rise</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and its expansion </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sunbreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in that time period), that's still an eye-popping amount of time to work on a single game. Fujioka told Game Developer that its expanded development was driven in part by the series' growing playerbase, whose existence increased the amount of time spent on research and development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The more people came on board the series, the more we had to think about how we actually meet our users' needs when we start a new project," he said. "There's so many more players now, and they [possess] a broader level of skill levels and experience with the [series]."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's especially worth calling out with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/monster-hunter-wilds-open-world-leap-is-thanks-to-growing-global-popularity">major shakeups</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to the Monster Hunter formula. The game is set in a series of open worlds where players can take on more open-ended hunts, tracking different monsters and mimicking the role of a hunter in a real-world ecosystem. Not every player can smoothly navigate the jump from one type of gameplay to another, and accommodating them (seemingly with insights from the global sales teams) was a key part of the process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As game director, Tokuda was the one who "felt" the long years developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Tsujimoto joked. Tokuda told us he's been creatively invested of exploring the "monster ecosystem" at the heart of the series ever since he first saw the first game's trailer over 20 years ago. But for the team to push the boundaries of that development philosophy, it increases the scale of the project, which "inevitably has a resource cost, and one of those resources is 'time,'" he observed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His passion for the "monster ecosystem" is palpable, telling us that Capcom has reached the point where it can "push the boundaries" on how it's represented on screen. "Not just in terms of graphical quality, but just being able to feel like you're leaping into this living, breathing world," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Are half-decade-long development cycles worth that fantasy? For players, probably. For developers—well, we'll have to wait until 2025 to truly find out.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
