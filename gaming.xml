			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds' launch has been extremely successful in the United States, where it became the best-selling game of the month of February and the current best-selling game of the year in a single day of availability.</p>
<p>According to data shared today by Circana (NPD), the latest entry in the series by CAPCOM was the overall best-selling premium game in the United States, topping the sales charts of every platform it has released on - PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam - followed by two other February releases, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civilization-vii-one-more-turn/">Civilization VII</a>. While the game sold great on all platforms, it was a smashing success on Steam, as the PC ecosystem accounts for more than half of the title's total dollar sales.&nbsp; With the game also being the current best-selling game of the year in the United States, it definitely looks like the first proper, simultaneous PC and console release for the series paid off big time.</p>

<p><br>
That Monster Hunter Wilds has been a smashing success, there was no doubt, as CAPCOM itself reported to have sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-8-million-units-in-3-days-the-fastest-game-in-capcoms-history/">eight million copies in only three days</a>, becoming the fastest-selling game in the publisher's long history. A success that is completely deserved, as the game is, despite some shortcomings, incredibly fun to play, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S worldwide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-wants-to-give-you-3m-in-game-to-return-to-gta-online/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you have not played GTA Online in the past 60 days, you might be eligible for Rockstar’s one-time exclusive offer, which gives players $3 million in-game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, you read that right: Rockstar is offering players $3 million in-game to return to GTA Online, but there’s a catch. Spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/532607/article/rockstar-games-trying-to-win-some-gta-online-players-back-with-3m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, players should meet a set of eligibility requirements before claiming the in-game currency. Moreover, Rockstar only offers $1 million for free; for the remaining $2 million, players would need to make additional purchases, including buying a Shark Card and subscribing to GTA+.</p>



<h2 id="h-eligibility-requirements-for-claiming-3-million-in-gta-online">Eligibility Requirements for Claiming $3 Million in GTA Online</h2>



<ul>
<li>Players should have a Rockstar Games Account that’s linked to their platform.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Claim the offer on Rockstar’s <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Players should not have signed into GTA Online in the past 2 months (60 days).&nbsp;</li>



<li>The account should not have received a ban or suspension from Rockstar at any point.</li>



<li>The offer should not be redeemed already.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-claim-3-million-in-gta-online">How to Claim $3 Million in GTA Online?</h2>



<p>To claim the $1 million, the player must claim the offer from Rockstar’s website and sign in to GTA Online using the same account. Once done, players will receive the in-game money within 72 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To receive the additional $1.5 million, players must purchase a Great White, Whale, or Megalodon Shark card.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, for the final $500,000, players need to subscribe to GTA+. If you are already a GTA+ subscriber, you can still claim the money if you haven’t played GTA Online in the past 60 days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, GTA 5 Enhanced has become the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-enhanced-worst-rated-steam-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worst-rated</a> Grand Theft Auto title on Steam. Also, Rockstar’s parent company has sued a GTA Online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-games-parent-company-sues-gta-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Market</a> provider.

<p>According to the latest data from Circana, Monster Hunter Wilds was the best-selling game of the month for PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam. When looking at the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqai5telk2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam data</a>, it has accounted for “more than half of the title’s total dollar sales”.</p>



<p>When it comes to the Monster Hunter franchise, the release of Monster Hunter Wilds doubled that of Monster Hunter Rise in terms of dollar sales. It’s worth noting that Monster Hunter Wilds launched at $69.99 while Rise launched at $59.99.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> developers at GSC Game World have been through a lot, to put it mildly. Following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-stalker-2s-developers-persevered-as-russians-invasion-of-ukraine-began/1100-6529870/" data-ref-id="1100-6529870">full-scale Russian invasion in 2022</a>, roughly 200 developers opted to relocate to Prague in the Czech Republic, continuing to collaborate with their colleagues in Kyiv. This, in theory, should have led to a more peaceful development process for this group, but a large fire in the Prague office threw another unexpected wrench in its plans.</p><p dir="ltr">The fire, which broke out in late 2023 in the Prague office's server room, partially wiped out one of the floors. No one was hurt, but post-accident images of the damage show scorch marks and ash covering the ground. GSC Game World CEO Ievgen Grygorovych seems to view the situation as a sort of blessing in disguise, as he explained to us in the latest GameSpot Insider documentary.</p><p dir="ltr">"It actually made us stronger because we got to experience what can happen, how it may look--what we have to do to not let it happen again," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KSH5O1KLSI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8KSH5O1KLSI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There was certainly a material cost to the accident, though. In addition to the server on the floor being destroyed, developers' work computers were also destroyed.</p><p dir="ltr">"It was one more challenge to rebuild this game again," lead community manager Yevhen Bazarov said. "One more thing we weren't expecting."</p><p dir="ltr">While he's able to laugh about it now, lead cinematic artist Ingwar Dovgoteles was working on a cinematic-department documentation job that took roughly three days. He had finished it late the night of the fire. About 15 minutes after he got home, he got a call from the office that everything he had worked on was gone.</p><p dir="ltr">"All my work was there," Dovgoteles added. "[Done] in three days with all this documentation. It was just wasted."</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately for GSC Game World, despite yet another setback, Stalker 2 did eventually release in late 2024, and it was one of our picks for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/" data-ref-id="2900-6045">best games of 2024</a>.

			<p>The Assassin's Creed Shadows PlayStation 5 Pro upgrade is among the largest we have seen so far, according to a new in-depth analysis of the soon-to-be-released new entry in the series.</p>
<p>In a new analysis shared today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how the one thing that elevates the Assassin's Creed Shadows experience on the PS5 Pro over the base model is how Performance Mode leverages the power of the system to deliver 60 FPS gameplay, though with some drops in certain scenarios, with the ray-traced global illumination available only in Quality Mode on the base system. As seen in the footage below, RTGI makes quite a bit of a difference, even when, on both base and Pro systems, the game features similar image quality, internal resolution, which is only marginally higher on PlayStation 5 Pro, and graphics settings. Other than sporting RTGI in Performance Mode, Assassin's Creed Shadows on PlayStation 5 Pro features substantial improvements from added specular detail from additional ray tracing. Interestingly enough, the Playstation 5 Pro version also doesn't seem to be using the PSSR upscaler, as it exhibits visual artifacts more in line with analytical upscaling than machine-learning-based upscaling.</p>

<p>While Assassin's Creed Shadows doesn't push the boundaries of the series' open-world RPG formula first seen in Origins, it delivers solid enhanced by some of the best visuals seen in open-world games that is worth experiencing for all fans of the series, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review.</a></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows launches on March 20th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Knightling Release Date Brings Cute Zelda-Style Platforming in August]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knightling-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-knightling-release-date-brings-cute-zelda-style-platforming-in-august.1139052/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knightling-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and developer Twirlbound have announced the release date for 3D action-adventure platformer&nbsp;<em>The Knightling</em>, and it's gracing PC and current-gen consoles (as well as the Switch) this summer.</p>

<p><em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>was originally unveiled <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knightling-saber-interactive-2025" rel="nofollow">back in August last year</a>, which feels pretty appropriate given that the game's official release date is August 28th.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>The Knightling</em>, you'll play as the titular hero as he attempts to follow in the footsteps of his missing mentor Sir Lionstone, the legendary guardian of the land of Clesseia. The Knightling must discover what's happened to Sir Lionstone and save him from whoever has taken him prisoner.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-knightling-release-date-water.jpg?itok=8XfO8I0a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-knightling-release-date-water.jpg?itok=oXXWq50C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>launches in August for PC and current-gen consoles.</figcaption></figure><p>Saber Interactive and Twirlbound promise the chance to explore the lands of Clesseia, where you'll find plenty of miscreants waiting for a shield bash to the head. To that end, you'll also be unlocking "the extraordinary powers of Sir Lionstone's mighty shield".</p>

<p>You will, of course, be playing as Sir Lionstone's apprentice, but I'm betting that by the time this one is over, you'll have discovered that even young knightlings can exhibit great courage. That's just a guess, mind.</p>

<p><em>The Knightling</em>'s combat will give you the chance not only to press the attack against your enemies, but also to block and parry attacks in order to create your own openings, finishing the fight with "huge attacks and combos".</p>

<p>The shield isn't just a combat weapon, though; you'll also be using it to solve various puzzles, platform your way across the world, and unlock secrets in order to earn new upgrades.</p>




<p>If you'd like to check out&nbsp;<em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>before you commit to picking it up in August, then there's a free demo for you to try out right now on Steam. Hey, what have you got to lose, eh?</p>

<p><em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>comes to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10004254/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-knightling/9nd5r4j0g5lv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch on August 28th.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/632121/razer-wyvrn-developer-ai-qa-gamer-copilot-sensa-haptics-thx</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/razer-launches-new-wyvrn-game-dev-platform-with-automated-ai-bug-tester.1139046/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/632121/razer-wyvrn-developer-ai-qa-gamer-copilot-sensa-haptics-thx<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer is getting into AI with a new developer platform called <a href="https://www.wyvrn.com/">Wyvrn</a>. It encompasses dev-focused automation tools like the Razer AI QA Copilot to assist with quality assurance / game testing and the AI Gamer Copilot (formerly called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24338016/razer-project-ava-ai-gaming-copilot-coach">Project Ava</a>) for real-time tips and guides via voice assistant while playing games.</p><p>Wyvrn (pronounced “wyvern,” like the mythical creature) will also be an umbrella for Razer’s next-gen Chroma RGB platform, a new THX Spatial Audio Plus game plug-in, and Razer’s Sensa HD Haptics software.</p><p>The most consequential of Razer’s new tools is the AI QA Copilot. It’s a cloud-based plug-in for Unreal Engine, Unity, and bespoke engines in C++ that’s designed to reduce the time and cost of manual quality assurance testing through AI. Quality assurance is a labor-intensive process for any video game, involving many hours of testing and manually logging glitches in need of fixing. The AI assistant can watch a game being tested, automatically find bugs or performance issues like frame rate drops, and create a QA playtest report with both its findings and any bugs manually tagged by the tester.</p><p>Razer claims that its AI can identify 20 to 25 percent more bugs compared to manual testing, and this can reduce QA time by up to 50 percent as well as cost savings of up to 40 percent. After playtest reports are generated, the AI QA Copilot is designed to learn from the tagged bugs to get “smarter” and more effective.</p><p>What will happen to the employee headcount in QA teams if these tools are introduced and proven successful? It’s perhaps <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349728/gdc-state-of-the-industry-survey-2025-results">not difficult to imagine</a>. And Razer is already partnering with game dev services company <a href="https://www.side.inc/">Side</a> (formerly <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/game-services-firm-ptw-rebrands-as-side/">PTW</a>) to integrate the AI QA Copilot into its in-house QA teams.</p><p>The other big component of Razer’s dabbling in AI is its upcoming and very uniquely named AI Gamer Copilot. It’s an AI-based voice assistant that’s designed to watch you play and give you live, on-the-fly tips for tactics in competitive multiplayer games like MOBAs or strategies on how to take down difficult enemies in single-player games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/23/24226834/black-myth-wukong-hands-on-impression-game-science">Black Myth: Wukong</a></em>. My colleague Sean Hollister and I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24338016/razer-project-ava-ai-gaming-copilot-coach">saw a brief demo of this at CES</a> while it was called Project Ava, and it seemed… <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K46-vHL4Ouo">interesting</a>. The retiring of its “project” moniker means it’s destined for an actual release.</p><p>Razer’s other, non-AI announcements pegged under the Wyvrn platform include its Razer Sensa HD Haptics, which is now getting a sim racing game integration in partnership with <a href="https://www.simhubdash.com/">SimHub</a>. That means users of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/29/24257440/razer-freyja-gaming-cushion-kraken-v4-pro-headphones-haptic-feedback">Freyja haptic chair cushion and Kraken V4 Pro headset</a> can get multidirectional, multidevice haptic feedback in games like <em>Assetto Corsa Evo</em>. Razer claims Sensa haptics are now in over 100 supported titles, with the promise of more to come. And lastly, Razer is introducing a THX Spatial Audio Plus plug-in for Wwise. It’s an open-source format alternative to Dolby and DTS, offering more immersive 3D audio in games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Japan’s government recently convened to discuss a series of topics in a Diet, one of which was the recent controversy surrounding Assassin’s Creed Shadows. The game’s more scandalous scenes have showcased Yasuke, an African samurai, destroying shrines, sequences which have naturally prompted concerns in the Japanese government.</p>



<p>In a recent discussion, Japan’s Prime Minister voiced a strict response to these concerns, answering points raised by other party members suggesting that ‘imitation attacks’ could occur in real life.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-absolutely-unacceptable">‘Absolutely Unacceptable’</h2>



<p>Hiroyuki Kata, a Lib Dem party member, brought up the topic of shrine destruction in Assassin’s Creed Shadows at a recent Diet, putting questions to the nation’s Prime Minister.</p>



<p>He explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to ask about the Assassin’s Creed issue. </p>



<p>In the game, the samurai protagonist smashes drums, sacred mirrors, and altars inside the worship hall of a shrine that appears under its real name. He slashes at people who appear to be priests, shoots arrows, and engages in other violent mayhem. When I asked the chief priest, he said that the game company had not contacted the shrine to ask for permission to use the name.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The politician floated the suggestion that imitation attacks might take place at real shrines across Japan and that other concerns, like ‘tourist pollution’, were also being considered. These details were reported by <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2503/19/news167.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ITMedia</a> (picked up by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/japanese-government-addresses-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy-as-ban-rumors-spread-3165590/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>).</p>



<p>By way of a response, the nation’s Prime Minister, Ishiba Shigeru, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is absolutely unacceptable to graffiti a shrine. It is nothing but an insult to the country.</p>



<p>It is natural to have respect for the culture and religion of a country, and I think it is important to send out the message that we will not tolerate any behavior that does not respect the culture and religion of a country and will not tolerate it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was suggested that such wanton destruction of culturally significant facilities wasn’t replicated in any other Assassin’s Creed title, prompting further worries from the Japanese government. The comments made by the Prime Minister and other party members are not indicative of any further action.</p>

<p>Inzoi is under the stewardship of Inzoi Studio—published by Krafton—and its release date can’t come soon enough for fans of life-sim titles. We’ve got the key details you’re looking for, including its cost and platforms.</p>



<p>Attention Inzoi fans, the wait is nearly over. Whether the life simulator has only recently caught your eye or since its announcement a couple of years ago, you don’t have to imagine what your idyllic world looks like for much longer.</p>



<p>Inzoi’s release date is getting closer, and we’re ticking days off the calendar quicker than we can count!</p>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-release-date">Inzoi Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ve got the whole world in your hands. Credit to Inzoi Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>March 28 is the official Early Access release date for Inzoi.</strong></p>



<p>To reiterate, this signals the full-scale, playable debut of Inzoi, but this isn’t its official launch. If you don’t know, Early Access lets players get hands-on with a title, and it’s a far more sophisticated beta test in many ways. </p>



<p>You get access to most of the content that will be available at launch, but it’s a chance to refine the product and iron out flaws before launch. You still purchase Inzoi, own it, and get a ton of content, but it’s your chance to help refine it before its full release.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-inzoi-platforms">All Inzoi Platforms</h2>



<p><strong><strong><strong>PC players get first access to Inzoi, and a PlayStation and Xbox release is only happening once the title completes its Early Access run.</strong></strong></strong></p>



<p>You can check out everything we know about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-inzoi-platforms-is-it-coming-to-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi’s platforms and console availability</a> here. The quick details are that PC Early Access is up first—although we don’t know how long it will last. Furthermore, future console ports should arrive for the full release.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-does-inzoi-cost">How Much Does Inzoi Cost?</h2>



<p><strong><strong>Inzoi will cost $39.99 when it launches in Early Access.</strong></strong></p>



<p>We’ve also dove into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-inzoi-cost-inzoi-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi’s cost</a> in greater detail. But I can tell you it’s definitely going to be <strong>$39.99 in Early Access</strong>, and we’re theorizing a <strong>potential £34.99 price tag elsewhere</strong>. This isn’t a low-key, low-effort project: Inzoi is looking to be the real deal in 2025—hence the retail price.</p>



<p>There are no special Editions to consider for the time being. Early Access isn’t known for having Deluxe Editions or anything like that, but this might be a question once Inzoi is looking to release in its entirety.</p>

Here are more hubs for some of this year’s biggest titles:&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-release-date-platforms-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tales-of-the-shire-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a>.</p>

Steranka said he's been looking online at some of the player theories. "What I would love to be able to get across is like, 'Hey, it’s actually great,'" Steranka said.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-assassins-creed-shadows-makes-the-most-of-its-boring-setting<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Japan is a setting Assassin's Creed fans have wanted for years, but it was described by a former game director as "boring". Here's how Assassin's Creed Shadows really makes the most of it's much-loved new location.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2012, Assassin’s Creed 3 director Alex Hutchinson called out people on the internet for suggesting the most “boring” future settings for the series. “The three most wanted [settings for Assassin’s Creed] are WWII, feudal Japan and Egypt,” he explained at the time, adding “They’re kind of the three worst settings for an AC game.” Hutchinson later clarified his statement, saying “the point I was trying to make was that in the broad strokes and scale of history, that’s a theme that’s been well-mined in video games.” He’s not wrong and since he made his most recent comments, Ghost of Tsushima, Rise of the Ronin, Nioh and more have all shone a spotlight on feudal Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast-forward to 2025 and Assassin’s Creed is finally going to one of these “worst” settings with Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, but Shadows director Jonathan Dumont believes his team has found a new way to tell the story of feudal Japan. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think it's not boring at all. The setting is very exciting," Dumont says when asked about Hutchinson’s quote. "I do think that being able to bring it to life and have that balance of the political intrigue [of the era], the war and conflict, and also the beauty of nature and supporting more exploration within this changing world give it another dimension [compared to other games]."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hutchinson wasn’t wrong back in 2012. The setting of Feudal Japan has indeed been one of the most requested locations for the Assassin's Creed series. Bringing the series' unique blend of historical fiction and sci-fi to the backdrop of warring states and samurai in fierce conflict seemed like a no-brainer for developer Ubisoft to make happen sooner rather than later. The only problem was Ubisoft chose later, perhaps to its detriment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Ubisoft has been praised for exploring previously overlooked historical settings like Egypt and Industrial Revolution England, other developers have beaten Ubisoft to open-world stealth-action games set in Japan with titles like Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Tsushima. That said, shows like FX’s Shogun prove that people’s appetites for samurai action hasn’t waned in the least. Much like Shogun, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows explores how outsiders navigate the courts and politics of feudal Japan. And the Assassin’s Creed name has a built-in reputation all on its own.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What made the setting interesting was the political landscape of the time, along the environment of that era. We've seen other games do it but not in the Assassin's Creed way</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Dumont highlights the conflict and historical impact of the era – particularly in how Japan was "opened up" to the rest of the world for the first time following the arrival of Portuguese merchants and missionaries during the late 1500s Sengoku era. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What made the setting interesting for us to tackle was the political landscape of the time, along with the arts and the environment of that era. We've seen other games do it before, but not in the Assassin's Creed way that we're doing it," says Dumont. "We also have that big open-world feeling with the big cities, the wilderness, and we really touch upon the historical arts and the reconstruction of these locations to make it real for that time. So I don't think we've seen that necessarily in a lot of games [covering this era] – to truly explore and bring you into that world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Dumont, the political intrigue of the era made it a particularly compelling setting to tackle for Assassin's Creed. A key difference he highlights that makes Shadows different from other games is how it brings a more dynamic and deeper dive into a politically troubled era filled with conflict – one that players will be able to immerse themselves in and learn more about almost from the moment the game begins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is also the matter of new technology that Ubisoft utilized in order to bring its version of Japan to life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The team was very enthusiastic about Assassin's Creed's take on Feudal Japan, and we felt that the latest technological improvements and new consoles would help us bring that vision to life," says Dumont. He highlights the dynamic weather and seamless open-world, and according to our review, the team seemingly succeeded in creating one of the best historical locations in Assassin’s Creed history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember, the Assassin’s Creed series began during the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 era, and since then technology has come a long way, with 4K resolution, bigger open worlds with greater density, and ray-tracing now standard on consoles and PC. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What that does is give a much more 'alive' feeling than what we've done in the past [with other games]," he continues. "So I think that technology that took a few years to develop is omnipresent and all around you within the game. It does bring another dimension of being able to see the world in different states – which gives it more depth. It would not have been possible to make Shadows without our current technology; I don't think we would have gotten that feeling of losing ourselves in this open world without it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes the Assassin's Creed series so compelling is how it takes historical settings and injects its patented stealth-action gameplay and open-world immersion to make them all the more engrossing. Assassin's Creed Shadows leans into the samurai and ninja fantasy, much like other games tackling this setting. And the need to one-up the competition presented a big challenge to ensure the game's scope was well realized – and given the lengthy wait for the series to tackle a Japan setting, Dumont felt the wait was worth it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's really all about keeping the vision there, and the team keeps pushing for better quality in every aspect,” he says. “There's always a challenge with trying to meet people's expectations, and we also put the pressure on ourselves to do the best we can."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Assassin's Creed Shadows, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-review">IGN's review of the game</a>.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">One of the largest labor unions in North America is creating a new United Videogame Workers union, which aims to allow anyone in the business to join. Communications Workers of America has teamed up with the American Federation of Musicians to launch this new gaming-specific organization to coincide with the start of the Game Developers Conference.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/faq" rel="nofollow ">the group's FAQ</a>, this new gaming union will offer basically anyone in the industry--in the United States and Canada--<a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/membership" rel="nofollow ">the opportunity to sign up</a> and then eventually pay dues. This is also open to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/">the thousands of people who have lost their jobs</a> over the past couple of years. The United Videogame Workers mission statement mentions taking "back our lives, our labor, and our passion from those who treat us like replaceable cogs; to empower our fellow workers; to link up arms with the laid off, with the freelancer, with the disillusioned contractor, with the disenfranchised and the marginalized, with the workers laboring invisibly to keep this industry afloat." The new organization also advocates for creating studio-specific unions, too, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/qa-workers-at-zenimax-studios-have-become-the-gaming-industrys-largest-union/1100-6510268/">like ZeniMax Workers United</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"The creation of this union was not done in isolation; it's a cumulative effort by the thousands of video game workers who have been fighting for years to redefine what it means to stand together and reclaim power in one of the largest and highest-grossing industries on the globe," said CWA's senior director of organizing Tom Smith in a press release.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time the CWA has made waves in the gaming industry. For example, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-game-studios-is-now-unionized-across-the-board-recognized-by-microsoft/1100-6525206/">Bethesda Game Studios became unionized</a> last year with the help of the organization. Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-qa-workers-say-they-were-laid-off-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6524209/">the CWA went after Microsoft for allegedly firing QA testers</a> because they were attempting to unionize. Last but not least, in October, the labor union <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-shutdown-just-another-example-of-bad-decision-by-highly-insulated-ceos-labor-union-says/1100-6527505/">criticized Sony's decision to shut down Concord developer Firewalk</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/">video game voice actors went on strike</a>, and it's now going on its eighth month. Recently, SAG-AFTRA argued there are<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-publishers-have-too-many-alarming-ai-loopholes-says-striking-actors-union/1100-6530074/"> too many AI loopholes for game publishers to use</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-developers-choice-awards-2025-nominees-revealed/2900-6173/#1">GDC</a> kicks off today in San Francisco.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Roger Craig Smith has voiced loads of iconic video game characters, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-dream-team/">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/batman-arkham-origins/">Arkham Origins</a>' Batman, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a> fan-favorite Mirage. He's perhaps best known for his performance as the ledge-climbing, leap-of-faith-taking Ezio Auditore da Firenze in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-ii/">Assassin's Creed II</a> (and several other games in the franchise), but fans of Assassin's Creed will likely be surprised to learn that Smith is absolutely terrified of ledges.</p><p dir="ltr">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshualamb/2025/03/19/assassins-creeds-roger-craig-smith-i-have-a-fear-of-ledges/" rel="nofollow ">Forbes</a>, Smith--who is a big fan of gaming--was asked if there's a specific gaming memory in his life that "stands out." For Assassin's Creed fans, his answer was a bit unexpected.</p><p dir="ltr">"Climbing to the top of a tower in Assassin's Creed II and synchronising so the map unlocks for you; that iconic and sweeping entrance [to the game] always gets me," Smith said. "I have a fear of ledges, and this game would give me the heebie jeebies moving around up there. I'd get butterflies in my stomach, but it's such a beautiful moment. Getting to be a part of it and seeing what everyone had worked so hard to create was just such a 'Wow,' moment for me."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4461733-eziocollection.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461733" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4461733-eziocollection.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461733"></a><figcaption>Smith is afraid of heights--even in games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4461733-eziocollection.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Smith also revealed which game he'd play for the rest of his life, if he were only allowed to play one.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'll cheat and say the entire Assassin's Creed franchise," Smith answered. "That'll give me at least a lifetime of gaming there. Aside from the fact that I got to be a part of the franchise so early on, I've always thoroughly enjoyed playing all of the games. The music, storytelling, visuals, gameplay--it all works so well, and that's rare to have everything fire off and hit the way those games do."</p><p dir="ltr">Smith did add that he hasn't had much time for gaming as of late due to being busy with work, saying that it's "no way to live," and that he needs to "turn [his] gamer card in."</p><p dir="ltr">Still, Smith has always had a reputation for genuinely enjoying games. In the wake of Apex Legends' wildly successful 2019 launch, Smith and fellow Apex voice actor Chris Edgerly (who voices Pathfinder) did several livestreams together, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iOUS-vRI00">playing Apex and messing with unsuspecting teammates</a> by using their respective Apex characters' voices in voice chat.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, Smith seems extremely content with the state of his career. When asked if there are any video game voice roles he wishes he'd gotten, he simply expressed gratitude for the opportunities he's had in the industry.</p><p dir="ltr">"Lightning has struck so many times in my life and career," Smith explained. "I've been able to look people in the eye and tell them that I'm the voice of Ezio, Batman, and Sonic. In all honesty, I just look forward to the next project. It's amazing to think that there's somebody out there who loves games and storytelling and is creating something we can't even imagine that could become <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/">the next Assassin's Creed</a>."</p><p>Speaking of the next game in the franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> launches on Thursday, March 20, but you can check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/">GameSpot's review of the latest entry</a> in the long-running series now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/7-how-assassin-s-creed-shadows-makes-environments-look-great-up-close-and-at-a-distance<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All video games are, in one way or another, a giant Rube-Goldberg machine. But open world games feature some of the most complex behind-the-scenes mechanisms of them all. Games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are crafted not to let players observe the intricacy of interlocking technical systems, but to hide as many of those systems as possible so they can wander huge environments riddled with luscious detail.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Details, of course, can only be so luscious, especially when you're talking about small assets or observing an object from thousands of miles away. Games draw on CPU and GPU memory to render these expansive scenes, and many game artists know the struggle of trying to preserve an immaculate aesthetic while working against how much memory is budgeted for gameplay and other environments.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft Montreal has cooked up a rather neat solution for this problem in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a game whose launch, for better or worse, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-delays-assassin-s-creed-shadows-promises-day-one-steam-launch">has become a major inflection point for the company</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. But while industry analysts are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-delays-assassin-s-creed-shadows-promises-day-one-steam-launch">closely scrutinizing its sales</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, players and developers checking out the game will no doubt be peering closely at the environments of feudal Japan. That's because the tech team behind Anvil has rolled out a new methodology that reworks how open-world games are rendered: "virtual geometry," or as Ubisoft calls it, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa">the Micropolygon system</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an interview with Game Developer, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> technical director Pierre Fortin broke down the principles of the Micropolygon system, and explained how the method upends the way environment artists have been wrangling open-world art assets for ages.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Virtual geometry uses dynamic meshes to preserve detail at a distance, and render more up close">Virtual geometry uses dynamic meshes to preserve detail at a distance, and render more up close</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here's how the magic trick usually works. In an open-world game, a game engine like Ubisoft's Anvil Engine determines how to render graphics using a number of variables, a key one being draw distance. Objects like a sword, a chair, or a painting on a wall all require multiple versions to be created. Higher-fidelity versions will contain more polygons and will look good when the player is inside of a few meters of them, while other versions will have fewer polygons and will be used when the player is further away. When it works smoothly, the illusion of an object coming into focus is seamless.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it doesn't always go smoothly. When objects "pop in" to frame while players navigate an environment, they might close the distance too fast on an object, and the lower-poly version rendered at a distance is what they see first. Not the worst bug they'll encounter but something of an immersion breaker.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via Ubisoft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And maybe even more frustrating for game artists—this process sometimes limits how much detail can go into an object when viewed up close. If you wanted to render a painting like, say Sōami's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/essays/muromachi-period-1392-1573">Landscape of the Four Seasons (Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers)</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, you might have to compromise on showing the pencil work that makes such an image so breathtaking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Enter the Micropolygons system. In a tech demo sent to Game Developer by Ubisoft, the studio explained that this system allows the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team to dynamically alter the number of polygons on display on an asset, rather than swapping different versions out. This is done by generating a dynamic mesh that filters throughout the game world, across designated objects. It's powered by the dedicated SSD of modern game consoles and high-end PCs, and represents a major technological advancement for the series (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the first Assassin's Creed game made entirely for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the previous entry, launched on current-gen and last-gen consoles).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We had to produce the same asset multiple times, but we were not showcasing it always in the best light," Fortin said. By dynamically updating the number of polygons onscreen for each asset, players aren't treated to static assets that reflect to light and other objects the same way at all distances. The closer the player gets, the microadjustments made by the game show more and more detail, and when the player zooms in very tight, everything from nicks and dents, to reflections, to dirt smudges are all visible to the naked eye.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In the past, to allow for budgets to be respected, we sometimes had to cut a bit, whereas now we're able to go a bit further," he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft has also </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa">explained elsewhere</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that the Micropolygons system expands the graphical range that can be displayed on PCs with varying specs. Before, weaker machines might have rendered assets in lower detail, now the system can check the computer's SSD and make adjustments accordingly.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via Ubisoft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Fortin, targeting the Xbox Series S helped Ubisoft expand the number of PCs that could run </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. On the Series S, Ubisoft only needs to render </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at a max of 1080p, while the Series X can go as high as 4K UHD. "In terms of capabilities of the CPU and SSDs, this isn't where we have to adapt," Fortin explained.

The answer, it now seems, isn't just about "what" is being shown to the player, but the presentation, and how players perceive objects from different positions.

            <p>A quick heads up for PlayStation Plus subscribers - eight games will be leaving the service in the coming weeks.</p>

<ul>
<li>Animal Well</li>

<p>Many of us here at Eurogamer were rather taken with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a> on its release last year, so this is one I would suggest snapping up while you have the chance. We described the pixel-art combat-free Metroidvania as "astonishingly rich" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-well-review">Eurogamer's five star Animal well review</a>.</p>
<p>Another highlight leaving PlayStation's subscription service is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera</a>: Zau. "What Tales of Kenzera lacks in creative game design it makes up for in vital, passionate storytelling," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-review">Eurogamer's four star Tales of Kenzera: Zau review</a>.</p><p>

As for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a>, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-the-year-2019-slay-the-spire-and-the-joy-of-spontaneity">one of Eurogamer's Games of the Year 2019</a>. Our review, meanwhile, called it "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slay-the-spire-review-a-gorgeous-blend-of-dungeon-crawler-and-card-battler">a gorgeous blend of dungeon-crawler and card-battler</a>".

<p>Per a press release on the new UVW <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/news/20250319-press-release" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the union will demand "dignity and job security for all video game workers", with the union pointing to the devastating slew of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-studio-visual-arts-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a> that's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oxenfree-night-school-layoffs" rel="nofollow">assailing the industry</a> in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">last couple of years</a>.</p>

<p>The union's mission statement is to "take back our lives, our labor, and our passion from those who treat us like replaceable cogs", and to work to create a gaming industry that "nourishes its talent and invests in its future, rather than constantly seeking short-term profits".</p>

<p>In addition to US and Canada employees, the UVW union will also encompass "video game contractors, freelancers, indie developers, workers who are currently unemployed, and workers who are already organizing their workplaces", so even if you already have a workplace union, you can join up.</p>

<p>CWA senior director of organizing Tom Smith says the new union is a "cumulative effort" by workers to "redefine what it means to stand together and reclaim power", while CWA president Claude Cummings Jr. describes the union as an "exciting next step" in the journey to "help video game workers build power in their industry".</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows hits the open market tomorrow, and Japan’s government is eagerly discussing whether to address certain scenes in the game on a legal level. The most controversial scenes in Assassin’s Creed Shadows were revealed as Yasuke, an African samurai, desecrating and destroying shines, which drew intense blowback from the Japanese people.</p>



<p>In a Diet discussion today, the Japanese government – including Prime Minister, Ishiba Shigeru – brought up the question of what to do about Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ scandalous sequences.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-assassin-s-creed-issue">‘The Assassin’s Creed Issue’</h2>



<p>A report from <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2503/19/news167.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ITMedia</a> (circulated by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/japanese-government-addresses-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy-as-ban-rumors-spread-3165590/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>) breaks down the discussion in the Diet, which was centred around the legality of Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>Hiroyuki Kata, a Lib Dem party member, raised concerns about ‘the Assassin’s Creed issue’, highlighting sequences that see Yasuke devastate a revered shrine in the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to ask about the Assassin’s Creed issue. </p>



<p>In the game, the samurai protagonist smashes drums, sacred mirrors, and altars inside the worship hall of a shrine that appears under its real name. He slashes at people who appear to be priests, shoots arrows, and engages in other violent mayhem. When I asked the chief priest, he said that the game company had not contacted the shrine to ask for permission to use the name.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stressed that the necessary bodies in Japan are ‘keeping an eye’ on the situation, as they’re intently concerned about possible copycat attacks on shrines across the country. The government is also concerned about tourist pollution, worried that the eventual success of Assassin’s Creed Shadows could see these shrines flooded with visitors.</p>



<p>Ishiba Shigeru, Japan’s Prime Minister, had some tough words on the matter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is absolutely unacceptable to graffiti a shrine. It is nothing but an insult to the country.</p>



<p>It is natural to have respect for the culture and religion of a country, and I think it is important to send out the message that we will not tolerate any behavior that does not respect the culture and religion of a country and will not tolerate it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The lobby found a clear issue with the destruction of Japanese culture and facilities in this game, claiming that it wasn’t possible to replicate such acts in previous games. It’s not clear what their plans are beyond monitoring the situation, but it was noted that the Prime Minister’s comments, however strict, aren’t indicative of further action.</p>



<p>Before this, the existence of Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows was also subject to intense speculation and scrutiny, with many highlighting his dubious and unclear historical position and the accuracy of his character. </p>
