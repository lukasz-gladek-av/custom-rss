As part of this reporting, Belloni shared a story from 2022 involving an interaction between Craig and Sarandos during the TIFF 2022 premiere of <em>Glass Onion,</em> the sequel to <em>Knives Out. </em></p><p>Apparently, after the audience at the event gave the movie a standing ovation, Craig used it as evidence that <em>Glass Onion</em> should get a larger and longer theatrical release. The Netflix CEO disagreed and replied that’s “not our model” and that led to a heated reply from the Benoit Blanc actor, who reportedly said some variation of “Your model is fucked.” And according to Puck, Craig isn’t the only person in Hollywood unhappy with Netflix’s streaming-focused business model. <br></p><p>Last week, Belloni reported that Margot Robbie and filmmaker Emerald Fennell had passed on a $150 million Netflix deal for their upcoming <em>Wuthering Heights</em> movie. Reportedly, Fennell and Robbie want the cultural impact that theaters can provide. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/09/matt-damon-casey-affleck-possible-the-instigators-sequel-streaming-future-their-chemistry-fenway-park-appletv-1236075992/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/matt-damon-casey-affleck-possible-the-instigators-sequel-streaming-future-their-chemistry-fenway-park-appletv-1236075992/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In September, <em>Deadline </em>reported</a></span> that <em>Glass Onion </em>could have made over $600 million worldwide at the box office if it had received a full-length theatrical run and marketing push by Netflix. It was also reported that Craig and writer/director Rian Johnson weren’t happy about the situation. The duo’s next <em>Knives Out</em> sequel, <em>Wake Up Dead Man</em>, is set to arrive on Netflix in 2025.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.worldofreel.com/blog/2024/10/17/rian-johnson-amp-daniel-craig-not-happy-with-knives-out#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20just%20going,adds%20that%20value.%E2%80%9D&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.worldofreel.com/blog/2024/10/17/rian-johnson-amp-daniel-craig-not-happy-with-knives-out#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20just%20going,adds%20that%20value.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But recent comments</a></span> from Sarandos during an investor meeting indicate that this approach and business model won’t be changing anytime soon, regardless of how upset some creators in Hollywood seem to be.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Wizards of the Coast announced their popular card game crossing over with the superhero property <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-marvel-universes-beyond-sets-are-happening" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last October</a>. Those new details regard a Secret Lair superdrop and a Universes Beyond set.</p>

<p>During an official press event at this year's New York Comic-Con, Wizards of the Coast revealed several cards from their <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Marvel crossover.</p>
<p>The first drop of cards were part of a Secret Lair superdrop. This superdrop will contain Legendary Creature Cards (perfect for Commander) based on Captain America (he's Red, White, and Blue - get it??), Iron Man (Blue/Red), Wolverine (Red/Green), Storm , and Black Panther (White/Green). This Secret Lair will be available Monday, November 4 in non-foil (MSRP $39.99) and foil (MSRP $49.99).</p>
<p>Read on to check out images of the cards included in these drops!</p>
<h2>Captain America, First Avenger</h2>

Specifically, the characters and events from the amazing Spider-Man. This tentpole set will be available sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>In a one-on-one <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Marvel crossover pre-panel meeting, we asked Senior Product Designer Daniel Nguyen about future potential Universes Beyond crossovers. Nguyen stated the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Trying to figure out how much I can say or can’t say, but basically our emerging business team, they are fantastic and always trying to find cool things for us to get into. And typically we try to align them with cultural beats, right? Like the Fallout set - this was serendipitous but the Fallout set came out at the same time the Fallout show came out, and that is the ideal case. When something else is happening and you’re thinking about that thing and then BOOM, here’s some Magic cards related to that thing. Doesn’t always line up, these are big moving things, but that’s generally our motivation: what do people want, when are people going to be thinking about it?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During our one-on-one meeting, Nguyen also stressed that this partnership is focused on the Marvel comics IP, and not the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which Nguyen explained also gave the design team a lot of room to play in, and deep-cuts for comic lovers to explore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Marvel crossover is the first major collaboration between Wizards of the Coast and the ubiquitous superhero property. The superhero franchise has dabbled in the tabletop space through the living card game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fantasy-flight-games-announces-marvel-champions-next-evolution" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Marvel Champions</em></a> and the <em>Marvel Multiverse</em> TTRPG.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/weapons-and-armaments-for-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a new blog post by the Call of Duty staff, it's been explained what Primary, Secondary, and Melee weapons are going to be coming to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 when it <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-load-details-revealed-102-gb-ssd-needed/">launches on October 25, 2024</a>. The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-comms-weapons-attachments-intel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> also goes into detail about how players will be able to create Global Weapon Builds, as well as how the weapons unlock. In total, there will be an arsenal of 33 different armaments that you can utilize to customize your weapon to your liking, including 12 weapons that are all completely new to the franchise.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is said to have a streamlined Weapons menu on launch to help players build and customize their Loadouts, allowing them to have a smoother experience. Additionally, there will be Weapon Leveling to come in the future, meaning that exploring and researching what weapons are available will be crucial for the player so that they can find out how to unlock weapons that may be beneficial to them, as well as the Gunsmith being more accessible than previous games in the franchise.</p>
<p>Diving into the Primary Weapons, there are a wide variety of guns to choose from, as well as individual Attachments for each weapon, which unlock as you level the weapon up. Here are the types of Primary Weapon you can expect at launch:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assault Rifles (7)</li>
<li>SMGs (6)</li>
<li>Shotguns (2)</li>
<li>LMGs (3)</li>
<li>Marksman Rifles (4)</li>
<li>Sniper Rifles (3)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's also stated that some of the Optics available for these weapons will be unlocked through different means rather than leveling up. Additionally, you can run the Wildcard "Overkill," which will allow you to equip a second Primary Weapon in the Secondary Weapon slot if you're feeling a little bit chaotic.</p>
<p>For the Secondary Weapons, there aren't as many options. You can choose between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pistols (4)</li>
<li>Launchers (2)</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the Melee Weapon, only the Knife or Baseball Bat will be available on launch. Whether there will be more in the future is uncertain, but it seems unlikely. However, there will be many different cosmetics you can use for your weapons at The Gunsmith if you want to add some flair to your kills.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The launch weaponry in Black Ops 6 does have specific unlock criteria, which are related to your Player Progression. If you want to check how well you are doing, you'll be able to see how far along you are via the Progression tab in the Barracks Menu.</p>
<p>There are attachments made for each weapon, with some having special unlock requirements and others being unlocked immediately to give players the opportunity to experiment. Of course, for more details on what you can expect from the weaponry at launch, you can read more about the specifics in the Call of Duty blog post.</p>

Following yesterday's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-gets-first-trailer-and-its-launching-into-early-access-next-year">first proper Subnautica 2 reveal</a>, developer Unknown Worlds has given some early hints at what players can expect when the underwater survival adventure launches into early access next year. Multiplayer support and "several biomes" will feature on day one, but there's plenty of time to evolve given early access is expected to last "about 2 to 3 years."

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> (which will be the third entry in Unknown World's series, following on from its 2018 original and 2021's standalone expansion <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-below-zero">Subnautica: Below Zero</a>) was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-new-subnautica-game-is-in-early-development">initially teased</a> back in April 2022, with its big new feature being co-op for up to four players.
</p>
<p>
Subnautica 2's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-responds-to-publisher-claims-its-a-multiplayer-live-service-game">briefly controversial</a> multiplayer mode got a bit of a hat tip in this week's debut teaser trailer, which features two divers working together to explore the oceanic depths of an alien planet. However, Unknown Worlds has now revealed a little bit more of what players can expect when the game launches next year.

"You are a pioneer traveling to a distant world, but something is amiss," the studio teases in a recently published <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/">listing on Steam</a>. "The ship's AI insists you carry on the mission. This world is too dangerous for humans to survive... Unless you change what it means to be human. What creatures, intelligent or otherwise, await your arrival?"
</p><p>
Subnautica 2 continues the series' tradition of nautical survival, but this time takes place on an all-new alien ocean planet. It'll see players exploring everything from towering underwater cliffs to lush coral fields, all with their own diverse ecosystems and unique creatures. "But something isn't right," adds Uknown Worlds. "The world is out of balance. What happened here? What happened to you? And more importantly, where are you?"
</p>
<p>
Alongside multiplayer, Subnautica 2 promises an "overhauled building system", and "new tools [that] allow for greater adaptation to the world". But as to what'll be included when early access access begins next year, Unknown Worlds is touting a "multiplayer mode, several biomes, some narrative, and a variety of creatures and craftables." This initial offering will expand with "more biomes, creatures, craftables, features, and narratives" as development continues.
</p>
<p>
Players thinking of waiting for Subnautica 2's full 1.0 release might be hanging on for a while, however, with Unknown Worlds saying it currently expects the game to be in early access development for "about 2 to 3 years".  There are a "number of goals" it's  "adamantly working towards", and the studio is focusing on "delivering quality at a reasonable pace". 
</p>
<p>
Subnautica 2 doesn't have a launch date yet, but it'll be available through Steam, the Epic Games Store, and Xbox Series X/S when its early access begins in 2025.

It’s fall, and spooky season is upon us, which means it’s time to spend your nights settling in with a good scary movie. We’ve got <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-halloween-movies-disney-scary-spooky-1851654060&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-halloween-movies-disney-scary-spooky-1851654060">a list of those for you to check out</a></span>, as well as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-horror-games-ps5-xbox-steam-pc-silent-hill-2-1851671021&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-horror-games-ps5-xbox-steam-pc-silent-hill-2-1851671021">best horror games of the last 20 years</a></span>, but what if you’re looking for something more specific? Maybe something sexy, sensual, and sanguine? A vampire movie, perhaps?</p><p>We’ve got a collection of must-watch vampire flicks for your perusal, from ‘80s classics like <em>The Lost Boys</em> and <em>Near Dark</em> to more modern movies like <em>Van Helsing </em>and <em>Queen of the Damned</em>. There’s scary ones like <em>30 Days of Nights</em>, and hilarious ones like <em>What We Do in the Shadows. </em>Whatever kind of vampire movie you’re looking for, we’ve got you covered. So in no particular order, here are the vampire movies you should check out ASAP.</p></div></div><div><p>Joel Schumacher’s <em>The Lost Boys</em> is certainly not the scariest vampire movie, and possibly not the funniest, but it’s the one I can watch and rewatch, over and again, while quoting along with all its most iconic scenes in the most infuriating way possible.</p><p>It’s so wonderfully ‘80s, yet utterly timeless, a ludicrous mishmash of adult horror, Spielbergish children’s caper, and teenage metal album cover, a combination that’s clearly aimed at no one and yet perfect for everyone. This is a movie that has chilling nighttime vampiric stalking sequences and the line, “My own brother, a goddamn shit-sucking vampire! You wait ‘til mom finds out!”</p><p>While I’m not going to try to argue that this film isn’t cheesy, I am going to argue that it’s more than cheesy. That’s in large part thanks to a cast that, alongside 80s cheddar-chewers like Corey Haim and Corey Feldman, features the likes of Jason Patric, Edward Herrmann, and the always exquisite Dianne Wiest. Never mind Alex Winter, two years before anyone would hear of <em>Bill &amp; Ted</em>. <br></p><p>It’s hilariously funny, but it’s funny on purpose. It’s surprisingly creepy, but always with a wry grin. And it’s by far the most quotable vampire film ever made. “Maggots, Michael. You’re eating maggots.” “Are you freebasing?

Couple that with incredible set design and wildly innovative special effects, and it’s difficult to think of another movie with such a strong visual identity.</p><p>Plus Winona Ryder is an absolute vision to behold as Mina Harker, a Victorian woman drawn to the dark (and sexy) side by Gary Oldman’s (admittedly irresistible) Dracula—we watch as those big, brown eyes that once looked upon the world with innocent curiosity mature and morph into something darker and more dangerous. <em>Bram Stoker’s Dracula </em>is an absolute must-watch not just during spooky season, but year-round. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>It’s not that vampires weren’t cool to me when I was young. They were cool, but in a kind of stuffy, old-timey way. I watched old movies about Dracula and even ventured into his realm myself in <em>Castlevania</em>, and so vampires, to me, were synonymous with capes and fog and remote castles in the European countryside hundreds of years ago. (And yes, I saw <em>The Lost Boys</em>, but while it was “fun” in a cheesy sort of way, it was too glossy and mainstream to really get me excited about the idea of modern-day bloodsuckers.) Then I saw Kathryn Bigelow’s movie <em>Near Dark</em> and had my entire understanding of vampires turned upside down. These vampires were rock n’ roll! Like a leather-clad biker gang that also wanted to suck your blood, <em>Near Dark</em>’s band of modern-day nightcrawlers simultaneously horrified me and electrified me. I wanted to run away from them, <em>and</em> I wanted to be one of them. Who wouldn’t feel the charismatic pull of a group that includes both Bill Paxton—at his most sinister and unnerving here in a thrilling performance—and Lance Henriksen, whose gravitas serves as a counterbalance to Paxton’s mania?</p><p>The movie is as rock n’ roll as its subjects, an exhilarating American odyssey of open roads, small-town motels, and dimly lit bars, with real visual energy and poetry to it. Before she’d go on to mak<em>e Point Break</em> and the much-maligned but now widely reclaimed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/strange-days-streaming-cyberpunk-2077-braindance-1849945692?_gl=1*19ctsm0*_ga*MTk4MjkyODk2OS4xNzExNTYxOTM0*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTI2NTM3Ni4yNDkuMS4xNzI5MjY2ODA4LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/strange-days-streaming-cyberpunk-2077-braindance-1849945692?_gl=1*19ctsm0*_ga*MTk4MjkyODk2OS4xNzExNTYxOTM0*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTI2NTM3Ni4yNDkuMS4xNzI5MjY2ODA4LjYwLjAuMA.." target="_blank"><em>Strange Days</em></a></span><em>, Near Dark</em> announced the arrival of a major filmmaking talent in Kathryn Bigelow. It also changed the way I thought about vampires forever. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><p><em>Van Helsing</em> is one of those aughts movies that is campy and silly while trying to keep a semi-straight face. Starring Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing in one of his sexiest roles ever and Kate Beckinsale as the equally sexy Anna Valerious, <em>Van Helsing</em> is an homage to the Universal horror movies of the ‘30s and ‘40s, which is why it can sometimes feel a bit too reliant on pastiche. It reminds me a lot of <em>The League of Extraordinary Gentleman</em>, the steampunk/Gothic comic book movie featuring iconic literary characters like Tom Sawyer, Dorian Grey, and Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde which came out a year earlier.</p><p>It’s got all the hallmarks of an aughts film: an overreliance on mediocre digital effects, an incessantly blue tinge in nearly every scene, and unabashed horniness. Is it a great movie? No. But is it a movie in which incredibly hot and incredibly horny brides of Dracula transform into gray-skinned flying bats to attack a small village and try to turn Kate Beckinsale before one of them takes an auto-crossbow to the gut from Jackman that pins her to a building’s spire? Yes. — AM</p></div><div><p>While the TV show on FX has become arguably more well-known and popular than the original movie, 2014’s <em>What We Do in the Shadows</em> is worth checking out a decade after its release. The basic setup of the movie, like the show, is that a group of vampires live together in a house, and we watch them via a documentary camera crew as they try to navigate normal and paranormal situations including ex-lovers, werewolves, parties, and the death of a friend.</p><p>What really makes <em>Shadows </em>a blast to watch over and over is that the cast, including Takia Waititi and Jemaine Clement, perfectly nail their roles as loveable vampires trying to fit into modern society while still being creepy bloodsucking weirdos you probably wouldn’t want to hang out with in real life. — Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>1998's <em>Blade </em>gives us <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=blade+club+scene&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS1108US1108&amp;oq=blade+club+scene&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDE0MDhqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#vhid=zephyr:0&amp;vssid=atritem-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DXHzcIBC50MU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=blade+club+scene&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS1108US1108&amp;oq=blade+club+scene&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDE0MDhqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#vhid=zephyr:0&amp;vssid=atritem-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DXHzcIBC50MU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the most iconic opening scenes</a></span> of all time: a hot girl drags a goofy guy through a butcher shop to the entrance of a secret club filled with writhing bodies undulating to a techno beat. Hot people make out in corners and eye the guy like he’s a lone zebra calf on an open plain and they’re a pack of lions. Suddenly, the club’s sprinkler system goes off—but instead of water, the sprinklers are spraying blood. “What’s the matter, baby?” the girl asks, her fangs bared. Just when you think this guy is going to become vamp dinner, Blade, the Daywalker, shows up.</p><p>Wesley Snipes is incredible as Blade, the stoic, self-hating half-vampire determined to protect the human race from the worst of his kind. <em>Blade</em> is a bit goofy at times, sure, but we also get banger performances from Kris Kristofferson as Blade’s comrade in arms and Stephen Dorff as an evil vampire club owner. It’s a classic flick, and I really really really hope we can see Mahershala Ali step into Blade’s leather fit sometime soon. — AM</p></div><div><p><em>Let The Right One In</em> was the Swedish precursor to Matt Reeves’ horror success, <em>Let Me In</em>. So, are we picking <em>Låt den rätte komma</em> in because we’re some bunch of pretentious film snobs? Nope, it’s because I’ve <em>seen</em> this version, but never got around to the U.S. follow-up. Although it seems likely you’d do well to watch either, or both.</p><p>Based on the novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist, <em>Let the Right One In</em> tells the deeply quiet and gentle story of a friendship between a 12-year-old boy, Oskar, and a girl who looks much his own age, Eli. Eli is new to the area, and moves into the apartment building next door to Oskar, and the two begin to form a relationship, despite Eli’s opening declaration that they could never be friends. Eli, as you might have guessed given the nature of this collection of films, is also a vampire, which somewhat complicates things—especially as she needs blood, and the adult man she lives with, Håkan, is failing to secure her any.</p><p>What follows is the most stunningly calm and evenly paced piece of cinema, in which the snow is as much of a character as any of the people. It’s a film that’s about childhood, about bullying, and about friendship, before it’s about vampiric dismemberment, but it does this without pretensions, without thinking itself above the genre, and also with plenty of vampiric dismemberment. Years before the breakthrough of “Scandi-noir,” <em>Let the Right One In</em> embodied all of its defining features of understated severity, brooding quietness, and dark, dark humor. — JW</p></div><div><p>Yes, the television series of the same name based on the same book by Anne Rice is just as good as (if not better than) this Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise film, but you absolutely must watch this movie first. Not only does it have two of the most iconic modern actors playing a bitchy gay vampire couple wearing more makeup than I do for a night at the club, but a baby-faced Kirsten Dunst will wow you as a young girl perpetually frozen in adolescence. </p><p>It’s campy, it’s lush, it’s absurd—it’s Anne Rice, baby. — AM</p></div><div><p>One time I convinced a friend of mine to sit down and watch <em>From Dusk Till Dawn</em> with me and they had no idea what the movie was about. For the first 30 or so minutes, they were enjoying the dark story of two criminals kidnapping a family and stealing their RV to make their escape to Mexico. And then, after stopping at a large strip club/bar, vampires showed up and my friend was shocked, but also extremely excited.</p><p>Sadly, if you are reading this now you can’t have this experience. But <em>Dusk</em>’s shift from a story about criminals on the run to a tale of survival as a small group of people fight back endless waves of demonic vampires still works even if you know what’s coming. It’s like two movies stitched together and it somehow works. A big reason the “twist” succeeds is that the group we meet in the first half is well-defined and we get to really know who they are, so as they start to get picked off in the second half we care a lot more. What could have been a so-so vampire movie is elevated by the first half and some incredible gore. — ZZ<br></p></div><div><p>If you’re into nu-metal and the late, great Aaliyah, then you’re into <em>Queen of the Damned.</em> This is another one of the movies on this list that isn’t necessarily <em>good</em> but it is an important entry into the lexicon of vampire cinema. It follows iconic vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend), a rock star in the modern day whose nu-metal concert wakes up Akasha (Aaliyah), the ancient queen of vampires who wants to make him her king consort. </p><p>It’s based on a book in Anne Rice’s <em>Vampire Chronicles</em> series (and is <em>technically</em> a sequel to <em>Interview</em>), and it is as horny and absurd as all good vampire movies should be. There’s ancient vampire meetings, sexual subservience, and a quest for world domination, all powered by music by Disturbed, Papa Roach, and Chester Bennington. Hot Topic was never the same. — AM</p></div><div><p>If “the first Iranian vampire Western” doesn’t pique your interest, I fear nothing will. <em>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</em> is a beautiful subversion of the traditional life of a woman in Iran—a young vampire woman with a taste for bad men (literally) can freely roam the streets at night, because she <em>is</em> the danger in the dark. She begins to interfere in the life of a young man struggling to take care of his addict father who has gotten them into a pickle with a local drug dealer—the more she interferes, the more it’s clear that she’s no typical woman, but does that matter? </p><p>The film, clearly inspired by Sergio Leone and spaghetti Westerns as well as the original <em>Nosferatu</em>, is beautifully shot and well-acted, taking the familiar genres and turning them upside down and inside out by melding them with a bold, graphic novel-esque visual style. — AM<br></p></div><div><p><em>30 Days of Night </em>(based on the comic book series of the same name) is intense and relentless—as intense as it must be to face a 30-day-long polar night when you’re town is being attacked by vampires, I suppose. That’s the premise of the 2007 horror film, directed by David Slade and starring Josh Hartnett as the sheriff of the small, snowy town of Barrow, which is its own character in this film. </p><p>Though <em>30 Days of Night</em> falls victim to some typical vampire movie tropes (lightning-fast movement, heaps upon heaps of cruelty, and some gaping plot holes), its unique setting helps it stand out in a sanguine sea. You can almost <em>feel</em> the cold hand of death creeping up your leg while you watch it, and it will certainly make you a little bit more freaked out on an impossibly quiet, snowy night. — AM</p></div><div><p>If you’ve got some extra spare time over an upcoming weekend, you should absolutely double feature 1985's <em>Fright Night</em> and the 2011 remake starring Colin Farrell. In both films, a teenager believes his new next-door neighbor is a vampire and turns to an actor who played a vampire hunter to help him oust the bastard. The original is more campy and absurd thanks to its reliance on practical effects and the overall ‘80s-ness of it all, but the second has both Farrell and the late Anton Yelchin, so it’s worth a watch. Try them back-to-back and see which one is your fave. — AM</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

33 Immortals - the 33-player co-op action roguelike from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spiritfarer">Spiritfarer</a> studio Thunder Lotus - has been delayed into next year, as it "needs a little bit more time in the oven before it's ready".
</p>
<p>
Thunder Lotus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spiritfarer-developers-new-game-is-a-33-player-co-op-action-rpg">unveiled 33 Immortals last June</a>, promising a game in which players, taking on the role of damned souls, must co-operative to defeat hordes of monsters and massive bosses in order to rebel against God's final judgment and fight for their eternal lives.
</p>
<p>
33 Immortals was originally due to launch into early access sometime this year, but Thunder Lotus has now pushed its release into 2025, as it revealed <a href="https://x.com/ThunderLotus/status/1846959359043272895">on social media</a>. "The game needs a little bit more time the oven before it's ready," the studio wrote. "We're making great progress, but this year has really flown by! We still want to iron out a few unexpected challenges with stability and address the valuable feedback we've received from you during testing."

"Though we don't have a set date for 2025 just yet," Thunder Lotus continued, "we're excited to announce that another playable opportunity is coming soon on both Epic and Xbox. Stay tuned for more details, we think you'll love what's coming next."
</p><p>
33 Immortals will make its early access debut on Xbox, Windows PC, and the Epic Games Store, with Thunder Lotus having elected to eschew Steam at launch. Whether the studio can pull off its ambitious concept remains to be seen, but signs are promising: its previous titles - Spiritfarer, Jotun, and Sundered - have ranged from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sundered-review">great</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spiritfarer-review-a-beautiful-unique-blend-of-genres">geniunely special</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/18/24273563/supper-mario-broth-creator-fan-support<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of the popular Mario blog, <a href="https://www.suppermariobroth.com/">Supper Mario Broth</a>, have come together to remind us that the internet can still be a place where good things happen.</p><p>Supper Mario Broth is one of the most wholesome Mario blogs on the internet. Since 2017, its owner has posted a regular stream of Mario-flavored tidbits he could dig up including interesting glitches, old advertisements and merchandise, screenshots, gifs, artwork, and more. If it’s obscure and has to do with Mario, Supper Mario Broth will let you know about it and the blog has become a celebrated institution in the broader Nintendo community. </p><p>However on October 17th, the person behind all this wonderful content <a href="https://youtu.be/QAPGbeknudY?si=UNRxHxYbatCc8wFZ">posted a video</a> saying the entire endeavor was in danger of being permanently shut down. “This is the end of Supper Mario Broth as we know it,” said the creator, who has not revealed his real name <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/meet-the-meticulous-fan-behind-the-internets-most-meticulous-mario-blog/">and prefers to simply go by Broth</a>. </p><p>In the short-but-heart-wrenching video, Broth revealed that for the last six years he was the primary caregiver for his mother. He said the government assistance he received for that work, in addition to a part-time salary and meager earnings from his Patreon was just barely enough to allow him to work on Supper full-time. However, Broth shared that his mother passed away and that his other earnings wouldn’t be enough for him to stay in his apartment. </p><p>“I will have to get a full-time job,” he said. “And I will not have any time to do Supper Mario Broth anymore.”</p><p>Broth ends the video with an emotional plea begging his fans for their help. </p><p>“I’m praying for a miracle,” Broth said.</p><p>And he got one.</p><p>The very next day, October 18th, Broth posted an update saying support he received was so great that not only would he be able to continue his work full-time but he’d also be able to expand his operation.</p><p>Because of community, mutual support, and genuine human empathy, a person had their livelihood saved. Not only that, but Broth’s work has genuinely contributed to the preservation of <em>Mario</em> history and we, thankfully, still get to enjoy that.</p><p>“I will always remember [...] all of the joy we shared in Mario,” Broth said. “And I hope that whatever happens, you will remember me.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If, like me, you are a procrastinator, that means you probably haven’t figured out what you will wear when trick-or-treating, handing out candy, or attending costume parties at the end of the month. Have no fear, superheroes are here to solve your problems.<br></p><p>With both Marvel and DC releasing a steady stream of movies and TV shows—to the point of oversaturation, some might argue—there is no shortage of superhero-themed costumes to choose from. The wonders of the modern internet also make them easier than ever to order and get in time for Halloween celebrations.</p><p>If you’re more of a Marvel person, then the best place to start is with this year’s big releases.

Looking to the future of the MCU, you could also bring out a Doctor Doom costume in anticipation of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/robert-downey-jr-rdj-doctor-doom-avengers-marvel-sdcc-1851607689&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/robert-downey-jr-rdj-doctor-doom-avengers-marvel-sdcc-1851607689">Robert Downey Jr.’s villainous turn</a></span> in the upcoming <em>Avengers</em> films.</p><p>For DC fans, this year is all about Batman’s villains. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/joker-2-folie-a-deux-reviews-rotten-tomatoes-lady-gaga-1851665388&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/joker-2-folie-a-deux-reviews-rotten-tomatoes-lady-gaga-1851665388"><em>Joker: Folie à Deux</em></a></span><em> </em>saw the return of Joaquin Phoenix’s take on the clown prince of crime, this time with Lady Gaga along for the ride as Harley Quinn.

                <p>Certain Affinity, a developer known for its co-development projects on major franchises and games like Call of Duty, Halo, and Hogwarts Legacy, has been sold to Keywords Studios. You might not have heard of the Dublin-based Keywords, but the company is gigantic--it owns 50 companies around the world, many of which are connected to the video game industry in one way or another.</p><p>Keywords paid an <a href="https://irpages2.equitystory.com/websites/rns_news/English/1100/news-tool---rns---eqs-group.html?article=34632409&amp;company=keywords" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">undisclosed sum</a> for Certain Affinity, and as part of the buyout, CEO Max Hoberman and president Paul Sams will stay on with the company. Keywords said it's excited about Certain Affinity's future, which includes a "strong pipeline of high-quality projects." One of these is the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exodus-gets-a-new-trailer-featuring-cosmic-horrors-and-matthew-mcconaughey/1100-6527187/" data-ref-id="1100-6527187">Exodus, which features Oscar-winner Matthew McConaughey</a>. Certain Affinity is a co-developer on the game with Archetype Entertainment, which itself is a division of Wizards of the Coast.</p><p>Keywords CEO Bertrand Bodson said the company has "enormous respect" for Certain Affinity, while Hoberman said he was "thrilled" to sell to Keywords "at this most difficult time in the market." He said selling to Keywords gives Certain Affinity and its 180+ employees "stability and a supportive home."</p><p>The video game industry has faced a tough stretch in the past few years <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">regarding mass layoffs</a>.

In addition to supporting other developer's projects, Certain Affinity made its first original game, Age of Booty, in 2008.

<p>Call of Duty has featured some form of Early Access for the last several years, so we’re here to discuss Black Ops 6 and the notion of more Early Access and whether either the Campaign, Zombies, or Multiplayer can be enjoyed earlier than scheduled.</p>



<p>I’ve enjoyed playing the last few CoD campaigns before the official release date. Doing so allows me to complete the story component and move on to the rest of the content with time to spare. I got through the relatively short Modern Warfare 3 Campaign in 2023 ahead of time, meaning I was free to pile my way through multiplayer on launch.</p>



<p>Players typically enjoy this freedom, making Early Access a great benefit and a cool incentive to pre-order. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-release-date-time-countdown-launch-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 release date</a> is on the horizon, so let’s see if Early Access is included in this year’s iteration.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Bad news, sadly. Credit to Activison</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, <strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 does not have Campaign Early Access</strong>, nor does the first-person shooter offer Early Access in any capacity. You must wait until launch day before you can play any of the game’s main content: Campaign, Zombies, and online multiplayer.</p>



<p>My first memory of CoD going down the Early Access route was 2016’s Infinite Warfare, which famously included a special Legacy Edition—giving you access to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Remastered. If you pre-ordered, you could play CoD 4’s Campaign before the full multiplayer launch.</p>



<p>Fast-forward to modern times, and 2022 and 2023’s Modern Warfare reboot entries have also featured Campaign Early Access. This tactic presumably encourages players to soak in and appreciate the time and effort that went into the Campaign before sinking hundreds and thousands of hours into multiplayer.</p>



<p>For whatever reason, Treyarch/Activision has decided against the idea of Early Acces this time around. Personally, it doesn’t deter me from playing the Black Ops 6 Campaign as I play them all—especially when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-achievements-how-to-unlock-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 trophies</a> are on the line.</p>



<p>You might have a headache concerning the BLOPS 6 content you choose first, but it’s a good dilemma to consider. We’ll have to see if Campaign Early Access returns for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty 2025</a>.</p>
