<figure><a title="Switch 2 Pro Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0fbfc6e72db97/switch-2-pro-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We know the Switch 2 has sold incredibly well worldwide, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-2-launch-helps-boost-us-video-game-spending-to-record-june-high">the console shifting 1.6 million units in June 2025 in the US alone</a>. Now we have an idea of just how well the pricey, but excellent, new Pro Controller has done, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/even-85-switch-2-controllers-just">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a> has shared Circana's estimated Switch 2 Pro Controller sales, and it's around 512,000 in the United States — that means around one in three people picking up a Switch 2 have also grabbed a shiny new controller to go with. That's around <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37t7z552k">a 32% attach rate</a>.</p>
<p>If you're a Nintendo fan, you'll know that the Pro Controller is one of the pricier controllers on the market right now, and is actually one of the accessories that went up in price in response to the Trump Administration's tariffs (or, as Nintendo put it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2-us-pre-orders-start-24th-april-system-and-launch-game-pricing-unchanged">"changes in market conditions"</a>) — from $80 to $85.</p>

<p>The original Switch 1 Pro Controller is also compatible with the console, and that, coupled with the price of the new controller, has put some people off rushing to grab one , as good as it is.</p>
<p>We're also still in the very early days of the console's life, so those sales are likely going to dip over the coming months. Still, 32% is an impressive number, and we'll be interested to see how other accessories — such as the Camera — have sold.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-announces-new-ps5-beta-update-for-pairing-dualsense-controllers-to-multiple-devices-and-upcoming-power-saving-update-to-reduce-power-consumption.1251534/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/">announced</a> a new update coming to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro users who have opted into the PS5 Beta program, meant to make pairing your DualSense controller to multiple devices at a time a "<em>seamless</em>" process. The update, which is being pushed tomorrow for users in the beta program, will let you switch from using your DualSense controller wirelessly on one device to another, without having to re-pair it every time.</p>



<p>The PlayStation Blog post describes a process through which after you've initially paired your DualSense or DualSense Edge controller with your PS5, PC, and mobile device, through a combination of pressing the PS button and one of the face buttons, you can switch between devices.</p>



<p>"<em>With this update, you can now register up to four devices simultaneously, and easily switch between them directly from your controller,</em>" writes Shuzo Kikuchi, vice president of product management at Sony. "<em>For example, you can take your controller which you use with your PS5, then seamlessly switch connection to a PC to play PC games, or connect it to a smartphone to enjoy Remote Play from your PS5. With this enhanced flexibility, you can enjoy gaming more freely across multiple devices</em>.<em>"</em></p>



<p>Once you've properly paired your controller to a device the first time, going through the prescribed button presses in the example chart below should let you switch from one device to another, without skipping a beat. </p>



<p>Note that this chart doesn't mean you'll need to set up device switching in this exact way, it is just an example of how you can have up to four devices paired to one controller and switch between them.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Slot Number</strong></td><td><strong>Button Used</strong></td><td><strong>Player Indicator Lights</strong></td><td><strong>Connected Device</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Slot 1</td><td>PS button and Triangle button</td><td>One light on</td><td>PS5</td></tr><tr><td>Slot 2</td><td>PS button and Circle button</td><td>Two lights on</td><td>PS5 Pro</td></tr><tr><td>Slot 3</td><td>PS button and Cross button</td><td>Three lights on</td><td>Windows PC</td></tr><tr><td>Slot 4</td><td>PS button and Square button</td><td>Four lights on</td><td>iPhone</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The other key element of the blog post announcing this update is a feature that won't be in tomorrow's update but will be in a future one. A power-saving mode is coming down the pipeline, which will reduce the amount of power your console is pulling while playing games that support the feature. </p>



<p>Meaning that if you're playing, say, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, and it supports this power saving feature, then with the feature enabled, your PS5/PS5 Pro device will draw less power to run the game. This will result in performance being scaled back, and it also disables features like VR support for games that have a VR mode. The intent of the mode is to reduce the environmental footprint caused by running your PS5/PS5 Pro at full power whenever you're using it.</p>



<p>If you're a player who cares about having a smooth framerate and/or being able to play with graphical features like ray-tracing, then it's doubtful you'll ever use a mode like this. But for games that don't require that much power to run them at a smooth framerate, and ones that don't even have higher-fidelity options in terms of graphics, like most pixel-art games, it's a solid option to reduce the environmental impact, and perhaps even your own electricity bill. </p>



<p>For now though, we're still waiting to see how many games will even support the feature, and the specifics around how it'll work. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em>&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy </em>was already known to be the best selling set of all time, but new statements from Hasbro in their financial reporting reveal the staggering degree of which this is the case.</p>

<p>During the earning call Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks opened up saying that&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>&nbsp;was up 23% year over year, and up 32% year to date, foreshadowing the crazy numbers yet to come. When answering a question, Cocks revealed that&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Ranking ALL of Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Legendary Creatures Part 1"><em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>(and its hoard of legendary creatures)</a> had sold as much in one day, as previous best selling set&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings - Tales of Middle-Earth</em>&nbsp;did in 6 months.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In terms of Final Fantasy, and how it met expectations, I'll give you a comparison between two of our biggest Universes Beyond sets. Lord of the Rings took 6 months to deliver $200 million of revenue, Final Fantasy took 1 day, and we left demand on the table. So we couldn't produce enough. I think we increased production runs on it 4x pre release. It was substantially by many, many very high double-digit percentages ahead of any other production run we've ever done, and we left the market wanting more." (Transcript from <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4803536-hasbro-inc-has-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hasbro, Inc. (HAS) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript">Seeking Alpha</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite that huge sales, and increasing production of <em>Magic: The Gathering -&nbsp;</em><em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>4 separate times, they still were unable to meet the demand that brought over $200m in sales on day 1. That $200m in revenue was a large part of the Wizards and Digital gaming revenue segment which was $522m.</p>

<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> Isn't the Only Set Doing Big Numbers</h2>

<p>Of course, if the only strong numbers were related to&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;it would be somewhat concerning. That isn't the case, as in his prepared comments Cocks revealed that&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/tarkir-dragonstorm-commander-deck-reviews" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Tarkir: Dragonstorm Commander Deck Reviews - Roaring Fun!"><em>Tarkir - Dragonstorm</em>&nbsp;</a>is on pace to become the best selling in-universe premiere&nbsp;set (aka standard legal, and not a&nbsp;<em>Modern Horizons</em>&nbsp;type set) of all time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Player count in organized play was also up substantially, with a 40% increase in unique players taking part in events as Universes Beyond manages to attract both new and old players to the game. This was also buoyed by&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>as it "set a record for new player growth, delivering more new players in its first 2 weeks than any prior set posted over an entire season," <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/005be71f-0c3f-4e8a-800e-06ecd698c19c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hasbro Investor Prepared Remarks">according to Cocks</a>.</p>

<p>Older cards are selling too. Despite half the year left to go,&nbsp;<em>Magic</em>'s backlist of sets has already set an all-time annual record of sales as of the end of June. This is partially powered by sets like&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings - Tales of Middle-Earth</em>, but also by sets like&nbsp;<em>Modern Horizons 3</em>, and&nbsp;other in-universe sets that continue to sell even more to more players. As for Secret Lair, the controversial decision to go back to limited print runs has not harmed sales at all as it has just delivered its strongest sales quarter in its history, possibly powered by the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-releasing-three-secret-lair-x-final-fantasy-drops-this-summer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Wizards of the Coast Releasing Three Secret Lair x Final Fantasy Drops This Summer"><em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>Secret Lairs</a>.</p>

<p>All in all,&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>'s finances are booming right now, and it's good to be Hasbro, who is able to lean on Wizards of the Coast while various toys experience more difficulties with tariffs due to components coming from regions that are heavily tariffed often.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/ozzy-osbourne-death-blizzcon-2009-world-of-warcraft</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ozzy-osbourne-played-a-video-game-convention-in-2009-and-it-ruled.1251519/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2009, I had been a journalist for, charitably, one year. I was in college, and most of the publications I’d written for paid in exposure rather than cash. Somehow, for reasons that have since been lost to time, I wound up with a press pass to BlizzCon, Blizzard’s official though still-nascent annual gathering in Anaheim, California. What I did not fully grasp the significance of back then – so starry-eyed was I at the prospect of interviewing people who’d worked on <em>StarCraft </em>– was that this meant I had also been handed a front-row ticket to an Ozzy Osbourne show.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a different era for games journalism – already removed from the glitz, glamor, and lavish review/preview trips of <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-game-development-ign-kotaku" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the ‘90s and early 2000s</a>, but nowhere near as far as we are today. Ozzy’s appearance wasn’t a walled-off press perk, though; this was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP3c736bzYU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a show for everyone in attendance</a>, a flex of a tradition that would in subsequent years lead to closing ceremonies headlined by acts including Tenacious D, Foo Fighters, Blink 182, Metallica, Linkin Park, and Muse. At the time, though, only one rock band, The Offspring, had previously heralded BlizzCon’s conclusion, and no offense to The Offspring, but they weren’t Ozzy Osbourne.&nbsp;</p><p>Almost two decades later, I remember the 2009 show in bits and pieces. At the time, I marveled at how, despite gaining a reputation for unintelligible speech and half-lucidly shouting “Sharon,” Ozzy’s singing voice was still crystal clear – and strong as all hell. I also recall that even though I was only a burgeoning concert goer at that point in my life, I’d already learned to recognize what a dead crowd looked like. Ozzy repeatedly implored BlizzCon attendees to jump, clap, and move, but many of them were seated, and only during the biggest hits did it really <em>feel </em>like a metal show ought to. (This would continue to be an issue for BlizzConcerts; tired nerds at the end of a convention weekend do not a great crowd make, but that never stopped artists from trying.)&nbsp;</p><p>Ozzy did his best, though, and apparently he had a good time.</p><p>“I was thinking they'd all be wearing spectacles the size of f****** Coca-Cola bottles, like curly white hair and f****** rimmed glasses, you know, the scientist types,” Ozzy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ozzy-osbourne-rides-crazy-train-into-blizzcon-2009/1100-6216112/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told GameSpot</a> of the BlizzCon audience in an interview after the show (censorship theirs, not ours). “But they were f****** great, man. The vibe was there. The kids had a great time. That's the best part of my job: giving them the best time.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Ozzy Osbourne World of Warcraft AS AIRED then ACTUAL STORYBOARDS version Commercial TV ad WoW" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T6LpGBS-BUo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>There are a few pieces of cultural ephemera worth excavating here. Foremost, Ozzy’s presence at BlizzCon feels weirdly incongruous until you consider that he was fresh off a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6LpGBS-BUo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">popular 2008 commercial</a> for <em>World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King</em> in which he competed against the aforementioned in-game monarch to determine who was the real “Prince Of Darkness” and lost. Never mind that one was a prince and the other was a king, rendering the entire premise nonsensical; I remember enjoying this ad a lot when I first saw it – and then a little less each of the following one thousand times.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/08/23/blizzcon-09-ozzy-osbourne-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking with IGN</a> after the BlizzCon show, Ozzy – who also voiced The Guardian Of Metal in Double Fine’s 2009 cult classic <em>Brütal Legend</em> – explained his relationship to video games.</p><p>"To be honest with you, I don't [play <em>World of Warcraft</em>],” Ozzy told IGN. “I'm very computer dumb. My son goes, 'Dad, check this out.' He plays those war games, my son, and I'm a World War II buff. But he sits up there in his room for f****** four days playing this thing going, 'Shhh! Don't get me going!' I'm very slow with the computers; I'm one of the old timers. But it's the future, you know. My kids now – when I was a kid, the big thing with my dad was learning how to work the remote, and I learned that, so I thought, 'I'll always know what's going on.' But now my kids are talking in f****** computer language – megabytes and gigabytes, whatever the f*** that means."</p><p>His perspective on <em>Brütal Legend</em> revealed a similarly begrudging open-mindedness that, as someone now being overtaken by the world in the great race we call life, I cannot help but respect.&nbsp;</p><p>“You know what, a lot of guys have been doing the things I do for a long time, but they don't get involved with [games],” he said to IGN. “It's the wave of the future – it's sink or swim. I'm very honored to be in the video game. Someone was telling me that the one I did for the rock thing: a billion kids, a billion kids played it! That's f****** unbelievable! That's a f****** tenth of the population of the world! If only that many bought the f****** album.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>It's the wave of the future – it's sink or swim.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Someone lied to Ozzy about <em>Brütal Legend</em>’s sales so boldly and shamelessly that they probably succumbed to spontaneous human combustion immediately afterward, but that’s not the point. What matters is, this is a man who did his best to keep up with what was going on around him because fuck it, whatever, I guess I have to in order to remain an interesting person, and we can all learn from that.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite goth-ed up appearances and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/ozzy-osbourne-bites-head-off-bat-anniversary-1287867/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eternally mistold tales of bat biting</a>, Ozzy’s biggest songs were about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lD5bfqzr6E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learning how to love, forgetting how to hate</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUT730G-xvA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revolting against a world obsessed with war</a>. You don’t write lyrics like that unless you believe in people and the idea that, with sufficient time and collaboration, they’ll become better than they are now. It’s easy to recede into the comforting arms of irrelevance as the world regresses into division and strife. It’s much harder to stay present, grounded, and accept that you’ll never stop going through changes.&nbsp;</p><p>How exactly Ozzy squared all of this with latter-day claims that he preferred to "stay away from politics" and his wife's increasingly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/23/sharon-osbourne-calls-for-kneecap-rappers-us-visas-to-be-revoked-after-israel-criticism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fascist-friendly</a> <a href="https://www.newarab.com/news/dead-76-ozzy-osbourne-mourned-fierce-israel-ally" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support of Israel</a> – which led Ozzy to play shows there in 2010 and 2018 – is a question to which we will never get a direct answer. There is no excusing even tacit approval of such a stance, one that could be chalked up to an admirable distaste for antisemitism – as evidenced by <a href="https://x.com/OzzyOsbourne/status/1756100047056564602" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ozzy's rejection of Ye's request to sample his music in 2024</a> – but which via his actions, if not his words, went further. Heroes and legends can still be hypocrites, and even as we laud their achievements, we must also grapple with their failings. This is a big one, a stain on Ozzy's legacy that should not be forgotten.</p><p>Open-mindedness, selective though it evidently was, ultimately led Ozzy to a reality TV career and, eventually, collaborations with modern artists – like the irritating but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJZmO5mByVY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">undeniably skilled</a> Yungblud – in his final days. He never stopped trying shit. This proclivity was on full display during the 2009 BlizzCon show, with Ozzy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEnwWp70mJ8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bringing a then-nine-year-old guitarist named Yuto Miyazawa on stage</a> during “Crazy Train,” going so far as to heft Miyazawa on his shoulder midsong.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Crazy Train - Ozzy Osbourne with Yuto Miyazawa - Blizzcon 2009." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WEnwWp70mJ8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Miyazawa was about as familiar with Blizzard's games as Ozzy, but up on stage, none of that mattered to him.</p><p>"I always admired [Ozzy's] first guitarist Randy Rhoads," Miyazawa, now 25, told Aftermath. "When I played on his shoulder, I felt like I [was] Randy Rhoads for a moment. It was and is still my best moment of my life."</p><p>Miyazawa also noted that Ozzy went on to send him a Christmas card that year and invite him to Ozzfest 2010. </p><p>Back in 2009, Ozzy had no idea why he was at BlizzCon: “You know what? I have not the f****** faintest,” he replied when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ozzy-osbourne-rides-crazy-train-into-blizzcon-2009/1100-6216112/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameSpot asked</a> him how he wound up playing a convention center full of <em>WoW</em>, <em>Diablo</em>, and <em>StarCraft </em>fans.</p><p>But he still went up there and sang his heart out, grinning like a child even younger than Miyazawa when the crowd belted the chorus to “Crazy Train.” He made the same face <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NAemzzu9DI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during the same moment of his final show</a> just a couple weeks ago, weary but possessed by one final purpose – with a voice that, even after 76 years on this Earth, still kicked hard enough to wake the Devil.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>RIP to the real Prince Of Darkness.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ridge-racer-4-zine-magazine"><h3>Riiiiidddgggeeee Raaaaccceerrrr Ziiiinnnneeeee</h3></a><p>'A tribute to Namco's Ridge Racer Type 4, the vibiest racing game of all time'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/coming-of-age-anime-call-of-the-night-vampires"><h3>Call Of The Night Is The Sensual Coming Of Age Anime I Craved As A Teen</h3></a><p>When you’re a teenager, falling in love is about as risky as becoming a vampire</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tyler-the-creator-dont-tap-the-glass-hip-hop-rap-kendrick"><h3>We Should All Outgrow Our Heroes Like Tyler, The Creator</h3></a><p>Turns out all it takes to shake hip-hop’s foundations was “Don’t Tap The Glass” daring its rap listeners to put the keyboard down and dance

Reportedly, <em>BF6 </em>will arrive on October 10. The game will be available in two versions: A standard edition and a “Phantom Edition.” This Phantom Edition will be digital only and will include additional in-game content, likely cosmetics. Neither version will provide early access. Pre-orders will go live on July 31. </p><p><em>Battlefield 6</em>'s prices were also leaked, but they are in Euros, and it’s not clear yet how that will translate to the United States and other regions. At the very least, it appears the Phantom Edition will cost $30 more than the standard release. </p><p>Billbil-kun also reports that there will likely be an open beta for<em> Battlefield 6</em> available in August. This follows months and months of closed alpha testing. </p><p>We won’t have to wait long to find out how much of this report and its data-mined information is accurate. Tomorrow, on July 24, EA and its team of studios working on <em>Battlefield 6</em> will unveil the first trailer for the game, and we’ll likely be told its official release date and more. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/bf6-battlefield-6-leak-october-launch-early-access-beta-1851786824]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Game Manufacturers Association (GAMA) is entering its second lawsuit against the Trump Administration. The lawsuit involves the new wave of emergency tariffs being imposed by the US President, which would pose an existential crisis to the entire tabletop industry.</p>



<p>In a report by Board Game Wire, GAMA is joining the cookware manufacturer Firedisc and timber supplier Ryan Wholesale for a new lawsuit against the Trump Administration in response to its <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/07/economy/trump-letters-tariffs" rel="nofollow">recent sweeping emergency tariffs</a>. These new tariffs are imposing a price increase of anywhere between 10-20% on goods coming from multiple countries around the world, including Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and others.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gama-john-stacy-profile-photo.jpg?itok=aSnvWSwy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gama-john-stacy-profile-photo.jpg?itok=Uf2z7j_Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In many ways, this lawsuit may invoke a sense of deja vu on the part of GAMA. When the Trump Administration provoked a trade war with China, imposing tariffs on import costs, it was a devastating blow to the entire tabletop industry. One GAMA spent months of hard work trying to overturn.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it was a decision that came with its share of industry casualties. CMON has <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ceased development</a> and has had to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-acquires-zombicide-ip-from-board-game-publisher-cmon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some of its IPs</a> to keep the lights on. <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Than Games</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/boardlandia-shuts-down-due-to-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boardlandia</a> shut their doors.</p>

<p>The difference between the previous lawsuit and the new lawsuit is in scale. The first lawsuit pertained to Chinese imports only, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">still devastating</a> to the industry as a whole. These new tariffs by comparison, are a lot broader and far more devastating across multiple businesses and industries.</p>

<p>GAMA has stated that this lawsuit is about more than just the long-term health of the tabletop industry. Much like the first string of tariffs, these are being imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which allows the President to impose trade tariffs without approval of Congress while in states of emergency.</p>

<p>Since a state of emergency hasn't been declared, or the rationale to impose such a state is dubious at best, this would mean the President has unilaterally imposed these devastating tariffs without any Congressional approval or oversight.</p>

<p>This is the key argument of GAMA's second anti-tariff lawsuit. It invokes the US Supreme Court's Major Questions Doctrine, emphasizing that major policy changes require Congressional approval and that IEEPA does not provide such unilateral action. It is not just about economic fairness, but about restoring constitutional order.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“GAMA strongly supports this lawsuit as a critical effort to restore constitutional oversight of trade and tariffs.</p>

<p>“These emergency tariff orders are economically damaging and threatens tens of thousands of jobs in our industry that relies on international manufacturing and cooperation.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This new lawsuit was officially filed on July 21 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas</p>

                <p dir="ltr">If there's one thing Ready at Dawn co-founder Ru Weerasuriya wishes he could've done differently with The Order: 1886, it's getting more development time for the PS4 exclusive. He revealed in a new interview that the studio cut roughly 30% of the game to hit the game's release date in February 2015.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/ready-at-dawn-co-founder-says-vr" rel="nofollow ">The Game Business</a>, Weerasuriya discussed how "we really hoped to make a sequel" to The Order: 1886 and ruminated on what happened with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-order-1886-review-roundup/1100-6425390/">the game's lackluster critical reception</a>. "The game length [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-order-1886-review/1900-6416033/">GameSpot's reviewer</a> said it took 6 hours to finish] ... that's something that a lot of people talked about at the time," Weerasuriya said. "We cut ... I want to say 30% of the game a few months before it was released. We decided it had to come out in the time allotted. Were we to do it again, I would've probably tried to figure out a way to extend the development."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Firearms Expert Reacts To The Order: 1886’s Guns</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In the week leading up to the game's launch on February 20, 2015,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-order-1886-leaks-to-youtube-in-full-playthroug/1100-6425327/"> a leaked playthrough of The Order: 1886 appeared on YouTube</a> and showed a person beating the game in five hours. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-order-1886-dev-denies-five-hour-claim/1100-6425343/">This led to Ready at Dawn denying that claim</a> days later, arguing the game's length was roughly eight to 10 hours long.</p><p dir="ltr">Weerasuriya also touched on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4-exclusive-the-order-1886-won-t-have-multiplayer-will-run-at-1080p-30fps/1100-6417564/" data-ref-id="1100-6417564">the lack of multiplayer for The Order: 1886</a>. "We did do a multiplayer in the first year of development, but we didn't have the budget and time to finish it and, together with Sony, we decided to kill it in year two, and hopefully bring it back in a sequel," he said. "We had a functioning multiplayer. It was fun."</p><p dir="ltr">The sequel obviously never happened, even though Weerasuriya mentioned having "the story for the second and third one." <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4-exclusive-the-order-1886-delayed-to-2015/1100-6419882/">Sony did delay The Order: 1886</a> in May 2014, pushing the game back to 2015.</p><p dir="ltr">The other Ready at Dawn co-founder, Andrea Pessino, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-passed-on-the-order-1886-sequel-dev-claims/1100-6529368/" data-ref-id="1100-6529368">reflected on The Order: 1886 sequel</a> earlier this year, too. Like Weerasuriya, he mentioned the pressure to ship the game led to cut content. Facebook acquired Ready at Dawn in 2020, but then <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-order-1886-and-lone-echo-developer-shuts-down/1100-6525619/">shut down the studio last year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Plenty of people are busy revisiting two of the Switch 1's greatest games — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> — on Switch 2. The frame a resolution boost are pretty remarkable in our eyes, and it seems like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-zelda-upgraded-on-switch-2-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-tested">Digital Foundry agrees</a> with our assessment, calling the upgrades "transformative", especially for the 2023 sequel.</p>
<p>While the upgrades do cost a few pennies to pick up (though they are included in the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription), Digital Foundry thinks it's "worth it" to see just how remarkable these upgraded titles look on the new console.</p>
<p>First up is dynamic resolution, which is available on Switch 1, but the Switch 2's version has a higher range in both games to support 4K displays.</p>
<figure><a title="DF Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/12249eada6850/df-zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtdaeX_fGHI&amp;ab_channel=DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where dynamic resolution targeted 1600x900 on Switch 1 while docked, the Switch 2 release boosts that to a maximum of 2560x1440. There are dips in extreme cases, but these are extremely rare.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry did spot a few moments where the frames dipped randomly during cutscenes for no obvious reasons, but quickly corrected itself. And while the resolution boost and improved textures are fantastic across the board, there's a distinct lack (or lack of effectiveness) of anti-aliasing in both games.</p>

<p>Improved load times (some of which are more than halved) and shadow quality are two other highlights the outlet was keen to point out, but we want to focus on the frame rate and performance.</p>
<p>Focusing on Tears of the Kingdom first, Digital Foundry confirms what we all know — the game is running at 60fps for the most part, and stays pretty consistently up in those figures whether you're in battle or using Ultrahand. Testing only the first 6 hours of the game, DF noticed one tiny blip when building vehicles. A huge improvement from our experiences on Switch 1.</p>
<figure><a title="DF Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/93a8df22abe6f/df-zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtdaeX_fGHI&amp;ab_channel=DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Breath of the Wild is even more consistent, with busier areas like Kakariko and Zora's Domain put under the test with exploding barrels. These stay at a rock solid 60fps now.</p>
<p>So, it's an impressive rundown, with a few little caveats. While "rough points" do remain in both games, these two upgrades come with an easy recommendation from the tech specialists.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-corps-of-discovery-board-game-is-a-challenging-trek-through-the-american-wilderness.1251453/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">“Here be monsters,” says the legend on so many antique maps, firing the imagination with thoughts of kraken, chimeras, or worse. But what if it were true? What if Lewis and Clarke, setting out on their expedition across the American interior, encountered buffalo-headed minotaurs and man-eating plants. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the premise of the Corps of Discovery comic and now of this board game adaptation. The game comes from the same designers as the superb <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mind-mgmt-board-game-review"><u>Mind MGMT</u></a>, although, save for the comic book connection, this is a very different kind of game.</p><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What's in the box">What’s in the Box</h2></p><div catalogid="a6a6c32d-c46f-44a3-834e-97a927e776f1" id="225555"><div id="225555" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Corps of Discovery</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Most box-openings start with a board, and Corps of Discovery is no exception, but the nature of the board itself is rather surprising. Instead of the usual fold-out affair, you get a cardboard sandwich: two layers of card stuck together, with room in between to slip in a sheet of paper. The top layer is punctuated by a regular grid of circular holes, and the box contains an equally unusual supply of thick cardboard sun tokens with wide “pegs” that fit loosely into the grid's holes.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250628-145130883-1753125741072.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are two folders of paper maps that slide into the sandwich, one for each of the two scenarios included in the game. There’s also a second board which is used for tracking the current game state, with spaces for three challenge cards, backpack items and water: this doubles as a handy reminder of the flow of each game day. There are tokens for the various resources that go in your backpack and for your water supply. There are also several card decks, not only the challenge cards that’ll outline the obstacles you must overcome each day, but also characters to play, items for them to use and so on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a scenario-based game, there are also additional cards and tokens applicable to particular scenarios. One thing to note is that, as a game based on a comic book series, all the components are furnished with excellent art from the original comics. While it might not be to everyone’s tastes, it does a fantastic job of bringing the game’s dangerous world to life, especially if you’re familiar with the source material.</p></div><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and how it plays">Rules and How It Plays</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250707-191631962-mp-1753126200486.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Understanding how the game is set up is, unusually, an integral part of understanding how it plays. First, your group chooses one of the two scenarios to play (plus a training mission), and one of the 10 map sheets included for that scenario, covering it with a blank sheet so you can’t see what’s on it. You slip this, cover and all, into the cardboard-sandwich board then cover all the holes with the sun tokens. Then you slip out the blank sheet. The result is a game map that you know nothing about, ripe for exploration and discovery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games"><u>cooperative game</u></a> where you’re working together to map the wilderness and survive. On your individual turn, you simply remove a sun token, revealing an icon underneath, and take a matching resource to add to your collective backpack. There’s no piece to mark where you are on the map. Instead, movement is abstracted away under the presumption that it’s easy to move through already explored territory. The next player just removes a sun token next to any already-revealed space, although there are some mountainous areas on each map that you can’t traverse.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250707-191556654-1753126158243.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploration, however, is far from a random walk in the park. Each scenario has a set of rules about where and how the various different icons are laid out. In the Fauna scenario, for example, there’s always one wood icon per row and column, and there will always be a water icon orthogonally adjacent to each wood. Each mud icon will be next to a water and a stone, while forts always form an L-shape series with a water and a skull. There are more rules – and icons – but you get the idea.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This allows you to make predictions and deductions about what you’re going to encounter on the map. Sometimes you can figure it out with complete certainty, but more often it’s a bit of a gamble, where you can narrow down the odds without being sure. Exploration is thus both a fun puzzle where you can aim for specific resources, and an exercise loaded with tension. The rules are complex enough to make it a good group discussion, ensuring there’s a dynamic sense of cooperation, and something you can master with practice. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The rules are complex enough to make it a good group discussion, ensuring there’s a dynamic sense of cooperation, and something you can master with practice.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each time you remove a sun token from the board you place it on one of three challenge cards dealt at the start of the game day. These cards have a resource requirement that you must spend in order to pass the challenge and a consequence for passing or failing, the latter of which usually means losing even more, different resources. You have to face these consequences once the card accumulates a certain number of suns, often only two or three. Considering many challenges require more than two or three resources to pass, this immediately puts your game under massive pressure to find the right icons on every turn.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250707-190121214-1753125922112.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you run out of water tokens, you die. If you end the day – timing out the three challenge cards for that die – without any food tokens, you die. Monsters generally don’t kill you outright but sap these precious, precious resource tokens until you die. Even when you’re on top of the resource-mapping system, most games will go down to the wire of you gaining your objective with a few measly drops of water left in your canteen. The last few turns ramp up the tension to crushing levels, until it almost feels like you’re struggling through a real wilderness, desperately following signs of water in the hope of surviving just one more day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As if this wasn’t enough, on top of surviving you also have a goal to complete. This depends on the scenario. In Fauna, for instance, you’ll meet those buffalo-headed minotaurs who’ll make it harder to traverse rows and columns until you find a fort, learn a recipe for killing one, and sacrifice the necessary resources, all of which you were probably hoping to save to pass a challenge card. These kinds of trade-offs are part of the game’s strategy: identifying times when failing a daily challenge can be a useful step in the wider goal of passing the winning objectives.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250628-145141636-1753125839302.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other aspects of your decision-making come down to the characters in play and the gear you choose at the outset, all of which offer you special abilities to piece together and increase your chance of survival. You can plan ahead with these since you pick them yourself, look for combos, and build a strategy around them. But there are also destiny cards, random helpful bonuses that you can sometimes replenish by achieving in-game goals, and for these you’ll have to roll with whatever fate gives you, adjusting your tactics accordingly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With practice and luck you will, eventually, manage to beat Fauna and, in time, the game’s second scenario, Flora, which involves a giant carnivorous plant. Corps of Discovery goes out of its way to make these scenarios replayable by offering such a huge range of map sheets – you can also download and print out more – that memorising the layouts is essentially impossible. Variety, however, cannot fully undermine human psychology: there’s an innate tendency to treat a mission as “done” once it’s been won. This is exacerbated by the game’s high difficulty level and lack of narrative detail. Although it does a great job of conjuring up the spectre of starving in the wilderness, the challenge cards feel pretty mechanical, so repeated tries at a scenario can feel a little same-y.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/pxl-20250707-191508329-1753126054718.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Matt Thrower - (Deluxe edition shown)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn’t quite the limiting factor it may sound like as it’ll take you repeated attempts to win both the scenarios, and there are expansions available which further the story and build considerably on the core mechanics – all four are included in the deluxe edition, which we used for the photos accompanying this review. But it still would have felt like a more complete experience if more of these elements had been included in the base game. As it stands, the game’s high toughness is the major motivation for a replay, and it’s almost enough by itself: winning against the odds, in a land where almost everything you encounter is out to kill you, is a hugely satisfying moment.</p><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aBgxA8?object_uuid=efb277a0-a370-437f-878b-a449b5653b6a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QP8e8O?object_uuid=efb277a0-a370-437f-878b-a449b5653b6a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Miniature Market</a></li></ul></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 23, 2025 5:36 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Corps of Discovery’s core concept of exploring and surviving in unknown, hostile terrain is a strong one, and it’s well executed with some novel mechanical ideas. Each play feels like a gruelling crawl across the wilderness, just as it should, and it feels very rewarding when you manage to eke out a win. As strong as this central pillar is, however, the core of the game lacks much in the way of support from narrative, player interaction, or variety, particularly given the sparse supply of different scenarios to play, so it might not return to your table as often as it should.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-corps-of-discovery-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

It costs 7 to Station and is a 5/5 in its own right (with Flying).</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Esika’s Chariot</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225657"><div id="225657" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Esika’s Chariot</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One for the cat lovers, <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxlZ4?object_uuid=75ca9cc3-68af-413b-8e65-01127207d870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Esika’s Chariot</u></a> is a four-cost 4/4 that requires 4 to Crew, but can create tokens when it arrives, and then copy additional tokens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tie it in with Doubling Season and your go-wide strategy can be, uh, wider than ever, creating four tokens when it enters, and then duplicating more when it attacks. More kitties, more chaos.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Entropic Battlecruiser</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225658"><div id="225658" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Entropic Battlecruiser</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh boy, where to start?

Potentially, but we reckon it’s worth it for those people who love to mess with their opponents’ hands.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Exploration Broodship</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225659"><div id="225659" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Exploration Broodship</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve been looking for a fresh Landfall Commander, this could be it.

It’s found in the World Shaper Commander Deck, if you’re picking that one up.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">RMS Titanic</h3></div><div catalogid="1ccbfd71-cd96-4da9-8e66-a7b565a1edaf" id="225660"><div id="225660" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering RMS Titanic</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As soon as the rules change was announced, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAKZj?object_uuid=75ca9cc3-68af-413b-8e65-01127207d870&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>RMS Titanic</u></a> from the Doctor Who set saw a lot of love, and it’s understandable for what could be a pretty fun (if not entirely functional) Commander.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a 7/1 with a relatively low crew cost, and only costs four mana to bring into play. It’ll also act as a Treasure token engine, has flying and trample.

The first lets you power up your creatures, making it easier to hit the second.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It could be particularly fun with the Tidus deck from the Final Fantasy set as you swap your counters around to get a flying, lifelink spaceship powered up in various ways.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What to Consider When Picking Your Commander</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As with any Commander, picking a Legendary Vehicle that works into your desired playstyle is important, but many of the vehicles available are colorless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since you can only pick cards within your Commander’s color identity for your deck, that means you’d be limited to colorless cards if you opted for one of those. That may suit you just fine, but it’s worth mentioning.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Magic: The Gathering’s Spacecraft explained</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Spacecraft make their debut in Edge of Eternities as a new Artifact Subtype. The idea is that your ship uses its ‘Station’ ability to pick up crew. Once you reach the required number of charge counters (calculated from the power of the cards you use to ‘Station’), your ship becomes an Artifact Creature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wurmwall Sweeper, for example, needs to be crewed by four or more, so using ‘Station’ to put a couple of 2/2s in there would work nicely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wizards puts it best in <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/edge-of-eternities-mechanics" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>its mechanics blog</u></a>: “If Wurmwall Sweeper has three charge counters on it, it's not a creature and it doesn't have flying. Once it gets its fourth charge counter, it becomes a 2/2 artifact creature with flying.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Magic: The Gathering's Edge of Eternities Set</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Ready to head to a whole new galaxy?

I think we increased production runs on it 4x pre-release. It was substantially by many, many very high double-digit percentages ahead of any other production run we’ve ever done, and we left the market wanting more.”</p><p>That might come as a surprise to fans who have struggled to find <em>MTG</em> booster packs and Commander decks for the <em>Final Fantasy</em> set, with stock selling out during advance pre-order periods and then being marked up over MSRP at some locations by the time it hit store shelves. But critics who sometimes claim that Wizards of the Coast artificially limits supply to drive hype and engagement should be happy to know that the company intends to keep selling new <em>Final Fantasy </em>stock for a while yet. </p><p>“Our expectation is there’s going to be a nice long tail of backlist for the product. Likewise, we’re still selling <em>Lord of the Rings</em> product today,” Cocks said. “So even though we hit $200 million in December of ‘22 for<em> Lord of the Rings</em>, we sold a substantial percentage of that in the several years following and we expect <em>Final Fantasy</em> to be no different. It’s partially what’s powering our backlist, which already in, like, five and a half months in the year did more than we’ve ever done in any year prior.” Hasbro chief financial officer Gina Goetter added, “We’re continuing to produce this set. We think the set itself is going to have a huge long tail.” </p><p>While the rarest and most expensive cards in the set were only available in Collector Boosters, the initial print run of which is basically all sold out, regular cards in the set will continue to become available and hopefully drive down prices on some of the more sought-after standard cards. One of those is Vivi Ornitier, a mythic Legendary Creature from<em> Final Fantasy IX</em>. It’s a powerful card that synergizes well with lots of mana-hungry, spell-based decks and has been hovering around $45 for weeks now. Other examples include Knights of the Round and Bahamut summons. Unlike with standard <em>MTG</em> sets, fan interest in the cards for their own sakes, combined with their limited availability, is currently fueling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/golden-chocobo-mtg-final-fantasy-price-foil-restock-1851784836&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/golden-chocobo-mtg-final-fantasy-price-foil-restock-1851784836">a particularly brutal reseller market for collectors</a></span>. </p><p>One upside is that those who just want to have fun playing with the cards can collect them much more cheaply in<em> Magic The Gathering Arena</em>, the video game adaptation for PC and mobile. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-4-d-d-mtg-arena-commander-g-i-joe-1851703869&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-4-d-d-mtg-arena-commander-g-i-joe-1851703869">It’s due for an update at some point in the future</a></span>, though Cocks also noted that the app only accounts for a small slice of the current fanbase. “Only 15-or-so percent of the player base plays on something like <em>Arena</em>,” he said. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-mtg-magic-gathering-vivi-stock-1851786817]]></content:encoded>

Monolith Soft’s flagship RPG series has consistently pushed the limits of Nintendo’s hardware, cramming massive and lush worlds into hardware that’s roughly a generation behind the home console competition. The results are typically impressive, if not a bit compromised. <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> in particular could suffer from some dips in image quality due to dynamic resolution scaling, and performance wouldn’t necessarily hold at 30 FPS either.</p><p>I’m not 100% sure these issues are <em>totally </em>smoothed over after watching <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> run on my Switch 2 with my naked eye, but they’re at least greatly minimized. Overall, the experience is just better on the new hardware. The resolution doesn’t appear to dip in the game’s usual trouble spots, and the frame rate didn’t take noticeable hits either. I do hope the <em>Xenoblade</em> series can get proper Switch 2 upgrades, as the game could clearly look way sharper if it wasn’t capped at such a low resolution (especially in handheld mode). That said, this series also contains over 500 hours of content if you intend to 100-percent each game, so I think it’s perfectly okay to get started on it now.</p><h2 id="h742063"><a id=""></a>4: <em>Super Mario RPG</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="dc84c8e9b71cb406f91abd0cdaa3cf44" data-recommend-id="image://dc84c8e9b71cb406f91abd0cdaa3cf44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Super Mario RPG for the Nintendo Switch.

That latter title benefits from the Switch 2 hardware too! If you’ve never tried these quirky adventures, you’re in for a treat whether you’re a casual gamer or a hardcore RPG nut.</p><h2 id="h742064"><a id=""></a>5: <em>Bayonetta 3</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="bdda8603fb00605e4e0d7511a7755052" data-recommend-id="image://bdda8603fb00605e4e0d7511a7755052" data-format="jpg" data-width="2550" data-height="1434" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A promotional screenshot of Bayonetta 3.

However, in a fast-paced action game like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bayonetta-3-review-ending-luka-jeanne-nintendo-switch-1849735230&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bayonetta-3-review-ending-luka-jeanne-nintendo-switch-1849735230"><em>Bayonetta 3</em></a></span>, you’ll <em>really </em>feel the difference that extra frames can offer. On the original Switch, <em>Bayonetta 3 </em>generally targeted 60 FPS but usually didn’t hit it. Instead, the game would hover in the 50 FPS range and could drop <em>way </em>lower during certain attack animations. It’s not unplayable by any means, but obviously there’s room for improvement.</p><p>Which is <em>exactly </em>what <em>Bayonetta 3</em> on the Switch 2 serves up. Not only do you get those smooth 60-FPS graphics (where it’s possible in the game), but the Switch 2 even fixes some audio desync bugs that could pop up in the original sometimes. Load times are way faster too. If we weren’t limiting this list to Switch-exclusive games, <em>Bayonetta 3</em> would still be one of the most improved games on Nintendo’s next generation hardware.</p><p>As was the case with <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>, it would still be nice for <em>Bayonetta 3</em> to get a proper Switch 2 upgrade. If nothing else, the visuals would pop if the resolution was raised, especially in handheld mode. But even if that never comes to pass, there’s no denying that <em>Bayonetta 3</em> is better than it’s ever been before.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-games-run-better-upgrade-bayonetta-hyrule-xeno-1851786809]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-details-including-october-release-date-leak-ahead-of-this-weeks-official-reveal.1251411/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Fresh Battlefield 6 details have emerged from a reliable leaker ahead of its big trailer reveal tomorrow, including word the latest instalment of EA's beleaguered shooter series is eyeing up an October release date and an €80 price tag on consoles.
</p>
<p>
That's according to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/battlefield-6-date-de-sortie-editions-prix-precommande-on-vous-devoile-toutes-nos-infos-inedites-60267">Dealabs' consistently reliable Billbil-kun</a>, whose sources claim Battlefield 6's previously rumoured 10th October release date is accurate, and that the game will launch for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S in both Standard and Phantom Edition forms - costing €79.99 and €109.99 respectively on consoles and €10 less on PC.
</p>
<p>
As to what the Phantom Edition actually <em>is</em>, it's supposedly a digital-only special edition featuring unspecified in-game content, which Standard Edition owners can upgrade to at any time via a €29.99 Phantom Pack. It's also claimed there'll be no early access with any version.
</p>
<p>
Battlefield 6 pre-orders will reportedly open next Thursday, 31st July, one week after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-is-finally-getting-a-reveal-trailer-tomorrow-heres-when-and-where-you-can-watch-it">game's grand trailer unveiling</a>, which is officially scheduled to take place tomorrow, 24th July, at 4PM BST/8AM PST. This, of course, should also be the point we find out if all of the above is true.
</p>
<p>
We already know some of what to expect, of course, thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode">various playtest leaks</a> and EA's early confirmation Battlefield 6 would feature a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">modern-day setting, classes, and more</a>. It's going to have to be a pretty special, however, if the publisher has any hope of reaching its<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-expects-battlefield-6-to-have-100-million-players-three-times-more-than-the-series-best-seller">reported 100m player target</a> across Battlefield 6's main game and a separate free-to-play battle royale - a particularly lofty goal after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-admits-battlefield-2042-flopped-but-would-have-been-less-than-10-percent-of-annual-revenue-anyway">disastrous Battlefield 2042</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sloclap-shoots-off-the-first-major-patch-for-rematch-includes-button-re-mapping-hit-detection-fixes-and-more.1251396/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">Rematch</a>, developer Sloclap's new football game, has just received its <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/patch-1-1-200-100">first major patch</a>, a little more than a month after it launched across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Earlier in the week, Sloclap celebrated Rematch <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-surpasses-5-million-players-since-launch-crossplay-support-still-6-9-weeks-away/">surpassing 5 million unique players</a> who've checked it out, either through buying the game directly or checking it out through Xbox Game Pass. Days prior to that, it published a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138720/view/534356176690741599?l=english">lengthy blog</a> where it acknowledged the feedback players have been giving the team in the last month, and committed to fixing some of the game's key problems, starting with a patch that was due out this week.</p>



<p>That patch is here, with one of the highlights being the fact that players can now re-map the controls on a controller, though Sloclap admits that this first version of button mapping is "<em>quite basic</em>," and that a more advanced version which lets players create combinations of inputs is coming.</p>



<p>Better hit detection is the second highlight of the patch that Sloclap hits, though if you talk to anyone (like me) who has been playing Rematch this past month, hit detection should be the first thing Sloclap mentions in every patch notes release, for as long as it remains an issue. Hit detection, whether that's regarding the ball not being properly handled by goalkeepers or with players not correctly responding to tackles, is the key issue plaguing every game in Rematch. </p>



<p>It's good to see that so many of the fixes in these patch notes are directly related to hit detection issues, and hopefully this patch is the beginning of a turn for the better for the quality of each match.</p>



<p>While this patch has a few key fixes, it still doesn't address one of the major features players have been asking for since the game launched, which is full crossplay support. And players will continue to wait for it until sometime in September, according to Sloclap.</p>

                <p>The popular soccer game Rematch has reached 5 million players, and now the game's newest patch has arrived, ushering in new features and changes--however, the promised cross-play feature remains missing.</p><p>Developer Sloclap said in a <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/patch-1-1-200-100" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> that the new Rematch patch "contains many changes in all domains, which should all improve the game in different ways." As for the promised cross-play feature and netcode improvements, Sloclap said these efforts require "the work of specialists in their domain."</p><p>"We can't put all our resources on these topics to make them happen faster," Sloclap said. However, the studio teased that it's making "very good progress" and will have more news to share soon.</p><p>New for Rematch in the update is a colorblind mode that caters to people with deuteranopia, protanopia, or tritanopia by offering a toggle for team colors. Additionally, the player-progression screen has been updated to improve readability. In terms of fixes, the ball indicator should no longer incorrectly follow the ball, while issues with the social panel screen have been addressed.</p><p>There is also a new gamepad-remapping feature in Rematch that is described as "quite basic" for now, but Sloclap said it wanted to start slow here before offering a "more advanced version soon." The new Rematch update also has an improved goal validation system for when the ball is caught on the line. "Decision-making now uses a delay to check for potential deflect/catch and account for network variation before validating the goal," Sloclap said.</p><p>You can see the full patch notes below.</p><p>Sloclap also announced that it's creating Test Servers for the purpose of testing future updates in "separate environments." Sloclap said it needs to spend more time on this before it's ready, however.</p><h2>Matches / Core Gameplay Improvements</h2><h2>Major Changes / Updates</h2><p>Gamepad Remapping</p><ul><li>This first version is quite basic (it doesn’t allow to create combinations of inputs), but we opted to allow players to start tinkering with mapping before offering a more advanced version soon.</li></ul><p>Better Hit Detection</p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the ball would be deflected instead of being caught by the goalkeeper in certain situations : the ball speed was not correctly evaluated to decide whether to catch or deflect.</li></ul><p>Note: some design to tweaks to catch vs. deflect parameters will also be coming soon.</p><ul><li>Improved goal validation when the ball is caught on the goal line : decision making now uses a delay to check for potential deflect/catch and account for network variation before validating the goal.</li><li>Other general netcode improvements and fixes.</li></ul><h2>Major Fixes</h2><ul><li>Multiple fixes to camera during goal replays, removing jitter</li><li>Fixes to "hindering" (physical contact between players): it should now be more efficient to “body block” opponents</li><li>Fixed end match screens skip function (at last!): scoreboard can now be analyzed without going back to ranking screen automatically</li><li>Fixed pause menu toggle in any stage of match: pause menu should be accessible at all times during matches</li><li>Fixed various crashes happening during post-goal sequence</li></ul><p>Multiple animation improvements and fixes</p><ul><li>New statics tap animations</li><li>Polish on volley shoots animations</li><li>Polish on Dive player animations</li><li>Polish on pushball animations</li><li>Minor animation improvements and fixes</li></ul><h2>Minor / Misc.

The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/autobattle-your-past-self-in-fool-king-a-promising-strategy-roguelite-in-which-dice-are-soldiers">Fool King</a> is dead, long live the Deckbuilder King. The Decking, if you will. Publishers Yogscast Games have announced that festive card-based roguelite The Royal Writ will launch on 7th August.</p>
<p>The Royal Writ seems pretty spesh, and yet, we have never covered it before, because we are blundering philistines. Sorry about that. In our defence, this is yet another cousin of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> on some level, and there's only so many of those I can process in one year before my thumbs and eyes swell up in protest. But based on a quick snort of the Steam demo, The Royal Writ stands apart thanks to 1) immensely jovial animated storybook visuals 2) an interesting set of card sacrifice mechanics. Here is a trailer.

<p>
The Royal Writ might look like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKYEKhxWy6o">the opening number for Disney's Robin Hood</a>, but it's actually rather grisly. Each lane-based battle is a sort of slaughterhouse line. As the king implied by the title, you place unit cards on the left who advance from turn to turn, column to column towards the enemy outpost on the right, dishing damage as they go. As regards the early battles, at least, columns nearer the enemy give your cards a boost. All fine and dandy, but if those cards actually reach the final column and make contact with the opposing fortifications, they'll be obliterated instantly and vanish from your hand forever. 
</p>
<p>
As such, you'll want to arrange cards so that you build a multiplier and overcome your adversary's health pool before your forces advance too far. Except. Except that sometimes letting your merry minions perforate themselves on the defences is beneficial. For example: there's an affluent Widow card who racks up a fat pile of cash as she advances along her lane. You'll be able to 'inherit' that coin if she dies. So maybe don't win too early, eh? I like the pervasive evilness of The Royal Writ, which elsewhere comes across in resourcing opportunities such as the ability to trade a soldier's teeth for upgrades. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3333700/The_Royal_Writ/">Find the Royal Writ demo on Steam</a>. The game is the work of Save Sloth Studios, who are also working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2876100/Sixth_Sun/">Sixth Sun</a> - an action game set in alternate 1500s Mexico, with similarly luxuriant visuals. Incidentally, if anybody knows of any other upcoming or new-ish games featuring kings (not 9 Kings or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-king-is-watching">The King Is Watching</a>, which we've covered already), please sing out in the comments. I've done three king-themed games today and I need a fourth to finish the poker hand or I won't be able to sleep tonight.
