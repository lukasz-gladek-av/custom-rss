			<p>Today, the Community Shaders team has released a new major update to the Skyrim graphics framework mod. Following the introduction of features like <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-true-pbr-with-community-shaders-1-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physically Based Rendering</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-dynamic-cloud-shadows-thanks-to-new-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skylighting, and dynamic cloud shadows</a>, Community Shaders version <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.2.0</a> adds support (through an add-on) for AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation, delivering a 60-70% performance uplift for most users. NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, which was implemented a couple of months ago, was also improved, although it remains an older version since the most recent ones do not support DirectX 11. Moreover, neither Multi Frame Generation nor Reflex are currently supported due to issues that NVIDIA should fix on their end. On the other hand, AMD Anti-Lag 2 should be supported.</p>
<p>According to the authors, the Frame Generation feature automatically optimizes Skyrim in a similar way to the extremely popular Display Tweaks mod. Therefore, Display Tweaks is not recommended to be used in conjunction, although it is still supported. The modders also note, as our readers already know very well, that frame Generation works best when your computer can already run the game at around 60 frames per second. The frame rate is then doubled to 120 frames per second, providing reliable frame pacing. Because of this, the feature only enables itself on 120Hz and higher displays, although it can still be forcefully activated from the Community Shaders panel.</p>
<p>The new Community Shaders release also brings several other improvements to Skyrim, such as a new grass shading model and improved grass collision, a parallax shading fix, mipmap LOD bias for TAA/FSR/DLAA to deliver sharper textures, the latest transformer model for DLAA, tweaks to screen space global illumination, brighter skylighting with improved shading, improved wetness effects, and various tonemapping tweaks. There will be several graphics showcases of CS 1.2.0 on YouTube in the next few days, no doubt.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">There could be an official Xbox-branded handheld out by the end of this year. A new report states that Microsoft is partnering with a PC gaming company, like ASUS or Lenovo, on the device, with a targeted launch in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027" rel="nofollow ">WindowsCentral</a>, the handheld is codenamed Keenan and will be similar in nature to the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lenovo-legion-go-s-windows-handheld-preorders-are-live-steamos-model-releases-in-may/1100-6528675/">Lenovo Legion Go S</a>--which will be the first device outside the Steam Deck family to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steamos-is-coming-to-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-starting-with-lenovos-new-unit/1100-6528686/">run on Valve's SteamOS</a>. So, the Xbox-branded handheld will likely run on Windows, featuring the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass. The report also states the system will likely sport an Xbox guide button and aesthetics that fit the Xbox ethos.</p><p dir="ltr">Interestingly enough, Microsoft Gaming CEO <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-device-is-a-few-years-out-apparently/1100-6527758/">Phil Spencer mentioned an Xbox handheld is a "few years out"</a> in November. (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-thinks-xbox-should-have-a-handheld/1100-6524107/">Spencer, for his part, has teased making an Xbox handheld</a> for a while now, too.) This longer-term plan lines up with the report of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-might-not-be-a-traditional-console-may-launch-in-2027-per-insider/1100-6529996/">the next Xbox launching in 2027</a>. Basically, Microsoft plans to kick off the next generation with a Xbox Series X successor accompanied by an internally developed handheld system.</p><p dir="ltr">However, unsurprisingly, it's noted that this schedule could shift as Microsoft works on the future of the Xbox brand. For instance, WindowsCentral points to the Xbox-licensed handheld scheduled for this year to serve as sort of a test drive for Microsoft. There is also no specific details on the partnering company, which could also be Razer or MSI.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot has contacted Microsoft seeking comment on this report.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-rumored-to-launch-in-2026-with-new-call-of-duty/1100-6528636/">a Call of Duty leaker claimed the next Xbox is planned for 2026</a>. One aspect that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-should-be-more-innovative-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529067/">Spencer has touched on is that the next Xbox hardware must be more innovative</a>.</p>

Mio, the angsty introvert of the duo, writes science fiction to cope with her difficult upbringing. Zoe, a bubbly fantasy writer, escapes into stories of dungeons and dragons to process her trauma. While playing Hazelight’s latest co-op adventure, I was curious how the action-platformer would spotlight both its leads’ fictions in its final levels, assuming it would no longer be alternating between the sci-fi and fantasy worlds. Would it take place in some kind of neutral world that wouldn’t show favor to either of its heroes? Could Hazelight maybe just hone in on one of their stories for simplicity’s sake? As it turns out, the studio didn’t take any of the easy options, and the result is an incredible display of the team’s technical skill and inventive game design.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196123" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond The Day Before | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="125" data-playlist="196123,196789,197298" data-current="196123"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond The Day Before | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21655.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Split Fiction</em>, Mio and Zoe have been trapped in a virtual reality that extracts ideas from authors’ brains, to be packaged and sold by a tech corporation called Rader Publishing. An accident occurs, and Mio and Zoe are stuck in a shared simulation, being thrown back and forth between sci-fi and fantasy stories, the pair working together to battle through each other’s imagination.</p><p>Beyond the occasional side quest, the simulation keeps a divide between both worlds, but as the pair tear down the facade from the inside it becomes more unstable, and they’re almost able to break free and go back to their real world. However, in a last-ditch effort to save his brain-scraping machine, Rader of Rader Publishing forcibly enters the simulation himself, destabilizing all that’s come before to introduce the final 30 minutes of the game.</p><figure id="" data-id="23f1a9871494a2b10b8d369d092c48d4" data-recommend-id="image://23f1a9871494a2b10b8d369d092c48d4" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A ship flies to the right side of the screen and is suddenly a dragon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A ship flies to the right side of the screen and is suddenly a dragon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Video Game News / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="23f1a9871494a2b10b8d369d092c48d4" data-recommend-id="image://23f1a9871494a2b10b8d369d092c48d4" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A ship flies to the right side of the screen and is suddenly a dragon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At first, it appears both players are, for the first time, existing in two separate worlds. Mio wakes up in her sci-fi story, while Zoe is thrown into her fantasy world. But after some brief platforming, the two find each other, yet each side of the game’s split screen depicts entirely different levels. Structurally, they are identical, but where Mio sees buildings and gaseous planets in the distance, Zoe sees a magical forest. <em>Split Fiction</em>’s co-op gameplay requires communication and coordination, but it was all while occupying the same space. Now, because the level is rendered as both sci-fi <em>and</em> fantasy, some objects are only interactive for one player, while the other has to find some way to help them from their “side.” For example, something that appears as just a pushable box to Mio might be a bouncy mushroom for Zoe, something she can use to jump high enough to reach an objective. Or perhaps some flora in the fantasy world could appear as a computer terminal in the sci-fi one. <em>Split Fiction</em> mostly delegates puzzle-solving and combat roles by giving its characters different tools. In the final level, that division of labor becomes inherent in the world design. Mio and Zoe are occupying the same space, but only one of them can see the way forward at a time. It leads to silly moments like when Zoe has to swim to reach an objective and Mio can’t see how she’s floating above what—to her—looks like a chasm. These two worlds are rendered simultaneously, with both characters moving through their respective worlds, affecting the other, all without once showing any signs of performance trouble. It’s a clever way to give sci-fi and fantasy equal weight in the final push, but it doesn’t stop at one impressive technical feat.</p><p>As the simulation continues to fall apart, <em>Split Fiction </em>starts playing with the boundaries of everything you thought you knew up to that point. Hazards appear in Mio’s sci-fi world that she has to avoid by moving to the right side of the screen where Zoe’s fantasy story takes up space, then suddenly there’s an onslaught of enemies, aircrafts, and obstacles blocking your progress that requires both players to rapidly move between both levels, as you watch both characters and the worlds around them seamlessly shift from one genre to the other.</p><figure id="" data-id="a179b5d27177045af7914086fb42462d" data-recommend-id="image://a179b5d27177045af7914086fb42462d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The split screen divide moves across the screen, showing more and less of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as it moves." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The split screen divide moves across the screen, showing more and less of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as it moves." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Video Game News / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a179b5d27177045af7914086fb42462d" data-recommend-id="image://a179b5d27177045af7914086fb42462d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The split screen divide moves across the screen, showing more and less of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as it moves." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>But it doesn’t end there</em>. After a brief boss fight with a kaiju version of Rader in the simulation’s home, Mio and Zoe are sent back to their respective worlds and all the rules you’ve been taught about how these intertwined worlds work go out the window. The splitscreen that was once just a dividing line to help both players navigate the world from their perspective becomes a chaotic obstacle you have to navigate. The bar in the middle of the screen rotates, pivots, and shifts in ways that constantly change the confines of both the sci-fi and fantasy worlds, exposing both players to different dangers and paths forward.</p><p>The split down the middle of your television becomes a weapon for your enemy to wield, depriving you of literal screen space where you can safely exist, moving the divide between both worlds to push you into the dangerous sides of your own creation. There’s a section where <em>Split Fiction</em>’s camera shifts to a top-down perspective, with the splitscreen spinning around like a carousel, exposing dangers from the fantasy world like piranhas, or science-fiction industrial grinders, and all you can do is frantically jump between worlds until Rader throws something else at you. It’s challenging and requires you to pull from your knowledge of every previous level to recognize hazards from one world and maneuver your way to safety in the other. <em>Split Fiction </em>manages to pull this off without a hitch, which is another incredible technical feat on top of being stunning gameplay.</p><figure id="" data-id="e033f0c43e674bf00ae0f43049c4b9e0" data-recommend-id="image://e033f0c43e674bf00ae0f43049c4b9e0" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A split screen spins like a carousel, exposing different parts of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as Mio and Zoe jump across them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A split screen spins like a carousel, exposing different parts of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as Mio and Zoe jump across them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Video Game News / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e033f0c43e674bf00ae0f43049c4b9e0" data-recommend-id="image://e033f0c43e674bf00ae0f43049c4b9e0" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A split screen spins like a carousel, exposing different parts of the sci-fi and fantasy worlds as Mio and Zoe jump across them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s something kinda poetic about an artless corpo having to wield Mio and Zoe’s created worlds to take them down because he’s incapable of imagining something of his own. The final boss fight, against Rader’s giant god form, is literally just him reaching into both of their stories and tossing whatever beast or machine he can in hopes that it might save his creation. <em>Split Fiction</em>’s final level is relentless, dragging both players between science and magic without a moment’s respite. Words don’t do it justice. Its visual splendor is mixed with clever and challenging game design, all tied in a tight thematic bow. It’s the kind of thing you can only experience to its fullest once, and I’m already miffed I’ll never get to experience the delight of playing it for the first time with my co-op partner, slackjawed and gobsmacked at how Hazelight pulled it off.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Last week AMD launched FSR 4 alongside its first RDNA 4-equipped desktop GPUs. It's a drastic improvement over previous versions of the tech suite, introducing AI-powered upscaling that is only possible thanks to dedicated hardware on the new cards. It's an advancement that Sony's Mark Cerny is saying will come to PS5, albeit not until 2026.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-mark-cerny-fsr-4-to-play-a-key-part-in-the-next-evolution-of-pssr-upscaling" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a>, Cerny was full of praise for AMD's FSR 4 release, saying that the upscaler surpasses the work Sony has done with its PS5 Pro-exclusive solution, PSSR. "And results are excellent, it's a more advanced approach that can exceed the crispness of PSSR," Cerny explained. "I'm very proud of the work of the joint team!"</p><p>Cerny says that FSR 4 will need to be backported to the PS5 Pro, essentially through a new version of PSSR that takes into account all the advancements AMD has made. Cerny says that for the most part the information the upscaler requires from a game will stay the same, which will make implementation by developers easier, but that it isn't as easy as supporting FSR 4 natively. This is due to the PS5 Pro having an entirely different architecture than RDNA 4, and thus not one that can support it fully like AMD's latest GPUs.</p><p>"RDNA 4 and the hardware in PS5 Pro are completely separate designs, which is why I speak in terms of 'reimplementation' on PS5 Pro when I talk about the new upscaling network used in FSR 4," Cerny continued. "I'm definitely looking forward to a future with co-developed hardware features for machine learning that will dramatically increase the interoperability."</p><p>FSR 4 doesn't have the same performance gains as its previous iteration, in part due to the additional overhead required for the vastly improved results. Cerny, however, believes the PS5 Pro can still support these image improvements despite the much weaker hardware in the PS5 Pro, without requiring major re-architecture. "That is what we are targeting, and we believe we can achieve it," Cerny added.</p><p>Sony and AMD continue to collaborate on Project Amethyst, with its first major milestone coming with the release of PSSR. Cerny believes there's a lot more to come by working closely with AMD, especially when it comes to machine learning and ray tracing enhancements for future console hardware. "All I can say is stay tuned! There’s a lot of opportunity with our Amethyst collaboration, and we know that ray tracing is a huge part of the graphics future," concluded Cerny.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/luffy-one-piece-lakers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is Monkey D. Luffy.&nbsp; He's 19 years old, neurodivergent as hell, and, I don’t know if you’ve heard, but he's gonna be king of the pirates. In <em>One Piece</em>’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-just-read-1-025-chapters-of-one-piece-and-its-a-damn-1847671952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,000+ ongoing manga</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-leading-into-one-pieces-historic-1-000th-epi-1848078095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">episodic anime odyssey</a>, I’ve seen him overcome insurmountable odds <a href="https://kotaku.com/hasan-piker-one-piece-socialist-twitch-youtube-politics-1850295738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liberating islands from fascist marines</a> and imperialist oligarchs, and stomp out anyone who dare deride folks who fed him whenever his ship graced their shores. Although his ethos isn't a cypher to unravel, his basketball in a recent <em>One Piece</em> and Los Angeles Lakers collaboration clip is. Allow me to put my hands on the proverbial SportsCenter desk and give my take on Luffy’s b-ball skills and why he wouldn’t be in the Straw Hats’ starting five.&nbsp;</p><p>On February 28,&nbsp; <em>One Piece</em> and the Los Angeles Lakers released “a first-of-its-kind collaboration” during a game against the Clippers. The highlight of the event was a special anime featurette where Luffy donned the Lakers’ purple and gold jersey and played basketball. The thirty-second clip was sick as hell and has amassed 594,000 viewers on YouTube all losing their minds over how surreal it is watching Luffy balling for the Lakers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="LOS ANGELES LAKERS x ONE PIECE Collab Anime" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VfKwPIbycbg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>But Luffy lacks fundamentals. Let's start with Luffy’s ball handling: Unsurprisingly, Luffy won the jump ball in his score-less handicap game against a group of nameless marines who’re auspiciously dressed in Dallas Mavericks jerseys. As we all know, Luffy ate the Gum-Gum fruit, allowing him to stretch his limbs to far greater reaches than Michael Jordan at the end of <em>Space Jam</em>, so having insane ups isn’t anything wild. What is wild is Luffy’s abysmal ball handling and security. Within moments of possessing the rock, it was swatted away with ease by a player flanking him at half court. Luffy doesn’t even make any movement toward the net before losing possession. That’s some embarrassing lack of full court awareness. What’s worse, the ball is about to go out of bounds within nine seconds of the game. Who let him cook?</p><p>Thankfully, Luffy locks the fuck in and puts his stringbean arms to use, clasping the ball with one hand, sliding through the Marine’s defense, laying up a shot off the glass, and dunking on his opps before cheesing at the courtside camera. Luffy’s dunk further emphasizes the aura from his score with a well-timed rafters sign hyping up the crowd, asking, “Who’s the king?” before he posterizes two marines. Although anime’s glorious king rose to the occasion, if this were a real basketball game, he wouldn’t be in the same area code of my Straw Hats starting five. I’d have kept him sat on the bench until the last quarter of the game to save the day like one of his battles.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, let’s talk about my starting five. For sports-averse readers, a starting five are players coaches put out on the court who display a high amplitude for scoring, an impenetrable defence, and seamless chemistry. If I were in charge of the Lakers x <em>One Piece</em> collab, I would've capitalized off the concept to further elevate the big-game feel of <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-demon-slayer-team-up-before-dodgers-cubs-play-tokyo-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anime melding with sports</a> beyond Luffy soloing an entire team. While the Straw Hats are short five players to constitute an NBA-regulated team, let’s pretend those rules don’t apply (given Luffy’s Gum-Gum powers were allowed) for the sake of building my <a href="https://kotaku.com/nba-playoffs-anime-ja-morant-chris-paul-basketball-1848900403" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fantasy anime basketball team</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Why draw the Straw Hats in Lakers jerseys and keep them on the bench?<span></span><a href="https://lakersnation.com/lakers-giving-out-shirts-posters-for-one-piece-night-against-clippers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">©Eiichiro Oda/ Shueisha ©Eiichiro Oda/Shueisha, Toei Animation ©Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc.</a></figcaption></figure><p>My team needs a point guard who can pop off with laser beam shots from half court like it's nothing. No other player would fit this role better than the Straw Hats’ resident sniper, Usopp. Usopp never misses his target in the heat of battle, so his scoring ability coupled with his court presence and leadership makes him (or that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhXNmMLdivk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper King</a> fellow) an ideal point guard to carry the game until we need to sub him out for Luffy.&nbsp;</p><p>As the senior officer of the Straw Hats crew with ample experience as a crew member on other ships and one of the seven warlords of the sea, Jinbe’s expertise and strategery overqualified him as my team’s shooting guard. What’s more, his <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Fish-Man_Karate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fish-man karate</a> would provide defensive versatility for our team on account of him moving enemies without touching them with blasts of air, and his <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Haki/Armament_Haki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">armament haki</a> would give him enough space and durability for his wide-ass frame to get open for open shots.&nbsp;</p><p>The next player on my starting five would be the devil child herself, Nico Robin. Having eaten the <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Hana_Hana_no_Mi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flower-Flower fruit</a>, a devil fruit that lets her sprout duplicates of her body on any surface within her range, Robin would be the center in my starting five. Her defensive presence would make for a wealth of scoring and rebound opportunities from virtually anywhere on the court, including off the enemy team’s body (which probably wouldn’t count as a foul).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And finally, my Straw Hat’s small and power forward would be Sanji and Zoro. Sanji’s whole deal as the Straw Hats’ versatile cook makes him perfect for adapting to whatever task spontaneously asked of him. What’s more, he’d be able to handle mid-range shots supporting our point guard or ball-handling all with his fucking feet. That’s sick as hell. As our power forward, Zoro would basically be asked to do the same tasks as Sanji, with the only difference being him being the most dependable player. Seeing as how he took <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAtZoIFW2Uw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the brunt of Luffy’s pain</a>, he’s the only man strong enough to fulfill the role. Although the two don’t get along as well as Draymond Green and Jordan Poole on a good day, when push comes to shove, the pair are the most in sync of the entire crew. As “<a href="https://gamerant.com/one-piece-zoro-sanji-wings-of-the-pirate-king/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the wing’s of the pirate king</a>,” Sanji and Zoro come in clutch with rebounding off each other’s offensive and defensive attacks without communicating with one another.&nbsp;</p><p>What of the rest of the crew? Well, I’d have Nami serve as the coach since her role as the navigator basically makes her the closest thing to being the crew’s real captain. Her cheerleading and chastising would not only keep Zoro and Sanji (mostly Sanji) from butting heads, she’d also suss out the pattern of the enemy team’s plays and chart us towards victory. Chopper would be doctoring, naturally, with the option to sub in for Jinbe should he exhaust his armament haki in the first quarter of the game and need a breather. Hopefully his <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Rumble_Ball" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumble balls</a> won’t count as juicing up. Franky would also serve as a replacement for Robin or Sanji should they blow up in the first half of the game. Brook….can be our team’s Drake and cheer for us on the sidelines by singing or something. This isn’t because I don’t like the skeletal bard, I just think it’d be harder to justify his soul-swapping ghost ability on the enemy team as fair in this already ludacris rule breaking anime basketball game.&nbsp;</p><p>While Luffy is nice enough alone on the court, basketball is a team-based sport, so it’s weird the collab had him playing like LeBron James in the paint without his nakama by his side. If my Stephen A. Smith-esque analysis of Luffy’s skills and fantasy booking are anything to go on, the Straw Hats are a far cry from being as bad as the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-cant-do-it-all-alone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017-era Cleveland Cavaliers</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-monster-hunter-wilds-streamlined"><h3>The New Monster Hunter Is The Most Streamlined Yet, But That’s Not Such A Bad Thing</h3></a><p>"I’ve played so many Monster Hunter games, and I don’t have time for the bullshit involved in Monster Hunter games"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/fiio-ft1-review-sennheiser-hd6xx-best-midfi-headphone-canjam"><h3>I Went To A Fancy Headphone Convention And Fell In Love With The Basics</h3></a><p>The classic Sennheiser HD 6XX and the new Fiio FT1 are the budget kings of headphones, beloved by many.

			<p>Today, ZeniMax Online Studios announced the release of a new premium DLC and free update for the PC/Mac version of the MMORPG The Elder Scrolls Online (consoles will have to wait a couple of weeks as usual).</p>
<p>The premium DLC is called Fallen Banners and introduces two new dungeons to the game: Lep Seclusa and Exiled Redoubt. In Lep Seclusa, the Moth Priests who inhabit the location are under siege, and the cunning Orpheon the Tactician is determined to seize the power of the Elder Scroll they guard. The Elder Scrolls Online players must help Sister Chana defend the sanctuary from an army of deserters, protect its people and secrets, and confront Orpheon before he can use the scroll's power to change the face of Cyrodiil forever.</p>
<p>In Exiled Redoubt, soldiers of the Alliance War (regardless of their faction) are disappearing, and all traces lead to the namesake Imperial fortress. In this case, players will team up with Battlemage Lucilla to infiltrate this mysterious stronghold and put an end to the plans of a once noble Imperial House before the chaos spreads beyond its stone walls and across Tamriel.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Players who succeed in emerging victorious Lep Seclusa and the Exile Redoubt will also have the chance to loot and unlock a host of special rewards, including new collectibles, item sets, and Achievements. These include the Tactician's Gold Grate Skin, which can be earned by completing both dungeons on Veteran difficulty.</p>
<p>Fallen Banners is currently available to active ESO Plus subscribers. However, there's also a free update, the game's 45th. ZeniMax Online Studios has introduced a visual overhaul to the Starter Zones (Bleakrock Isle, Bal Foyen, Stros M'kai, Betnikh, and Khenarthi's Roost), including improved lighting, improved ground and water textures, updated structures, and the addition of more clutter or props.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Update 45 adds much more, though, between various balance changes, the first stages of console add-on support (which is scheduled to go live in its entirety later this year), and new player response options when talking to story NPCs, in an effort to improve the roleplaying factor in dialogue. For the full patch notes, head over <a href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/674341/pc-mac-patch-notes-v10-3-5-update-45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, earlier this year, ZeniMax <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-switch-from-yearly-chapters-to-seasonal-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that The Elder Scrolls Online would switch from yearly Chapters to seasonal content. The studio has already scheduled an ESO Direct for April 10 where more information about what's coming this year will be unveiled.</p>

Piggybacking off similar efforts in other gacha games like <em>Genshin Impact</em>, the developers at Infold Games have created an interactive map that’ll guide you to all the bits and bobs littered throughout the game’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/14/24320757/infinity-nikki-review-gacha-dress-up-game">impressively expansive world</a>.</p><p>Because <em>Infinity Nikki</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/605811/infinity-nikki-gacha-mechanics">is a gacha game</a>, there are fifty ‘leven different kinds of <em>things</em> to collect and trade for resources, currencies, and clothes. You can map some of the collectibles in <em>Infinity Nikki </em>to the ones in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and it works out pretty well. Some of them are easier to find than others. The whimstars are like spirit orbs you earn from shrines and they’re pretty easy to find as the game has a built-in system to help you locate them. The dews of inspiration are like korok seeds; there’s ten and a half million of them and your best chance of finding them is through sheer luck and determination – i.e. impossible. </p><p>It kinda sucks that they’re so hard to find because dews can be exchanged for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619372/infinity-nikki-eerie-season-event-march-2025">really cool outfits</a> that can help out if you’re stuck in one of the styling boss battles. The <em>Infinity Nikki</em> community has clamored for the developers to put a tracking system for them in the game similar to the way your bi-pedal cat companion Momo can guide you to nearby whimstars. The developers have fulfilled other community wishes like expanding the number of outfit slots from four to seven (thanks!) and now they’ve answered this ask in a big way.</p><p>Visiting <a href="https://pearpal.infoldgames.com/en/home">this site</a> will grant access to an interactive map whereby you can finally locate all those damnable dews of inspiration. If you use your <em>Infinity Nikki</em> log in information, the map will be personalized to show what items you’ve picked up and what you’re still missing. Best yet, this map can be used for literally everything – missing treasure chests, secret clothing vendors, hidden caves, and more. It’s not as convenient as an in-game map would be but it updates in real time to make checking things off your list a little easier.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A bunch of playtester footage for the next, modern-day-set Battlefield game has slipped past EA's non-disclosure agreements and erupted all over social media. The footage stems from the company's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-crumbling-warzones-are-teased-in-a-promo-vid-calling-for-playtesters">Battlefield Labs community testing program</a>, and consists of multiple consecutive minutes of burly shootyfolks running down alleyways through showers of grit, firing very briefly at enemy troopers, and getting themselves bullet-bonked back to the lobby screen. 
</p>
<p>
EA had been taking the videos down, but have seemingly now decided to let them roll. It's the kind of tactical withdrawal in the face of overwhelming numbers that seldom occurs to me when I play Battlefield, because I always play Battlefield in the character of a movie extra. I am here to cultivate the ambience for other players by prancing around yodelling "INCOMING", not contribute to our victory.
</p><!--more-->
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
From the footage, we glean a few bits of information about the new game, which has yet to be formally revealed (or titled). In good news for people who hated Battlefield's specialist system, it looks like the old Assault, Engineer, Recon, and Medic classes are back. So are those picture-in-picture spawn select views that once allowed you to watch your squadmate running directly towards an enemy tank, then decide to spawn on them anyway. 
</p>
<p>
There are new squad animations for victory screens, which seem well-placed to help with sales of cosmetics. There's also the ability to drag downed team mates to cover rather than trying to defib them in a raging crossfire (see also: how I like to play Battlefield). And there are glimpses of the new destruction systems, with whole buildings falling over at the behest of rocket-propelled grenades.</p>
<p>If I have one request for nu-Battlefield, it's destruction physics of sufficient granularity and improbability that I can engineer really silly terrain traps. The tech has surely caught up with the blue sky thinking by now. I want to whittle buildings down to a single load-bearing doorway, then open it with a sniper bullet and drop the whole skyscraper on somebody's head. Less Spielbergian gravitas, more Looney Tunes, please!
</p>
<p>
The new Battlefield is the work of series creators DICE and long-haul Battlefield support studio Ripple Effect, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-have-delayed-need-for-speed-so-criterion-can-support-battlefield-6">together with Need For Speed outfit Criterion</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a> rebooters EA Motive. Ridgeline Games were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefields-next-campaign-being-developed-by-halo-co-creators-new-studio">working on the campaign at one point</a>, but EA <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">closed them down</a>.

You can see a rusty, cobbled-together sign that says “Welcome to the strip.” This is the nicer area of New Vegas in the video games, and getting in isn’t cheap. </p><p>Of course, it’s hard to discern much more from these shaky videos and leaks and we don’t know precisely how New Vegas will be featured in <em>Fallout’s </em>next season. But regardless, I’m excited to see such an iconic and famous piece of <em>Fallout </em>turned into real sets. <em>Fallout’s </em>dedication to real, hand-built sets and not just relying on CG backgrounds is something I really appreciated about season one, and it seems we’ll be getting more of that in season 2 when it arrives at some yet-to-be-announced date in the future. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We see Ellie, played by Bella Ramsey, view an infected whose breath releases the spores.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">You can’t stop this.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheLastOfUs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#TheLastOfUs</a> returns April 13 on Max. <a href="https://t.co/DH8UzAugIV" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/DH8UzAugIV</a></p>— Max (@StreamOnMax) <a href="https://twitter.com/StreamOnMax/status/1898500551521825174?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 8, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for The Last of Us Season 1 follow.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the video games, the cordyceps infection spreads via spores, which forces the characters to wear a gas mask at points.

While this works on The Mandalorian thanks to his cool helmet, a lot of the tension would be lost in The Last of Us, and tendrils are also way more menacing, visually speaking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s disturbing and it’s violative. I think it’s very primal in the way it invades your own body,” Mazin said in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/last-of-us-clickers-flour-theory-game-changes-explained-1235495180/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Variety</u></a> about the decision to swap spores for tendrils, particularly in the final scene where Tess receives what can only be described as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-most-devastating-tv-deaths-of-all-time"><u>world’s worst goodbye kiss</u></a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/10/infected-1741624851517.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The latest The Last of Us Season 2 trailer confirms the return of spores.

And then one shot you see in this trailer, there are things in the air."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mazin later confirmed "spores are back," before Druckmann added: "The reason [we’re doing it now], I mean, we really wanted to figure it out, and again, everything has to be drama.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>'s "spring" arrival on PS5 has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">been known for a good few months now</a>, but with the season of daffodils and egg box art now almost upon us, we might finally have a specific release date to chew on. According to ultra-reliable leaker Billbil-kun, The Great Circle comes to Sony's consoles on 17th April, with pre-orders set to open soon.
</p>
<p>
Writing on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-les-dates-de-sortie-de-indiana-jones-et-le-cercle-ancien-sur-ps5-60055">Deallabs</a>, Billbil-kun (who has an excellent track record with PlayStation leaks) claimed their "recent investigations" had revealed the Standard edition of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will launch for PS5 on 17th April. However, Microsoft is reportedly also releasing a Premium version - just as it did on Xbox and PC - granting two days early access, from 15th April. Billbil-kun says they were unable to confirm if a PS5 Collector's Edition is in the works.
</p>
<p>
Billbil-kun claims The Great Circle's Standard and Premium editions will both be available as a physical release, with prices reportedly matching their Xbox equivalents. That means £69.99 / €79.99 / $69.99 USD for the Standard edition on PS5 and £99.99 / €109.99 / $99.99 for the Premium release. Pre-orders for both versions expected to go live on 25th March in Europe.

<p>
"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones," Eurogamer's Katharine Castle <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">wrote in her five star review of The Great Circle</a> last year, "[this] is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames." And if you're somehow still on the fence after all the praise its received since its release, perhaps you might like to know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-eurogamers-game-of-2024">we loved The Great Circle enough that it was named Eurogamer's Game of the Year in 2024.</a>
</p>
<p>
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's PlayStation 5 release follows Microsoft's decision last year to bring select first-party Xbox releases to other platforms. And after a tentative first 12 months - which saw <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, Grounded, Pentiment, and Hi-fi Rush make the jump to either PS5 or Switch - 2025 looks to be a busy one. Microsoft has already confirmed the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-age-of-mythology-and-age-of-empires-2-remasters-heading-to-ps5-this-year">Age of Empires 2</a>, Age of Mythology Retold, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-forza-horizon-5-officially-heading-to-playstation-5-this-spring">Forza Horizon 5</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2 are heading to PS5 - with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Halo">Halo and Flight Simulator 2024 reportedly also on the way</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft's Xbox next-generation plans include a premium successor to the Xbox Series X and a handheld that will reportedly launch in 2027.</p>
<p>In a new report shared today on <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027">WindowsCentral</a>, it has been revealed that the internal successor to the Series X|S platform has been fully greenlit. As of now, Xbox next generation hardware plans include a premium successor to the Xbox Series X console that will launch in 2027, alongside a gaming handheld and multiple new controller options which will have direct-to-cloud connectivity and allow users to switch them between different devices. As previously rumored, next-generation consoles will be closer to PCs than ever before and will make it much easier for developers to port games from PC. Backward compatibility will also be available.</p>
<p>While the handheld system that will be part of Xbox next generation plans is still two years away from release, we will get a first taste of a portable experience later this year with an Xbox-branded handheld codenamed Keenan that is in the works with a PC gaming OEM. This handheld, according to WindowsCentral's report, will look markedly Xbox with the typical guide button and design sensibilities, and will likely run full Windows with the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass as one of its main focuses.</p>
<p>Ever since Microsoft started releasing their former exclusives to other consoles, many have wondered if there are real Xbox next-generation plans. Judging from this report, it definitely looks like the company is not going to leave the hardware market anytime soon. If the new systems will indeed launch in 2027, it won't take long to see how they will deliver the largest technical leap <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/">teased</a> a while back.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/626952/sony-fsr-4-upscaler-coming-to-ps5-pro-reimplementation</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/626952/sony-fsr-4-upscaler-coming-to-ps5-pro-reimplementation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">the $700 PlayStation 5 Pro</a> can already produce crisper, sharper, smoother, and more stable graphics than a PS5, if you sit close enough to appreciate them. But starting in 2026, the company hopes to imbue games with a new AI upscaling formula that’ll make them even crisper, based on the AMD FSR 4 technique that’s now shipping with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/624423/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review-benchmarks-price">AMD’s new RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards</a> and appears to be competitive against Nvidia’s latest DLSS as well.</p><p>“Our target is to have something very similar to FSR 4’s upscaler available on PS5 Pro for 2026 titles as the next evolution of PSSR,” PlayStation lead architect Mark Cerny <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-mark-cerny-fsr-4-to-play-a-key-part-in-the-next-evolution-of-pssr-upscaling">tells <em>Digital Foundry</em></a>.</p><p>Many new PS5 Pro games already use an AI upscaler called “PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution” (PSSR) on their AMD-based chips. PSSR can turn 720p images into 4K ones on the fly while adding extra particle effects, and we’ve been relatively impressed by its quality compared to, say, FSR 3.</p><p>But Sony and AMD’s relationship didn’t stop there — it turns out that the neural network that underpins AMD’s new FSR 4 upscaler was part of a collaboration with Sony, too, and Sony now plans to backport some of that work to its flagship PlayStation.</p><p>In December, Sony and AMD announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324317/amd-playstation-ai-work-better-graphics-project-amethyst">a multiyear collaboration called Project Amethyst</a>, one that we’re now learning actually began back in 2023, and Cerny tells <em>Digital Foundry</em> that FSR 4 was the first fruit of those labors. “The neural network (and training recipe) in FSR 4’s upscaler are the first results of the Amethyst collaboration,” he says, calling it “a more advanced approach that can exceed the crispness of PSSR.”</p><p>For now, though, Cerny says it’s still encouraging developers to use PSSR, as it will take time to “reimplement” FSR 4’s upscaling network into the PS5 Pro and its games.</p><p>Cerny suggests that Sony will have “its own implementations” of each algorithm it develops with AMD from here on out. He also hints Project Amethyst may be about more than home consoles, though: “Now to be clear, this technology has uses beyond PlayStation, and it’s about supporting broad work in machine learning across a variety of devices – the biggest win is when developers can freely move their code from device to device,” he tells <em>Digital Foundry.</em></p><p>You can watch <em>Digital Foundry</em>’s comparison of FSR 4, and its deep dive on PSSR, below.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Use it every time it’s available during combat to make life easier for your healers (and yourself).</p><p><strong>Mag-Cannon</strong> (LB) - After charging up the rings on his back, Mag-Cannon unleashes them in a targeted attack, dealing more damage the more rings there are. The fully-powered version knocks enemies back several yards as well. Great for picking off enemies with low health, particularly Strategist characters and Dualists.</p><p><strong>Magnetic Descent</strong> (Passive) - Hold the jump button to float down instead of falling.</p><p><strong>Metallic Fusion</strong> (Team-Up Ability: Y / Triangle) - Teaming up with his daughter, the Scarlet Witch, Magneto gains the ability to power his Iron Volley with a massive sword, dealing more damage.</p><h2 id="h2416653"><a id=""></a><strong>How Should I Play Magneto?</strong></h2><p>Magneto is a solid, all-around tank who moves slowly and more deliberately, but who also has several special moves that help him protect himself and his allies, as well as prepare to deal small bursts of damage afterwards. He is a fantastic choice for a Vanguard character, rewarding those who put in the time to truly master his skills.</p><figure id="" data-id="1abe9f598a0e3526884d13ce9a9e7f19" data-recommend-id="image://1abe9f598a0e3526884d13ce9a9e7f19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto using his shield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magneto using his shield." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NetEase / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1abe9f598a0e3526884d13ce9a9e7f19" data-recommend-id="image://1abe9f598a0e3526884d13ce9a9e7f19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto using his shield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Three chevrons near the middle of the screen represent the rings on Magneto’s back, so keep an eye on them.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/a-tier-two-cs2-team-has-already-played-100-maps-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Counter-Strike 2 competitive scene is known for its dauntingly stacked calendar, but one team is racking up official maps played at a breakneck pace. Unsurprisingly, it’s a tier two team that has to play a marathon of matches just to qualify for events like the illustrious Majors.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tier-two-bc-game-could-break-the-cs2-record-for-most-official-maps-played-in-a-year">Tier Two BC.Game Could Break the CS2 Record for Most Official Maps Played in a Year</h2>



<p>It’s not even halfway through March, and the European veteran roster playing for BC.Game has already <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/teams/12878/bcgame?startDate=2025-01-01&amp;endDate=2025-12-31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">played 107 official maps</a> of professional Counter-Strike in 2025. BC.Game, a crypto casino website, entered CS2 in the summer of 2024. In the second half of that year, the team played 94 maps, but they have already beaten that number this year in less than half the time.</p>



<p>107 official maps played so far averages out to more than 1.55 maps per day. While that doesn’t sound like a lot to a casual player, that’s only taking into account official matches as part of a tournament or qualifier. It doesn’t include the hours spent practicing, scrimming, or traveling. In 2024, the team that played the most official maps was Polish team Permitta, who played 467. But at their current rate, BC.Game could pass 500 official maps played before the end of the year.</p>



<p>Tier two teams like BC.Game are burdened with having to play far more maps of Counter-Strike than the higher ranked tier one teams. In comparison, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reigning Major champions Team Spirit</a> have only played 35 maps so far this year, less than a third of the total that BC.Game has accrued. Tier two teams such as BC.Game consistently have to play through open qualifiers to reach prestigious CS2 events, as they don’t have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-vrs-in-cs2-valve-regional-standings-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Valve-determined ranking</a> to receive a direct invite to playoffs or later stages of certain events. Even Fnatic, who once dominated Counter-Strike a decade ago, had to play <a href="https://www.hltv.org/team/4991/fnatic#tab-matchesBox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seven best-of-three series</a> across the past two days.</p>



<p>Will BC.Game, or any CS2 team, reach 500 official maps played in 2025? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The next-generation Xbox console is two years away from release. According to a new report from Windows Central’s Jez Corden, Microsoft is currently targeting 2027 for release of its next mainline Xbox consoles.</p>



<p>Per <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the report</a>, the new systems are in full production at Microsoft. </p>



<p>“[Our] sources also indicate that Microsoft’s internal successor to the Xbox Series X|S platform has been fully greenlit all the way up to CEO Satya Nadella,” Corden writes.</p>



<p>He adds that it’s believed that the current plans for the next generation of Xbox include a “premium successor” to the Xbox Series X along with its own in-house developed handheld console. There are also plans for “several” new controllers.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Future Of Call of Duty—Insider Gaming Weekly</a></h6>



<p>Corden’s report also follows up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-not-a-console-at-all-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his earlier claims</a> that new Xbox consoles will be “closer to Windows than ever before”.  The new systems will also still support backwards compatibility to allow older games to be played.</p>



<p>In addition to the new consoles, Microsoft is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-launching-partner-gaming-handheld-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly planning to launch</a> an Xbox-partnered handheld gaming system later in 2025.</p>



<p>None of these plans have been officially announced by Microsoft. Until that happens—and even after they become public—, understand that targets can always change. Insider Gaming has reached out to Xbox for comment on the claims. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>Xbox is finally getting into the gaming handheld space. According to a new report from Jez Corden of Windows Central, Microsoft is working to launch an Xbox-branded handheld later in 2025.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report states</a> that it won’t be a Microsoft produced device. Instead, the company is working with a partner OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer).</p>



<p>The device, under the codename “Keenan”, “will look unmistakably Xbox”, the report says. The device will even feature an Xbox Guide button that is featured on Xbox controllers.</p>



<p>Not much was given regarding features. However, there was speculation from the report.</p>



<p>“Given that this is a partner device, similar to&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lenovo-legion-go-s-is-the-first-third-party-steamos-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lenovo’s SteamOS partnership with Valve</a>, I expect this handheld to be more PC-oriented,” Corden says. “It’ll most likely run full Windows, putting the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass front and center, alongside the ability to install things like Steam.”</p>



<p>In addition to the plans for an Xbox-themed handheld this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-gen-xbox-console-release-planned-for-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft is targeting 2027</a> for its next-gen console.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Xbox for comment on the claims. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 8 will be all about taking on the game's endgame bosses and channeling their powers, Blizzard revealed, along the way confirming the return of one of the franchise's biggest bosses ever.</p><p dir="ltr">As part of a recent Campfire Chat livestream, Blizzard discussed what players can expect from Season 8. Alongside a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-will-get-harder-next-season-with-both-a-difficulty-increase-and-xp-gain-decrease/1100-6530009/" data-ref-id="1100-6530009">slower pace, difficulty changes</a>, and class balance updates, the theme of Season 8 will revolve around a revamped endgame boss system that will make channeling them more straightforward and rewarding.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgzOVLtAWLI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kgzOVLtAWLI?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Three new endgame bosses in total will be added as part of Season 8: Urivar and the Harbinger of Hatred from Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred campaign, and a third that will be familiar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3</a> players. That boss is none other than Belial, the Lord of Lies, who will serve as the game's new pinnacle boss. Players may remember him from his multi-phase Act-2 battle in Diablo 3, the final phase of which his massive form took up the majority of the screen.</p><p dir="ltr">"Belial is back in Sanctuary," Diablo 4 lead season designer Deric Nuñez said during the livestream. "He is climbing his way to the top of the lair boss ladder. He is the new exalted, pinnacle challenge within the ladder. He is the highest challenge, the highest reward."</p><p dir="ltr">Defeating the endgame bosses during Season 8 will unlock that boss' powers for players to use. There will be a total of 24 boss powers to collect and experiment with as part of Season 8, Blizzard said. There will additionally be a new boss-rush style open world event, Apparition Incursions, that players can take part in as part of the Season. Defeating and looting any endgame boss will have a small chance to initiate an ambush by Belial (in his smaller, less screen-covering form). If players can then take out Belial too, the loot rewards will double.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is really cool, because it's like a two-for-the-price-of-one payout," Nuñez said.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside the new bosses and the ability to channel some of their iconic powers, Blizzard is vastly simplifying the boss summoning process. Currently, players collect a number of different items required to summon different bosses, resulting in inventory clutter and a constant state of having some items needed to summon a boss but not the others.</p><p dir="ltr">Come Season 8, that system will be done away with and replaced by a much simpler Lair Key system. Each endgame boss will require their own Lair Key, but those keys are only used to unlock their hoard of loot upon being defeated. Players will actually be able to challenge the endgame bosses at any time in order to see how their character stacks up and to practice and learn each bosses mechanics, without the risk of losing precious boss summoning materials as is currently the case.</p><p dir="ltr">The public test realm for Diablo 4 Season 8 will start on March 11. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-8-delayed-but-will-feature-return-of-an-old-friend/1100-6529803/" data-ref-id="1100-6529803">Season 8 proper, meanwhile, was recently delayed</a> and is expected to arrive April 29.</p>

            <p>When the second season of The Last of Us airs this April, viewers will be introduced to the character of Abby.</p>
<p>Those who know the games will be aware of the conversation around this character, with some already expressing concern about the toxicity actress Kaitlyn Dever will likely receive through proxy of playing Abby. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/abby-actress-kaitlyn-dever-protected-by-extra-security-while-filming-the-last-of-us-season-two">Dever required extra security on set because of the role</a>.</p>
<p>But, while Dever has admitted it's "hard not to see those things on the internet", she has worked to "do this character justice" in The Last of Us' second season.</p>

<p>When asked by <a href="https://screenrant.com/last-us-season-2-abby-backlash-kaitlyn-dever-response/">ScreenRant</a> if she pays attention to how people anticipate a character such as The Last of Us Part 2's Abby, Dever replied:</p>
<p>"Well, it's hard not to see those things on the internet. It's hard not to stop myself from looking at it every once in a while, especially going into this, for sure. And I want to do this character justice and make the fans proud by bringing her to life in this kind of way."</p>
<p>Dever added her "main focus was just the collaboration between Neil [Druckmann] and Craig [Mazin], and making sure I was really getting to the core of who she is and what drives her and her emotional state; her anger and her frustration and her grief and all of that," before closing: </p>
<p>"I wanted to make sure that that was what I was focusing most of my energy on."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-will-be-used-in-ps5-pro-games-next-year-reveals-sonys-mark-cerny/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-confirmed-to-have-been-co-developed-with-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmation</a> that AMD FSR 4 had been co-developed with Sony as part of the wider machine learning Project Amethyst collaboration, PlayStation 5 Pro System Architect Mark Cerny revealed today <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-mark-cerny-fsr-4-to-play-a-key-part-in-the-next-evolution-of-pssr-upscaling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an interview with Digital Foundry</a> that AMD's latest upscaling technology will be introduced to the most powerful console currently on the market in 2026.</p>
<p>This year, Sony plans to focus on helping developers implement the current version of PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR), but they are already working on the future implementation of AMD FSR 4, or rather, its equivalent tailored for the PS5 Pro console:</p>
<p><em>Our target is to have something very similar to FSR 4's upscaler available on PS5 Pro for 2026 titles as the next evolution of PSSR; it should take the same inputs and produce essentially the same outputs. Doing that implementation is rather ambitious and time consuming, which is why you haven't already seen this new upscaler on PS5 Pro.</em></p>
<p><em>RDNA 4 and the hardware in PS5 Pro are completely separate designs, which is why I speak in terms of 'reimplementation' on PS5 Pro when I talk about the new upscaling network used in AMD FSR 4. I’m definitely looking forward to a future with co-developed hardware features for machine learning that will dramatically increase the interoperability.</em></p>
<p>When questioned about whether the console could handle the increased computational cost of AMD FSR 4, Cerny expressed confidence that the PS5 Pro's 300 8-bit TOPS would make it work. Later in the Q&amp;A, the programmer and game designer returned to discuss both short-term and long-term objectives that are part of Project Amethyst (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-lead-architect-mark-cerny-unveils-codename-amethyst-ml-collaboration-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed a few months ago</a>):</p>
<p><em>The shorter-term goal is to co-develop neural network architectures and training strategies for game graphics. The longer-term goal is to work together to create a more ideal hardware architecture for machine learning, something capable of processing the neural networks needed for game graphics at high speed. PS5 Pro was a wonderful learning experience for us here at SIE, and of course, AMD has an incredible amount of knowledge from its multi-generation RDNA roadmap. Again, it just makes sense to combine those expertises. [...] AMD FSR 4 and this next evolution of PSSR are a paradigm for our future. Going forward, we expect to have our own implementations of each of the algorithms developed through the collaboration.</em></p>
<p>Closing up, he added there might be quite a few tweaks because technical targets for console and PC games are quite different. For example, 60FPS is still believed to be the golden standard for consoles, while PC games aim much higher nowadays.</p>
<p>With FSR 4, AMD definitely <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-better-fsr3-dlss-cnn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed the gap with NVIDIA</a>, although the latest DLSS 4 transformer model and the GeForce RTX 50's Multi Frame Generation keep the Green Team ahead. Still, NVIDIA will have to continue investing in advancements, something that users should be thankful for.</p>
