<p>Black Myth: Wukong took the gaming space by storm and, honestly, much of the world. It’s one of the most successful video games to hail from China and does an exceptional job of unveiling Chinese mythology to the masses. Despite many claiming it’s not a Soulslike, it absolutely is a Soulslike. I’ll die on this hill. So, does Black Myth: Wukong have difficulty settings? Can you make the game easier or more challenging if you’d like?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-raise-or-lower-the-difficulty-in-black-myth-wukong">Can You Raise or Lower the Difficulty in Black Myth: Wukong?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, there is no difficulty settings option in Black Myth: Wukong. The game doesn’t follow the traditional Easy, Medium, or Hard scale of game difficulty but utilizes its own internal difficulty settings to challenge players to an extraordinary experience. However, it follows the same gameplay style as Elden Ring or Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. You can’t lower the difficulty to make life easier, but you can practice and repeat sections of the game to improve your skills. </p>



<p>Furthermore, as in Elden Ring, you can farm zones and enemies in Black Myth: Wukong to level up and make the game slightly more approachable, albeit still tricky.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-hard-is-black-myth-wukong">How Hard is Black Myth: Wukong?</h2>

<p>I’ll be frank: Black Myth: Wukong provides quite the challenge. If you’re an inexperienced Soulslike player, or if you were tricked by the many reviews that said the game isn’t Soulslike but is an “action RPG,” which is total bull, then you’re likely feeling the sting of the game’s difficulty. </p>



<p>There’s one boss in particular, in one of the early-game zones, by the name of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-1-billion-steam-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wandering Wight</a>. It’s one of the most infuriating boss fights for a new player, and he’s begging you to challenge him. But you’re not supposed to beat him on the first encounter. You’re meant to return at a later time. The game features numerous bosses similar to this one—a lot of optional boss fights.</p>



<p>If you’re not a fan of the Soulslike genre, especially if you grow weary or angry when you don’t progress quickly enough, then perhaps skip Black Myth: Wukong!</p>

<p>With so many people enjoying the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta gameplay, players with some computer know-how want to ensure their systems run the game as optimally as imaginable. With that said, here’s a look at the Black Ops 6 system requirements!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-system-requirements">What Are the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 System Requirements?</h2>



<p>Besides the massive storage space requirements, the system requirements for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 don’t appear too egregious. With the backing of Activision and Microsoft, one would expect a highly optimized first-person shooter, and that’s often what we receive each year. Make any argument you want, but Call of Duty usually runs well on most systems at launch.</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 1400 / Intel Core i5-6600</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 960/GTX 1650 / AMD Radeon RX 470</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 149 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 1600X / Intel Core i7-6700K</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti/RTX 3060 / AMD Radeon RX 6600XT / Intel Arc A770</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>:  149 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-will-the-system-requirements-change-before-launch">Will the System Requirements Change Before Launch?</h2>



<p>While it’s unlikely that the game’s system requirements will change, especially considering so many of us are already enjoying the game during the beta, there’s still a slim chance. The studio could make behind-the-scenes improvements that optimize the core experience and reduce the hardware requirements. They could also include some files that bloat the storage space requirements.</p>



<p>It’s entirely up in the air whether the PC system requirements for Black Ops 6 will change, but I find it unlikely.</p>

<p>With Final Fantasy XVI finally coming to PC, we’re looking at the latest RPG from Square Enix—previously only available on PS5—and we’re impressed so far. It looks gorgeous, and the PC features appear worthy, but how are the Final Fantasy XVI system requirements? Can your system run the game successfully?</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-xvi-pc-system-requirements">Final Fantasy XVI PC System Requirements</h2>



<p>Overall, the Final Fantasy XVI system requirements don’t appear too egregious. That is, until you spot the storage requirements! This massive game will eat up your SSD in one big gulp, so hopefully, you have enough room to accommodate yet another extensive RPG!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 1600 / Intel Core i5 8400</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: AMD Radeon RX 5700 / Intel Arc A580 / Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 170 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X / Intel Core i7-10700</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT / Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 170 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-does-final-fantasy-xvi-have-controller-support-on-pc">Does Final Fantasy XVI Have Controller Support on PC?</h2>



<p>When Final Fantasy XVI launches on PC on September 17, it will do so with complete controller support from the get-go. You can use a DualShock, DualSense, or an Xbox Series X|S controller—even a third-party controller you scored for a few bucks from Walmart—to play the RPG. </p>



<p>It’s probably best to play with a controller. After all, this is a console RPG designed for the PS5 and is now being ported over to the PC!</p>

Sony's troubled live service game didn't even last two weeks, failing to fill its beta and launching to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-shooter-concord-debuts-to-a-tragic-697-concurrent-players-on-steam">tragically low concurrent count on Steam</a>. Ultimately it is estimated to have<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"> only sold around 25,000 units</a>, which is extraordinarily low by first-party release standards.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Concord servers are now offline.</p><p>Thank you again to all the Freegunners who have joined us in the Concord galaxy. <a href="https://t.co/o1dTywrqUx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/o1dTywrqUx</a></p></div>— Concord (@PlayConcord) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayConcord/status/1832107824295629044?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l3bffz4jjx25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Bluesky</a>, Circana executive director Mat Piscatella called Concord's shutdown "unprecedented," nothing that even Anthem was the best-selling game of February 2019 and is still playable today. Asked how it compares to the likes of The Day Before and Crucible, two other games that were shuttered soon after release, Piscatella said that this "one reads differently to me than anything that's come before," describing it as being "soundly rejected" by players.</p><p>It makes Concord one of the most remarkable news stories of the year — a first party release that ultimately never had a chance.</p><h2>Does Concord have a future as a free-to-play game?</h2><p>Still, at least some fans are wondering if there's a future for Sony's shooter. Could Concord work as a free-to-play game? That's been one of the main questions on platforms like X/Twitter and Resetera as fans debate the path ahead for Sony. Even before Concord shut down, Forbes writer Paul Tassi called its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/28/free-to-play-concord-is-inevitable-but-will-it-change-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transition to free-to-play "inevitable,"</a> though wondered if it would change things. </p><p>There are certainly plenty of sticking points. The roster failed to resonate with fans, and the art style and writing has variously been described as a kind of off-brand Guardians of the Galaxy. There's also little in terms of innovation to differentiate Concord from other hero shooters. In a market flooded with live service games, success is increasingly a zero sum game, and Concord was on the wrong side of the divide.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>On the one hand, the game and the IP were just so soundly rejected of it that one may think it unsalvageable</p></div><p>Nevertheless, we found points to like about Concord. In our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-review">review</a>, we described the competitive gameplay as "fantastic" and praised its map design. In its closing days, a collection of trophy hunters made a last second dash to try and grab what will soon be one of PlayStation's rarest Platinums, even going so far as to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-players-are-jumping-off-cliffs-in-game-as-they-desperately-grind-for-the-platinum-trophy-before-shutdown">throw themselves off cliffs to grind XP</a>.</p><p>So will it return? One <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-sales-ceasing-immediately-offering-refunds-to-all-customers-the-game-will-be-taken-offline-beginning-sept-6th-check-staff-post.970872/page-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resetera</a> user opines. "I'm guessing it'll probably end up going F2P and then quietly shuttered if it doesn't find an audience quickly. Doing that's going to be a hell of a task though as the game was designed around progress not being monetised. I feel terrible for Firewalk, all that time invested into what's apparently a pretty decent game to have this happen straight after launch. I have a horrible feeling that there's going to be some layoffs coming soon."</p><p>Piscatella, for his part, is uncertain. "On the one hand, the game and the IP were just so soundly rejected of it that one may think it unsalvageable. On the other hand, so few know about the game that perhaps it could be brought back with a different model and a significant refresh. I think this is an unprecedented situation, with all options on the table, so anyone's guess is probably as good as mine."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>What's next for Sony</h2><p>For what it's worth, Concord isn't completely finished. As we reported yesterday, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-will-remain-in-prime-videos-secret-level-despite-games-sudden-cancellation-source">Concord is still set to appear in Secret Level</a>, the upcoming Prime Video anthology series by Tim Miller that also features the likes of God of War, Mega Man, and Warhammer 40K. While it seems unlikely that it will re-ignite interest in the property, it does represent at least one spark of life for the franchise.</p><p>The future of Firewalk Studios, for its part, is unclear. The studio behind Concord was established as part of ProbablyMonsters in 2018 and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-acquires-aaa-multiplayer-developer-firewalk-studios">acquired by PlayStation in 2023</a>. Design director Josh Hamrick <a href="https://x.com/Josh_Hamrick" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted throughout the week</a>, thanking fans and signing off when the servers went down with "FREEGUNNER FOR LIFE."</p><p>At one point he wrote wistfully, "I started at Firewalk in the Spring of 2019. We were less than a dozen devs working shoulder to shoulder in a friend's attic."</p><p>Sony, meanwhile, has more free-to-play games on the way, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fairgame-is-the-first-game-from-jade-raymonds-haven-studios">Fairgame$</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Bungie's Marathon</a>. Marathon has already had its share of problems, at one point being <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-shakes-up-marathon-leadership-removes-chris-barrett-as-game-director">forced to replace its director amid layoffs and other problems</a>. Little has been shown of Fairgame$ outside of a CG trailer, but GI.biz's Chris Dring recently said that he's been hearing positive buzz about the game. One way or another, the future of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-commits-to-launch-just-six-of-playstations-12-live-service-games-by-march-2026">Sony's live service strategy is uncertain</a>, though PlayStation can claim at least one victory thanks to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks">success of Helldivers 2</a> in the first part of the year (though it has also struggled of late).</p><p>For now, Sony can take comfort in Astro Bot, which is both single-player and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">receiving rave reviews</a>. As for whether Concord will ever get another chance of its own, we'll just have to see.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions/" data-ref-id="5000-631815">Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</a> has finally delivered fans of the Wizarding World a proper Quidditch sports game, and so it only makes sense that broom customization will be a major factor in the experience. Ideally, you'll be spending the entirety of every Quidditch match on one, after all. But every broom that's available to choose from has its pros and cons--there's no one-size-fits-all choice to be made here. To pick the best broom in Quidditch Champions for you, you'll have to figure out what works best for your style of play and the positions that your characters are playing.</p><h2>Best Broom in Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</h2><p dir="ltr">When you first get started with Quidditch Champions, you'll have three brooms by default: the <strong>Shooting Star</strong>, the <strong>Cleansweep</strong>, and the <strong>Comet</strong>. There are currently seven others available to unlock by various means, like completing challenges or buying the deluxe edition or progressing through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-season-1-battle-pass-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-5752/" data-ref-id="2900-5752">the seasonal rewards</a>. But you don't need to sweat those unlocks--the basic brooms have better stats, at least to begin with, so you don't need any of those others if you're just concerned with effectiveness.</p><p dir="ltr">Brooms have three main stat categories--speed, durability and agility--and each of the three basic brooms is good in two of those categories and poor in the third. The Comet has high agility and high durability but low speed. The Cleansweep has high agility and high speed but low durability. The Shooting Star has high speed and high durability but low agility. You can upgrade them using Moonstones, one of the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-how-to-get-more-winged-keys/1100-6526307/" data-ref-id="1100-6526307">three main currencies</a>, but there's an opportunity cost involved in doing so because you upgrade each broom separately--if you blow all your Moonstones on Shooting Star, you won't have anything to upgrade your Comet.</p><p dir="ltr">But because of how the brooms are balanced, it's not ideal to simply pick one to put all your Moonstones into. You'll need to upgrade all three of them, because each of the three main brooms fills a niche. The way each position plays will be the biggest factor, but your playstyle also matters, so keep that in mind as you read the rest of this.</p><p dir="ltr">For my money, <strong>the Shooting Star is best for chasers</strong>, whose main job is to get downfield quickly and without getting knocked out. But since you have three chasers, it's not the worst idea to throw in one Cleansweep among them so you can have a point guard who can fly circles around everyone.</p><p dir="ltr">I also enjoy the Shooting Star for beaters who like to roam all over, <strong>but a beater who stays on their own team's end of the field may be better suited with a Comet</strong>. But this one is very subjective--what really matters here is you pick a broom with high durability. The other stat is more of a personal choice.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>For a seeker, the choice is very easy; </strong>you need the speed and maneuverability of the Cleensweep. If you want to have any hope of catching the snitch before Harry Potter or Draco Malfoy, you'll need to make full use of the Cleansweep's speed and maneuverability.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, the keeper will need a Comet because its high maneuver speed is necessary for hopping between the three goals you're defending, and its high durability is also essential--it would be <em>really </em>bad if your keeper got knocked out.</p><p dir="ltr">As you play, be sure to regularly upgrade your brooms. You'll receive 15 Moonstones every time you increase your career level, which happens basically every match, so you'll have your equipment in great shape very quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions is developed by Unbroken Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The game is tangentially related to Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Although she is not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success.

            <p>
High-profile streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm has returned to YouTube - two months after admitting he exchanged "messages with an individual minor" that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" - accusing critics of a "planned and coordinated attack", and asking, "Did any of you consider [they] may have been over the legal age of consent?".
</p>
<p>
Beahm <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">admitted to conduct</a> that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" with a minor back in June, after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>'s former account director of strategic partnerships, Cody Conners, <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">claimed</a> an unnamed person had been banned from the streaming platform "because [he] got caught sexting a minor". Those allegations were later directly linked to Beahm by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">The Verge</a> after the publication spoke with two former Twitch employees.
</p>
<p>
In a lengthy response at the time, Beahm said, "I can now tell you my side of the story regarding the ban. Were there Twitch Whisper messages with an individual minor back in 2017? The answer is yes. Were there real intentions behind these messages, the answer is absolutely not."

<p>
"These were casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate," Beahm continued, "but nothing more. Nothing illegal happened, no pictures were shared, no crimes were committed, I never even met the individual. I went through a lengthy arbitration regarding a civil dispute with Twitch and that case was resolved by a settlement. Let me be clear, it was not a criminal case against me and no criminal charges have ever been brought against me."
</p>
<p>
Since that admission, Robert Bowling - who co-founded developer Midnight Society with Beahm - has <a href="https://x.com/fourzerotwo/status/1805671144412049732">distanced himself</a> from the streamer, and many long-running partners have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dr-disrespects-sponsors-and-partners-are-responding-to-twitch-ban-allegations-updated">terminated their agreements</a>. But now, after a period away from the spotlight, a clearly agitated Beahm has returned in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkaSTVagsgo">combative YouTube stream</a> in which he repeatedly accused Conners and "so-called journalists" of a "planned and coordinated attack". All this, Breahm admits, comes ahead of a 25th September "opportunity" to reapply for partnership on YouTube and re-monetise his previously de-monetised channel. 
</p>
<p>
In a 20-minute diatribe mixing prepared statement and seemingly unplanned outburst, Beahm referred to Connors as a "fucking rat", insisting he "wasn't even involved" in the Twitch investigation that would see him <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-banned-by-twitch">banned from the platform</a>. Beahm also repeatedly disputed accusations a minor had been involved in the incident that led to his ban from Twitch, asking, "When you and all these so-called journalists, Cody, fired off your tweets, did any of you consider that the Twitch user may have been over the legal age of consent at the time of the messages?" This is despite the fact Beahm himself previously admitted to sending "Twitch Whisper messages with an individual minor back in 2017".
</p>
<p>
Beahm also insisted he "never intended to meet" the user involved in the accusations, and "never made plans to meet at TwitchCon", instead saying, "I suspect all of you sort of planned and coordinated this attack. These big-time publications, these journalists... act like they're just gossip channels now, without any real journalism, and real research happening."
</p>
<p>
Beahm claims he was deliberately targeted by a former Twitch partner manager who he requested to be replaced because he "didn't do anything for me... he was never on my channel, he didn't follow me on Twitter, he wouldn't even inform us about Twitch rival tournaments." Beahm then adds, "Just a few months later, that ex-Twitch partner manger is directly involved in getting me banned. Coincidence? The Twitch user [involved in the case] tells [them] they do not want to report anything to Twitch but this ex Twitch partner manager encourages the user and even directs them to file a report directly with Twitch, even though the user told them clearly that we never physically met anywhere and that no photographs were exchanged." Beahm does not explain why the former partner manager believed potentially inappropriate behaviour had occurred in the first place. 
</p>
<p>
"I'll say it again," Beahm continued. "Neither I nor the Twitch user exchanged any sexually graphic messages or images... I even used the word 'inappropriate' purposely, and look how it was defined by everyone, including these defaming articles. I'm sorry but mutual bantering with inappropriate jokes taken out of context should have never lead to me getting banned from Twitch."
</p>
<p>
Beahm then offered a lengthy explanation of how the report was progressed - wrongly he claims - to Twitch's law enforcement response team, and then to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children. "As far as I know, he adds, "they didn't escalate Twitch's report to law enforcement. Mind you, the same people that made this decision [at Twitch] admitted internally that the messages did not constitute sexting... that the messages did not warrant any child sexual abuse material charge... Twitch makes this decision to terminate my contract and ban me while admitting they never investigated the age of consent in the jurisdiction where the user's messages were send and received."
</p>
<p>
"I don't claim to be perfect," Beahm added toward the end of his statement, "but I also didn't do all the shit that they're saying I did. But then that doesn't make a story, right? They wanted media attention, the media wants controversy, and by sensationalising all this with big inaccurate headlines like 'sexting' and 'sexually explicit', you all got what you wanted at the expense of [me]. The reality is they wanted to cut down the Doc, plain and simple.... It's so obvious that certain Twitch executives and employees involved had personal biases against the Doc and used all of these as an opportunity to terminate my contract."
</p>
<p>
"I'm not denying the exchange of Whispers," Beahm concluded. "I'm not denying that to all of you out there - it looks bad - I have no way of knowing if the Twitch user thought our exchange of Whispers was inappropriate. If it was, I apologise. All I know is that I never did what Twitch, Cody Conners, or the public is claiming that I did."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-youtube-twitch-drlupo-timthetatman-swagg<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remember a few years ago when YouTube started <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/09/10/twitch-youtube-drlupo-timthetatman-leave-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aggressively throwing money</a> at some of Twitch’s golden-egg-laying-est geese, leading to widespread speculation that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/09/14/youtube-strategy-twitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube might supplant Twitch</a> as the internet’s premiere livestreaming destination? That… didn’t happen. This week saw three big-name streamers – Ben “Dr Lupo” Lupo, Tim “TimTheTatman” Betar, and Kris "Swagg" Lamberson – <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/swagg-timthetatman-drlupo-come-back-twitch-multistreaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return to Twitch</a> after their lucrative YouTube exclusivity contracts expired. From here on out, the former two will stream on both Twitch and YouTube, while the latter is focusing on Twitch. The more things change, the more they stay the same. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>We begin by marveling at the speed with which <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-shutdown-offline-refund-ps5-pc-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony pulled the plug on its latest live service offering</a>, <em>Concord</em>, a game so focused-grouped for everyone that it ended up being for no one. Are live service games as a whole doomed? Probably not. But the way triple-A publishers approach them – toiling away for years and then releasing something that feels dated on day one – likely is.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we reflect on the great Twitch vs YouTube livestreaming war, which seems to be ending with a whimper rather than a bang. Now that Twitch allows creators to stream to multiple platforms and YouTube seems uninterested in significantly improving its streaming product, why not? In the end, nobody really won The Streaming Wars. Instead, they got distracted trying to copy TikTok.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, we discuss <a href="https://aftermath.site/nanowrimo-ai-statement-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NaNoWriMo’s weird stance on AI</a>, which – as with most supposed defenses of AI as a creative tool – just doesn’t really make much sense. Oh, and I absolutely knock it out of the park with my segment transitions this week. Do not believe anyone who tells you otherwise!</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can sink millions into doomed live service <em>and </em>platform exclusivity efforts (or at least into <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-2024-finances-subscription-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paying ourselves sustainable salaries</a>).</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>[These streamers] are now streaming to Twitch and YouTube, which has become the new meta ever since Twitch started letting people do it last year. So we’re in this place where a few years ago, all the headlines were about the exclusivity wars between Twitch and YouTube. They were trying to lock down all the biggest names, and YouTube was making these big moves to try to become the new destination for livestreaming.&nbsp;</p><p>Here we are a few years later, and both have abandoned that strategy. YouTube really isn’t offering contracts like that to streamers anymore. Twitch still kind of does it in places, but not really. It’s interesting to see how things have changed, in part because the landscape shifted and now everyone’s on every platform. Even we’re doing that, to an extent. You post everywhere.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Technically you’ve been able to do that forever. You can stream to two different [platforms]. That’s not hard. It’s a very easy thing to do. The only thing preventing people was the money – and also moderating two different platforms.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> That’s the big issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, if you have two chats, that sucks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>There have been debates this week between streamers about what to do now. Is the best approach to multi-stream because you’re allowed to and because you can maximize your audience’s size that way? Or is the strategy to focus on one streaming platform, because even beyond moderation, there’s also the issue of just engaging with an audience. It’s really hard to follow two chats at once. So if you want to engage with people – which is the point of livestreaming; the reason why it’s so popular is because there’s a back and forth – it doesn’t make sense to try to reach multiple audiences at once. Because at the end of the day, your YouTube audience or your Twitch audience or your Kick audience or whatever will have trouble talking to you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I hope people aren’t prioritizing their Kick audiences.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, but I had to include that because Kick does have a sizable audience for livestreaming at this point. I’d be remiss if I didn’t. But yeah, there are some people who say “Yeah, I’ve gotta be everywhere.” Ludwig, who’s one of the big remaining YouTube streamers, said that the next Kai Cenat isn’t going to come from multi-streaming. The next one of those is gonna be locked into a particular audience and culture. I don’t really have a take on this; I think that we’re going to have to wait and see what happens.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>People are talking about how there are tools you can use to unify chat display. Not surprising. It still sucks to do, I think. I think that’s annoying. There’s a company called Topping that makes an audience interface. It’s a very funny name for a company. They just got into audio interfaces, and they have one out called the OTG model. You can plug a phone into it and plug it into a computer and have the same mic audio going into a livestream on a phone and your computer.&nbsp;</p><p>So if you’re doing the shit we’re talking about where you have a TikTok livestream and another stream going into Twitch, you can do both of those and have the audio feed into both. That’s one of those things where you’re like “Who is this for?” And then you hear people doing this meta with multiple streams, and you’re like “That’s who it’s for.” People who want to stream to, like, five different platforms.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think it’s still weird because the appeal of a chat is often the relationships within that chat. Even if you can address multiple groups, I think it still feels disjointed from a viewer perspective. Even if you see both chats at once via software, they’re not talking to each other. So you still end up in this odd spot.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I just want to make fun of the URL [for the company Chris mentioned], which is topping.pro, which I would click, but I would not expect to get what I’m told I’ll be getting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>This is like every time I see a commercial for Dick’s Sporting Goods, and they tell me to visit dicks.com. I’m like “I don’t believe you! I don’t believe I’m going to get what you say I’m going to get from this website!”</p><p>But anyway, back to the topic at hand, I think it’s interesting where all of this has gone. For a minute there, it seemed like YouTube really cared about streamers and wanted to make that a big part of its offering. They had this guy named Ryan Wyatt who was running that side of things, and he was very hands-on, talking with streamers on Twitter all the time. Actually, I wouldn’t be surprised if what Dan Clancy, the current CEO of Twitch, is doing was inspired by Ryan being the head of a division but also this big-time community guy who was always making appearances, and everyone knew him by name. Being everyone’s cool friend.&nbsp;</p><p>But then what happened is, YouTube discovered something that Twitch has kind of known all along: Streaming is not an easy way for companies to make money. And around the same time, shorts got big. TikTok blew up. YouTube was trying to become a major player in the streaming space in 2020 and 2021, which is right around the time that TikTok really caught on. So YouTube was like “We’ve gotta pivot to rip that off.” In the years that followed, streaming just kind of stalled out for them.</p><p>They encountered the same problem that Twitch has in another way: Discoverability isn’t great on YouTube if all you’re doing is streaming. So streamers who weren’t already huge struggled there. And now we’re sort of back at square one, where streaming is a thing YouTube doesn’t seem to care about that much and Twitch is the main place to go for it. All these millions of dollars were slung around at streamers in the name of winning a war between two tech giants, and the end result is a status quo that’s not that different from what came before.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/mister-pi-de-10-nano-clone-board-taki-udon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Of all the consoles I have ever bought, few rival the sheer usefulness of my MiSTer. Based on a Terasic DE-10 Nano development board, the open source project encompasses a massive amount of consoles, old computers, and arcade machines with pinpoint accuracy. New additions happen every day thanks to the community of developers. I was lucky: I bought my DE-10 Nano board before the massive jump in prices a few years back, which has been the biggest barrier for new people attempting to gain entry to this community. All that may have just changed, thanks to a replacement clone board produced by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/TakiUdon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taki Udon</a>. And he’s not stopping there–he’s hoping to upend the entire MiSTer ecosystem.</p><p>I first became aware of Taki Udon while looking up reviews of retro handhelds on YouTube.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TakiUdon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> His channel,</a> with 369k subscribers as of this writing, often focuses on the inexpensive but powerful emulation handhelds from companies like Anbernic. There are countless devices like this with names like R35S, TRIMUI Smart Pro, or Miyoo Mini Pro. Most of them run some variant of Linux and are between $30-$100, which buys you a shocking amount of device.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="We Need to Talk." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnDSBbzYE5A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>I became aware of Taki Udon first via his YouTube channel, where he publishes videos on retro handhelds like this.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Taki himself never appears on camera. All you see are his hands, usually in front of a single color sheet of seamless paper peppered with retro devices and narrated by his enthusiastic, cheerful voice. He does not talk about his personal life or experience explicitly (he says he wishes to open up in a video series later), but he says he is in the business of hardware development in China.&nbsp;</p><p>“I never liked that MiSTer was tied to a platform that was out of reach for many people,” Taki told me over Discord “For a few years, I wanted to do something with FPGA, but there was never a good opportunity. Late last year, I started having discussions about whether or not it would be possible to create a successor platform for developers to migrate to with more performance at a lower price. I reached out to members of the community to get some feedback on what kind of hardware features they would want in an upgraded dev board.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="MiSTER Pi - Product Overview &amp; New User Guide" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cbppuWmukw0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A product overview of the MiSTER Pi board.</figcaption></figure></div><p>“While that was happening, we started to work on creating a board that could run MiSTer as-is to get some experience making a board,” Taki told me. “When that board was done, we felt confident that we could make a similar board with an upgraded FPGA, but I thought it would not further our goal of trying to get more people into FPGA gaming if we did not offer up the R&amp;D board that we had. We would have also fragmented the community because there are a lot of people who still want to enjoy the systems that are supported by the current Cyclone V. So we paused work on making the successor platform and turned our focus to building out a cost-effective roadmap based on CV5.”</p><p>When Taki announced that he was not only creating a more affordable MiSTer clone board, but several commercial consoles and handhelds, I was taken aback. Announcing that many products is surprising to say the least. But his background, coupled with his <a href="https://x.com/takiudon_/status/1830814512959689157" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">close proximity</a> to hardware production in China, goes a long way to explaining how that might happen.</p><figure><figcaption>Laying it all out. Credit: Taki Udon</figcaption></figure><p>“Yeah, I live in China. I worked in consumer electronics for several years before forming my new company,” Taki said. “When it comes to prototyping, there are a lot of things that are easier to do here. There is no shortage of PCB companies that you can work with, and it is fast and cheap to get boards made by some of the companies that you mentioned. Those companies already have great pricing on their global websites, but they charge way less on the domestic platform.”</p><figure><figcaption>So far all that Taki has posted aside of the rest of the line is this brief tease of the handhelds and some early close-ups of the consoles.

His account is one of the few I have notifications turned on for, and usually updates late at night. As of this writing, multiple products have been announced: “Flagship, mainstream, budget cartridge, and two handhelds,” Taki told me.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Full Stack. Credit: Taki Udon</figcaption></figure><p>“After I decided that I wanted to sell the bare $99 board, I sat down and decided to try and come up with a product roadmap that would reuse the work that we had already done. I took a full day to draw 2D ID for three consoles and a single handheld. I'd have to look at timestamps, but I remember it taking 14 hours or so. The next day, I had a meeting with my cofounder, and I pitched all four products to see which ones would get greenlit. Needless to say, they all got approved. Those three consoles turned into four during the rest of the ID stage, and the single handheld split into two.</p><p>“For this project, we did some rapid prototyping on accessory boards using those services. It's awesome to be able to get a board file, modify some of the routing, and have the order fully processed and shipped to your house in 48 hours.”</p><p>While Taki Udon has been announcing his product roadmap, at least two other <a href="https://x.com/zyjnumber1/status/1791769986396307930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyclone-V based DE-10 Nano</a> clone boards have emerged on the market, one of which has integrated RAM, by a company called QMTech. Both have been <a href="https://irkenlabs.com/qmtech-de10-clone-mini-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tested</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fosp0mnU8X0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple people</a>, and seem to work in that setup. They are not without their limitations and quirks, particularly when it comes to compatibility with the existing ecosystem of MiSTer cases and I/O boards, <a href="https://x.com/zyjnumber1/status/1829442478426169724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">although QMTech sells their own hats</a>. But that makes Taki Udon’s board and ecosystem of multiple potential consoles all the more interesting, and more competition within this space only further loosens the bottleneck that Terasic has imposed on an otherwise open source project.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Switch Lite OLED - Engineering Preview" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ufYiLnbOkbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>On top of all this, Taki is also doing a Switch Lite OLED.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Taki does not seem worried. “The community is still kind of small compared to other things that I have worked on, but I think there are a lot of people who are excited about this little niche growing with cheaper products. That motivates me to want to work harder on this. In terms of things being harder than I expected, I wouldn't say anything was really that difficult for the product that will launch this month. Everything has been pretty smooth, all things considered, but that's mostly because we aren't solving any difficult technical challenges to make this product.”&nbsp;</p><p>“We are also working on a Switch Lite OLED screen, and that is orders of magnitude more complex from a product standpoint than making the triple stack at a cheaper price. The most difficult thing that we have in this FPGA roadmap is the flagship console. That has a lot of technical challenges that need to be dealt with to get it out the door.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Taki Udon's Clone MiSTer FPGA Review Part 2!

I recognize this isn’t indicative of much beyond my sentimentality, but I thought it was a crucial tidbit to underscore something else, something important about PlayStation’s excellent new platformer. It really <em>is</em>, more than anything else,<em> </em>a celebration of the consoles and games that shaped me, and likely many of you, too. It is so completely possessed with joy and teeming with the life of everything that PlayStation has meant to people over the years. It is also a brilliant platformer in its own right, stuffed full of ideas that make it seem like Asobi Team is just getting started in this utterly endearing franchise. For all its charms and wonders, however, there’s also a slightly melancholy feeling that <em>Astro Bot</em>, which secondarily serves as a kind of museum of PlayStation’s history, is putting that legacy and the spirit of innovation that defined it under glass to be gazed upon and appreciated as a relic of yesterday, rather than to infuse and electrify the games of today and tomorrow. — Moises Taveras</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="adbf93e5f3781335c25911eccce26e64" data-recommend-id="image://adbf93e5f3781335c25911eccce26e64" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows Space Marine Titus holding back a large wave of aliens.

But another enduring Square Enix series, quietly running just as long as the others, takes the opposite approach, embracing the positive side of religion and mythology. These are games about unity, the healing powers of nature, and the virtuous pride brought from trusting in a benevolent higher power.

Chapters 1, 2, 4, and 5 contain these hidden locations and even contain their own hoops to jump through in order to access and complete them. <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/How_to_Unlock_the_Chapter_2_Secret_Area">Accessing the Chapter 2 secret area</a> alone requires the completion of a separate quest for a warthog NPC, and it comes with two bosses to beat – the Tiger Vanguard and Fuban. While keeping every location and its requirements in mind, players will also need to ensure they complete the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Side_Questlines">Treasure Hunter side quest in Chapter 3</a> and beat the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Boss_List_and_Guides">game’s final boss, The Great Sage’s Broken Shell</a>. Make sure you don’t start a New Cycle afterward, though, as there is still more to do.</p><p>After choosing to continue your journey, you’ll need to find Mount Mei, with arguably the most difficult boss in the game, Erlang, the Sacred Divinity, waiting to greet anyone who’s made it this far. Finally, after beating Erlang and the Four Heavenly Kings that follow him, you’ll need to beat The Great Sage’s Broken Shell just one more time. Then, after what is sure to result in hours of work, you’ll be rewarded with the Black Myth: Wukong true secret ending, which includes a gorgeously animated video.</p><p>It's… a lot! Thankfully, if you’re pressed for time or just can’t get past that Erlang fight, we’ve recorded and shared the full clip below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/atomic-mass-games-gives-away-canceled-star-wars-x-wing-ship-pack-cards<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of the Star Wars X-Wing miniatures game just got some new content. It's not a new edition or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deleted-fantasy-flight-games-custom-tools-files-restored-by-fans" rel="noopener" target="_blank">newly uncovered custom scenarios</a>, but a set of ship cards from a canceled ship pack. And it is available to everyone for free.</p>

<p>According to a social media <a href="https://x.com/atomicmassgames/status/1832106250911494539">post on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter), Atomic Mass Games decided to release cards for the announced, then canceled, <em>Star Wars X-Wing TIE Phantom </em>and<em> Alpha Class Starwing</em> ship packs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-x-wing-cancelled-alpha-starship-pilot-card-artwork.jpg?itok=8t8riSaG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-x-wing-cancelled-alpha-starship-pilot-card-artwork.jpg?itok=5arTEUV5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The cards are available on Atomic Mass Games' <a href="https://www.atomicmassgames.com/xwing-docs/">website</a> as a print-and-play PDF. In addition, the game's points document has been updated to include the new ships.</p>
<p>Like all <em>Star Wars X-Wing</em> ship packs, the cards in <em>TIE Phantom</em> and <em>Alpha Class Starwing </em>contain a mix of tactics, weapons, pilot cards, and spaceship artwork courtesy of Timothy Ben Zweifel, Matt Bradbury, Mark Molnar, and Anthony Deville.</p>
<p>This is the first piece of new content for <em>Star Wars X-Wing</em> since April 2022. The original game was released in 2012 by Fantasy Flight Games. In 2018, the game received <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-x-wing-minatures-game-2nd-edition-core-set-review-perfect-time-to-join" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a second edition</a>.</p>
<p>Since its release, the game has had 12 waves of expansions. These expansions have added multiple ships and factions from across the Star Wars franchise, including the CIS and Old Republic from the prequel trilogy and the New Republic and First Order from the sequel trilogy.</p>

These include <em>Star Wars X-Wing</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-legion-early-2021-expansions-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars Legion</em></a>, and <em>Star Wars Armada</em>. This past June, Atomic Mass Games announced they were <a href="https://www.atomicmassgames.com/transmission/update-on-star-wars-x-wing-and-star-wars-armada/">stopping development</a> on both <em>X-Wing</em> and <em>Armada</em>.</p>
<p>Atomic Mass Games has stopped all active development on both miniature games but continues to support the community through tournaments and organized play events.</p>
<p>If you want some new content in your <em>Star Wars X-Wing</em> skirmishes, these print-and-play ship cards may do the trick. As for miniature models, there's always the option of DIY 3D printing.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-first-stream-back/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dr-disrespect-returns-to-streaming-to-explain-his-side-of-the-story.974472/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-first-stream-back/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Dr Disrespect appeared on camera for the first time since June to address the recent allegations of ‘minor messaging’ that were levelled against him on social media. It has been one of the most storied topics in the content creation world in the last couple of months, ever since former Twitch employees came forward with their claims.</p>



<p>In the opening 20 minutes of his return stream, Dr Disrespect blasted Twitch, confirmed that he’s still not denying what he did, and attempted to set the story straight from his perspective, all in front of 240,000 viewers.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-this-was-handled-years-ago">‘This Was Handled Years Ago’</h2>



<p>In his first stream in more than two months, Dr Disrespect kicked off by giving an expansive account of his side of the story. As the reports go, Dr Disrespect messaged a minor on Twitch in 2017 (which he has admitted to doing), and in 2020, this was discovered and used as ‘fuel’ to get him kicked off the platform.</p>



<p>That’s the abbreviated version of this lengthy debacle.</p>



<p>Per Dr Disrespect’s to clear things up, things turned sour for him and Twitch when in 2019 he was assigned a partner manager he instantly failed to work well with. Shortly after, a grudge was formed and the ‘partner manager’ started probing into Dr Disrespect’s Whispers – which was Twitch’s on-platform private messaging service.</p>



<p>Following a review by the Trust and Safety team at Twitch, no wrongdoing was found, but this unnamed partner manager persisted and used a friend to force the messages onto the ‘Law Enforcement Team’ at Twitch. Again, no wrongdoing was found, despite it having an ‘investment’ from a company director.</p>



<p>This process reportedly included reviews by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, amongst others, and again, no illegal actions were discovered, and therefore, nothing was taken any further. Dr Disrespect also claimed that the victim in question had no interest in escalating the situation to Twitch, and at no point were Dr Disrespect <strong>or </strong>the victim interviewed.</p>



<p>Hunter clipped the full segment below:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Dr Disrespect's full 20 minute response after returning to stream. He says: </p><p>– He was not found guilty of anything <br>– The individual did not want to file a report but Twitch pushed them to<br>– His old Twitch partner manager was targeting him and personally escalated messages to… <a href="https://t.co/hr7YyE4uhV">pic.twitter.com/hr7YyE4uhV</a></p></div>— Hunter (@HUN2R) <a href="https://twitter.com/HUN2R/status/1832131401044414870?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>On stream, Dr Disrespect said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It has affected us on so many levels – back in 2020, and now in 2024. And Cody Connors, I just have to say it again… Why would you do this? Like I said, this was handled professionally years ago, no wrongdoing. But because of you, Cody, we just lost — unfortunately, we had to lay off people from Midnight Society, because of you, Cody.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is a reference to the individual who ignited this situation back in June with posts on social media.</p>



<p>After that, he said again:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For all you Doc haters, I’m sure you’ll jsut dissect all of this and still find a way to publically criticise me, but do what you need to do. But this isn’t for you. This is for my team today, my community, and my friends that have supported me. And I’m not denying the exchange of Whispers, Champs.</p>



<p>I’m not denying that to all of you out there, it looks bad. I have no way of knowing if the Twitch user thought our exchange of Whispers was innappropriate, and if it was, I apologise. All I know is that I never did what Twitch, Cody Connors, or the public is claiming that I did.</p>



<p>That’s it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many were quick to state that Dr Disrespect ‘has no receipts’ for much of this, but throughout this entire event, there has also been nothing from those condemning him to verify his wrongdoing. He has copped to it and held his hands up, and now he’s trying to do some damage control and claw back his career.</p>



<p>He explained that he’s eligible to apply for monetisation on YouTube on September 25, and if he lands it, then it just might remain business as usual for the streamer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237735/amd-z2-extreme-gaming-handheld-pc-chip<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme is the chip inside the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">Asus ROG Ally X</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review">Asus ROG Ally</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a> — and in early 2025, AMD will announce its successor, the Z2 Extreme, for future PC gaming handhelds. </p><p>That’s the word <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/amd-confirms-z2-extreme/">from <em>Digital Trends</em>’ Jacob Roach</a>, who heard AMD computing and graphics boss Jack Huynh say it’s targeting a 2025 release on an IFA stage in Berlin; I just confirmed with AMD spokesperson Stacy MacDiarmid that the company plans to announce it in early 2025, though AMD’s declining to say any more about it today. </p><p>The only other things we’ve heard: AMD says it’s working with multiple partners, so the chip may already be in handheld makers’ hands. And it’s probably based on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24198605/amd-ryzen-ai-strix-point-vs-apple-intel-qualcomm-event">AMD’s Strix Point</a>; so say Jez Corden’s sources <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/amd-confirms-z2-extreme-chip-aims-to-boost-pc-gaming-handheld-battery-life-by-over-300">over at <em>Windows Central</em></a>. </p><p>AMD’s Huynh also reportedly mentioned he wants to play games like <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> for three hours on a handheld instead of the current 45 minutes, but it’s not clear whether that was just an anecdote or a hint at what a Strix-based Z2 Extreme can do. </p><p>I’m not yet sure how optimistic to be about Strix quite yet; AMD touted the increased performance of Zen 5 in its Strix Point laptop architecture briefings, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24198605/amd-ryzen-ai-strix-point-vs-apple-intel-qualcomm-event#:~:text=Next%2Dto%2Dno%20mentions%20of%20battery%20life">it didn’t say a word about increased battery life</a>. </p><p>While a performance improvement can sometimes turn into a battery life improvement by changing a chip to that end, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/25/23696722/amd-ryzen-z1-z1-extreme-rog-ally">AMD’s original Z1 Extreme</a> was largely just a tweaked version of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/3/23709251/amd-ryzen-7040-u-apple-m2-intel-laptop-cpu-apu">Ryzen 7840U laptop chip</a>, one that really needed lots of electricity to thrive. </p><p>Handhelds like the ROG Ally and Legion Go can turbo up to 40 or 50 watts of total system drain to play games that barely run on the Steam Deck, but that means they fully drain their batteries in under an hour. They couldn’t beat the Steam Deck’s semi-custom chip at 15 watts or get anywhere near as much battery life in less demanding titles.</p><p>Eventually, the AMD ROG Ally X brute-forced its way to vastly better battery life by doubling the size of the pack inside. But maybe AMD takes a different route and makes the Z2 Extreme a bespoke handheld chip? That’d be exciting.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Roblox Developer's Conference 2024: Everything Announced]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-developers-conference-2024-everything-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-developers-conference-2024-everything-announced.974445/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-developers-conference-2024-everything-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>2024's Roblox Developer's Conference has arrived and has given fans a glimpse into the future of the platform that is setting its sights on 1 billion daily active users. Roblox founder and CEO David Baszucki shared that the team hopes to achieve that goal by focusing on helping creators build their businesses, scaling creation and access, and bringing people together.</p><p>Roblox still has a ways to go to reach that one billion daily active user goal, as the game saw a still impressive 79.5 million daily active users as of June 2024, but Baszucki believes this mindset and the plans they have in place will transform the gaming landscape to a place where "10% of all gaming revenue will flow through the Roblox ecosystem and be distributed with our community of creators."</p><p>Some of these plans include a new Party system that lets friends play their favorite together with ease, the growth of a "Roblox-created 3D foundational model to power generative AI creation on the platform," and new commerce opportunities to help creators earn more and even sell their physical merchandise to more fans. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/06/render-communication-and-connection-on-roblox-1725637041181.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>Roblox is introducing a new Party system</h2><p>Roblox's new Party system is set to launch in October and aims to get friends playing and communicating together with as few barriers as possible. Anyone above nine years old will be able to utilize this feature and Party will launch first with the ability for players to text each other in the app. Later in the year, voice will be added for those who are phone-verified users aged 13 or older.</p><p>Party will work both inside and outside of Roblox and, early next year, the Roblox team will add an API that will let developers improve the Party system by letting them teleport players to the same starting point, put them in a private lobby, and even pre-pair them onto the same team.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/06/the-flow-of-hosting-a-party-with-friends-1725636860526.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Another way Roblox is attempting to bring people together is by rebranding its Roblox Groups to Roblox Communities. These spaces will be a place for players to participate in Forums to share feedback on their experiences, talk about their favorite games and moments, and report issues that arise.</p><p>Music is one more area Roblox is looking to expand into, as the team will be making new ways for players to discover music and connect with artists beyond just listening to the songs included in a Roblo experience. Such platform features as What's Playing and Music Charts will be added and an integration with the music distribution service DistroKid will be the simple way artists can upload their work or find music to include in their projects. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/06/music-charts-desktop-view-1725637415607.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>Creator Affiliate Program and transparent algorithms</h2><p>Roblox has announced a Creator Affiliate Program that will reward developers who can bring new users into the platform. Creators will be able to share a unique link that will earn them money when someone uses it to sign up and purchase Robux. Creators will earn a share of the revenue the person "generates from their Robux purchases" for the first six months. </p><p>Applications are open now for the first version of this program — which will enable creators to earn up to 50% on qualified purchases — and the team anticipates all eligible creators will be able to utilize the program by the middle of 2025.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/06/23-1725637111974.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Creators will also be happy to know the Roblox team is improving the way users find their content. Today's Picks on the homepage and on Marketplace will highlight even more experiences, and impressions on sponsored ads on Roblox's homepage have increased from 1.6% in March 2024 to over 8% in June 2024.</p><p>Furthermore, the team promises "open and transparent insight into search and discovery on Roblox." This means creators will have a better idea on what the team values and how they can craft their experiences to become as visible as possible.</p><h2>AI and scaling Roblox to all devices</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/06/capture-1725637021622.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The team at Roblox wants the platform to run its best on as many devices as possible, and a new technology called Harmony aims to optimize the game to achieve this goal. Harmony includes client-side balancing and optimizations of CPU, GPU, and RAM. In the future, this will extend into Roblox-supported architecture for "server authority for competitive games."</p><p>AI, which has already been a part of Roblox for some time with Assistant, Texture Generator, and Avatar Auto Setup, will be taken to the next level with a new incubation project that was launched just a few months ago. This 3D foundational model will be open source and multimodal and will "power 3D generation through text, video, and 3D prompts." </p><p>The goal is to let devs create their dreams in whichever style they prefer - be it photorealistic, anime, low-poly, or steampunk - and generate objects and scenes to match. Devs will even be able to have AI create an entire world and give the AI feedback to finetune it to their liking.</p><p>Additionally, Roblox will soon make it possible for devs to host a high-performance, 100-player open world, sports, or battle royale-type game and have it run on 2GB RAM devices. </p><h2>Helping Creators Build Their Businesses</h2><p>Alongside helping devs create newer and even more ambitious projects, the Roblox team is working on helping these same creators earn more money for their hard work. In the "coming months," there will be a new option to optimize in-experience pricing. This new tool will run price tests and recommend the "most attractive pricing strategy." There will also be testing done for regional pricing recomendations. </p><p>Early next year, creators will be able to sell physical merchandise from within their experiences, and the team at Roblox will be parterning with various e-commerce platforms like Shopify to make this a smooth and easy process.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/06/paid-access-pricing-1725636903936.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Lastly, devs will be able to price their paid access experiences in real currency value on desktop and earn an even higher revenue share than before. This means experiences selling at $9.99, $29.99, and $49.99 will get a 50%, 60%, and 70% revenue share, respectively. This change will roll out later this year for desktop and other devices will hopefully get this feature in the future.</p><p><em>Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/once-human-mobile-testing-begins-september-19-dlss-3-support-on-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Once Human's mobile testing will officially begin on September 19, 2024, with players on both iOS and Android devices able to play the game. Those in North America, Europe, Japan, and South Korea will be able to play the game on a smaller screen and provide feedback to the developers. In addition, <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-qa-the-launch-was-successful-beyond-our-imagination/">the developers</a> have also announced that Once Human now has DLSS 3.0 support, which has helped to enhance the game's graphics.</p>
<p>To join the mobile testing for Once Human, players will need to download the version from the <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>. The test starts on September 19 at 8 PM PDT / 11 PM EDT / 4 AM BST. However, the number of spaces for players is limited, so once the maximum number has been reached, the registration page will be closed. The developers have also stated that once the test is done, all data from the test will be wiped.</p>
<p>Once Human already had spectacular graphics, DLSS 3.0 provided a better visual experience for those with Nvidia RTX 40 series GPUs. DLSS 3.0 works by providing enhanced game performance while continuing to bolster graphical fidelity. This technology can double the game's frame rate while using the same graphic settings as before. This is especially beneficial for those who don't have a beefy setup and can provide a more immersive experience to those who are on lower-budget hardware.</p>
<p>The official Once Human YouTube channel posted a 45-second showcase to help players see what NVIDIA DLSS 3 and Reflex have in store for them.</p>
<p><iframe title="Once Human丨NVIDIA DLSS 3 and Reflex are now available!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YL2o5hJ03nI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to these two major news points, it has been announced that the Once Human Season 2 Battle Pass will launch on September 12, which includes some limited edition cosmetics for players to obtain. This includes the Night Time Rose cosmetic set, the Nightmare Cage backpack skin, the Dragon Dance weapon skin for the MPS7, and the Battle Station furniture pack. While these are available through the battle pass, new items will be added to the Shop on September 19 for players to purchase.</p>
<p>The items in the Shop include the Ethereal Feathers fashion set, the Cold Exuviate backpack skin, the Sad Blossom weapon skin for the MPS5, and the Combat Medic fashion set. These are paid items that players can obtain through the free-to-play game's store and Battle Pass.</p>
<p>There are two paid tracks on the Battle Pass, the essential track costing $9.99 and the premium track costing $23.99. Both tracks provide supplies and cosmetic items.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-is-too-much-nostalgia-and-too-little-substance.974421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-movie-review-cast-2024-new-1851642373<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nostalgia has been the driving force behind so many recently released movies, with sequels, prequels, reboots and remakes of films that we love from the past dominating theaters in the last several years. From <em>Ghostbusters</em> to <em>Indiana Jones</em>, <em>Scream</em> to <em>Spider-Man</em>, <em>Twister</em> to <em>Deadpool</em>, It feels like now more than ever, we are desperate to rekindle the joy and laughter from pieces of popular culture’s past. Instead of simply watching the original movies, audiences yearn for a return to beloved characters and the unique worlds they inhabit, wondering what they would be like now.<br></p><p>But these nostalgic retreads face a difficult challenge: They must try to capture the spirit of the original (which usually can’t be done) or outshine it, while also adding something fresh and new. This can either surprisingly succeed or spectacularly fail—unfortunately, <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> falls into the latter category. While there are glimmers of the macabre comedy that we’ve come to know and love from director Tim Burton, the majority of the sequel to the 1988 classic feels like you’re on some sort of demented carousel; it just keeps spinning past partial storylines, visual slapstick, and limited character development without ever digging into the emotional core.</p><h2 id="h1124"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Beetlejuice </em>but make it girl power</strong></h2><p>One of the best aspects of the sequel is that it focuses on three generations of Deetz women. Winona Ryder, who starred in the original film, artfully translates Lydia Deetz’s pensiveness to middle age. While she still sports her signature choppy hairstyle and long, black clothing, her character has evolved into someone far more anxious and distant than the young woman we once knew. She pops pills and has trouble connecting with her daughter, Astrid (Jenna Ortega). Lydia, now a psychic, hosts a television series, using her abilities to communicate with the ghosts that she’s able to see. But lately she’s been haunted by unsettling visions of her teenage demon, Betelgeuse. Lydia has lost a lot of the fire she had as a teen, allowing her to be taken advantage of by her smarmy producer and boyfriend, played by Justin Theroux. </p><p>Lydia’s shift from photographer to television star feels slightly out of character because she was always such a loner and quiet presence. But people change, especially decades after being a 16-year-old. It also allows for a cheeky meta commentary that sees Astrid annoyed to be living in her mother’s shadow and wanting to carve out her own story.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tim-burton-movies-ranked-beetlejuice-big-fish-halloween-1851637754&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tim-burton-movies-ranked-beetlejuice-big-fish-halloween-1851637754">We Ranked Every Tim Burton Movie, Now Including <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em>, From Worst To Best</a></span></p><p>Jenna Ortega, with glum expressions, downward-turned mouth, and large eyes, seems like she was made in a Tim Burton factory. As with her lead role in Burton’s series <em>Wednesday</em>, Jenna Ortega is the perfect fit for a new generation of angsty <em>Beetlejuice </em>oddballs. Echoing Lydia’s annoyance with stepmother Delia  in the first film, Astrid resents her mother’s psychic abilities and showbiz occupation. She idolizes her father who passed away and fought for important causes like environmentalism.<br></p><p>This dynamic makes her an easy target for Jeremy, a Dostoyevsky-loving teen who’s more than he initially appears. This all sounds like fodder for interesting tension and sharply-drawn characterization, but unlike past Tim Burton films that have a sentimentality as evocative as his visuals,<em> Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> mostly relies on exposition and hasty plot contrivances to move everything forward, making the stories feel rushed and superficial. We never stay with the characters long enough to attach to who they are and how they’re feeling. When Astrid ventures into the underworld and conveniently encounters her father, it leads to a family reunion that moves way too fast to have any emotional effect.<br></p><p>Catherine O’Hara returns as the melodramatic Delia, who has moved on from sculpture to multimedia art, which produces some hilarious moments like when she is filming herself trying to capture the perfect primal scream.<em> Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> shrewdly sidesteps actor Jeffrey Jones, who played Delia’s husband Charles in the original and whose career ended in a child pornography scandal, with the use of a stop-motion animation sequence to show how he died. The original’s stop-motion sandworms also return, preserving the 1988 film’s cartoony, old-school aesthetic, though ventures into CGI muddy the film’s visual language.</p><figure id="" data-id="7a4a6eb9437319863199429da24c4751" data-recommend-id="image://7a4a6eb9437319863199429da24c4751" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Beetlejuice looks smugly at the camera.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h1125"><a id=""></a><em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice </em>binges nostalgia</h2><p>As the titular character, Michael Keaton is appropriately rambunctious and kooky, but he’s lost some of his bite. The film’s attempts at contemporary humor, which find it mocking therapy-speak and the focus on healing from trauma and addressing one’s inner child, just don’t sting as much as the barbs in the original. Betelgeuse is involved in a plot with a very underused Monica Bellucci as Delores—Betelgeuse’s ex-wife who is part Morticia Addams, part Sally from <em>A Nightmare Before Christmas</em> with a stapled-together body. She looks sexy and menacing while stalking him throughout the underworld, but has little else to do. Her threadbare story amounts to nothing except for a reason to re-stage the wedding scene at the end of the original <em>Beetlejuice </em>with Lydia’s blood-red dress.<br></p><p>Another new face is Willem Dafoe, who fits right into Tim Burton’s eccentric style as Wolf Jackson, an action star who approaches his afterlife cop duties with all the campy gusto he brought to his movie roles. Oddly enough, I got more laughs out of Wolf than I did Betelgeuse. Other jokes, like the painfully obvious, literal soul train and Astrid’s self-referential muttering of“I swear, the afterlife is so random,” weren’t cutting it, either.<br></p><p><em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> is more comfortable cramming references to the first film than doing anything different. A child choir sings “Banana Boat (Day-O)” at Charles’ funeral; there’s no earthly reason for this, except to reference the infamous scene. I understand that this is a fantasy comedy, but the sacrifice of storytelling for obvious nostalgia bait was too much.</p><p>There’s another lip-syncing scene at the end of <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> (and really, how could there not be?) but Tim Burton was never going to be able to top the original’s calypso revelry set to Harry Belefonte. Richard Harris’ lengthy “MacArthur Park” is a delightfully peculiar choice, but it also doesn’t feel earned, just inserted just for the sake of having another musical number.</p><p>I might have rose-colored glasses on for the original <em>Beetlejuice</em>, which I grew up watching as a kid, but sitting through <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> felt like going to an amusement park as a grown-up: the rides are now worn and clunky and you just want to get off. <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em> is all flashing lights and bright colors, but little substance. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Concord, Sony's floundering 5v5 hero shooter, has now officially gone offline just two weeks after its PS5 and PC launch - its short life abruptly ending with an undignified "error" message.
</p>
<p>
Concord was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-exclusive-pvp-shooter-concord-is-firewalk-studios-first-game">unveiled last May</a> as part of former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">optimistically expansive push into live-service gaming</a>. Unfortunately for Sony and developer Firewalk Studios, Concord's launch this August failed to make much of an impact - player numbers were less-than-stellar, and subsequent reports claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">only around 25,000 copies had been sold</a>.
</p>
<p>
Still, it was a bit of a shock when Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">announced it was pulling the plug on Concord</a> earlier this week so soon after release, Firewalk admitting "our initial launch didn't land" and confirming Concord would be taken offline today. And its life - in its current guise, at least - is now officially at an end; servers went down a little before 7pm this evening in the UK, presenting players with nothing more than a terse "error" message and instructions on how to refund the game.

<p>
Over on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConcordGame/comments/1fal8r5/concord_servers_are_officially_closed/?rdt=39465">game's subreddit</a>, though, Concord's community team shared a more heartfelt message, writing, "On behalf of everyone at Firewalk, thank you for all of your support. We are deeply thankful for those of you who spent your time with us, made memories, and learned what it means to be a Freegunner." It also noted the game's Discord server will remain open, although changes will be made to "streamline the conversation".

As to whether Concord still has a future, that remains unclear. Firewalk previously said it would "determine the best path ahead" and "explore options" following the game's closure, suggesting it might one day return in an overhauled form. Concord's demise won't, however, impact its appearance in Amazon's upcoming animated video game anthology series Secret Level, according to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-will-reportedly-remain-in-amazons-upcoming-secret-level-anthology-series-despite-recent-shutdown">recent report</a> - so there'll be one last opportunity to say goodbye.

<p>Following the immense success of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2’s advanced access launch, which garnered <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-already-has-over-130000-concurrent-players-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 130,000 players in a single day</a>, people have their eyes on the studio behind the game. Who is Saber Interactive? What other games did the Space Marine 2 developer create? Let’s dive in and find out!</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-saber-interactive">Who is Saber Interactive?</h2>



<p>Saber Interactive is an American video game developer founded in 2001 by Andrey Iones, Mathew Karch, and Anton Krupkin. Today, they employ more than 1,350 people and work on numerous projects, including Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando, and RoadCraft.</p>



<p>Back in the day, the studio handcrafted a 3D game engine for its first title, Will Rock, before moving on to TimeShift in 2007.</p>



<p>In 2016, the studio expanded outside its internal studio in Russia to Madrid, Sweden, and Belarus. Since then, with immense success, they’ve partnered with 343 Industries, CD Projekt RED, and numerous other high-profile developers and publishers in the industry.</p>







<h2 id="h-other-games-from-the-space-marine-2-developer">Other Games From the Space Marine 2 Developer</h2>



<p>While reading the history behind a competent and much-lauded game development studio is always fun, we know you’re mostly curious about the other video games under its belt. Here are a few of the most notable titles from the Space Marine 2 developer:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance (Switch Port)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Expeditions: A MudRunner Game</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gloomhaven</strong></li>



<li><strong>World War Z: Aftermath</strong></li>



<li><strong>SnowRunner</strong></li>



<li><strong>Evil Dead: The Game</strong></li>



<li><strong>Vampyr</strong> <strong>(Switch Port)</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>They also have several upcoming titles, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando</strong></li>



<li><strong>RoadCraft</strong></li>



<li><strong>Jurassic Park Survival</strong></li>



<li><strong>Descent</strong></li>



<li><strong>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Remake</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Word is they’re also working on an untitled Painkiller game! Do you remember the frantic first-person shooter franchise Painkiller?</p>

                <p>Remedy recently announced that a coming update for Alan Wake will <a href="https://x.com/alanwake/status/1831739167392272866" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remove</a> the classic David Bowie song Space Oddity from the game, replacing it with the original song Strange Moons, penned by Remedy composer Petri Alanko. However, it seems that this update will not affect Alan Wake Remastered, which came out in 2021.</p><p>Arguably one of Bowie's best-known songs, the galactic rock song that features the iconic line "ground control to Major Tom" originally played over Alan Wake's closing credits.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Alan Wake Full Story Recap</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Music licenses often cause game developers to have to update or even delist their games years after release due to expiring legal contracts. Perhaps the best-known recent example is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spec-ops-the-line-delisting-reason-revealed-director-comments-on-removal/1100-6520743/">Spec Ops: The Line</a>, which was delisted from Steam due to "several partnership licenses related to the game…expiring." While it's not clear if these are related to music licenses, it's a shame that one of the most critically acclaimed shooters of the early 2010s is no longer available for the next generations of players to enjoy. Alan Wake 2's latest DLC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2-night-springs-dlcs-genre-bending-trailer-reveals-surprise-launch-this-week/1100-6524028/">Night Springs</a>, released back in June.</p><p dir="ltr">Remedy recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-and-annapurna-strike-a-deal-to-expand-control-and-alan-wake-franchises/1100-6526191/" data-ref-id="1100-6526191">struck a deal</a> with Annapurna to co-finance and self-publish Control 2, and that may result in the production of films or TV shows based on the Control and Alan Wake franchises.</p>

The company </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/09/rdc-2024-robloxs-next-frontier">announced</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that developers making "paid access experiences" (think premium games) on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will soon be able to earn a higher revenue share than developers making free-to-play games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This increase applies to games that are purchased with "real currency value" on desktop. If you make a game priced at $9.99, $29.99, or $49.99, your revenue share will respectively rise to 50 percent, 60 percent, and 70 percent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company says it has plans to expand the increase to "other supported devices" in the future.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The announcement is packed in the middle of a slew of other economic updates, including an upcoming partnership with Shopify and a new creator affiliate program that will reward </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developers that bring new users to the platform. A specific revenue-share increase for premium developers is worthy of pause however, as it could mark a major shift in what developers make on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Premium games understandably have struggled on newer platforms that also facilitate free-to-play games supported by ads or microtransactions. After all, especially for a younger-skewing audience, nothing beats "free" when it comes to trying out a game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That means </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developers have had plenty of incentive to push for retention-driving features and eschew other types of games that aren't as economically viable. The fact that all transactions were first processed through </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s premium currency Robux didn't help either.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, being able to take up to 70 percent of the revenue from someone buying your game brings the platform close to (but not fully, with those lower rates for cheaper games) in parity with revenue share on Steam, Xbox, PlayStation, and the Nintendo store.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Do these changes address concerns developers have with ">Do these changes address concerns developers have with <span>Roblox</span>?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Changes like this could go a long way to addressing concerns developers have had with how Roblox Corporation splits revenue with developers. Those working in the free-to-play space won't benefit from this change right away, but now developers could consider spinning up studios to make premium games with a more reliable business model in mind.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, developers worried about the platform's ability to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-roblox-employees-are-worried-it-isn-t-doing-enough-to-stop-child-predators">protect young players</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from abusers and predators won't find any major news in today's RDC announcements.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
