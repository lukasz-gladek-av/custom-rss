		<p>Nintendo has announced an end to their My Nintendo Gold Points reward scheme, ending what was a nice little cashback bonus for purchases on the eShop in the run up to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launch.</p>
<p>From 25th March 2025, you will no longer earn Gold Points when making digital purchases from the eShop or when redeeming download codes. After that point, you’ll have up to 12 months from the date you earned any points to spend them on the eShop.</p>


<p>There’s further exceptions to this cut off date, as any physical games that were released prior to 25th March will still have a Gold Points redemption available to them for up to 2 years from their original release date. Any digital pre-orders placed before 25th March will also award points at the time that the purchase is completed – cancelling a pre-order will obviously exclude you from earning those points.</p>
<p>For full details, <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/news/7db7f9327a48ec83">visit the My Nintendo announcement.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/08/youll-soon-be-able-to-use-my-nintendo-gold-points-in-the-nintendo-switch-eshop/">Introduced back in 2018</a>, Nintendo Gold Points award 5% of the amount you pay when purchasing digital content, and 1% redeemed from physical games, which can then be used to fund further purchases of digital software and DLC via the eShop. It’s been a great incentive over the past 7 years, putting a few coins back into your pocket and encouraging you to keep spending and/or subsidising that next big game launch.</p>

<p>Nintendo has decided to cancel the programme practically on the eve of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">the Nintendo Switch 2’s reveal</a> and expected release. With rumours that Nintendo could push for higher game prices, and the huge player base that the Switch has going into the console transition, this kind of scheme isn’t needed anymore – it was a sweetener to help fuel platform growth after the disappointment of the Wii U.</p>
<p>Other rumours and speculation suggest that Nintendo could also be planning for a price increase for Nintendo Switch Online, and it’s entirely possible that they reconsider or restrict <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Nintendo-Switch-Online/Exclusive-benefits/Exclusive-benefits-Nintendo-Switch-Online-2719183.html">the Switch game vouchers benefit for subscribers</a>, which allows you to spend £84 to get two vouchers for certain first party and exclusive games.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Mario’s been spotted running around in a pair of swimming short on his way to a McDuck-like vault filled with all those gold coins he no longer needs to share!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/karma-the-dark-world-to-launch-next-month-on-ps5-and-pc-will-support-ps5-pro/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Wired Productions and Shanghai-based indie developer Pollard Studio have announced the release date of <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-in-a-trilogy-of-trailers-released-for-karma-the-dark-world-paying-homage-to-david-lynch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARMA: The Dark World</a>. The upcoming first-person psychological thriller game will be available on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010911/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a> and PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1376200/KARMA_The_Dark_World/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/karma_the_dark_world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-dark-world-karma-3921c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>) starting March 27, priced at $24.99. Pre-orders will be able to enjoy a 10% discount on either platform, and owners of a prior Wired Productions title on Steam can get an extra 10% off.</p>
<p>The game will also be enhanced on PlayStation 5 Pro thanks to full-featured PSSR integration, which will enhance image quality, definition, and texture clarity—along with improved reflections and distance rendering—providing what is being described as 'rock solid 60fps performance' at 4K resolution. An Xbox version is also being developed and will launch later.</p>
<p>Leo Zullo, Managing Director at Wired Productions, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Wired Productions has always championed storytellers who push the boundaries and craft compelling narratives. Yonghe Wang and Pollard Studio team have raised the bar and have delivered a rollercoaster assault on the senses, in an abstract, surreal, dark yet hauntingly beautiful cinematic gaming masterpiece. If Kojima, Christopher Nolan and the late and great David Lynch ever had the chance to work on a project from China, KARMA: The Dark World might just be the end result.</em></p>

<p>KARMA: The Dark World is a first-person psychological thriller game set in a dystopian alternate East Germany in 1984. In this time and place, the Leviathan Corporation rules with an iron fist, controlling its citizens through mass surveillance, social class rules, mind-altering drugs and the promise that the gates to utopia will open for those who serve.</p>
<p>Players will become Daniel McGovern, a Roam Agent for Leviathan's Thought Bureau. Using advanced technology to enter the minds of the accused, they will investigate crime scenes, interview suspects, and report their findings back to Leviathan.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gold-point-scheme-ending-march</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-gold-points-reward-scheme-to-end-in-march.1112067/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gold-point-scheme-ending-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that its Gold Points reward scheme will be coming to an end in March, but you'll still be able to spend the points you've accrued after the closing date.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/news/7db7f9327a48ec83" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official announcement</a> on its website, the Japanese gaming giant says you'll no longer earn Gold Points for Switch purchases after March 25th. However, since Gold Points expire twelve months after purchase, any you have left over will still be valid until a year after you acquired them.</p>

<p>Naturally, this means that not only will you not be able to earn Gold Points through buying games on Switch, but you also won't get them through Nintendo's website or through redeemed download codes anymore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-gold-points-ending-cycle.jpg?itok=sj9DujkX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-gold-points-ending-cycle.jpg?itok=rKUvpCaw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo's Gold Point scheme is coming to an end soon.</figcaption></figure><p>If you pre-order anything via the Nintendo eShop prior to March 24th, you'll still earn the Gold Points for that pre-order, even if the payment is processed after March 25th.</p>

<p>However, if you cancel that pre-order, then you won't get Gold Points anymore, even if you re-up your pre-order at some point later down the line. Bear that in mind if you're umming and ahhing about one of your pre-orders right now.</p>

<p>Nintendo confirms later in the announcement post that you'll still be able to spend your Gold Points for up to a year after you get them, even if you're spending them after the cutoff date. You just won't earn any more from that point onwards.</p>

<p>No reason is given in the post for Nintendo's decision to end the Gold Point scheme, but I'm assuming that it has something to do with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">impending arrival of the Switch 2</a>, which may bring a scheme that replaces Gold Points with it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-gold-points.jpg?itok=1ivxFvzf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-gold-points.jpg?itok=_xII6sKn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch 2's arrival is imminent, which could have something to do with the discontinuation of Gold Points.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're not aware of Gold Points, they're a reward scheme by which you earn points for certain Switch games or other software you buy. You can then use those points to get discounts on future store purchases.</p>

<p>If you're thinking of buying anything on Switch, it's probably best to do it before March 25th so you can get your hands on those sweet, sweet Gold Points. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Another small patch for VALORANT has been deployed, with patch 10.03 giving the minimap a visual upgrade and updating the effect of slow abilities. The smaller patch size is due to the soon-to-start <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-masters-bangkok-2025-teams-schedule-prize-pool-where-to-watch/">Masters Bangkok event</a>, and the patch will deploy a day later than usual due to a Riot holiday.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-valorant-10-03-patch-notes">Full VALORANT 10.03 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>The slowing abilities of Chamber, Skye, and Harbor will now slow dash abilities. Dash abilities include Jett’s Tailwind and Neon’s Slide. Previously, agents like Jett and Neon could dash at full speed even if they were caught by a slow, but now <strong>slowing abilities will slow a dash by 50 percent</strong>. These abilities now all slow dashes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Chamber’s Trademark</li>



<li>Skye’s Trailblazer</li>



<li>Harbor’s Cascade and High Tide</li>



<li><a href="https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/Status_Effect#Concuss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concussive</a> abilities:
<ul>
<li>Astra’s Nova Pulse</li>



<li>Breach’s Fault Line and Rolling Thunder</li>



<li>Cypher’s Trapwire</li>



<li>Deadlock’s Sonic Sensor</li>



<li>Gekko’s Wingman</li>



<li>Harbor’s Reckoning</li>



<li>Neon’s Relay Bolt</li>



<li>Tejo’s Special Delivery</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>The minimap visuals have been updated, providing “increased gameplay clarity and fidelity.” The minimap now uses shading to clearly show elevated spots across the whole map, as well as ziplines.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-valorant-patch-10-03-bug-fixes">VALORANT Patch 10.03 Bug Fixes</h2>



<ul>
<li>Fixed issues where explosive damaging utility could kill sentinel trap abilities like Vyse’s Arc Rose from vastly outside its intended radius.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where you could not move/use the buy menu while the remake vote screen is displayed. This new voting widget also color corrects the confirmation button to be green and the decline button to be red.</li>



<li><strong>(Console):</strong> You can now add and edit friend notes for your Riot friends.
<ul>
<li>You can use the friends list search field to filter your friends list by player name or tag.</li>



<li>When you have more than four party invites, the friends list will now hide them so you can still see your friends. You can click ‘Show More’ to display any hidden invites.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>(Console): </strong>Fixed an issue where Remake-ended matches in Competitive queue would display incorrect end-of-game screens after the game.</li>



<li><strong>(Console): </strong>Fixed an issue where navigating players on the Leaderboard would sometimes highlight multiple players.</li>



<li><strong>(PC): </strong>Fixed an issue on the Premier tournament bracket screen where match score was occasionally displayed in black.</li>



<li><strong>PC: </strong>Fixed an issue where the Premier tournament bracket was not properly centered on some ultrawide displays.</li>
</ul>

replace the outgoing service. As for why Nintendo is discontinuing the loyalty program, it hasn't given a concrete answer yet in its official announcement.</p><p>One possible reason here could be the upcoming launch of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2 console</a>, as Nintendo might be looking to gain as much financial momentum as possible when its Switch successor arrives. The Switch 2 is already generating an impressive amount of hype, so it's likely that Nintendo doesn't need to incentivize people to purchase games for the system during this initial launch period.</p><p>For a closer look at the console, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/now-we-know-exactly-when-switch-2-nintendo-direct-is-happening/1100-6529256/">Switch 2 Direct is scheduled for April 4</a> and Nintendo will also host global <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-to-try-the-switch-2-before-its-released/1100-6528849/">Switch 2 Experience events</a> to give people hands-on time with the device.</p>

			<p>The latest versions of the Unreal Engine 5 feature systems designed to prevent shader compilation issues, but they reportedly don't work well without additional work from developers.</p>
<p>During their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry went over a recent <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/tech-blog/game-engines-and-shader-stuttering-unreal-engines-solution-to-the-problem">blog post</a> shared by Epic on the Unreal Engine official website detailing why shader caching stuttering issues occur, highlighting how the shader compilation process designed in the past reached a breaking point in Direct3D 11 with the increase in shader code, and how it was addressed in modern APIs like Direct3D 12 and Vulkan with the introduction of PSOs, Pipeline State Objects, which opened up a lot of other issues, even in Unreal Engine despite the engine providing solutions for developers to compile PSOs so that game performance isn't impacted which continue to be worked on and improved. The blog post also addresses the misconception that shader compilation stuttering issues were introduced in DirectX 12, as they are a result of the increased shader code and general complexity, rather than anything the API has introduced over the previous version.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, these systems Epic introduced to reduce stuttering issues reportedly don't function as intended without developers' intervention. According to what technically-minded developers have told Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia, these systems don't work properly from Unreal Engine 5.1 to 5.4 and require specialized work to actually make them function as intended. Still, Digital Foundry found what Epic has outlined in the blog post, such as addressing Global Shaders issues which cause a lot of issues in a lot of games, and working with hardware and software vendors to adapt drivers and graphics APIs very promising, so hopefully, future versions of the engine will provide better experiences on PC than the current versions do.</p>

<p>The latest version of Unreal Engine 5 is version 5.5, which introduces an experimental new feature dubbed the Nanite of lights called <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-5-megalights-performance-improvements/">MegaLights</a>, Sequencer improvements, and much more. You can learn more about this version of the game engine on its <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-5-is-now-available">official website.</a></p>

            <p>Wizards of the Coast has unveiled the first four of its forthcoming Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy cards, and confirmed legendary artist Yoshitaka Amano is involved.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy crossover will launch on 13th June and consists of four decks based on Final Fantasies 6, 7, 10, and 14. It's the lead card from each of these decks that's now been revealed: Terra, Cloud, Tidus, and Y'shtola.</p>
<p>Each deck will consist of 100 cards, including both reprints of existing cards with new Final Fantasy art and brand new cards, and will tell the story of that particular Final Fantasy game.</p>

<p>"Final Fantasy games are so rich with flavor, beloved characters, and unique settings that choosing a single game as the theme provided more than enough material to design a full deck of cards around," Magic's senior game designer Daniel Holt told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers">IGN</a>. "Approaching each deck as a single game also provided the opportunity to dive deep into the lore of each, capturing even more beloved moments from across the game's storyline that we may not have been able to achieve otherwise."</p>
<p>Holt said the development team has "so many passionate Final Fantasy fans", with the four games partially chosen because they're favourites among the team. However, each brought its own unique challenges in adaptation. For instance, how will the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> deck balance the original game with its Remake trilogy?</p>
<p>"Our core approach to Final Fantasy 7 was to capture the original PS1 game's narrative, while using <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>'s modern aesthetics to push the fidelity of each character design, story moment, and memorable location to the next level," said principal narrative game designer Dillon Deveney. "With that in mind, if a scene existed in both games, we had our choice of showing it as the original game did, how the modern version interpreted it, or a unique fusion of both. Hopefully, this deck feels familiar and nostalgic to players of both the original game and the modern series!"</p>

<p>And while each deck has the lead character from each game as its Commander, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> is an MMORPG without an equivalent lead.</p>
<p>"For Y'shtola, it came down to a mix of popularity of the character as well as being a spellcaster, her story and character development offered a wide range of abilities and moments to pull from to lead the deck," said Holt, adding the deck specifically reflects her story arc in expansion Shadowbringers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the official Magic: The Gathering account stated the crossover has "brought together esteemed artists from around the world" - and confirmed legendary Final Fantasy artist Yoshitaka Amano is involved.</p>

<p>More details on the crossover are expected later today, with a reveal on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/magic">Magic: The Gathering Twitch channel</a> at 10am PT (that's 6pm UK time).</p>
<p>All four decks will be available individually as a regular version (MSRP $69.99) or as a collector's edition (MSRP $149.99).</p>
<p>This isn't the first time a video game has been adapted into Magic cards, following the likes of Fallout, Tomb Raider, and Assassin's Creed in recent years.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-announces-magic-the-gathering-film-and-tv-series-wants-it-to-be-the-next-cinematic-universe">Hasbro announced a Magic: The Gathering film and TV series</a>, which it aims to be a "multimedia universe that thrills longstanding fans and creates a broad wave of new ones".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you are looking for a recommendation, I played The Past Within with fellow Eurogamer puzzle enthusiast Matt, and rather enjoyed my time with it. In fact, Matt and I called it an "imaginative co-op experience that demands communication and teamwork, and conjures something memorable and unique as a result," in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-past-within-review-rewarding-co-op-teamwork-with-a-fascinating-spin">Eurogamer's The Past Within review</a>.</p>
<p>I was also taken with Little Kitty, Big City (in my opinion, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-campfires-unexpected-cat-games-and-northern-lights">it was a better 'cat game' than Stray</a>) and Nobody Saves the World.</p>

You earn back five percent of the amount you spend on games as this store currency, which can then be used to get money off further purchases on the eShop. So if you spent $60 on a new title, you’d usually receive $3 into your account. Which might not sound like a <em>huge </em>amount, until the next time you’re browsing the store to look at indie games on sale and realize you can have the one that takes your eye for free! It makes buying things on the Nintendo console store feel directly rewarding, in contrast to the more intangible offers from Microsoft of Sony.</p><p>Which makes it really odd that it’s coming to an end. Gold Points you already have will continue to work as before—they’re valid for 12 months after you receive them, and you’ll still be able to use them for discounts until the last possible date, March 24, 2026. You can also still receive them until that March 24, 2025 date, on any digital or physical purchases you make. Further, physical games published ahead of the deadline will still be redeemable, even after March 24.</p><p>There’s no information regarding whether Gold Points will be redeemable against Switch 2 games on that device’s store.

<p>Nightreign incorporates a lot of what made the original so special. But one element players fight tooth and nail over is each other. I’m here to tell you if Elden Ring Nightreign features any PVP or if it’s solely PVE.</p>



<p>I got to experience the debut <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/after-technical-problems-more-elden-ring-nightreign-test-sessions-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign Network Test</a>. I was blown away by how incredible it was and how much it differs from Elden Ring. It looks the same on the surface, but the overall feel, speed, and complexity make it a tough and tantalizing proposition.</p>



<p>You’re encouraged to team up, traverse The Lands Between, and take down familiar FromSoftware bosses. But some players want a break from AI to take on real people. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> having PVP would scratch this painful itch, so let’s see if it’s possible.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-pvp-in-elden-ring-nightreign">Can You PVP in Elden Ring Nightreign?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No time for PVP right now. Credit to FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign doesn’t include any PVP and the only combat in the game is played out in classic PVE fashion with human players against enemy AI.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, if you’re big into PVP, Nightreign might not be the Souls game for you. In an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with IGN</a>, game director Junya Ishizaki talked a lot about Nightreign and what the team wants to accomplish with it.</p>



<p>The topic of PVP came up when interviewer Tristan Ogilvie asked: “Are there any other sort of modes planned, like a PvP battle royale or anything like that?” Ishizaki responded: “<strong>Currently there are no plans</strong>. We wanted to first and foremost concentrate on this three-player co-op experience. So that’s the main focus for now.”</p>



<p>Nightreign will launch with no PVP features unless something changes between now and launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-pvp-be-added-to-elden-ring-nightreign">Will PVP be Added to Elden Ring Nightreign?</h2>



<p><strong>There’s no confirmation from FromSoftware about adding PVP to Elden Ring Nightreign in the future but never say never.</strong></p>



<p>Alluding to the IGN interview above, Junya Ishizaki was quoted saying “<strong>Currently</strong>” when it came to PVP ideas. This doesn’t mean the developer won’t look to add PVP in a future update. The sole focus is on delivering a complete and coherent three-player experience with working functionality.</p>



<p>But we know more content is going to be available at launch. Furthermore, additional content is arriving post-launch. PVP may eventually get added if the team can implement it effectively.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for any further updates on Elden Ring Nightreign’s PVP status.</p>



<hr>



<p>Check out the latest Elden Ring Nightreign details and questions including if you can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-with-two-players-or-solo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play it Solo or with two players</a>.</p>



<p>Can Nightreign be the start of something special for the Souls genre? Or are you hoping this is a one-and-done deal for FromSoftware so it can move on to a new project?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Insider Gaming sources have said that the publisher and the developers are now confident that Assassin’s Creed Shadows will launch on March 20, 2025.</p>



<p>Of course, never say never of another delay, but Ubisoft has made preparations to increase its marketing of Assassin’s Creed Shadows ahead of its March 20, 2025 launch, including finalising the embargo dates for the games review.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows reviews will be live on March 18, 2025.</p>



<p>Speaking with several developers working on the game, they said that they felt confident that it will be ready for its March release date, with one source stating that the game is now “pretty much done”.</p>



<p>As mentioned during Ubisoft’s latest earnings call, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-preorders-in-line-with-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadows is currently on par with that of Assassins Creed Odyssey</a> in terms of its pre-order numbers. “Early previews have been positive, praising its narrative and immersive experience, with both characters playing critical roles in the game’s storyline, as well as the quality and complementarity of the gameplay provided by the dual protagonist approach,” Guillemot said in the most recent earnings call.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Shadows currently has around 300,000 pre-orders, said sources and Odyssey’s day one player numbers were between 400-450,000; a gap of around 100-150,000 that needs to be made up in the next four weeks.</p>



<p>In comparison, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-sales-1-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws, a game that failed to meet Ubisoft’s expectations</a> had less than half the pre-orders Shadows currently has in the same time period before launch, it was said.</p>



<p>Looking at the data, if Shadows continues the same trajectory as Odyssey throughout launch, it’s estimated that the game could sell approximately 3.5 million units in its first month. Valhalla, which was the series’ most successful Assassin’s Creed game had some eight million players in its first month, with more than 65% being attributed to past-generation consoles at the time.</p>

this content!</p></div><p>While Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will primarily stick to the gameplay of the original PS2 game, you can expect several enhancements and quality-of-life changes.</p><p>First off, you'll be able to choose between playing the game with modern controls in a modern third-person action game format <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-will-let-you-play-the-game-with-its-original-ancient-controls/1100-6524131/" data-ref-id="1100-6524131">or you can opt for a setup closer to the original game</a> that comes with a traditional MGS top-down viewpoint. Players can also change their equipped camouflage on the fly with a quick-select button.</p><p>On a technical level, the shift to Unreal Engine 5 has also allowed Konami to overhaul the animations of Snake Eater as part of its modernization efforts.</p><p>"At the early stages, we had planned on only overhauling the graphics to modern standards, but we just didn’t think it would be satisfying to play if that was the only update, so in the end we remade nearly all the animations, and found ways to refresh almost every facet of the game, as well as fully realizing elements that were held back by technical limitations at the time of the original," series producer Noriaki Okamura said in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-2025-on-ps5/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>.</p><p>The original voiceover recordings from Snake Eater on PS2 have been kept for the remake, but some new lines have been recorded.</p><p>"We're using all the original voice performances, but there are some lines where characters teach you the controls that really don't match anymore," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-features-a-few-new-lines-from-snake-eaters-original-cast/1100-6524174/" data-ref-id="1100-6524174">Okamura explained in a 2024 interview</a>. "So we actually did get the original actors to re-record just those. Plus, back then, twenty years ago, we actually had to compress the voice acting down a lot to fill all that audio. Today, we aren't as limited. We don't have to compromise as much on formats and compression, so we can actually have those performances in even higher quality."</p><h2>What does Metal Gear Solid Delta mean?</h2><p>Confused by the use of that Greek symbol? The <a href="https://twitter.com/Metalgear/status/1661550418357534721">official Metal Gear Twitter account</a> explained that the Delta symbol was chosen because its meaning "fits the concept" of the remake project. "Delta means change or difference without changing structure," according to the account.</p><h2>Is Hideo Kojima involved in Metal Gear Solid Delta?</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHTXRjuPJA4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jHTXRjuPJA4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Hideo Kojima and his key collaborators have no involvement with Delta. In an interview with <a href="https://za.ign.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/176621/news/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-devs-on-whether-kojima-is-involved-and-why-they-picked-this-game" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>, Konami confirmed that Metal Gear Solid 3 director Hideo Kojima and his frequent artistic collaborator Yoji Shinkawa, who helped establish the signature design of the Metal Gear Solid series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-isnt-involved-in-the-metal-gear-solid-3-remake-konami-confirms/1100-6514670/" data-ref-id="1100-6514670">are not involved with the remake</a>.</p><p>"They are not involved," a Konami spokesperson said. "However, the development team will work hard to create this remake and also the ports--for Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection--so that they can be enjoyed on multiple platforms by even more players all around the world."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-expected-to-leave-konami-after-mgs5-inside-/1100-6426024/">After Kojima and Konami split ways</a> during the development of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, Konami began distancing itself and the series from Kojima. It even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lawyers-reportedly-block-metal-gear-solid-creator-/1100-6432799/">blocked him from accepting an award</a> in person for The Phantom Pain at The Game Awards in 2015.</p><p>If there is one positive takeaway from the reveal trailer, it's that this cinematic teaser has a <em>lot </em>of references to Snake Eater throughout it. While it might look like a BBC documentary that explains how the food chain works, you can see references to Shagohod, The End's faithful companion, and even a codec conversation about giant ants.</p>

			<p>Being a huge fan of the Monster Hunter series, rumors of FromSoftware working on a similar experience based on Elden Ring got me quite excited. When Elden Ring Nightreign was <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/">announced</a>, however, I have to admit I wasn't particularly excited about the little that was shown, as I felt that the trademark FromSoftware gameplay mechanics, like the weighty combat and in-depth exploration, weren't really a good fit for a game that looked to be all about exploring maps as quickly as possible to power-up and survive the final boss encounter. The more I learned about the game, the more I felt this co-op venture could be a fun little game to play every now and then before getting abandoned in favor of meatier experiences.</p>
<p>After playing the game's Closed Network Test, however, I realized how wrong I was. FromSoftware isn't just combining its trademark gameplay mechanics with co-op and roguelike mechanics, it is doing so masterfully to deliver an experience that has a lot of potential and could really shine with some tweaks based on the feedback from these pre-release tests.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Elden-Ring-Nightreign-01-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The basics of Elden Ring Nightreign are really straightforward. From the iconic Roundtable Hold, players can decide to undertake expeditions with three other players, picking one of four Nightfarers, which will become eight in the launch version, all coming with unique special abilities, before getting thrown into one of the game's maps, where they need to survive for three days. At the end of the third day, the squad will get to fight one of the main bosses and will be rewarded with relics that represent the game's permanent upgrade system, which improves characters with a variety of different perks. Relics can also be obtained if the squad fails to get to the third day and defeat the final boss, so players still get something for taking part in expeditions.</p>
<p>On paper, winning a game doesn't sound too difficult, but in reality, Elden Ring Nightreign does its very best to prevent players from reaching the final night. At the start of a game, all characters start with very weak equipment and must obtain better weapons and gear by clearing locations on the map or defeating minor bosses to be able to take on even more challenges, all the while discovering Sites of Graces which automatically restore the character's HP and FP, the latter used to perform Weapon Skills, as well as Flask charges and level up once enough Runes have been obtained. All of this would still have been easy enough, especially with a competent team that sticks together, if it weren't for the time limit for each day, which is represented by a blue circle that gets smaller and smaller as time goes by. At some point, the circle will become very small, indicating that the squad should quickly head over to the location indicated by a tree icon on the interface to fight the night's boss and move on to the following day. All in all, despite the wrenches the game launches, it is a much more straightforward experience than the base game, which is quite simple to understand after a couple of games.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Elden Ring Nightreign features some roguelike mechanics which come into full force as soon as a game begins. All the weapons and perks that can be obtained are randomly generated, forcing players to make decisions that will shape their builds on the fly. As of the Closed Network Test version, the game features a very good number of weapons coming with different quality levels, but many of them feel too much like others, often having only the Weapon Skill to differentiate them, leading to some bloat in this regard.</p>
<p>I feel fewer weapons that are better differentiated would work better, considering the game wants players to move quickly from one place to another without spending too much time thinking about which weapon to pick, something that is clearly highlighted not only by the fast traversal speed of all characters, the lack of fall damage and the chance to get invaded at any time randomly by some powerful bosses, such as Margit the Fell Omen, who is just as annoying in Elden Ring Nightreign as he is for Elden Ring new players the first time they encounter him. With these variables, death is always behind the corner, but, in true FromSoftware fashion, it is not the end, as it is possible to get revived by other players for a short amount of time. If the other players fail to revive a companion, the dead player will be sent back to the last Site of Grace for the price of all their Runes and one level, which can be restored by recovering them from where the player died.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Elden-Ring-Nightreign-02-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the chaotic experience of the Elden Ring Nightreign Closed Network Test was generally fun, especially when playing together with others who didn't strike off on their own (a death sentence in this game), it also highlighted some issues that must be addressed before launch for the experience to reach its full potential. The lack of duos matchmaking is a major oversight that will hopefully be changed in the launch version, considering how popular it is in other co-op games and how it should be more than viable in the game, especially to up the challenge level a bit if the current balance is kept. As of now, the vast majority of bosses are quite easy to take down, with only some exceptions, even at a low level, so if the balance doesn't change in the final release, playing the game with only one other companion could definitely make things more interesting, though I would prefer for the general challenge level to go up regardless.</p>
<p>The biggest issue that could make or break Elden Ring Nightreign, however, lies in how map variations will be handled. In the Network Test version, getting to the final boss in a game was pretty much a matter of collecting as many Flask upgrades as possible, which granted excellent survivability in the vast majority of scenarios, allowing some players to even explore outside the blue circle, which drains HP, using the Sites of Grace to restore HP and Flask charges as they went. As such, in one of the final testing sessions, pretty much everyone was pinning for the churches where the Flask upgrades are located, resulting in an experience that was becoming stale fast, no matter the picked Nightfarer or the randomized elements. I sincerely hope the final game will go all out regarding map variations, or the whole experience will turn into a rush toward Flask upgrades that will get boring very, very quickly.</p>
<p>Even though the experience wasn't perfect, the Closed Network Test&nbsp;<span>succeeded in making me excited about the unique take on the Souls gameplay formula featured in Elden Ring Nightreign. I am now really looking forward to trying out the game when it launches in <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late May.</a> Hopefully, FromSoftware will be able to address some of the CNT version issues by then</span>&nbsp;and fully realize the potential of the experience.</p>

            <p>I really, really like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/is-this-seat-taken">Is This Seat Taken?</a> It might just be that this logic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzler</a> sticks its thumb out noticeably from the omnipresent gaggle of post-roguelite survivalyptic soulsbuilder decklikes, but I suspect it's also down to the deeply satisfying bloopy twinkle that plays whenever you drop someone into a seat with your floating hand cursor.</p>
<p>You've got a limited number of seats and a bunch of jolly demand-os, and it's your job to make them all happy. "I want to sit with Bob". "I need a window seat". "I forgot to shower". "I do not like bad smells". So you quarantine the nostril bombers in the back of your limo, make sure everyone else is happy, and drive off to the next level. There, you'll take the role of a cinema usher. Some punters want to sit next to someone with popcorn so they can steal it, and some want to wear massive cowboy hats that block those behind them. It's all quite simple, but robust, and just thoughtful enough to lightly tickle your synapses, like a gentle grizzly bear wielding an illustrious peacock feather.</p>

<p>Here's what the Steam page - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035120/Is_This_Seat_Taken/">which also has a demo</a> - has to say:</p>
<blockquote>"Window seat or aisle? Booth or table? Lone wolf or life of the party? In Is This Seat Taken?, your mission is to organize groups of people according to their preferences. It’s a cozy, no-pressure logic puzzle game where you’re in charge of who sits where."</blockquote><p>

Here are some features, arranged in the correct order:

</p><blockquote><ul>
<li>Play seating matchmaker to please picky characters.</li>
<li>Discover each character’s unique traits—relatable, outlandish, and everything in between.</li>
<li>Piece together satisfying puzzles with no timers or leaderboards.</li>
<li>Unlock fun new scenarios as you progress—from bus rides to banquets!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I really enjoyed this one, as I said. I'm almost positive it's a very ancient of genre of game and/or basically an elaborate GCSE Maths test question, although I'm struggling to think of any comparisons off the top of my head. The world's first <em>Seatlike</em>? No, that's terrible. Either way, its nice to be surprised by something that also feels quite traditionally designed. No release date just yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Rockstar Games are considering letting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> players modify the game’s map by way of Roblox and Fortnite-style creation mechanics, according to a report. The idea is that people can make and sell their own “custom experiences”, as they do in those games - expanding upon the existing customisation opportunities in GTA Online. This might even extend to featuring real-world sponsors, rather than the parody versions of familiar brands we encounter in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>. 
</p>
<p>
All of that’s from <a href="https://digiday.com/media/rockstar-games-talks-with-top-metaverse-creators-with-an-eye-on-making-grand-theft-auto-the-next-creator-platform/">a Digiday article</a> that cites three anonymous industry sources “with knowledge” of meetings between Rockstar and certain popular Fortnite, Roblox and GTA Online creators. Apparently, they’ve been having “open-ended” discussions about “the potential to create custom experiences inside the upcoming game”. These experiences “would allow creators to modify the game’s environment and assets to bring their own intellectual property - and potentially their brand sponsors - into GTA’s virtual sandbox”, the article notes.
</p>
<p>
Why do all this, given Rockstar’s historically iffy relationship with those who attempt to mod their games? Because publishers always want to make more money, and because GTA 6 in particular is said to be mindbogglingly expensive. It’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/08/13/gta-6-cost-2-000-000-000-make-claims-leak-eight-times-gta-5-21413035/">rumoured</a> to have cost two billion dollars to date. Hence the pressure to add monetisation features.
</p>
<p>
The Digiday article includes some third party comment that puts a spotlight on FiveM, the immensely popular mod framework from CFX.re that lets people host their own GTA role-playing servers, and supports subscription access models. Rockstar used to be at war with CFX.re as part of their larger policy towards piracy: they <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-responds-to-grand-theft-auto-mod-ban-complaint/">banned</a> members of the modding team back in 2015 and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/take-two-reportedly-sent-private-investigators-to-modders-home/">reportedly</a> sent private investigators to somebody’s home. Then, in August 2023, they <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/8971o8789584a4/roleplay-community-update">announced</a> that they’d bought the CFX.re team and “expanded our policy on mods to officially include those made by the roleplay creative community.”
</p>
<p>
Digiday offer the FiveM arc as evidence that Rockstar are getting more into user-generated content platforms and Ye Olde Metaversing with GTA 6. All of which makes sense to me, though the developers and publisher Take-Two Interactive have yet to comment on the report at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-think-pc-is-of-increasing-importance-in-2025-but-still-wont-announce-the-magic-date">wait for a GTA 6 PC release date continues</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-with-two-players-or-solo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>FromSoftware games have always had an element of multiplayer. Elden Ring Nightreign also encourages this, but playing with two players is the dream for many duos. We’ve got the latest details on Nightreign’s party-formation features. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is a breath of fresh air from the minds at FromSoftware. This isn’t to say the company’s work is bad—not by a long shot—but Nightreign has a different feel. The take-your-time exploration of Elden Ring, Sekiro, and Bloodborne is replaced by frantic battling and a constant race to clear bosses and level up as fast as possible.</p>



<p>A typical lobby involves three of you wailing away at tanky foes. But let’s see if it’s possible to play Nightreign as just two players or even one.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-elden-ring-nightreign-two-player">Is Elden Ring Nightreign Two Player?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Three players might be advisable. Credit to FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign currently doesn’t permit you to play with two players.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-join-the-elden-ring-nightreign-network-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Network Test</a> gave us a glimpse into <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nightreign</a>‘s potential. However, we also learned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightreign is suited to a Trio</a>. This direction comes at the behest of game director Junya Ishizaki.</p>



<p>He explained: “The reason that we went with a three-player focus was that we wanted to retain that sense of accomplishment you get from battling a boss together or from conquering a map together and that sense of enjoyment, but we wanted to recreate that in a fresh way.”</p>



<h2 id="h-will-elden-ring-nightreign-add-a-two-player-mode">Will Elden Ring Nightreign Add a Two Player Mode?</h2>



<p>Junya Ishizaki has said even though the Network Test didn’t allow for two-player teams, FromSoftware is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-considering-allowing-just-two-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">considering allowing two players</a>.</p>



<p>“Regarding having just two players, not three players or Solo, <strong>it is something we are considering</strong>, but it is currently not in the game at the moment,” explained Ishizaki.</p>



<p>Technically, you can invite a friend and play a game of Nightreign together. But you still have to partner up with a third person to complete the matchmaking process. If the third person leaves for whatever reason, it becomes you and your friend battling as a duo!</p>



<p>We’re still a while out from Nightreign’s full release, so we’ll have to see if FromSoftware changes its mind before the anticipated launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">Can You Play Elden Ring Nightreign Solo?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Elden Ring Nightreign can be played Solo if you’re not up to having partners</strong>.</p>



<p>Even though you can’t in two-player, Solo is an option. I wouldn’t say it’s smart (or feasible) to play Nightreign on your own though, so tread carefully around The Lands Between. </p>



<hr>



<p>Will you be put off buying Elden Ring Nightreign if it debuts without a two-player mode? Or are you tough enough to take on the Nights on your own?</p>



<p>If you missed out on the initial test runs, fear not, more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/after-technical-problems-more-elden-ring-nightreign-test-sessions-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nightreign Test Sessions</a> may be coming to give you a chance to get involved.</p>

            <p>
Sony has confirmed its $10 upgrade offer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> Remastered won't apply to anyone who previously had the game's PS4 version via PlayStation Plus, disappointing some fans.
</p>
<p>
Days Gone on PS4 was previously part of the PS Plus Collection, during which time countless subscribers were able to access the game.
</p>
<p>
But, as has been the case with most previous PlayStation upgrades, anyone who simply played Days Gone via PS Plus will need to pay the full $50 price tag, rather than $10.

<p>
"I would've payed $10 for the upgrade just to try it out despite the fact that a remaster for this game is not necessary," wrote AdSevere4623 on reddit, in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1iok0hw/days_gone_remastered_game_redemptions_via_ps_plus/">lengthy thread full of complaints about the issue</a>.
</p>
<p>
"CD Projekt Red gives us free Witcher 3 PS5 upgrade so many years after release and Sony charges $50 if you have PS Plus version," added Mo-Skito.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this isn't the first time this situation has occured. 
</p>
<p>
Another game to offer an enhanced PS5 version with a paid-for upgrade is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> Intergrade. And again, you needed to actually own the PS4 version to be eligible. If you simply had access to Rebirth on PS4 via PlayStation Plus, you couldn't upgrade for less.
</p>
<p>
Things worked slightly differently with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, which was given away by Sony back during the era of Covid lockdowns. In this case, users with a free copy were then able to apply that game's $10 upgrade to access its PS5 version. But that was a license for the full game - rather than relying on a subscription to access it.
</p>
<p>
Still, some fans say the policy should change to be more akin to that of Xbox - where you can pay a modest amount to upgrade access to titles on Game Pass, and gain their deluxe edition.
</p>
<p>
Others, meanwhile, have pointed to the fact that you can buy DLC for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PS Plus games</a> - such as the Burning Shores DLC for Horizon Forbidden West. Is this add-on much different?
</p>
<p>
"This is as stupid as requiring someone to pay for the full game when purchasing a DLC for a PS+ game," CoolGur878 noted. "And, mind you, PS+ is not a free service."
</p>
<p>
In addition to having fancier visuals, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-definitive-edition-announced-for-pc-and-ps5">Days Gone Remastered will offer a new survival arcade mode named Horde Assault</a>, plus fresh permadeath and speedrun modes for the main game.
</p>
<p>
These extra contents for Days Gone Remastered will also be offered on PC, as a $10 DLC.
</p>
<p>
Days Gone developer was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">recently working on an under-wraps live-service game for PlayStation</a>, though this was reportedly cancelled following Concord's high-profile flop. It's unclear what the developer is putting together next.

We now know that the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">is set to launch in 2025</a>, but it will be released into a world that’s packed with very capable handheld gaming PCs that could present an interesting challenge to Nintendo, especially following news from CES 2025.</p><p>Valve’s Steam Deck kicked off the handheld gaming PC push in large part because its Linux-based SteamOS makes playing your games just about as easy as it is on consoles. That’s why one of the biggest CES announcements is that Valve is going to let people install SteamOS on other handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck">as soon as April</a>, potentially making the entire handheld PC gaming market a lot more appealing.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTQ5" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen">The Switch 2’s bigger screen is just what I wanted</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">finally revealed the Switch 2</a> — but it didn’t reveal everything. Even still, the new console looks pretty much like a bigger, more refined Switch. Sure, that’s the straightforward and expected move from Nintendo. But it’s also exactly what I’ve been waiting for.</p><p>The first Switch was a revelation. When it launched, I marveled over being able to play <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> on my TV and then take the console out of the dock and play in handheld mode curled up on the couch. Nintendo absolutely nailed the execution of combining its console and portable expertise into one great device, and ever since, the Switch has been a constant companion at home and while traveling.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjU2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24344511/nintendo-switch-2-features-specs-handheld-dock-upgrade-comparison">The Switch 2 is boring — and that’s exactly what Nintendo needs</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>You can always count on Nintendo for a surprise. This is the company that followed the Game Boy with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24242128/nintendo-ds-touchscreen-games-2004-launch">a strange dual-screened handheld</a> and broke out of its GameCube slump with a console focused on motion controls. It’s the company that lost its lead with the Wii U and then gambled on another innovation — the portable hybrid known as the Switch — to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718273/nintendo-2023-big-moment-mario-zelda">ultimately get back on top</a>. All of those were big, risky swings that seemingly exemplified the company’s playful, experimental ethos.</p><p>The Switch 2, on the other hand, is… <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">a bigger, better Switch</a>. It’s kind of boring. But it’s also exactly the right move from Nintendo. At a time when people expect their games and experiences to carry over between devices, the old console paradigm of starting over with a new generation doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. And since Nintendo hit a home run with the original Switch, it has the runway to be a little bit boring this time.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24344511/nintendo-switch-2-features-specs-handheld-dock-upgrade-comparison">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Whenever the Switch 2 comes out, it’ll have competition from handheld PCs.</p><p>As I wrote <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos">earlier this month</a>, “it will launch into a world that’s packed with very capable handheld gaming PCs that could present an interesting challenge to Nintendo.”</p><p>Yes, the Switch 2 will probably outsell most handheld gaming PCs by a wide margin.

Late last year, one such manufacturer, Dbrand, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">debuted its Killswitch carrying case meant for the Switch 2</a>.

Interestingly, OnLeaks and <em>91Mobiles</em> report that the screen will “most likely” be an “OLED panel” — previous reports have said the console would have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24051407/analyst-tips-8-inch-lcd-for-nintendo-switch-2">an LCD screen</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339979/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-renders-onleaks">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjcyOQ==" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">Is this the Nintendo Switch 2?</a></h2><div><p>Nintendo isn’t officially at CES, but it might have stolen the show anyway: accessory maker Genki brought a 3D-printed mockup of what it says is Nintendo’s Switch successor, and we got to hold it and take some high-resolution pictures.</p><p>Based on the mockup of what we’ll call the Switch 2, Nintendo’s next console appears to be wider than the original, with slightly larger Joy-Con controllers that seem like they’ll be more comfortable to hold.

<p>Nintendo released a notice today announcing the discontinuation of My Nintendo Gold Points.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through the My Nintendo reward program, players could earn Gold Points when purchasing digital Nintendo Switch games or DLC. The earned points could be used towards rewards and discounts on the My Nintendo Store and Nintendo eShop. However, after March 25, 2025, at 1:30, Gold Points will no longer be awarded on eligible purchases.</p>



<p>Fortunately, players can use Gold Points they have already earned for longer, as they are valid for 12 months after receipt. Moreover, there are some cases where Gold Points may be awarded after the discontinuation date; check them out below:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Players will earn Gold Points if they pre-order a downloadable product before the end of the bonus period.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Gold Points can be earned if players purchase a packaged version of software released before the expiration.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Also, suppose players purchase Nintendo Switch (OLED model) White/Customized, Nintendo Switch Customization, or Nintendo Switch Lite Yellow/Turquoise/Grey/Coral/Blue from the My Nintendo Store before the reward expiration date and time. In that case, they will be able to earn Gold Points after the shipping date. Check out more details about earning Gold Points after the discontinuation date <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2025/0218.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>
