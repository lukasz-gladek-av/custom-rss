            <p>Take-Two Interactive have sold their publishing label Private Division to an unnamed party, along with five of Private Division's "live and unreleased titles". The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> publisher have also finally confirmed that they have shut down OlliOlli World and Rollerdrome devs Roll7 together with Kerbal Space Program 2 creators Intercept Games, months after performing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skateboarding-studio-roll7-is-reportedly-being-closed-down-by-parent-company-take-two">mass</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kerbal-space-program-2-producer-confirms-mass-layoffs-contradicting-ceos-remarks">layoffs</a> at both studios.</p>
<p>"[W]e recently made the strategic decision to sell our Private Division label to focus our resources on growing our core and mobile businesses for the long-term," company president Karl Slatoff said in <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e938f73a-cfd7-46ac-b308-3f5b55acaeb7">an investor call last night</a>. "As part of this transaction, the buyer purchased our rights to substantially all of Private Division's live and unreleased titles." Take-Two are holding onto <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-rest-for-the-wicked-2024">No Rest For The Wicked</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulslikers-are-going-to-love-ori-studios-new-arpg-no-rest-for-the-wicked">Soulsy early access ARPG</a> from the makers of Ori And The Blind Forest. </p>
<p>"We are grateful for the contributions that the Private Division team has made to our company and are confident that they will continue to achieve success in their new home," Slatoff added.</p>
<p>There's a bit more on the reasoning here in this <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zelnick-on-private-division-sale-those-projects-were-smaller-were-in-the-business-of-big-hits">GamesIndustry.biz interview</a> with Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick. The short version is that cool dystopian rollerskating games and sprawling engineer sandboxes do not make enough cash.  </p>
<p>"We're really best at these big AAA experiences," he said. "We have the biggest intellectual properties in the interactive entertainment business, some of the biggest intellectual properties in the overall entertainment business and to make sequels to existing beloved franchises as well as to create new hit intellectual properties is our mission.</p><p>"The team of Private Division did a great job supporting independent developers and, almost to a one, every project they supported did well," Zelnick went on. "However, the scale of those projects was, candidly, on the smaller side, and we're in the business of making great big hits."</p>
<p>Take-Two have had "strong second quarter results" for their fiscal year 2025, something Zelnick largely attributes in this week's investor call to "the continued success of the Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands franchises" (Borderlands, you might recall, recently had a movie adaptation, which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-benefited-game-sales-despite-being-disappointing-flop-take-two-boss-says">"benefited" Borderlands game sales</a> despite being a load of old rope). Zelnick anticipates "record" performance in 2026 and 2027, driven by the release of GTA 6, which Take-Two still have pegged for console launch in 2025 despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-could-slip-to-2026-under-rockstar-fallback-plan-according-to-reports">rumours it might slip to 2026</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017, Private Division was Take-Two's attempt to build an audience for more economical and adventurous "triple-I" games that combine the gloss of a GTA with relatively eccentric mechanics or stories. Take-Two aren't the only company to cut back on smaller experiments of late. Last month, Ubisoft confirmed that they had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/most-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-devs-have-moved-to-other-projects-ubisoft-confirm-following-report-about-rejected-sequel-pitch">broken up the team responsible for the well-regarded Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> (there were no layoffs).</p>
<p>In the wake of stagnating growth brought on by over-ambitious expansion during the Covid lockdown years, the investor-facing mindset appears currently to be: if it's not Assassin's Creed or GTA-scale, what's the point?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut is the first major former PlayStation console exclusive to release on Xbox consoles, as the latest game developed by Kojima Production has launched on Microsoft's consoles today.</p>
<p>As announced on X, the first entry in the series, which will continue next year with a new game, is now available on Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and the Windows Store. To celebrate this launch, which was made possible by Kojima Productions <a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/20241107-317236/">reportedly now owning the IP</a> (Thanks, Automaton), the new version of the game will be available for 50% off the full price for the next two weeks. As of today, the open-world game by Kojima Production is also available on the Amazon <a href="https://luna.amazon.com/game/death-stranding-directors-cut/B0DL19P4JD?dm_i=74N0,SXSP,2EYVRT,3X552,1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luna + streaming service</a>.</p>

<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut is an enhanced version of the original PlayStation 4 release which launched in late 2019 worldwide. The new version of the game is undoubtedly the best way to experience Sam Bridge's story, as we highlighted in our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-directors-cut-ill-keep-coming/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Death Stranding Director‚Äôs Cut is without a doubt the best way to step into the shoes of Sam Bridges, at least for those that haven‚Äôt seen Kojima‚Äôs vision of a ruined America. What Kojima Productions brings to the PlayStation 5 are performance and additions that make the experience play better than ever, although what‚Äôs actually new to the game feels lacking compared to what‚Äôs come in other definitive Sony collections. With all of the additions and enhancements seamlessly integrated into the Director‚Äôs Cut, there‚Äôs little reason to consider playing the first draft of Hideo Kojima‚Äôs vision if you can get your hands on this new release.</em></p>
<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>The Final Fantasy VII PlayStation 5 Pro patch uses some of the console's features to deliver the best version of the game until the launch of the PC version.</p>
<p>From today, owners of the upgraded PS5 model will be able to enjoy the second entry in the remake project with a variety of improvements introduced by the 1.050 patch. The patch introduces <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Versatility Mode</a>, which targets 60 FPS like Performance Mode but offers a high resolution equivalent to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Im0BR2QmIk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graphics Mode</a> thanks to the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler. Additionally, the update uses the PlayStation 5 Pro High CPU Frequency Mode to offer a more stable framerate throughout the game.</p>
<p>Besides providing the details of the PlayStation 5 Pro patch, Square Enix also shared a few screenshots showcasing how Final Fantasy VII Rebirth looks on the system in Versatility Mode. You can check them out right below.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches worldwide today. With improved specs and the aforementioned PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, the system introduces improvements to over 50 titles that have already received their PS5 Pro patch. Even games that haven't received a dedicated patch can see improvements, as showcased by some <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-playstation-5-pro-test/">early tests</a> conducted earlier this week.</p>

Your immense love and interest mean everything to us. I was especially touched by the wonderful reception we received at gamescom, and it was incredible to see everyone creating such unique Zois during our 'inZOI: Character Studio' demo period.</blockquote><blockquote>Initially, we were uncertain about introducing 'Canvas' to the world, not knowing how many people would actually participate. However, the turnout was amazing, with an enormous number of uploads. Seeing so much engagement brought us immense happiness, and it was inspiring to see how deeply people connected with inZOI. Your feedback and insights made us realize the responsibility we have to provide players with the most complete experience possible.</blockquote><blockquote>This message is about that realization. After reviewing your feedback from inZOI: Character Studio and analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests, we have decided to release inZOI in Early Access on March 28, 2025. We apologize that we couldn't bring you the game sooner, but this decision reflects our commitment to giving inZOI the best possible start.</blockquote><blockquote>It's said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. The extra love and care required to nurture a child to adulthood is how I see our journey with inZOI ‚Äî a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. This change in our release date reflects our commitment to building a stronger foundation for inZOI, so we can embark on this journey in the best way possible.</blockquote><blockquote>Until the release date, we'll continue working to improve any areas that need attention, striving to create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation. Our goal is to deliver an experience fans can enjoy for a long time to come. We'll keep you updated on our development progress, and we hope you'll join us on this journey toward inZOI's Early Access and beyond.</blockquote><blockquote>With love,</blockquote><blockquote>Kjun</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-first-preview-beautiful-and-full-of-potential-but-still-a-bit-hollow"><u>In IGN's preview if Inzoi</u></a>, we said: "The game‚Äôs world is extremely beautiful but somewhat empty in motion, permeated by a lack of grounding lore."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>In addition to Xbox, the director's cut version of the game - described as the "definitive vision" of Death Stranding - is also available on PC and PS5. </p>
<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut "challenges players to reconnect a fractured society after the cataclysmic 'Death Stranding' event", the official blurb reads. "This has opened a doorway between the living and the dead, leading to creatures from the afterlife roaming the fallen world marred by a desolate society. Carrying the disconnected remnants of humanity‚Äôs future in his hands, players take the role of Sam Bridges as he embarks on a mission to deliver hope to humanity by connecting the last survivors of a decimated America."</p>
<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut on Series X/S includes support for Xbox Achievements. In addition, this version of the game also boasts features such as Photo Mode.</p>
<p>Those interested can scoop up Death Stranding Director's Cut for just ¬£18 on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/death-stranding-directors-cut/9nqgn8tgnt8p?dm_i=74N0,SXRP,1MPOSW,3X2YT,1">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/">PC</a>. This deal is only available for a limited time, with the full price being ¬£35. There is also an upgrade option for players who already own Death Stranding on PC. It remains full price on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA01968_00-DEATHSTRANDINGEU">PlayStation 5</a>.</p>
<p>Along with today's Xbox news, Kojima Productions also announced it now has full ownership of the Death Stranding IP.</p>

Last year, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-productions-announces-partnership-with-a24-for-death-stranding-movie"> American film and TV production company A24 had partnered with Kojima Productions</a> to bring a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation">live-action Death Stranding movie to life</a>.

</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> is also in the works. Subtitled On the Beach, we got another look at the upcoming game back in September. This included its very realistic photo mode and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-footage-sees-creepy-puppet-dollman-steal-the-show-in-unexpected-dance-number">Sam Bridges' stop motion puppet companion</a>, Dollman.</p>
<p>At the same time, Hideo Kojima said he knew Death Stranding 2's release date already, but he refrained from sharing that news with the public. The developer said while he and his team were working "in preparation" for the release date, he could not confirm it until "some point next year".</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2s-release-date-wont-be-revealed-until-some-point-next-year">appears to still be on course for a 2025 release</a>, however. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has an upbeat outlook on this year's Borderlands film, and said that the  "disappointing" movie hasn't hurt the Borderlands video game series. In fact, it gave it a boost.</p>
<p>It's fair to say that the Borderlands film did not take off to the degree many had hoped and will not exactly go down in a Hall of Fame alongside the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-trailer-shows-our-best-look-yet-at-season-two">HBO's The Last of Us</a> or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-series-passes-impressive-viewer-milestone-after-six-months">Amazon's Fallout</a>, both of which were praised by fans and critics alike.</p>
<p>Alas, for poor ol' Borderlands, this year's Cate Blanchett-fronted film was instead branded a "disaster" and "huge misfire" by viewers. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-borderlands-movie-impressions-brand-it-a-disaster-and-a-huge-misfire">one review called it a "lifeless, unfunny, and visually repulsive dud"</a>. Eesh. The adaptation generated just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-earned-4m-on-its-opening-day">$4m across 3125 locations on its opening day</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-be-able-to-watch-the-borderlands-film-at-home-very-soon-it-seems">quickly getting shifted onto streaming services</a>.</p>

<p>Zelnick commented on the film's performance last night during an earnings call for Take-Two. When an investor asked about the project and how it contributed to the company, Zelnick stated Take Two didn't "really need to break out the contribution from the film because while it was economically positive, it wasn't material" to the company's results.</p><p>"Even though the film was disappointing, it actually benefited our catalogue sales," he continued. "So that is a sign that making a movie or a television show based on our very high-quality IP can drive catalogue sales and that can be a good thing."</p>
<p>That's not to say Take-Two is now going to go all in on film and television adaptations for its various IPs.</p>
<p>"All that said, we're really selective. And one of the reasons we have been so selective about licensing is we would really prefer that everything that comes out with our brands in it is really, really successful," Zelnick stated. "And we can't guarantee that, especially when it's out of our hands. So we have licensed other titles, we'll continue selectively‚Ä¶ emphasis on the word selectively."</p>
<p>I now wonder what could be next...?</p>

While the team at Gearbox has not announced a release date yet, it has said the game will be coming in 2025.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> publisher Take-Two has doubled down on the game's expected late 2025 launch window, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-recommits-to-autumn-2025-launch-following-delay-rumour">following earlier rumours that Rockstar could still delay</a> the game's arrival.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two's latest financial briefing last night pinned GTA6 to "fall of calendar [year] 2025", as previously expected. 
</p>
<p>
Other upcoming launches from the publisher include Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country - both of which simply have "fiscal 2026" launch dates. That means they'll arrive between 1st April 2025 and 31st March 2026.

<p>
Judas, the long-in-development next game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> creator Ken Levine, is listed with no firm launch window at all, meanwhile - it's simply down as "TBA". 
</p>
<p>
Back in February 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creators-next-game-judas-to-be-released-by-march-2025">Take-Two had the game listed as launching by the end of March 2025</a> - something the publisher is no longer stating. We got a quick look at the game in December 2022 at The Game Awards (it looked a lot like BioShock!) and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levines-judas-glimpsed-again">saw a bit more in January of this year</a>, but have heard nothing more since.
</p>
<p>
Levine's last game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>, launched in 2013 - over a decade ago.

<p>For now, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has said that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA5</a> - also released a decade ago - continues to "outperform" sales expectations, specifically through "sustained engagement" (and spending) in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>. 
</p>
<p>"Sales of Grand Theft Auto V outperformed our expectations and to date, the title has sold more than 205m units worldwide," Zelnick said. "Grand Theft Auto Online also exceeded our plans, driven by sustained engagement with the summer content pack Bottom Dollar Bounties and an array of updates, including the new multistage Assault on ATT-16 [ph] mode and experience improvements such as a new anti-cheat system for the PC version of Grand Theft Auto Online."</p><p>Membership of the GTA+ subscription grew by 35 percent this year, Zelnick continued, as it added Rockstar classics such as Bully. Red Dead Redemption 2 has also continued to sell, and is now up to 67m sold since launch six years ago.</p>
<p>Zelnick previously said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-wont-be-on-a-subscription-service-on-day-one-because-take-twos-decisions-are-rational-says-ceo">not to expect GTA 6 to launch via any kind of subscription service</a>, such as Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, because Take-Two's "decisions are rational".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Take-Two Interactive has announced the sale of their indie games publishing label Private Division, though hasn‚Äôt revealed who that is. Despite previous statements, they have also confirmed that developers Roll7 and Intercept Games were closed prior to the sale.</p>
<p>Details of the buyer will be revealed ‚Äúrelatively soon‚Äù, Take-Two Interactive Software CEO Strauss Zelnick told GamesIndustry.biz.</p>


<p>As part of the sale, the buyer now takes on all of Private Division‚Äôs catalogue of games and future projects, with the sole exception being Moon Studios‚Äô action RPG <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/19/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-review-soulslike-action-rpg/">No Rest for the Wicked</a>, which entered Steam Early Access back in April. Other games, such as Weta Workshop‚Äôs <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/tales-of-the-shire-gets-a-new-march-25th-release-date/">Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game</a> has gone with the publishing label.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, it was reported that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/02/take-two-confirms-closure-of-olliolli-studio-roll7-kerbal-space-program-2s-intercept-games/">Private Division was closing down OlliOlli developer Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 developer Intercept Games</a>, seemingly as part of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/17/take-two-layoffs-hit-5-of-staff-games-cancelled/">Take-Two‚Äôs cost-cutting measures</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, Take-Two insisted that KSP2 would still receive updates, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios">Zelnick publicly claimed</a> that the studios hadn‚Äôt been closed down. That statement was a big fat untruth, considering the WARN notices of job losses that were already available.</p>

<p>As for why they‚Äôre selling Private Division now? Zelnick just thinks indie games and smaller projects aren‚Äôt big enough to be worth Take-Two‚Äôs time.</p>
<p>Speaking to GI.biz, he said, ‚ÄúThe team of Private Division did a great job supporting independent developers and, almost to a one, every project they supported did well. However, the scale of those projects was, candidly, on the smaller side, and we‚Äôre in the business of making great big hits.‚Äù</p>
<p>Take-Two, naturally, has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> in the pipeline.</p>

        <p>Along with basically every sci-fi universe of note</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
The dominion of hated Super Earth threatens to expand afresh as Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt toys openly with the prospect of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> cross-over games, beginning with tabletop wargame Trench Crusade and extending to, well, take your pick. Arrowhead's appetite for other licenses appears insatiable. It's the kind of sheer expansionism you'd expect from Earth's loathsome regime, whose "managed democracy" propaganda continues to enthrall thousands of hapless disposable imperialists. Pilestedt even wants to make a Fifth Element game! Milla Jovovich is spinning in her grave. Milla Jovovich isn't dead, you say? Well, that's good news at least.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Pilestedt pitched the Trench Crusade crossover last week in a Xitter reply. The debonair vultures of <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/helldivers-2-cco-wants-crossover-sickest-thing-imaginable/">Videogamer</a> subsequently swooped in and did an article about it, which Pilestedt <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1853793032249765932">has also replied to</a>. "Yeah, but these are just musings," he qualified, noting that stirring too many or the wrong kind of third-party license into the Helldivers world might "dilute the IP". 
</p>
<p>
While this might read like an attempt to stave off further reporting, Piletstedt simply couldn't help sharing "an extended list of IPs that I really would love to do a take on", which the jolly jackals of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-creative-boss-doesnt-want-to-dilute-it-with-crossovers-but-his-list-of-dream-choices-has-some-real-deep-cuts/">PCGamer</a> have seized in their slavering jaws. And now, we're writing it up too. What kind of creature is Rock Paper Shotgun in this particular Attenborough scenario? We are <em>bugs</em>, of course. We are a horde of alien insects, emerging triumphantly from our burrows to chew upon the carcass of this story. Without further ado, here's Pilestedt's list.
</p>
<blockquote><p>

- Aliens
</p>
<p>
- Starship Troopers
</p>
<p>
- Terminator
</p>
<p>
- Predator
</p>
<p>
- Star Wars
</p>
<p>
- Fifth Element
</p>
<p>
- Blade Runner
</p>
<p>
- Warhammer 40k
</p>
<p>
- Trench Crusade
</p>
<p>
- Mutant Chronicles
</p>
<p>
- Dropzone Commander
</p></blockquote>
<p>
You could argue that there are already bits and pieces of those in Helldivers 2 as it stands. Starship Troopers is, of course, the book-and-movie franchise Helldivers takes inspiration from. The game's satirical forever-war fiction is basically 40K but without the crenelations and waxen seals. The Terminator, Alien and Predator loom large in the design of Helldivers enemy factions. Still, I see a few untapped possibilities here that might take Helldivers in fascinating directions. Here's a brief list.
</p>
<p>
- Do a Terminator expansion where one of your team-mates could be a Terminator in a skinsuit. Most of my team-mates are trying to kill me anyway.
</p>
<p>
- If you're going to add xenomorphs, make it so they can abduct Helldivers and cocoon them, giving colleagues a window of time in which to rescue them before they're facehugged
</p>
<p>
- If you're going to do Warhammer 40K, don't just add Space Marines. Give us the option of turning ourselves into Dreadnoughts when we die. Also, endow each map with an ambient level of warp activity, with demons emerging if you commit too much heresy (e.g. by drop-podding your comrades)
</p>
<p>
- As for Starship Troopers, let us talk to the bugs using telepathy. It's what Edge would want, and it actually happens at the end of the  Verhoeven film. Spoilers, I guess!!!!!

			<p>As someone of a certain age, I‚Äôve never really got into podcasts ‚Äì a reaction not helped by the fact that everybody and their dog seem to have one nowadays. In fact I think I‚Äôve actually been on more podcasts than I‚Äôve actually listened to‚Ä¶ That said, I can see the appeal of long form audio treatments of interesting topics, and especially the kind of spooky or dark content that works so well in that format. Dark and Deep takes the genre of conspiracy and haunted podcasts and weaves it into a disturbing and twisted tale with a truly unique artstyle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dark and Deep Launch Trailer [ON STEAM AUGUST 13]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n7KP0nurg5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The central premise of Dark and Deep concerns the question of who is Samuel Judge, an IT specialist and loner who may be wrapped up in mysterious conspiracies. You play as the aforementioned Samuel and must unravel the increasingly weird situations you are thrust into whilst only relying on the hints revealed through enigmatic webchat conversations and snippets of the Dark and Deep podcast. What transpires feels like a fever dream that takes you from an argument over a stolen sandwich to deadly encounters with ghostly snakes and more.</p>


<p>Booting up Dark and Deep immediately strikes you with the singular vision of its distinctive artstyle. Solo dev Walter Woods has spent years immersed in the beautifully Gothic aesthetics of nineteenth century artist, Gustav Dor√©, and the result is as effective as it is unique. The environments you explore are made up of the monochromatic hash effects that characterise Dore‚Äôs style interspersed with more photo realistic modern offices and server rooms. This combination creates a techno-Gothic dreamy Hellscape that is perhaps Dark and Deep‚Äôs greatest feature.</p>


<p>Playing from a first-person perspective, exploration is mostly linear, aside from some puzzles that require a certain amount of backtracking. This approach works well to push you forward and the final build is much more focused and streamlined than the demo one I played a few months back. Aside from navigating the environments you will be blocked by some puzzles that require you to make use of a number of mysterious picture frames that you find and also drops of ember ‚Äì bright shining orbs that power strange devices and move obstacles. A certain amount of platforming is needed to progress and it is here that the game sometimes falls down (or at least the character does‚Ä¶) as falling sends you back to the beginning of the section and can become frustrating ‚Äì&nbsp;even with updates to improve collision detection.</p>
<p>The first of the frames you find reveals hidden objects and handholds on walls, whilst the next is used to destroy the skulking enemies who try to sabotage you by stealing ember. Later ones have other specific powers which I won‚Äôt spoil here and there a number of areas that force you to switch between them to progress. The overall loop is therefore set but the different frames do allow for a decent amount of variety within what could have been a very straight forward walking sim setup.</p>

<p>Storytelling here is kept to a minimum in order to ensure that you constantly feel on edge, but the mood is more of suspense than straight out horror. Throughout the levels you‚Äôll occasionally come across computer desks which can be interacted with to read chat logs and listen to the eponymous podcasts. This slow drip feed of information is effective and even by the game‚Äôs ending there are questions left to ponder.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Dark and Deep is a focused and atmospheric title that doesn‚Äôt outstay it‚Äôs welcome. Most of this time is spent immersed in the unique aesthetic and it stands out amongst the many other copycat PT wannabes that flood the horror tag on Steam. The ending is interesting although some of the imagery felt too separated from the Dor√© influence and instead moved into more conventional folk horror. All in all, Dark and Deep is a well polished and fascinating indie horror that has a look and feel all of its own, and for that it deserves a wider audience.	</p></div>

            <p>Calling a game ‚Äòno frills‚Äô or ‚Äòno nonsense‚Äô is always a back-handed compliment, because it sounds like you're saying it's a bit straightforward and simple. And yes, that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm saying here. Acts Of Blood feels like a spiffy PS2 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> brawler; a slightly tighter old Yakuza game, or a stripped-back <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sifu">Sifu</a>. It‚Äôs snacky and a bit janky, but it‚Äôs also great coffee break fodder, assuming you want to spend your break breaking a selection of heavy objects over the crumbly skulls of ne‚Äôer-do-wells. I mean, they might have done some things well, I don‚Äôt know them. But they aren‚Äôt doing any well to my character in the game, so violence it is.</p>

<p>As you‚Äôll see from the trailer above, Acts Of Blood channels the relentless martial arts beatdowns of films like The Raid. What‚Äôs a little less obvious, due to all the cuts, is how the combat doesn‚Äôt quite flow together as well as I‚Äôd hoped. It‚Äôs smooth enough to play, although there‚Äôs a fair few canned counter and finisher animations that don‚Äôt play especially nice with whatever the other enemies are doing at the time, resulting in a bit of janky disconnect. Still, I found myself won over by some very smooth performance, some lovely kick combos, and how fun it was to lob fire axes across the room for some very decisive kills.</p>
<p>You can see how you feel about this yourself, anyway, since there‚Äôs a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3031890/Acts_of_Blood/">on Steam here</a>. Here‚Äôs the story setup:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the bustling city of Bandung, Hendra's life is torn apart when his family is slain by his father's business rival. Left alone and seeking justice, the college law student finds no help from the corrupt legal system that protects the killers. Discovering a powerful group behind the attack, Hendra decides to take revenge himself, determined to make them pay for their actions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Features include ‚ÄúDynamic Brutal Combat‚Äù (yes to brutal, rain check on dynamic), ‚ÄúVarious Melee &amp; Firearm Weapons‚Äù, ‚ÄúDestructible Environmental Elements‚Äù, ‚ÄúTraditional Parkour‚Äù (you can slide on things), and ‚ÄúOutfit Customization‚Äù. Misgivings aside, I got a good 20 minutes of fun out of it, and I reckon it‚Äôs worth the &lt;3GB download, if just to throw an axe at someone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In its Q3 2024 earnings report, published yesterday, South Korean publisher Kakao Games provided updates on its upcoming game slate, including the highly anticipated Unreal Engine 5 action MMORPGs ArcheAge Chronicles and Chrono Odyssey.</p>
<p>The first game, as you might remember, is nothing more than ArcheAge 2's rebrand. In late September, when the title change was <a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-chronicles-is-archeage-2s-new-title-out-in-2025-the-pc-version-requires-an-rtx-2070-super/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> and explained, we still got a generic 2025 release window. However, the updated Kakao Games release schedule has moved ArcheAge Chronicles to the fiscal year 2026, which is to say, at some point in the calendar year 2026.</p>
<p>Two additional games are also dated for FY2026: the looter shooter Project S and the action RPG based on The Swordmaster's Youngest Son IP. All of these games will be released globally for PC and consoles, just like <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-ue5-mmorpg-gets-striking-gameplay-trailer-confirmed-for-pc-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrono Odyssey</a>. The MMORPG developed by NPIXEL's Chrono Studio will launch in the last quarter of 2025, around this time next year. Here's a brief overview by the producer:</p>
<p><em>Chrono Odyssey is an "open-world MMORPG where time dictates destiny," and we are committed to integrating all the core elements showcased in the trailer into the game. Players will be able to experience exhilarating battles with colossal bosses, adventures that utilize the "Chronotector," a device that manipulates time and space, complex characters, and innovative storytelling. We look forward to the day we can share these features with you.</em></p>
<p>Kakao Games is also publishing Path of Exile 2 in Korea and the strategy RPG Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch globally. The latter game has just launched <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2530490/Lost_Eidolons_Veil_of_the_Witch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> and will get a full release next year on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>In Q2 2025, Kakao aims to publish version 1.0 of the action roguelite shooter Section 13 (also currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2111870/Section_13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>), while Q3 2025 will see the Korean debut of Project Q, an Unreal Engine 5 isometric open world MMORPG for PC and mobile made by Lionheart Studio, the team behind Odin: Valhalla Rising. <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/en/it/11158890" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Korean media</a>, Kakao has also signed a global publishing deal for Project Q.</p>
<p>Lastly, in Q4 2025, Kakao will launch two more games globally alongside the aforementioned Chrono Odyssey: the zombie survival game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3073940/God_Save_Birmingham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God Save Birmingham</a> for PC and the MMORPG Ares: Rise of Guardians for mobile devices and PC.</p>

            <p>Putting aside my natural annoyance at<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater"> Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> for almost beating out the Twarhammer series in the headline real estate wars, I am more than a little excited to play. Some days, you simply must feast on a tree frog, and while we still don‚Äôt have a solid release date, that day doesn‚Äôt feel <em>too</em> far away. Good news for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> fans, and perhaps <em>gooder news</em> for a dozen strapline writers sweating profusely, soiling themselves in anticipation of using ‚Äúkept you waiting, huh?‚Äù.</p>
<p>Until then, I at least have a steady drip feed of new information to keep me sated, the latest of which is the substantial hint that there'll be some new dialogue in the game, as per the video below. Alongside that, the previously pseudonymous Suzetta Mi√±et - who was credited with voicing EVA in MGS3 and Peace Walker - has revealed herself to be Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in Disney‚Äôs The Little Mermaid. Cheers for the spot, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-voice-actors-confirm-that-the-remake-will-have-new-dialogue/">Automaton West</a>.</p>

<p>The video features Benson, The Boss actor Lori Alan, and David Hayter, talking shop about reprising their roles for the MGS 3 remake. Konami have previously said that Delta will use the original game‚Äôs VO in its entirety, but it sounds like there‚Äôs actually some new dialogue, too. At around 11:50 in the video, Hayter asks his co-stars about their experience doing ‚Äúsome of the new lines‚Äù. Alan and Benson then go on to talk about stepping back in the recording booth to revisit their characters from 20 years ago.</p><p>Benson, when asked why she used a pseudonym for the original Snake Eater, says that the project‚Äôs voice director suggested the name change due to the other ‚Äúfamily based, children based‚Äù projects Benson was involved with at the time. The ‚ÄòSuzetta Mi√±et‚Äô pseudonym was based on her pet dog, Suzette Monet.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs lots of other lovely anecdotes in the full video, and it‚Äôs worth watching just for how proud Hayter looks of himself when he replies to Benson‚Äôs story of keeping a copy of Snake Eater in her basement with ‚Äúin a box!‚Äù.</p>
<p>While, again, there‚Äôs no solid release date as of yet, a hastily deleted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leak-suggests-a-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-exactly-20-years-after-the-original">Gamestop Xitter post this June</a> did list a 17th November release date - exactly 20 years after the original, although that does feel considerably less likely now we‚Äôre so close.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty is arguably the most impactful first-person shooter series ever made. What started as a World War II experiment turned out to be one of the best-selling franchises ever concocted, and today, the yearly Call of Duty release still nets tens of millions of sales. In this breakdown, we‚Äôre looking at all Call of Duty games, ranked by their impact and how good they were.</p>



<p>I‚Äôm aware that‚Äôs one of the most inflammatory things I‚Äôll ever say and that this is mostly subjective, but take a look through and see how you feel about this Call of Duty ranking.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-call-of-duty-games-ranked">All Call of Duty Games Ranked</h2>



<h3 id="h-21-call-of-duty-vanguard">21. Call of Duty: Vanguard</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Vanguard looked great on the surface but it was a paltry game that disappointed fans everywhere when it was released in 2021. It boasted one of the weakest competitive ecosystems in years and everything from the short-lived campaign to the multiplayer platform lacked something. </p>



<p>Sledgehammer Games tried to save Vanguard by weaving in maps from older games, but it wasn‚Äôt enough. It also heralded the arrival of Caldera, a Warzone map that pulled players away from Verdansk, and that‚Äôs often seen as the biggest mistake Activision has ever made.</p>



<h3 id="h-20-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-2023">20. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III (2023)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Ah, Modern Warfare III. The ‚ÄòDLC‚Äô Call of Duty game.</p>



<p>When Modern Warfare III was released in 2023, fans were dismayed at the 3-hour campaign and the fact that it felt more like an expansion to 2022‚Äôs Modern Warfare II. In many ways, it was, and despite Activision‚Äôs attempts to placate fans by saying it was a premium release, everyone who invested in it felt conned.</p>



<p>Not good.</p>







<h3 id="h-19-call-of-duty-black-ops-4">19. Call Of Duty: Black Ops 4</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 took the unusual route of being the only mainline entry in the series to completely bypass the campaign, opting for the traditional multiplayer modes and the series‚Äô first foray into the world of Battle Royale with its Blackout mode. </p>



<p>This served as a precursor to the popular Warzone mode that would be released in 2020. Overall, it was a fun iteration of Call of Duty, but not having a campaign hindered any long-term replayability once Warzone and the next entry in the series were released.</p>



<p>Black Ops 4 came out in 2018, and to this day, it was Activision‚Äôs last attempt at a futuristic Call of Duty game. Make of that what you will.</p>



<h3 id="h-18-call-of-duty-3">18. Call of Duty 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Call of Duty 3 is likely the game you haven‚Äôt played and you aren‚Äôt really missing much. This entry is the only one never to be released on PC, and with consoles being multiple generations ahead now, being able to go back and replay it is difficult, so it‚Äôs best to skip this and just start your <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-games-like-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> journey with the next entry.</p>



<h3 id="h-17-call-of-duty-infinite-warfare">17. Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Infinite Warfare was Activision‚Äôs final attempt at taking Call of Duty into the future before going back to its roots with WWII. It would flip back into the near future with Black Ops 4 in 2018, but you‚Äôve seen where that ended up on this list of all Call of Duty games ranked.</p>



<p>This is a game that often divides fans as it receives both praise and criticism depending on who you ask, but this marks the end of a dark period in the franchise and I think we can all agree that Call of Duty has seen much better entries in the years since.</p>



<h3 id="h-16-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-2022">16. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Modern Warfare II was a short, forgettable experience that players didn‚Äôt gel with. It marked an all-time low for the series, and the game‚Äôs competitive ecosystem didn‚Äôt fare too well either. It didn‚Äôt have the energy that previous games had, and while the campaign wasn‚Äôt bad, it was just far too short to keep players engaged for long ‚Äì and it was buggy as all hell.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs not the worst Call of Duty game ever, but it‚Äôs far, <strong>far </strong>from being the best.</p>



<h3 id="h-15-call-of-duty-wwii">15. Call of Duty: WWII</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Following three years of the Call of Duty series going into the future, Activision went back to its roots with a World War II-era game. Although it was a good change of pace, Activision failed to deliver and it quickly became a forgotten title in the series as there have been better World War II-era entries before and since. </p>



<p>It is worth playing the campaign if you can get the game cheaply enough, but you won‚Äôt miss much if you bypass this entry. Many will tell you that WWII had solid multiplayer, but they‚Äôre remembering it wrong‚Ä¶</p>



<h3 id="h-14-call-of-duty-black-ops-3">14. Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>After Sledgehammer Games took the series into the future with Advanced Warfare, Treyarch followed suit with Black Ops 3. As with other futuristic Call of Duty games, Black Ops 3 cemented the fact that the series doesn‚Äôt work as a sci-fi shooter. </p>



<p>Black Ops 3 does have its moments though, including a great Zombies mode. But when compared to the previous two entries in the series, Black Ops 3 doesn‚Äôt hold up.</p>



<h3 id="h-13-call-of-duty-ghosts">13. Call of Duty: Ghosts</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Like Infinite Warfare, Call of Duty: Ghosts is a game that divides opinions. Some players have fond memories of it while some think it is one of the worst entries in the series.</p>



<p>This game did serve as a precursor for what would become more standard with multiplayer games in the future in that it featured various collaborations with pop-culture icons, including Snoop Dogg as an announcer and both Michael Myers from Halloween and Predator being playable characters on DLC maps.</p>



<p>We all know how that panned out, though.</p>



<h3 id="h-12-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare">12. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Advanced Warfare was a fairly forgettable title that expanded on the jetpack era of Call of Duty, sitting in the middle of the series that spanned Black Ops II to 2018‚Äôs Black Ops 4. The campaign featured a solid cast fronted by the likes of Kevin Spacey and Troy Baker, but looking back, I can‚Äôt recall a single detail of the story.</p>



<p>Sledgehammer Games tried to get creative with the UI and various other mechanics in Advanced Warfare, which earns the game some extra points when we‚Äôre looking at all Call of Duty games ranked, but it wasn‚Äôt enough to push it into the top ten COD games ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-11-call-of-duty-2">11. Call of Duty 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It was immediately clear after the first game that Activision had a winner on its hands, but few could have predicted the rise that it would go on to have. </p>



<p>Call of Duty 2 is more of the same when compared to the first entry, with one of the most interesting facts being that it wasn‚Äôt released on PlayStation. This means that it is understandable if many players haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to play it, but it is worth hunting down if you haven‚Äôt played this great entry in the series.</p>



<p>For many of today‚Äôs OGs, Call of Duty 2‚Äôs multiplayer platform is where <strong>it all began</strong>.</p>







<h3 id="h-10-call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">10. Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>In 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Activision‚Äôs studios introduced Black Ops Cold War, a game built on the back of a work-from-home initiative and excessive crunch. It featured one of the shortest development cycles ever, but despite that, it wasn‚Äôt bad. It featured a stellar multiplayer ecosystem that engaged many millions of players, and the campaign wasn‚Äôt awful.</p>



<p>It had a somewhat bizarre Zombies mode that didn‚Äôt resonate too well with fans, but it was ambitious and it gave them something else in terms of meat on the bones away from strictly multiplayer or the COD campaign.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs a love-hate game for many, but I for one adored Cold War.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3">9. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>One of the more interesting things to note about Modern Warfare 3 is it seemed to be released on everything ‚Äì even the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS. Talk about accessibility.</p>



<p>Given that it was the final chapter of the original Modern Warfare series, the marketing for Modern Warfare 3 was very extensive. What was ultimately delivered ticked many boxes for fans, and it introduced some of the best core elements that we‚Äôve come to know and expect from a Call of Duty game today.</p>



<p>For instance, Kill Confirmed debuted in Modern Warfare 3, and that‚Äôs now considered one of the best Call of Duty game modes ever. </p>



<p>The campaign was a perfect ending to several years of Modern Warfare, the Spec Ops / Survival Mode was brilliant, and the multiplayer platform was polished.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-call-of-duty-world-at-war">8. Call of Duty: World At War</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Call of Duty: World At War is the second game by Treyarch in what would become the yearly trend of going back and forth with Infinity Ward. </p>



<p>World At War felt like Treyarch was finding its feet and getting ready to become a dominant force in the franchise with the Black Ops series. This game also marked the first time the popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-will-have-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies mode</a> would be featured in the series and became a huge selling point for the game and is still worth going back to today if you‚Äôre a fan of the mode, it still holds up very well.</p>



<p>Some of World at War‚Äôs maps are still being reused in modern games, which goes to show how beloved the game‚Äôs multiplayer was.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2019">7. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Modern Warfare (2019) was seen as a soft reboot of the franchise that had pulled in so many millions of gamers over the years. It was dubbed a resurgence of the series, and the anticipation in the market before it dropped was nothing short of palpable.</p>



<p>When it was delivered, players worldwide fell in love with the game‚Äôs campaign, and the new movement mechanics woven into the multiplayer platform would set a standard for years to come. It also served as the basis for Call of Duty: Warzone, one of the top battle royale games ever made and one of the best COD games of all time.</p>



<p>Modern Warfare dwindled with II and III, but the opening title is memorable, and that‚Äôs why it sits so high on this list of all Call of Duty games ranked.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">6. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here‚Äôs a surprising entry.</p>



<p>In 2024, Treyarch and Raven Software combined forces to release Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the most highly anticipated game in the series in <strong>years</strong>. It took years to develop, and when it was finally pushed live, it became the biggest Call of Duty launch in history. </p>



<p>It‚Äôs not perfect, but it took all the failings of the previous games and turned them upside down. </p>



<p>For instance, it had a meaty campaign that took around 7 ‚Äì 9 hours to finish, provided you wanted to collect all the hidden goodies and achievements. It returned to a round-based Zombies operating model across two phenomenal maps, and the multiplayer platform featured decent maps, all-new movement mechanics, and a stellar array of weapons.</p>



<p>All of a sudden, the internet was ablaze with <strong>Black Ops 6</strong>. From the camo grinds to the intense marketing campaign, everyone knew about Black Ops 6, even people who didn‚Äôt play games. It was everywhere, it was everything, and it was arguably the best Call of Duty game released in several years.</p>







<h3 id="h-5-call-of-duty-black-ops-2">5. Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 is often rightfully hailed as one of the best entries in the series. </p>



<p>It features a branching, non-linear campaign with multiple endings, a first for the series, and has one of the most solid multiplayer modes the series has ever seen. </p>



<p>Black Ops 2 grossed over $500 million in its first 24 hours of release, a gaming record that stood until GTA V was released in 2013. It also was the first game in the series to be released on the Wii U, although it is understandable if you never played that version of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-call-of-duty">4. Call of Duty</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Following the departure of many Medal of Honor developers from 2015, Inc., a new studio called Infinity Ward was created and set out to make a new World War shooter, which would quickly go on to become more successful than the Medal of Honor series. </p>



<p>The original Call of Duty game was originally released as a PC exclusive, but it was eventually ported to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as Call of Duty Classic in 2009 following the release of Modern Warfare 2.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs where it all began and it‚Äôs still one of the highest-rated Call of Duty games ever made, so you can‚Äôt say fairer than that.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare">3. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Call of Duty pivoted away from the World War era and into the modern age with Call of Duty 4, a move that took the series to new heights. </p>



<p>Modern Warfare was released in 2007, the same year as Halo 3, and it helped to push online console gaming into the mainstream as millions of players jumped into the game to battle it out with other players across the world. </p>



<p>Modern Warfare received universal critical acclaim, with its Metacritic scores ranging from 92-94 on most major platforms. It‚Äôs often considered the starting point for many veteran Call of Duty fans, and its simplicity is desperately sought out by players even today. Things have become too complicated in the Call of Duty space ‚Äì this is when things were simple enough to just be enjoyable.</p>



<p>In 2016, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Remastered was released, with Activision‚Äôs teams diving back into the full game and recreating what made the series so great. To this day, it‚Äôs the only Call of Duty game to be remastered in full, multiplayer included.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-call-of-duty-black-ops">2. Call of Duty: Black Ops</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>By the end of the decade, Infinity Ward had firmly established the Modern Warfare series and Treyarch needed a sub-series for its bi-yearly releases. </p>



<p>Black Ops is set during the Cold War in the 1960s and the opinion of which series is better is often fairly split, with some preferring Treyarch‚Äôs offerings and some preferring Infinity Ward‚Äôs. The game featured licensed music by the likes of Eminem and The Rolling Stones but notably included an original song by Avenged Sevenfold, a trend that would continue until Black Ops 4. </p>



<p>This game is often considered the peak of Call of Duty, and it‚Äôs no wonder why Treyarch has revisited the game‚Äôs concepts time and again. By 2024, we‚Äôre sitting on <strong>six </strong>Black Ops games, even if they‚Äôve not all reached the expectations players have had for them. </p>



<p>Black Ops was innovative, it had a flawless campaign, a remarkable Zombies mode, and the multiplayer was second to none. It helped ease many into the idea of Call of Duty esports, a concept that would be bolstered immeasurably with Black Ops II.</p>



<p>This is easily a contender for the title of the best Call of Duty game ever released, but it doesn‚Äôt quite snag it.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-2009">1. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Modern Warfare 2 is legendary, and that‚Äôs all there is to it.</p>



<p>From the expansion of the campaign established in 2007‚Äôs COD 4, to a multiplayer platform that users are still logging on to enjoy all these years later, Modern Warfare 2 helped grow the Call of Duty series beyond epic proportions.</p>



<p>In 2023, Modern Warfare III was released with a full remastered mapset pulled from MW2, and it was a win with fans worldwide ‚Äì particularly the more veteran players who got started on 2009‚Äôs MW2.</p>



<p>Even the side content, like the game‚Äôs Spec Ops mode, was lauded by fans worldwide.</p>



<p>This game gave rise to some of the most monumental maps ever made, including Terminal and Rust, and every inch of the campaign can be remembered all these years later.</p>



<p>There is nothing bad to say about MW2, and it‚Äôs the best Call of Duty game ever made.</p>

<p>Read on to learn about the best games like COD that could replace this shooter series in your library.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-top-games-like-call-of-duty">Top Games Like Call of Duty</h2>



<p>Call of Duty spans several ‚Äòeras‚Äô, from the Second World War to the Cold War, and from near-future theatres of war to the Gulf. It has taken players from space to the jungles of Vietnam, and from stealthy situations to all-out, guns-blazing engagements. It‚Äôs hard to compete with that diversity, but here are the best games like Call of Duty that try hard to beat the series.</p>



<h2 id="h-5-counter-strike-2">5. Counter-Strike 2</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Counter-Strike 2, the recently released sequel to CSGO, is another FPS title that is commonly related to Call of Duty. The game is similar to COD‚Äôs Search and Destroy mode, which pits teams against each other, as one team tries to defuse the other team‚Äôs bomb.</p>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 is an incredibly popular game within the FPS community, making it a great alternative to those who enjoy Call of Duty. It‚Äôs only really available to those playing keyboard and mouse on PC platforms, though ‚Äì so it‚Äôs a bit limited and blocked off from the console community.</p>







<h2 id="h-4-titanfall-2">4. Titanfall 2</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Titanfall 2, a large-scale multiplayer FPS game, is often compared to some of COD‚Äôs more futuristic titles. Like Black Ops III, Titanfall 2 has similar mechanics such as the jetpack, which allows players to jump higher throughout the maps. Both games have a Team Deathmatch mode and other fun game modes that people can play.</p>



<p>If you enjoyed the futuristic games that Call of Duty has released, then you will love Titanfall 2.</p>







<h2 id="h-3-rainbow-six-siege">3. Rainbow Six: Siege</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Tom Clancy‚Äôs Rainbow Six: Siege is another game that draws similarities to COD‚Äôs Search and Destroy mode. The game is a 5v5 FPS title, that has modes that include defusing a bomb, saving a hostage and more. While Siege may be a bit slower-paced, both games are still incredibly similar in comparison.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six: Siege is the perfect example of a game that Call of Duty players would highly enjoy.</p>







<h2 id="h-2-halo-infinite">2. Halo Infinite</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Halo series has notoriously been known as a rival to Call of Duty. While the franchise has slowed down on releasing new games, making them inferior to COD, it still is a great alternative to those looking for a similar style of game. The most recent title, Halo Infinite, has various game modes that rival all of the modes in COD.</p>



<p>Halo Infinite, or any game within the Halo series, is a great replacement for those looking for a game similar to Call of Duty.</p>







<h2 id="h-1-battlefield-2042">1. Battlefield 2042</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Battlefield series is arguably the closest thing you‚Äôll get to a modern Call of Duty game. </p>



<p>Battlefield 2042 in particular is one of the best games like Call of Duty, boasting typical first-person shooter combat mechanics spread across a series of maps and modes. In recent years, Call of Duty and Battlefield have become more aligned as Battlefield has become more ‚Äòarcadey‚Äô while Call of Duty has edged more into the bold, ambitious modes that feature vehicles and destruction.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-games-like-fallout/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Fallout is one of the best-known post-apocalyptic multimedia franchises ever made, allowing players to explore vast, open wastelands and carve out a name for themselves after the end of the world. Since spawning in the late 1990s, Fallout has gone on to inspire many similar games. With that in mind, we‚Äôre here today to identify the best games like Fallout for you to enjoy <strong>now</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-top-games-like-fallout">Top Games Like Fallout</h2>



<p>If you‚Äôre looking for games similar to Fallout, search no further than this list. We‚Äôve broken down what you need to go off and enjoy another romp through a ruined wasteland, a broken world, and a harrowing story. Strap on your survival gear ‚Äì you‚Äôre going to need it where you‚Äôre going.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-the-outer-worlds">5. The Outer Worlds</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>The Outer Worlds </strong>was dubbed ‚Äòlike Fallout but in space‚Äô by many, and that‚Äôs because it was co-created by teams who once had a hand in developing the Fallout franchise. In The Outer Worlds, players assume control of a character on an open-ended adventure across space, and like in Fallout, how the story unfolds is entirely up to you.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-starfield">4. Starfield</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Starfield </strong>is the latest open-world epic from Bethesda Game Studios, the company responsible for producing every Fallout game since 2008. It‚Äôs easily one of the best games like Fallout because it soaks up so many mechanics and elements from 2015‚Äôs Fallout 4 and 2018‚Äôs Fallout 76.</p>



<p>In Starfield, you‚Äôre left to your own devices to explore a monumental map made up of 1,000 planets. It‚Äôs a great game with incredible depth, but it doesn‚Äôt have that post-apocalyptic element you might be looking for ‚Äì but our top game like Fallout has that in spades.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-s-t-a-l-k-e-r">3. S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The ‚Äò<strong>STALKER</strong>‚Äò series is perhaps one of the closest games to Fallout you‚Äôll ever see. It‚Äôs a harrowing and intense series set in and around the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone, and it tasks players with exploring and surviving the zone, doing battle with mutants, enemy human factions, and ethereal anomalies.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs not technically an ‚Äòend-of-the-world‚Äô game, but it‚Äôs damn close, and it‚Äôs easily one of the best games like Fallout you can play right now.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-the-last-of-us">2. The Last of Us</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>The Last of Us</strong> tells one of the most emotional and heart-wrenching stories of the end of the world that you‚Äôll ever see represented in games. Like most Fallout games, The Last of Us‚Äô story is about being some of the few survivors remaining after an apocalyptic event, and both franchises deal with concepts of loss, combat, revenge, and suffering.</p>



<p>The Last of Us is much more ‚Äòserious‚Äô than Fallout, and side-by-side, they look and feel nothing alike, but you can‚Äôt escape the fact that these two franchises represent the cr√®me de la cr√®me of post-apocalyptic gaming.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-metro">1. Metro</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Metro </strong>is my number-one pick for games like Fallout. This series has almost unfolded in parallel alongside Fallout, with the first game in the franchise dropping just two years after Fallout 3 hit the market. Based on a novel series of the same name, Metro plunges players into post-apocalyptic Moscow, with survivors now occupying the city‚Äôs metro system while the world above burns in the nuclear fire.</p>



<p>Metro Exodus in particular is most worthy of the ‚Äòbest game like Fallout‚Äô title, given its semi-open-world operating model and solid end-of-the-world vibes. It‚Äôs mostly linear and not so much an RPG by nature, but if you put Fallout (with some mods) side-by-side with Metro Exodus, you‚Äôd barely be able to tell the difference.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/arcane-most-expensive-animated-series/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Riot Games‚Äô Arcane is a show-stopper of a series that has been turning heads since the first season dropped in 2021. Fans are now getting deep into the highly anticipated second season of the show, but recently a stat surfaced showing just how much of a financial burden producing the series was on Riot Games.</p>



<p>It was confirmed in an interview with Variety that Arcane cost a whopping $250 million to produce in full. That makes it the most expensive animated series to land on linear or streaming television services <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-money-well-spent">Money Well Spent</h2>



<p>Arcane boasts a phenomenal cast, stellar acting, and mind-blowing visuals, which is par for the course when it comes to Riot Games‚Äô animated sequences. The company has long focused on piecing together some of the best visual content in the business, such as the punchy animated promos they assemble for the League of Legends World Championship year after year.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/riot-games-arcane-hollywood-netflix-most-expensive-animated-series-ever-1236196655/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an interview with Variety</a>, co-founder of Riot, Marc Merrill, suggested that despite the bloated cost, the company isn‚Äôt wavering on the animation front:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our ambitions in entertainment haven‚Äôt changed. </p>



<p>We were never intending&nbsp;to operate like a traditional studio with traditional timelines. What&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;change as we learned more was our expectations of ourselves: We realized that getting it right takes a lot more time than we‚Äôd originally expected, and so we recalibrated our development, output goals and teams with that in mind.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition, Merrill addressed the cost of producing Arcane:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We‚Äôre more than comfortable with the spend it took to deliver a show that was worthy of our players‚Äô time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>League of Legends is one of the most popular games ever made, and it boasts a phenomenal esports ecosystem that pulls in millions of viewers <strong>with ease</strong>. The recent League of Legends World Championship broke viewership records as the event‚Äôs grand final series was streamed live from London.</p>



<p>Do you think the $250 million investment to produce 18 episodes of a show for a streaming service is appropriate? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/team-shotzzy-black-ops-6-invitational/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/team-shotzzy-black-ops-6-invitational/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The 2025 season hasn‚Äôt started, and last year‚Äôs world champion, OpTic Texas‚Äô Shotzzy, is busy claiming trophies. With Lucky, Kremp, and Beans, Shotzzy claimed the top spot in The Flank‚Äôs Black Ops 6 Invitational, netting the biggest prize we‚Äôve seen in the game ahead of the upcoming CDL season being formally announced.</p>



<p>That marks the end of the $100,000 tournament collective backed by The Flank. From what we‚Äôve already seen, this year‚Äôs competitive ecosystem, built on the foundation of Black Ops 6, will be nothing short of electrifying.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-easy-money">Easy Money</h2>



<p>As rosters for the upcoming competitive season were being cemented and everyone was getting to grips with Black Ops 6, the world‚Äôs best COD players were busying themselves trying to win $50,000 in one of the best pre-season events around. </p>



<p>The Flank‚Äôs Invitational played host to everyone from world champions to aspiring superstars, and it was genuinely such a great event to watch on stream.</p>



<p>When the dust had settled, it was Kremp, Shotzzy, Beans, and Lucky who stood victorious. This was Shotzzy‚Äôs second win in The Flank Invitational series, showing how ready he is to dominate again this season.</p>



<p>Before them came some top-tier teams, including one represented by Simp, Cellium, and Scrap, three of the most talented players in COD esports history, but somehow, Team Shotzzy pulled off a massive win and netted the $50,000 prize.</p>



<p>Before this, The Flank held two smaller tournaments to get things heated up, here‚Äôs how they ended up:</p>



<p><strong>Tournament #1: $25,000</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Dashy</li>



<li>Drazah</li>



<li>Simp</li>



<li>Shotzzy</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Tournament #2: $25,000</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Ghosty</li>



<li>Scrap</li>



<li>Gwinn</li>



<li>TJHaly</li>
</ul>



<p>These tournaments have got fans lusting for the competitive season to kick off. Recently, leaked documents outlined a rough roadmap for the 2025 Call of Duty League season, and it‚Äôs looking <strong>sharp</strong>.</p>

                <p>Last year, Epic Games brought back <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fortnite-battle-royale-review-laying-the-foundatio/1900-6416891/" data-ref-id="1900-6416891">Fortnite</a>'s original island in a month-long event called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-og-chapter-4-season-5-update-revealed/2900-4930/" data-ref-id="2900-4930">Fortnite OG</a>. The chance to revisit the earliest version of the game was wildly popular with players, and now reports are emerging that Fortnite OG will be returning on a permanent basis starting in December.</p><p>Fortnite leakers <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a> and <a href="https://x.com/hypex/status/1853920988594930095?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HypeX</a> were the first to report the news. The first 10 seasons of Fortnite, which collectively make up Chapter 1, are said to be returning on a monthly basis, and only the OG loot will be supported. Additionally, both Fortnite's battle royale mode and Zero Build modes will be incorporated into OG.</p><p>When Fortnite OG launched in 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-og-breaks-its-all-time-player-records-at-launch/1100-6518929/" data-ref-id="1100-6518929">over 44.7 million users logged in to play</a>, which marked the most popular single day in the history of the game. That massive response surely played a role in the decision to bring Fortnite OG back alongside the current incarnation of the game.</p><p>None of this has been confirmed by Epic Games yet, but the report suggests that the official reveal may occur during Fortnite Remix's finale on November 30, or during The Game Awards on December 13. Mind you, this is all likely to occur alongside the presumed Chapter 6 map, too.</p><p>But before Fortnite Remix Chapter 2 comes to an end, rapper <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-eminem-minigun-spits-out-bullets-and-lyrics-in-leaked-clip/1100-6527562/" data-ref-id="1100-6527562">Eminem will return to the game</a> on November 7. If players can defeat Eminem in battle, they'll earn his new Mythic RG Minigun, which can fire bullets and lines from Eminem's raps. And if that's not enough for players, Fortnite Chapter 6 is set to launch on December 1, shortly after the Remix finale event concludes.</p>

                <p>Nearly a year ago, Rockstar Games debuted the first trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2025-release/1100-6518649/" data-ref-id="1100-6518649">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which marks the franchise's first sequel since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/" data-ref-id="1900-6414475">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> in 2013. Fans had been hoping that today's fiscal report for Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, would include a new GTA 6 trailer. While that didn't happen, Take-Two did confirm that the GTA sequel is still on track for a fall 2025 release.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/17/take-two-ceo-on-gta-vi-release-upswing-in-mobile-gaming.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick acknowledged that some of the company's previous games have slipped from their originally announced release dates. However, he expressed his confidence that GTA 6 would make its release window. Zelnick also stressed that the extended development of the game is more centered on enhancing the experience rather than ironing out bugs.</p><p>"In the case of an extraordinary title, for which there are extraordinary expectations, it's not really about bugs, it's about creating an experience that no one's seen before, and Rockstar Games seeks perfection in what they do," explained Zelnick. "And perfection is indeed hard to measure, it really is more subjective than objective."</p><p>The company noted in this year's fiscal statements that GTA 5 has sold 205 million copies to date across all platforms, while Red Dead Redemption 2 had 67 million copies to its name. Take-Two also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-announced-during-opening-night-live-coming-2025/1100-6525977/" data-ref-id="1100-6525977">Borderlands 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mafia-the-old-country/" data-ref-id="5000-640433">Mafia: The Old Country</a> are set to be released during the company's fiscal 2026, which should fall between April 1, 2025, and March 31, 2026. The other upcoming titles mentioned by name, CSR Racing 3 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-successor-judas-is-a-procedurally-generated-roguelite/1100-6522180/" data-ref-id="1100-6522180">Judas</a>, don't have release windows yet.</p>

			<p>In the <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/take-two-interactive-software-inc-reports-results-fiscal-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new financial report</a> for the second quarter of Take Two's fiscal year 2025, they have announced that they've sold Private Division,<a href="https://wccftech.com/private-division-is-likely-to-be-sold-or-closed-down-by-take-two/"> the company</a> behind games like OlliOlli World and, more recently, No Rest for the Wicked, which was only released in Early Access on PC in April 2024. At the moment, the buyer of Private Division is completely undisclosed, and it remains a mystery as to who could have bought them out. However, Take-Two Interactive has stated that they have purchased "substantially all of Private Divisions live and unreleased titles." This message comes with the confirmation that support for No Rest for the Wicked will continue, and the support will be continued by Take-Two themselves.</p>
<p>The stated reason for selling Private Division is that the company now wants to focus on the "core and mobile businesses for the long term." Management of Take-Two has stated that the company remains "exceedingly well-positioned for the long-term," which a clear vision in mind, and has "one of the strongest portfolios of owned intellectual property in our industry."</p>
<p>When it comes to finances, Take-Two has mentioned that they have made $1.47 billion in Net Bookings with outperformance from both the Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands franchises. GTA VI is a game that is highly anticipated by fans of the franchise, with the first trailer being shown earlier this year. However, since that trailer, there have been very few details about the game. Additionally, this year saw the release of the Borderlands movie, which didn't exactly perform as they had hoped.</p>
<p>"I am pleased to report that we delivered strong second-quarter results. Our Net Bookings of $1.47 billion were at the top of our guidance range, driven by the continued success of the Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands franchises, and our operating results surpassed our plans, largely due to a shift in the timing of marketing expenses within the year," says Strauss Zelnic, Chairman and CEO of Take-Two Interactive.</p>
<p>With this in mind, they have reiterated that they are expecting a massive increase in Net Bookings for the fiscal year 2025 and have hoped to make $5.55 to $5.65 billion. The report also states the upcoming release dates for Take-Two's future lineup, including Civilization VII, WWE 2K25, and, of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-sales-not-affected-by-launch-window-take-two-ceo-believes-expects-game-to-move-consoles-aplenty/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, which is due out in the Fall of 2025.</p>
<p>What remains to be seen is whether selling Private Division will lead to layoffs within the company. Unfortunately, this is a typical cycle when companies are sold or acquired by others in the industry.</p>
