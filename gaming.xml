		<p>The classic GameCube game Kirby Air Ride is getting a sequel with Kirby Air Riders coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby Air Riders – Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1C4XSLAacNQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Details are pretty thin on the ground outside of the reveal trailer, but we see Kirby riding on his jet-powered star and joined by three other Kirbys on a variety of different craft.</p>
<p>Kirby Air Riders is in development with Super Smash Bros. series director Masahiro Sakurai at the helm. Sakurai is a truly beloved figure for the openness with which he led Smash Bros. development over the past decades, often in the foreground to demo new fighters that were coming to the smash hit series. Given the labour of love that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/super-smash-bros-ultimate">Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> was for him, it’s great to see that he’s taken a bit of a break from the series to lead a different classic series revival.</p>

			<p>Today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> presentation was a wave of new information about Nintendo's hotly anticipated console, and some of the first-party Nintendo games that will be available on the console either at launch, or later this year.</p>
<p>We also got confirmation for a number of third-party titles that will be available on the Nintendo Switch 2, including Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, Hades 2, Hitman: World of Assassination, Hogwarts Legacy, Star Wars: Outlaws, and more.</p>
<p>Some of these games are classified as specific editions, like how Elden Ring for Nintendo Switch 2 isn't just called "<em>Elden Ring</em>," but instead is called "<em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition,</em>" which in the case of Elden Ring signifies that this version of the game will include the base game and the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion.</p>
<p>The Tarnished Edition will also include new customizations for Torrent, new weapons, and new armor, when it arrives on Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>Some of the games confirmed were also brand new announcements, like a new FromSoftware game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/">The Duskbloods</a>, or Enter the Gungeon 2. We also got a reiterated confirmation that Hollow Knight: Silksong is indeed planned to release sometime later in 2025.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition however, has been confirmed to launch alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, 2025.</p>
<p>But on the note of release dates, we don't know when each of these games will release, as some of them came with specific release dates, while others just had a release window for 2025, and others still had no release date attached to them at all.</p>

			<p>A new game by FromSoftware called The Duskbloods is coming exclusively to Nintendo Switch 2 next year.</p>
<p>Announced during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXUmjX7DsP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct</a>, the next game by the renowned development studio will be a brand-new multiplayer title sporting a rather eerie setting and atmosphere not too different from Bloodborne's and a deep dive into what feels like a vampire-themed story, so much so that the game almost feels like a new entry in the Castlevania series. Sadly, details are scarce at the moment, but judging from the trailer below, it seems like the game will share some similarities with Elden Ring: Nightreign, especially regarding characters' mobility. Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to learn more about the game, as a developer diary series called Creator's Voice featuring director Hidetaka Miyazaki will be coming on April 4th.</p>

<p>Before The Duskbloods launches next year exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2, although it will likely be a timed exclusive, FromSoftware will release the aforementioned Elden Ring: Nightreign next month on PC and consoles. You can learn more about the multiplayer game featuring roguelike mechanics set in the same world of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">2022 Game of the Year</a>, which is also launching on Nintendo Switch 2, by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/">hands-on preview</a> of the closed beta.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th. It'll boast <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">a 1080p screen</a>, a 4K-compatible dock, and support for up to 120fps, with 256GB of storage and backwards compatibility with original Switch games.</p>

<p>What's more, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online" rel="nofollow">GameCube games will also be available</a> as part of the console's Switch Online library, although you will need an Expansion Pack membership to take advantage of that.</p>

<p>Pre-orders for the Switch 2 will open on April 8th, although it sounds like only "selected Nintendo Switch Online members" will be invited to pre-order the console first, with pre-orders subsequently opening up to more people. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/641537/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo is releasing a new 3D <em>Donkey Kong</em> game that will be an exclusive for the Nintendo Switch 2. The game, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, will release on July 17th, which is a little more than a month after the June 5th launch of the Switch 2.</p><p><em>Bananza</em> is a 3D platformer that gives DK a new look that’s seemingly inspired by his appearance in <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>. “Explore a vast underground world—by smashing your way through it!” according to the description of Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIddsPkdX9U">YouTube trailer for the game</a>. “Bash, throw, and climb through just about anything in DK’s brand-new 3D platforming action-adventure game!”</p><p>In the trailer, you can see DK scaling walls like a super-powered Link from <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, picking up and tossing rocks to smash through enemies and walls, and digging into the ground with his fists. There also looks to be old-school 2D sections and mine cart rides.</p><p>The game looks full of energy — DK and various characters in the trailer are really expressive and fun. It’s a shame it won’t launch at the same time as the Switch 2, but at least we won’t have to wait too much longer after the system releases to play the game.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572264/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review-nintendo-switch-zelda-botw-prequel"><em>Hyrule Warrior</em>s: <em>Age of Calamity</em></a>, <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> is another prequel whose story connects directly with the larger tale unfolding in <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">Breath of the Wild</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">Tears of the Kingdom</a></em>. But this time around, the game looks even farther back into the past to focus on the battle Princess Zelda fought alongside King Rauru against Ganondorf.</p><p>A brief trailer for the game highlighted how <em>Age of Imprisonment </em>will allow you to play as Zelda and Rauru as you fight against hordes of Hylian monsters. Nintendo didn’t reveal much about the new game’s plot, but announced that it’s set for release this winter.</p><p>The <em>Zelda </em>franchise played a key role in the original Switch’s success. <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, which was also one of the last Wii U titles, quickly became one of the handheld console’s bestselling games and a critical darling that kicked off a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">new era of open-world gaming</a>. The Switch gave Nintendo a chance to double down on <em>Zelda</em> spinoffs like the <em>Hyrule Warriors </em>series and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18677194/cadence-of-hyrule-crypt-of-the-necrodancer-zelda-nintendo-hands-on-release-date-e3-2019">Cadence of Hyrule</a></em>.</p><div><p>The company kept its <em>Zelda </em>momentum going with updated versions of classics like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20871958/legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review-nintendo-switch-updates-graphics">Link’s Awakening</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22576029/legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-review-nintendo-switch">Skyward Sword</a></em>. And even though the first Switch was nearing the end of its life cycle, Nintendo pushed the series even further into the future with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">Tears of the Kingdom</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch">Echoes of Wisdom</a></em>. The way <em>Zelda </em>flourished on the Switch is undoubtedly part of why the franchise is being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638133/legend-of-zelda-movie-premiere-date-2027">adapted into a live-action movie</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-of-legend-of-zelda-producer-eiji-aonuma-at-universal-studios-pulled-offline">seemingly getting the theme park treatment</a>. And now we know a bit more about how the princess’s legend will continue with the Switch 2.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Game Chat feature also lets you watch each other’s screens, too.</p><p>The Direct also showed off a new separate camera peripheral that shows your face laid over a game like a Zoom call with a backdrop, or places your lovely visage in various avatar bubbles in games.</p><p>And yes, you’ll need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to use this feature, though it will be free for a limited time so you can try it out.</p><p><strong>The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera launches with the Switch 2.</strong></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="83fca080a9401d6e798f00b12f4be76a" data-recommend-id="image://83fca080a9401d6e798f00b12f4be76a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the GameShare feature on Switch 2 working with other Switch platforms." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the GameShare feature on Switch 2 working with other Switch platforms." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="83fca080a9401d6e798f00b12f4be76a" data-recommend-id="image://83fca080a9401d6e798f00b12f4be76a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the GameShare feature on Switch 2 working with other Switch platforms." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Co-operative play on the Switch 2 looks to be more flexible than ever. This new feature lets you share a game locally with other Switch 2 systems and even the aging original Switch.</p></div><div><p>With a 7.9-inch screen, the Switch 2 doubles the pixels of the original without getting any thicker. The screen is 1080p with a 120Hz refresh rate. And even though its just an LCD, it features HDR support to make colors look nice and vivid.</p><p>The JoyCons are magnetically attached as many suspected, with bigger SL and SR buttons, so horizontal play is easier. The JoyCons can also be used as a mouse, which should make first-person shooters even more fun on the device.</p><p>Here’s a fun one: with headphones, the Switch 2 features 3D audio, a technology that simulates surround sound.</p><p>The console itself features an improved kickstand and <em>two</em> USB-C ports, letting you charge the device while using extra peripherals. </p><p>The new system also includes 256GB internal storage, thank god.</p><p>The new Dock enables 4k resolution (!) when playing in Docked mode. The Dock also features a fan, so its a bit more substantial than the old plastic brick we’ve all been used to.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b0e40f61d52ee2f28361851d240efcff" data-recommend-id="image://b0e40f61d52ee2f28361851d240efcff" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A 3D version of the JoyCon shows avatars walking around it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A 3D version of the JoyCon shows avatars walking around it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b0e40f61d52ee2f28361851d240efcff" data-recommend-id="image://b0e40f61d52ee2f28361851d240efcff" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A 3D version of the JoyCon shows avatars walking around it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This Switch 2-exclusive game lets you virtually explore the Switch 2 and its various features (not too dissimilar to <em>Astro’s Playroom</em> on PS5 from the looks of things). <br></p><p><strong><em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour </em>is a paid launch title for Switch 2.</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dd684d929a1264723bbc8323017553cd" data-recommend-id="image://dd684d929a1264723bbc8323017553cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows two different-colored Switch carts." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows two different-colored Switch carts." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dd684d929a1264723bbc8323017553cd" data-recommend-id="image://dd684d929a1264723bbc8323017553cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows two different-colored Switch carts." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Switch 2 Game Card is the same size as the original Switch cartridge, though now its a fancy red color to help distinguish them.</p><p>The Switch 2 will also support upgraded Switch-exclusive SD cards, but not the OG yellow ones.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="37177b4836098648c3d6a902e7688f29" data-recommend-id="image://37177b4836098648c3d6a902e7688f29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshots shows the Switch 2 Pro controller." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshots shows the Switch 2 Pro controller." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="37177b4836098648c3d6a902e7688f29" data-recommend-id="image://37177b4836098648c3d6a902e7688f29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshots shows the Switch 2 Pro controller." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Switch 2 Pro Controller not only features the Switch 2's new C-button, but it also has rear, assignable buttons.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a31bf7e2554d42f0bb22e0f1e6d5f05a" data-recommend-id="image://a31bf7e2554d42f0bb22e0f1e6d5f05a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Switch 2 console and dock with the June 5, 2025 release date written underneath it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Switch 2 console and dock with the June 5, 2025 release date written underneath it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a31bf7e2554d42f0bb22e0f1e6d5f05a" data-recommend-id="image://a31bf7e2554d42f0bb22e0f1e6d5f05a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Switch 2 console and dock with the June 5, 2025 release date written underneath it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll be playing the Switch 2 this summer, June 5, 2025!

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> might be promising exciting new instalments of classic franchises (like, say, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-announced-as-switch-2-launch-title-complete-with-24-player-races-new-modes-and-more">open-world Mario Kart</a>), but Nintendo's now also confirmed it'll be releasing special enhanced editions of original Switch games featuring higher resolutions, improved frame rates, and more.
</p>
<p>
While the company is yet to share an exhaustive list of games getting the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition treatment (as it's calling the initiative), the following are so far confirmed: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, Metroid Prime: Beyond, and Pokemon Legends Z-A.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo Switch 2 Editions will be available to purchase physically and digitally, but players who already own the original Switch versions can alternatively purchase an upgrade pack to gain access to the new Switch 2-exclusive features. Upgrade prices haven't yet been revealed, but Nintendo <em>has</em> confirmed - via a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiLoePc9tds">post-Direct trailer</a> - the Zelda upgrades will be free to anyone with a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership.

<figcaption>Here's a look at Zelda's Switch 2 enhancements.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiLoePc9tds" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Starting with Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, these'll both get enhanced resolution and improved frame rates on Switch 2, alongside support for HDR, and a number of brand-new features. Zelda Notes, for instance, is a available via the Nintendo Switch App on smart devices and offers a range of helpful tools to get the most out of your Zelda-ing, such as pointers toward shrines and Korok locations - and it'll even read out directions so you don't need to be looking at the screen. Additionally, Tears of the Kingdom players can upload their creations to the app then share them with other players.
</p>
<p>
Kirby and the Forgotten Land, meanwhile, is getting additional story content in its Nintendo Switch 2 Edition - taking place after the Forgotten Land has been struck by a mysterious meteor - alongside improved graphics and frame rates. And as for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, its Switch 2 Edition adds support for mouse controls in addition to its standard control scheme. Switch 2 players also get several fidelity options: it's playable at 4K and 60fps with HDR in Quality Mode, and at 1080p/120fps with HDR in Performance mode.
</p>
<p>
Pokemon Legends Z-A is also set to received a Switch 2 Edition which similarly promises enhanced resolution and frame rates, and there are improvements coming to Super Mario Party Jamboree.
</p>
<p>
Zelda and Mario Party's Switch 2 Editions and their associated upgrades will be available <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">when the console launches on 5th June</a>, with Kirby to follow on 28th August.

<h2>Switch 2 release date</h2>
<p>The <strong>Switch 2 will be released on Thursday 5th June</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes - that is the promised day! Make it down on your calendars, definitely don't skip school (I won't tell on you) or book the day off work (cos I definitely can't…). This date also marks the release of the Switch 2 launch titles, which you'll find listed down below.</p>
<h2>Switch 2 price</h2>
<p>The <strong>Switch 2 will be £395.99</strong> or the equivalent pricing tier in your local currency.</p>
<p>The <strong>Switch 2 and Mario Kart World bundle will cost £429.99</strong> or the equivalent pricing tier in your local currency.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this pricing only covers the base console from Nintendo and the prices listed above are from the official My Nintendo Store. The cost will obviously rise if you purchase games and other additions, like extra controllers. It may also differ between realtors and you should be very careful of scalpers or scams.</p>
<p>Here's a quick rundown of the prices for the Switch 2 related prices copied verbatim from the My Nintendo Store:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch 2 Console - £395.99</li>
<li>Switch 2 Console and Mario Kart World Bundle - £429.99</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller - £74.99</li>
<li>Nintendo GameCube (GCN) Controller - Nintendo Classics - £58.99</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2 Camera - £49.99</li>
<li>microSD Express Card - £49.99</li>
<li>Digital Mario Kart World - £66.99</li>
<li>Physical Mario Kart World - £74.99</li>
</ul>
<h2>Switch 2 preorder</h2>
<p>You'll be able to <strong>preorder the Switch 2 on Tuesday 8th April</strong>.</p>
<p>Pre-orders for <strong>Switch 2 digital games, upgrade packs and Amiibo</strong> will <strong>begin on Thursday 24th April</strong>.</p>
<p>If you're planning on pre-ordering the Switch 2 from the offical My Nintendo Store, then you'll have to hope you first recieve an email from the My Nintendo Store. This is because, at first, the ability to preorder the Switch 2 from this storefront will be done on an invite-only basis for select Nintendo Switch Online members.</p>
<p>You'll find the requirements for receiving said invite below and keep in mind eligibility is based upon data as of March 31st 2025:</p>
<p><strong>Nintendo Switch Online Membership Status</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have been a Nintendo Switch Online member for at least two years continuously by Monday 31st March 2025.</li>
<li>This membership must be active on the your pre-order is placed.</li>
<li>For family memberships, the person who purchased the membership will be eligible.</li>
<li>Other people in the family membership are not eligible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Play Time</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spent a certain amount of time playing purchased / paid Nintendo Switch games, prioritising those with more playtime.</li>
<li>Sharing usage information with Nintendo.</li>
<li>Opted in to share usage information with Nintendo to customise offers and recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Receive email messages from Nintendo</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Opted in to receive promotional emails and messages from Nintendo.</li>
<li>Be opted in on the day the invitation email is sent.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above criteria thersholds may be lowered over time so more people can pre-order from the My Nintendo Store. Yet, Nintendo will still be focused on priortising the most dedicated Nintendo Switch players and it will depend on stock.</p>

<h2>Mario Kart World announced</h2>
<p>We all knew it was coming but the Nintendo Direct fully confirmed that Mario Kart World is going to be one of the Switch 2 launch games. Once again you'll be able to face against characters from the Mario franchise - be it in a kart or on a motorbike. Mario Kart World brings weather conditions and changes to the time of day too! Best of all, you're no longer subject to the rules of the tracks and even have to drive between the tracks you race on.</p>
<p>There will be a Mario Kart World direct on Thursday 17th April at 2pm (local time).</p>

<h2>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment announced</h2>
<p>A new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyrule-warriors">Hyrule Warriors</a> game is coming for the Switch 2 - Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment. Much like the previous Hyrule Warriors game, Age of Calamity, this will take a look at events in Hyrule's past. In this case it will be events Zelda experienced during <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a> as you'll fight against Ganondorf during his original invasion of Hyrule (at least during this timeline).</p>
<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment will be released on the Switch 2 in Winter 2025.</p>

<h2>Kirby Air Riders announced</h2>
<p>The Switch 2 Direct began with Marion Kart World and, as it came to a close, we got a look at Kirby Air Riders. The sequel to the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-air-ride">Kirby Air Ride</a> (released over twenty years ago) will be released later in 2025.</p>

<h2>Switch 2 system details explained</h2>
<p>Here's everything we know about the <strong>Switch 2 system</strong> we know so far - from its <strong>hardware</strong>, <strong>controllers </strong>and<strong> internal software</strong>. We wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo is still keeping some secrets though, so we recommend keeping an eye on our 'Everything we know about Switch 2 guide' as we'll be updating that every time new information is announced.</p>
<h3>Joy-Con 2 Mouse Controls</h3>
<p>The Joy-Con 2 controllers will come with mouse controls, which can be accessed by detaching the controls from the Switch 2 and placing them flat down on a surface. Doing so will let you use them just like a computer mouse! Though, since this is Nintendo, there are some motion controls as well.</p>
<p>During the Nintendo Direct, we got a look at Drag x Drive - a game coming in Summer 2025 where these mouse controllers will be fully utilised. Drag x Drive is a three versus three basketball game.</p>
<p>Here's hoping the days pass quickly until it launches, but slowly after the Switch 2 is in our hands!</p>

            <p>Now, you may not know this about me, but along with being quite the Nintendo fan, I am also a HUGE James Bond fan. So, when Nintendo teased a particular spy was going to be coming to its Switch successor, well, my ears pricked up.</p>
<p>Yes, IOI's upcoming James Bond game will be making its suave and DJ wearing way to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, as will Agent 47 with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman World of Assassination</a>.</p>
<p>Reader, when that Bond music played, I squealed, prompting a rather confused look from my husband who sits across from me (for the record, he asked me to marry him). Anyway, Project 007, as it is currently known, will be on Switch 2. But, alas I am not sure when exactly. So far, the only teasers we have had feature the barrel of a gun. But, even so, I am excited and then some.</p>

<p>IO first announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-io-reveals-fresh-project">James Bond game back in 2021</a>. Very little has been shared on it since, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-io-opens-up-a-little-about-its-james-bond-007-game">our Bertie managed to tease a few extra 00-details out of the team back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, IOI said it hopes its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">upcoming James Bond origin story will be the start of a trilogy</a>.</p>

		<p>Nintendo revealed Donkey Kong Bananza for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, coming to the new console on 17th July 2025, just a month and a half after the Switch 2’s June debut.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza – Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z_EIYSSl3cY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Donkey Kong Banaza is the first fully 3D platformer in the DK series since the N64’s Donkey Kong 64, and so the gameplay here is dramatically different and more modern than Rare’s 90s classic.</p>
<p>There’s a big emphasis on DK’s strength, letting him just smash through enemies, smash through walls, and even smash down into the ground…. then use chunks of the ground to smash more stuff around him!</p>
<p>there’s a lot of great looking 3D platforming here, with big camera sweeps that shift the perspective an awful lot. Donkey kong has been given a big restyle to match the updated look of the character from the Super Mario Bros. movie.</p>

<p>There’s no real clue what the story will be this time, but we’d put some money down on the gallery of crazed baddies having stolen his banana haul. What does seem to have also happened is DK having made a friend with a purple crystalline looking creature.</p>

			<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is getting significantly upgraded on Nintendo Switch 2, with support for two different display modes supporting high resolution and framerates.</p>
<p>As confirmed during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTVeYm4iIM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct</a>, the fourth entry in the series launching later this year worldwide will also receive a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, which will take advantage of the system's power to offer two display modes. In Quality Mode, the game will run in docked mode at 4K resolution, 60 FPS with HDR support, and at 1080p, 60 FPS with HDR support in handheld mode. In Performance Mode, the game will run at 1080p resolution, 120 FPS with HDR support, and 720p resolution, 120 FPS and HDR in handheld mode. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on Nintendo Switch 2 will also support the new Joy-Con 2 mouse functionality, which is sure to make the experience even better.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a release date has yet to be officially confirmed for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, so we still don't know when we will be able to experience Samus Aran's new adventure and some of the game's mechanics, which include the Psychic Abilities shown in the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-new-gameplay-trailer-introduces-psychic-abilities-and-more/">latest trailer</a> last week. These abilities promise to spice up the experience considerably as they will allow Samus to operate mechanisms, open doors, control the trajectory of beams, and more.</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-first-trailer-release-date/">2025 release date</a> on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

			<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are two of the games getting upgraded versions for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">Nintendo Switch 2. </a></p>
<p>These new upgraded versions will be classified as the "Nintendo Switch 2 Editions" of each game, and if you already own either game, or any of the games that are getting a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, you'll be able to get the new version by purchasing an upgrade pack.</p>
<p>Both games will enjoy improved visuals and framerates, with HDR compatibility added for both titles that are surely to make the painted art style for each game pop and look better than it has before.</p>
<p>Nintendo also revealed that the Nintendo Switch Online app would be renamed to the Nintendo Switch app and will include a "Zelda Notes" section that will provide helpful tips to players while they're exploring Hyrule, as well as allow Tears of the Kingdom users to easily share their creations.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda games – Nintendo Switch 2 Editions &amp; ZELDA NOTES – Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dmDD7JSfhcE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We don't yet know how much the upgrades are going to cost, though if you've yet to buy either Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom, it would be a good bet that both games are going to be available at the regular full price for brand-new Nintendo games.</p>

Xbox showed a new trailer for it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/12/22175400/hollow-knight-silksong-sequel-xbox-game-pass-trailer">in June 2022</a> and said it would be available within 12 months. The game was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/9/23717855/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed">delayed shortly before that deadline</a>. The game was announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/16/23356667/hollow-knight-silksong-playstation-ps5-ps4-still-no-release-date">for PlayStation, too</a>. And in January, Matthew Griffin, who works on marketing and publishing for <em>Silksong</em>, <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696">stated that</a> “the game is real, progressing and will release.”</p><div><p>Now that the game has a release window, it might almost be time to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-in-clown-makeup">take off our clown makeup</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo says they will have “clearer image quality” and higher resolution than the original releases.</p><p>Nintendo also promised that games like <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>, <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>, <em>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</em>, <em>Super Mario Strikers</em>, <em>Chibi-Robo! Plug Into Adventure</em>, <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em>, and <em>Pokémon Colosseum</em> will be available on the service.</p><p>The GameCube game library will launch on the same day as the Switch 2, June 5th, and will be available as part of the Nintendo Switch Online: Expansion Pack.</p><p>Since its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17874798/nintendo-switch-online-launch-subscription">launch in 2018</a>, Nintendo’s slowly built up its online subscription service by offering games from console generations past, alongside other neat features. In addition to enabling cloud saves and online play, the base service offers players access to games from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/17/18185533/nintendo-switch-online-classic-nes-games-blaster-master-zelda-2">the NES, SNES, and Game Boy libraries</a>, along with the recently added <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284073/nintendo-music-streaming-app-switch-online-subscribers">Nintendo Music app</a>. The more expensive Expansion Pack subscription adds games from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591722/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-advance-games-expansion-pack">Game Boy Advance</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688780/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-64-sega-genesis-controllers">Nintendo 64, and Sega Genesis</a>, plus DLC from <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, <em>Animal Crossing</em>, and <em>Splatoon 3</em>.</p><div><p>Before this addition, GameCube games weren’t totally absent from the Switch. Nintendo has remastered or ported a handful of games to the system over the years, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/9/23592822/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-best-way-classic"><em>Metroid Prime </em>and<em> Metroid Prime 2</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/14/23873435/nintendo-switch-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-trailer"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438499/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Sunshine</em></a> (before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307522/mario-limited-time-nintendo-switch-disney-vault">yanking the collection that contained <em>Sunshine</em> from stores</a>).</p></div><p>Last year, Nintendo conducted a secretive online playtest that was initially thought to be for GameCube games with online multiplayer features. That test <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo">was actually for an MMO</a>, but at least Nintendo was a little late in adding GameCube games, rather than never doing it at all.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The critically acclaimed games will feature “enhanced resolution and frame rates” and HDR support. Nintendo didn’t go into specifics on those upgrades, but the titles were running at a perfectly smooth 60fps during the stream.</p><p>Both titles pushed the original Switch hardware to its limits with occasional frame rate drops, so if Nintendo is able to deliver buttery-smooth gameplay on the new console, many early buyers will be happy to replay these classics.</p><p>The company also demonstrated a new second-screen experience in its Nintendo Switch app for Android and iOS. A “Zelda’s Notes” feature will be able to show your location on a map in the massive world of either game, and it can help guide you to shrines and koroks that you haven’t yet discovered. “It’s a game-specific service that’s exclusive to the Switch 2 Editions of these titles,” the company said.</p><p>If you already own the original games, the upgrades will be available as separate purchases or at no additional cost if you have a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch Online app will be renamed to a simpler “Nintendo Switch” at the end of May, Nintendo confirmed during the stream.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Now that Nintendo has finally given us the rundown on the Switch 2, we can finally answer one of the biggest questions we had about the new console: “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637523/nintendo-today-switch-2-c-button-leak">what’s the deal with that ‘C’ button?</a>”</p><p>The button, present on the right Joy-Con directly below the home button, is square and marked with a “C.” The mysterious new button was shown briefly in the video debuting the Switch back in February and was present in every mock-up and leak of the console. In the Switch 2 Direct, Nintendo finally revealed the purpose of the button, a new feature called GameChat.</p><p>As its name implies, GameChat enables Switch 2 players to communicate using the console’s built-in microphone. Nintendo noted how the Switch 2’s microphone will feature background noise filtering to ensure that GameChat calls come through clearly. In addition to giving people a way to talk directly to one another, GameChat also features screen sharing functionality that will allow you to broadcast your gaming to friends on group calls. Notably, you will <em>not</em> have to be playing the same game while using GameChat, meaning that people within a call will be able to play and screen-share different titles simultaneously. And for gamers looking to see one another’s faces, GameChat will support video calls by connecting to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch">the new Nintendo Switch 2 camera peripheral</a>.</p><p>In a press release, Nintendo said parents looking to monitor their children’s use of GameChat will be able to enable or disable the feature through the Nintendo Switch Parental Control smartphone app.</p><p>The GameChat feature represents a major step forward in Nintendo’s social gaming offerings. Of the three major manufacturers, Nintendo was the only one that did not have a way for players to communicate with their friends via the console. Shortly after the launch of the original Switch, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/18/15995098/nintendo-switch-online-app-out-now-ios-android">Nintendo released a mobile app</a> that let users participate in voice chat for select games, but it’s awkward to use an app for a feature that comes standard in other consoles.</p><p>Nintendo <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fwhats-new-with-nintendo-switch-online-on-nintendo-switch-2%2F" rel="sponsored">also announced today</a> that it plans to rename the Switch’s smartphone app — it’s just called “the Nintendo Switch app” now — which will continue to offer voice chat functionality for certain games OG Switch like <em>Splatoon 3 </em>and <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>. The Nintendo Switch app will also debut a new service called Zelda Notes, that “supports players on their adventures in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.”</p><p>As a whole, all of GameChat’s features make it feel like Nintendo set out to bake some of Discord’s core features directly into its newest console. It’s a bold move for the company given its history of making this kind of communication more cumbersome than you would expect, but these are exactly the kind of moves that are (almost assuredly) going to make the Switch 2 sell like hotcakes.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will release in 2025, according to a showcase reel for Nintendo’s upcoming Steam Decklike, the Switch 2. Imagine dropping release details for a game as hotly, wildly, despairingly anticipated as Silksong in an effing montage video. Because that is what Uncle Mario did.</p>
<p>The game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTVeYm4iIM">appears in the showcase</a> for a handful of seconds, so there’s not much more to tell, but it’s nice to have something tangible after years of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fans-uncover-another-hollow-knight-silksong-character-in-team-cherrys-riddle">Team Cherry teaser campaigns</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unless-this-cake-is-lying-to-you-silksong-will-reappear-in-april">fan conspiracies about cake</a>. There were a few more concrete indications that Silksong would grace the Switch 2’s software reveal. Earlier this month, the developers updated the Steam page, changing the copyright date to 2025.</p>

<p>Team Cherry revealed Silksong back at E3 2019. It stars the balletic stilleto-wielding Hornet - a boss from the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> - and takes place in the new kingdom of Pharloom. It's about journeying upward through a realm "haunted by Silk and Song".</p>
