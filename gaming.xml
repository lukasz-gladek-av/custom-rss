			<p>2025 is going to see a lot of massive releases across a multitude of genres. Narrowing it down to the sports and racing games in particular, there are a fair few games that are going to be released this year that will be major hits for petrolheads and sports fans. If you want to know what games you should be putting on your calendar this year, make sure to keep reading for Wccftech's most anticipated sports and racing games of 2025.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2025-new-scares-inbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a></em></p>

<h2>Assetto Corsa EVO (Out Now on PC via Steam)</h2>
<p>Assetto Corsa is a very popular racing game franchise, and the latest iteration has just been released, albeit on early access. There isn't a date set yet for when Assetto Corsa EVO is going to be on consoles just yet, so those on console will have to wait a little bit longer for this hyperrealistic racing game. What we do know is that Assetto Corsa EVO is set to have its full launch between September and December. The game will feature extensive modding support, as well as consistent updates to keep the game fresh once it has experienced its full launch, when it will include 100 cars and 15 officially licensed circuits (with 5 more tracks following afterward as free updates). Before that, KUNOS <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-evo-to-get-open-world-map-in-summer-2025-early-access-begins-january-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will add an open world map sometime this Summer</a>.</p>
<p>If you jump in right now, though, you'll already find 20 cars from several classes and 5 circuits across the continents: Laguna Seca (America), Brands Hatch and Imola (Europe), Mount Panorama (Australia), and Suzuka (Japan). When it comes to modes, the early access launch build features Practice sessions, Quick Races, the brand new Driving Academy, and the Hotstint and Test Drive special events.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>WWE 2K25 (March 2025)</h2>
<p>WWE is a popular franchise that helps boost profits for both Take-Two Interactive. This game was mentioned during the earnings call, where they mentioned both the potential release of PGA Tour 2K25 and, of course, WWE 2K25. Since 2000, WWE has received a new game every year except for 2021, where there was no game released at all. Since then, it's gone back to regular scheduling, and it's likely that WWE 2K25 will be released this year. It doesn't have a set release date as of yet, but it was mentioned in the earnings call that the game will be released before March 31, 2025. This would make sense, as the past three WWE games (including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much-improved WWE 2K24</a>) were all released in early March.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>iRacing NASCAR 25 (Fall 2025 - PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>It's been a long time coming, but NASCAR fans are finally getting a new game in the franchise. It's been three years since the last iteration aside from NASCAR 21: Ignition, but most people don't count that as an actual game in the series. iRacing NASCAR 25 was first heard of in 2023, when iRacing purchased the NASCAR license from Motorsport Games. This game will be built in Unreal Engine alongside Monster Games and is currently planned to launch on consoles, while a PC release is still up in the air.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/maxresdefault-14-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds (TBA - All Platforms)</h2>
<p>This game was first showcased at The Game Awards 2024, where Sega released a trailer for this upcoming game. The release date is currently unknown, but it is set to debut "soon." All we know is that the developers have promised a distinct racing mechanic that will 'transport Sonic racing fans into a new dimension.'</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be available across all platforms (including Nintendo's) and, like its predecessor <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/team-sonic-racing-better-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Team Sonic Racing</a>, could be the perfect game to get youngsters into gaming and engage in some friendly competition.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Wreckfest_2_Keyart-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Wreckfest 2 (TBA 2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>Throughout the whole sports and racing games genre, there isn't anything quite like Wreckfest. The spiritual successor to FlatOut <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckfest-2-announced-with-new-car-customization-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returns in 2025</a> after 2018's first installment. We don't know a lot about it yet, although Finnish developer Bugbear Entertainment has promised improved destruction thanks to the more accurate physics engine and better sounds, with the latter being boasted as among the best in a racing title. So far, the main new feature is the ability to customize your vehicle. More info will undoubtedly be shared ahead of the launch.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-snap-goes-offline-in-the-usa-as-part-of-the-bytedance-apps-ban.1086411/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/19/marvel-snap-goes-offline-in-the-usa-as-part-of-the-bytedance-apps-ban/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>From today, mobile users in the United States of America cannot access any apps that are owned by the Chinese company ByteDance Ltd. ByteDance Ltd has ceased operations following the upholding of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which bans any foreign adversary apps from essentially operating in the USA. The biggest app shutdown is TikTok, which was the primary target of the legislation. However, in the app US users will see that ByteDance is hoping the app will be back online, saying they hope President Trump will work with them.</p>
<p>One unexpected app shutdown is Marvel Snap, which developers Second Dinner and publisher Nuverse did not expect. Nuverse is a subsidiary of ByteDance Ltd, and falls under the ban brought in with the legislation. Ben Brode, co-founder of Second Dinner, released the following statement regarding the banning of Marvel Snap on social media, including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benbrode.bsky.social">BlueSky</a>.</p>


<p><em>“Unfortunately, MARVEL SNAP is temporarily unavailable in U.S. app stores and is unavailable to play in the U.S. This was a surprise to Second Dinner and our publisher Nuverse. We’re actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share.”</em></p>
<p>In a follow up post, Ben has said that US players using VPNs should be able to get around the ban and continue playing Marvel Snap. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121596">Apple</a> has also created a support page regarding the Bytedance apps ban, and listed the following apps as no longer available in the US.</p>

<ul>
<li>TikTok</li>
<li>TikTok Studio</li>
<li>TikTok Shop Seller Center</li>
<li>CapCut</li>
<li>Lemon8</li>
<li>Hypic</li>
<li>Lark – Team Collaboration</li>
<li>Lark – Rooms Display</li>
<li>Lark Rooms Controller</li>
<li>Gauth: AI Study Companion</li>
<li>MARVEL SNAP</li>
</ul>
<p>It is currently unknown if the ban will remain in place, with incoming President Trump stating he is likely to give TikTok, and by extension ByteDance, a 90 day reprieve when he takes office. That would overrule the Supreme Court’s ruling of upholding the ban. This is a change in the message from Trump’s previous term in office where he publicly stated opposition to TikTok and was in support of a ban, as reported by <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-tiktok-timeline-1.7432843">CBC</a>.</p>
<p><em>Source:<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benbrode.bsky.social"> BlueSky</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121596">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-tiktok-timeline-1.7432843">CBC</a>.</em></p>

Welcome to <em>Installer</em> No. 67, your guide to the best and <em>Verge</em>-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, happy Switch week, and also you can read all the old editions at the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/installer-newsletter"><em>Installer</em> homepage</a>.)&nbsp;</p><div><p>This week, I’ve been watching <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/225385-black-doves?language=en-US"><em><strong>Black Doves</strong></em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1167027-ibelin?language=en-US"><em><strong>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin</strong></em></a>, reading about <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/01/20/lorne-michaels-profile"><strong>Lorne Michaels</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2025/01/13/the-tickling-of-the-bulls-a-rodeo-at-madison-square-garden/"><strong>rodeos</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/how-ben-shapiro-conquered-maga-verse-trump-1236104674/"><strong>Ben Shapiro</strong></a><strong>, </strong>restarting <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/1920-twin-peaks?language=en-US"><em><strong>Twin Peaks</strong></em></a> in honor of David Lynch, wading nervously into <a href="https://www.lemon8-app.com/"><strong>Lemon8</strong></a> and <a href="https://rednoteapp.io/"><strong>RedNote</strong></a><strong>, </strong>catching up on old episodes of <a href="https://www.birbigs.com/working-it-out-pod"><em><strong>Working It Out</strong></em></a><em>, </em>and watching altogether too many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVbo_cbHZP0"><strong><em>Balatro </em>strategy videos</strong></a>.</p></div><p>I also have for you my most anticipated gadget of the year, the new season of <em>Severance</em>, an incredibly cool tech design exhibit to explore, a nifty new AI productivity tool, and much more. This week has been <em>wild, </em>with the potential TikTok ban and the upcoming US inauguration and seemingly 40,000 other things happening — but we’ve got some great ways to decompress. Let’s dive in.</p><p>(As always, the best part of <em>Installer</em> is your ideas and tips. What are you reading / watching / playing / cooking / building / cutting into small pieces this week?

But I’ve seen enough. This is the Switch successor I was hoping for.</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/95396-severance?language=en-US"><strong><em>Severance </em>season 2</strong></a><strong>. </strong>I just rewatched the first season and loved it even more the second time. One of my favorite shows in years, and by all accounts, the second season is worth the wait. I’d put the first season up against any season of anything, so that’s high praise.</li><li><a href="https://nokiadesignarchive.aalto.fi/"><strong>The Nokia Design Archive</strong></a><strong>. </strong>A bunch of researchers spent several years putting together a massive, interconnected history of Nokia’s design work —&nbsp;from its wacky phone concepts to its biggest ideas about the future of everything. You could spend weeks digging around in there.</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/252174-an-update-on-our-family?language=en-US"><em><strong>An Update on Our Family</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> </em>As a still new-ish dad, I spend a <em>lot</em> of time thinking about how much of my personal and family life to share online. This story is, like, the opposite: what if you created a personal and family life <em>just</em> to share it online? It’s a wild ride.</li><li><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fdonkey-kong-country-returns-hd-switch%2F"><em><strong>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> </em>While you’re waiting on the new Switch, here’s a new game for the old one. I love Donkey Kong the way a lot of people love Zelda and Mario, so the idea of an updated, upgraded, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24343009/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review-nintendo-switch">super-challenging side-scroller</a> is exactly up my alley.</li><li><strong>“</strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8L9Z2vmMTQ"><strong>The Science of the Matrix with Laurence Fishburne</strong></a><strong>.”</strong> A somewhat unexpected episode of Neil Degrasse Tyson’s <em>StarTalk </em>podcast, but oh BOY was it fun to listen to Morpheus himself talk through red pills, the absence of spoons, and <em>The Matrix</em>’s<em> </em>deepest thoughts about everything.</li><li><a href="https://www.raycast.com/core-features/focus"><strong>Raycast Focus</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Raycast has become the first app I install on a new Mac, and I use it for everything. Love this new feature, which can block specific apps or websites —&nbsp;and uses a countdown timer to help keep you focused.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/279299-snl50-beyond-saturday-night"><em><strong>SNL50: Beyond Saturday Night</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> </em>Another one for the SNL 50th-anniversary content machine: a four-part NBC doc about some of the biggest moments in the show’s history. It’s an officially sanctioned thing, so don’t expect fireworks, but it’s a fun dive into the archives.</li><li><a href="https://chatgpt.com/tasks"><strong>ChatGPT Tasks</strong></a><strong>.</strong> A <em>super </em>basic feature so far, and pretty buggy — it invented a dentist appointment that I didn’t have? —&nbsp;but I’m really intrigued by the combination of a to-do list app and chatbot. I have it sending me a new oatmeal recipe and workout idea every morning, and it’s a pretty cool system.</li></ul></div><p><h3>Screen share</h3></p><p>It is an unintentional tradition at <em>The Verge</em> that new people always seem to start in incredibly chaotic situations. Often, it’ll be a writer’s first day on, like, the day of the iPhone launch, or they’ll be 15 minutes out of HR orientation and Elon Musk will suddenly buy Twitter. For <a href="https://www.threads.net/@todd.haselton"><strong>Todd Haselton</strong></a>, our new deputy editor for reviews and commerce, the chaos was CES. Todd started at the beginning of this year and was immediately inundated with 90,000 stories about weird gadgets nobody’s ever heard of. Welcome to the team!</p><p>I like to ask new <em>Verge</em> staffers to share their homescreen with us to see what we can learn about them by how they use their phone. You can fake it at work, but you can’t fake your phone, you know? Here’s Todd’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:</p><p><strong>The phone: </strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max. I’ve been using the biggest iPhone for years. I also have an old Galaxy Z Fold 3 that I’ve been thinking about upgrading to another folding phone.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The wallpaper: </strong>It’s a picture of me at my graduation from Lehigh University with my grandfather and my uncle, who also went to Lehigh. They’re my role models. It’s a reminder to myself to work hard and to be thankful for what I have. (My twin brother is cut off in this shot. Sorry, bro.)</p><p>My lockscreen background is a rotating picture of my family.</p><p><strong>The apps: </strong>Photos, Calendar, GroupMe, Xbox Cloud Gaming, ChatGPT, Gmail, The Verge, Messages, Phone, Safari, Camera.</p><p>David, are you sure you wanted me to do this? It might be the most boring homescreen you’ve ever published. It’s almost the default.</p><p><a href="https://groupme.com/"><strong>GroupMe</strong></a> is for staying in touch with my college friends and also where my town’s volunteer fire department keeps in touch. I haven’t been as active as I’d like to be since the summer. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fplay"><strong>Xbox Cloud Gaming</strong></a> is there because I always tell myself I’m going to have all this free time for gaming on the go. But I don’t.</p><p>The photo frame widget rotates pictures of trips I’ve taken and family members. This is a shot from my brother’s wedding in Santa Monica.</p><p>Just in case people think it’s rigged: the<em> Verge</em> icon was there before I started. I’ve been reading since the site was started, and I subscribed before I joined.</p><p><em>I also asked Todd to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he said:</em></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/172494/angle-of-repose-by-wallace-stegner/"><em><strong>Angle of Repose</strong></em></a><em> </em>by Wallace Stegner. I just started it so don’t ask me what it’s about. I spend most nights reading on a Kindle Paperwhite. If you’re looking for other recommendations, though, some other books I just finished and enjoyed: <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/678664/trust-pulitzer-prize-winner-by-hernan-diaz/"><em><strong>Trust</strong></em></a> by Hernan Diaz, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/191134/stoner-by-john-williams-introduction-by-john-mcgahern/"><em><strong>Stoner</strong></em></a> by John Williams, and <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/176616/the-little-friend-by-donna-tartt/"><em><strong>The Little Friend</strong></em></a> by Donna Tartt.</li><li>I mostly game on Friday nights with my college friends from about 9PM to 11PM. (We’re all dads now, so… early bedtimes.) It’s a ritual we started during the pandemic, and it’s a good and totally mindless way for us to stay in touch. Gamers are gonna hate, but right now, it’s <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blackops6/pc"><em><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</strong></em></a><em> </em>with the Nuketown map on repeat. Just a classic map.</li><li>I’ve been really into the McDonald’s two-cheeseburger meal. It’s a little restaurant nearby with good prices, and the burgers are solid. I <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.doordash.com%2Fbusiness%2Fmcdonalds-5579%2F"><strong>get it DoorDashed</strong></a>. Starting a new job is always a little stressful (in a good way!), and this is my stress food I guess. The Dasher is waiting for my order right now.</li></ul></div><p><h3>Crowdsourced</h3></p><p><em>Here’s what the </em>Installer<em> community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email </em><a href="mailto:installer@theverge.com"><em>installer@theverge.com</em></a><em> or message me on Signal —&nbsp;@davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week.

I’ve always struggled to stick with journaling, but this makes it effortless (it takes just 15 seconds) to capture my thoughts and details about my day.” –&nbsp;Austin</p><p>“<a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/207332-sakamoto-days"><em><strong>Sakamoto Days</strong></em></a> on Netflix. It’s an anime about the best hit man in the world who retired and settled down with a family. Extremely tropey, I know. Mostly just watching to see this cutie kick ass.” –&nbsp;Ryan</p><p>“Trying to get better at Dutch, and downloaded the excellent <a href="https://mochi.cards/"><strong>Mochi</strong></a> app. Like Anki but so much better in every way.” –&nbsp;Hannes</p><p>“I just discovered <a href="https://www.stremio.com/"><strong>Stremio</strong></a> and I have a profound feeling it will change my life forever. Okay, at least the way I consume media. With all the price hikes and many services not available in the Netherlands, this seems like a great alternative.” – Jasper</p><p>“<a href="https://www.macdroid.app/"><strong>MacDroid</strong></a>. I always back up my full-resolution photos to an external hard drive every few months in addition to Google Photos, but damn is it a pain to do that on the Mac. Tried MacDroid today and instantly signed up for a lifetime subscription. So much time and stress saved!” – Josh</p><p>“<a href="https://indianajones.bethesda.net/en-US"><em><strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</strong></em></a> on Xbox. It’s the best Indiana Jones thing made in decades. I’m shocked at how much fun it is to explore and how they hit the tone perfectly. And wow did the voice actor nail young Harrison Ford. It’s almost eerie.” – DSquiz</p><p>“I started reading <a href="https://www.viz.com/one-piece"><em><strong>One Piece</strong></em></a> from the beginning last year after watching <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/111110-one-piece"><strong>the Netflix show</strong></a> — it’s very fun, it’s lighthearted, the art’s great, and the characters are all lovable and easy to latch on to.” – Luis</p><p>“Got back into Apple Arcade JUST to play <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pocket-card-jockey-ride-on/id1604577143"><em><strong>Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On!</strong></em></a> A solitaire horse racing game developed by Game Freak (the <em>Pokemon</em> people), originally for 3DS, even though it looks SO mobile. It is amazingly fun and I cannot stop playing.” –&nbsp;Uli</p><p>“The amazing Safari extension <a href="http://safarikeywordsearch.aurlien.net/"><strong>Keyword Search</strong></a>! It allows you to run custom web searches by adding a keyword or letter, so adding ‘wiki’ or ‘yt’ will search those respective sites instead of your default search engine.” – JME&nbsp;</p><p>“Have you tried <a href="https://sparrownight.com/"><em><strong>News Tower</strong></em></a> yet? Total blast.” –&nbsp;Dave</p><p><h3>Signing off</h3></p><p>The Australian Open is happening right now, which means it’s the part of the tennis calendar where I wake up in the morning and it’s 6AM and somehow half the matches are already over and something really exciting is inevitably happening. It’s delightful. The tennis has been great, but the real story of this year’s tournament is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@australianopen"><strong>the YouTube channel</strong></a>.</p><p>For complicated rights reasons, the organization behind the Open is streaming the matches on YouTube, but not like you’d think: everything is live-animated and everyone looks like Wii Sports characters. It’s deeply bizarre and extremely hokey, but against all odds, it totally works? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/14/australian-open-avatars-helping-tennis-reach-new-audience"><strong><em>The Guardian</em> has a good story</strong></a> on how it works and why it’s necessary. I always thought these “alternative broadcasts” were just silliness, but I think there might be something here. Next year: real tennis, but make it Mario Tennis. I’ll be there.</p><p>See you next week!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> has been banned in the US.</p>
<p>Whilst 170m American TikTokers were anticipating the app's suspension after the US Supreme Court upheld a decision to ban the Chinese app over security concerns, Marvel Snap players in the US have also been impacted given publisher Nuverse is also owned by TikTok owner, ByteDance.</p>
<p>According to developer Second Dinner, the ban was every bit as much a "surprise" to the team as it was to players, too.</p>

<p>"A law banning Marvel Snap has been enacted in the US. Unfortunately, that means you can't use Marvel Snap for now.</p>

			<p>The extremely popular collectible card game Marvel Snap suddenly became inaccessible to United States users <a href="https://wccftech.com/tiktok-officially-banned-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following the TikTok ban</a> due to the implementation of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA). Here's the message that greets anyone who tries to log in (also available <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880861537981944300" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on social channels</a>):</p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, MARVEL SNAP is temporarily unavailable on U.S. stores and is unavailable to play in the U.S. In a surprise to Second Dinner and our publisher Nuverse, MARVEL SNAP was affected by the takedown of TikTok late on Saturday, January 18th.</em></p>
<p><em>MARVEL SNAP isn't going anywhere. We're actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share.</em></p>
<p>The reason is pretty straightforward: TikTok creator ByteDance owns Nuverse, the publisher of the game. All apps owned by ByteDance were banned, including Marvel Snap. However, since the game itself isn't related to TikTok at all, there may be enough wiggle room for them to restore service.</p>
<p>Developed by Second Dinner, the free-to-play game launched in October 2022 for Windows PC, Android, and iOS devices. It featured over 170 Marvel characters on release, and the roster has greatly increased over time due to weekly additions.</p>
<p>Gameplay in Marvel Snap isn't too complicated. Each player has a deck of 12 cards, each one representing a Marvel character with a cost, power level, and possibly a special ability. At the beginning of each round, players simultaneously place one or more cards face down in one of three locations. The locations are randomly assigned for each game, and each location has a unique associated effect. At the end of each round, the cards are revealed and their special abilities are triggered. Whoever has the highest power in a given location wins that location; the goal is to win two of the three locations.</p>
<p>Its relative simplicity won over many fans. Last we heard, Marvel Snap had over 22 million players and has earned more than $200 million in revenue since launch.</p>

<p>Genshin Impact’s publisher has met the long arm of the law in the courts against the Federal Trade Commission. Following a recent legal battle, the FTC has ordered Cognosphere (HoYoverse) to pay a $20 million settlement for ‘selling lootboxes to teens’. Also, the developer and publisher will be banned from selling such content to anyone under the age of 16.</p>



<p>Get the full results from this justice journey below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-genshin-impact-deceived-children">‘Genshin Impact Deceived Children’</h2>



<p>The FTC has ordered Genshin Impact’s publisher to pay a whopping $20 million in damages after a complaint was filed by the Department of Justice against the game’s lootbox mechanics.</p>



<p>In a statement issued by Samuel Levine, the Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, it was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Genshin Impact deceived children, teens, and other players into spending hundreds of dollars on prizes they stood little chance of winning.</p>



<p>Companies that deploy these dark-pattern tactics will be held accountable if they deceive players, particularly kids and teens, about the true costs of in-game transactions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>HoYoverse was never bashful about microtransactions and lootbox mechanics, making them a relatively integral part of the Genshin Impact experience. The game is inherently free-to-play, but this is how the publisher and developers make their money – by encouraging users of all ages to chase those five-star prizes.</p>



<p>In a follow-up statement, Cognosphere (HoYoverse) said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Animation-style games and shows are well-received by global audiences and players across various ages. Genshin Impact is a popular free-to-play, anime-style game designed for older teens and adults. While we believe many of the FTC’s allegations are inaccurate, we agreed to this settlement because we value the trust of our community and share a commitment to transparency for our players. </p>



<p>Under the agreement, we will introduce new age-gate and parental consent protections for children and young teens and increase our in-game disclosures around virtual currency and rewards for players in the U.S. in the coming months.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to the dubious lootbox activities, HoYoverse was hit with COPPA violations after failing to comply with some of the key rules. For instance, the requirement for online services ‘directed to children under 13’ to notify their parents about the personal information they collect was flouted by the developer and publisher.</p>



<p>Going forward, the terms set out by the FTC are that Cognosphere is:</p>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Prohibited from allowing children under 16 to purchase loot boxes in their video games without a parent’s affirmative express consent;</li>



<li>Prohibited from selling loot boxes using virtual currency without providing an option for consumers to purchase them directly with real money;</li>



<li>Prohibited from misrepresenting loot box odds, prices and features;</li>



<li>Required to disclose loot box odds and exchange rates for multi-tiered virtual currency;</li>



<li>Required to delete any personal information previously collected from children under 13 unless they obtain parental consent to retain such data; and</li>



<li>Required to comply with COPPA including its notice and consent requirements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, which is one of the biggest mobile games in the world, is one of several games banned in the United States following the TikTok takedown that hit ByteDance. ByeDance boasts ownership over the likes of Nuverse and MOONTON Games, which impacts ML:BB, Marvel Snap, and Land of Empires, among others.</p>



<p>This ban impacts the esports industry, as ML:BB is one of the key drivers of the mobile competitive gaming market. In data from Esports Charts, it’s revealed that ML:BB is one of the most-viewed games in history, boasting a peak concurrent viewer count of more than <strong>five million users</strong>, secured during 2023’s M5 World Championship.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-hit">Another Hit</h2>



<p>The TikTok ban is live now in the United States, and when you try to access the application from the region, you’ll be met with a prompt saying that… Well, that you <strong>can’t</strong>.</p>



<p>The ByteDance ban has impacted a few games, too – <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-snap-taken-down-in-u-s-due-to-governments-tiktok-ban/">including Marvel Snap</a>, which is published by Nuverse, a ByteDance-owned brand.</p>



<p>Many esports fans are concerned about the ban that has impacted Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, arguably the most popular mobile esports game in the world, alongside the likes of PUBG Mobile. </p>



<p>This action has also hit Mobile Legends: Adventure. When you try to access that game, you’ll be met with a message that reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Mobile Legends: Adventure is currently unavailable.</p>



<p>Due to circumstances beyond our control, Mobile Legends: Adventure is currently unavailable to players in the US.</p>



<p>We deeply value our vibrant player community and are actively exploring possibilities to bring the game back in the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Trying to access ML:BB and TikTok will reward you with similar message prompts.</p>



<p>According <a href="https://escharts.com/top-games?order=peak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to Esports Charts</a>, ML:BB was the eighth most valuable esports game in 2024, awarding players almost $8 million across 163 tournaments. It closely beat PUBG and trailed just behind VALORANT. Behind League of Legends, ML:BB was the most-viewed esports game of the year, beating Counter-Strike, Dota 2, and Fortnite.</p>



<p>While North America isn’t the most populous region where ML:BB is concerned, this is still a blow.</p>

<p>Marvel Snap, the competitive digital collectable card game developed by Second Dinner, is currently unavailable in the United States. This is due to the U.S. government’s ban on Chinese social media application TikTok, as the company that developed the app also owns Marvel Snap publisher Nuverse.</p>



<p>The sudden downing of the popular card game without warning from the developer has left players based in the United States baffled.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-oh-snap">Oh Snap</h2>



<p>On the evening of January 18, 2025, TikTok officially went dark in the United States due to the enactment of a law banning the social media application. As a consequence of this ban, the availability of apps from ByteDance, the company that developed TikTok, has been restricted on mobile app stores. This unfortunately includes Marvel Snap.</p>



<p>Players in the U.S. who attempt to sign in to the game are greeted with a message very similar to the one TikTok users are seeing:</p>



<figure></figure>







<blockquote>
<p>Sorry, Marvel Snap isn’t available right now. A law banning Marvel Snap has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use Marvel Snap for now. Rest assured, we’re working to restore our service in the U.S. Please stay tuned!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Players who attempt to sign in either on mobile or PC are either greeted with the above message or are unable to sign in entirely. The game’s website is also unavailable to access in the U.S.</p>



<p>The game does not appear in a search of the Google Play store, and a notification there states that downloads for ByteDance applications are “paused due to current U.S. legal requirements.”</p>



<p>Marvel Snap developer Second Dinner has stated that both it and publisher ByteDance were surprised by the TikTok ban affecting their game. “Marvel Snap isn’t going anywhere,” the developer <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880850204095811821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> on X. “We’re actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share.”</p>



<p>What other impacts will the TikTok ban have on gaming? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The app suddenly cut off access Saturday night, seemingly without warning, surprising gamers who weren’t aware of its connection to ByteDance.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/19/23413064/marvel-snap-second-dinner-hearthstone-ios-android">card game battler set in the Marvel universe</a> is developed by Second Dinner, which is based in California. But the game is published by Nuverse, a company owned by ByteDance. As a result, it’s subject to the same shutdown order. </p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880850204095811821">a statement on X</a>, Second Dinner called the takedown a surprise and said, “Marvel Snap isn’t going anywhere. We’re actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share.”</p><p>Just before the calendar turned over to January 19th, 2025, the game disappeared from the App Store for iPad and iPhone players and from Google Play for players on Android. For players on PC, the game is still listed in Steam at the moment, but <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1997040/discussions/0/510696076432380503/">many players</a> are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelSnap/comments/1i4pmgy/comment/m7xogf3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reporting</a> they were signed out and can’t sign back in.</p><p>An in-game message now tells players:</p><div><blockquote><p>Sorry, Marvel Snap isn’t available right now</p><p>A law banning Marvel Snap has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use Marvel Snap for now.

The effect on other ByteDance-linked apps is mixed; however, it may take time to remove them. The <a href="https://www.larksuite.com/">Lark app</a> that offers a Slack-like collaboration platform was available initially but has now been removed, while other Nuverse-published games, like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9-%E3%83%AA%E3%83%90%E3%82%A4%E3%83%90%E3%83%AB-%E5%9C%B0%E4%B8%AD%E6%B7%B1%E3%81%8F%E3%81%B8/id1665908849"><em>Earth: Revival - Deep Underground</em></a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/ragnarok-x-3rd-anniversary/id1545808948?mt=8"><em>Ragnarok X: 3rd Anniversary</em></a><em>,</em> are still available in the App Store as of this writing, just after midnight ET on the 19th.</p><p><em><strong>Update, January 19th: </strong>Noted reports that Marvel Snap PC players can’t log in and added </em><a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1880850204095811821"><em>a statement</em></a><em> from game developer Second Dinner.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to the FTC, the company “actively marketed” its loot boxes to children and misled players about their odds of winning prizes.</p><p>Cognosphere allegedly also “deceived children and other users about the real costs of in-game transactions,” by requiring them to buy virtual money that involved multiple currency exchanges. Players often spent “hundreds of dollars on prizes they stood little chance of winning,” according to Bureau of Consumer Protection Director Samuel Levine. For years, loot boxes have been likened to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18226852/loot-boxes-gaming-regulation-gambling-free-to-play">a form of legal gambling</a>. </p><p>The complaint, filed by the Department of Justice, also accuses the <em>Genshin Impact</em> developer of marketing to kids using approaches like posts on social media channels and in-game banners. The company then allegedly collected their personal information in violation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule. Once the settlement is approved, the company is required to delete any data for children under 13 whose parents haven’t consented to their data being collected.</p><p>Other requirements of the settlement include that Cognosphere must offer an option to buy loot boxes directly and not just through virtual money. It’s also forbidden from misrepresenting pricing, features, and winning odds for loot boxes, and it must disclose exchange rates for multi-tiered virtual currency. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I don't think we've ever written about Intravenous 2, but the topdown shooter has been on my radar since its release last year. It's a blend of tactical stealth and frenetic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a> spraying, and it just got a major update to add Steam Workshop support and a map editor.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Workshop will let players download and share maps, campaigns, new weapons and gadgets that they've added to the game, although ambitious modders will need to know the Lua scripting language to implement their changes. It looks like the map editor is pretty friendly, however, given the 2D tile-based levels.
</p>
<p>There are plenty of topdown games that aim to walk in Hotline Miami's bloody footprints, but Intravenous 2 differs by going deep on tactical elements. You can stealth through the levels if you choose: enemies of vision cones, you can hide in shadows, and you can manipulate the environment by turning off lights, lockpicking doors, or using items to distract or lure enemies.
</p>
<p>You can also tinker with your skills and weaponry. There are 29 weapons according to the Steam page - although whether that's been updated to reflect those added in updates such as this one, I don't know - and those weapons can be customised with suppressors, laser sights, ammo types and so on.
</p><p>Perhaps most ambitiously, Intravenous 2 brags that its storyline is dynamic and changes based on your style of play. I don't know how far it follows through with that, but I'm interested in giving it a go just because I love stealth games and tactical combat. I've had good experiences with topdown games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/door-kickers">Door Kickers</a>, and I'd be onboard with a less fiddly, more action-oriented take on a similar experience. Topdown <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a>, as opposed to topdown SWAT? I dare to dream.
</p>
<p>One day, one day I will find time to play it. For now: hey, it's cool that its got mod support. All games should have mod support. You can find more <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2608270/Intravenous_2/">on Steam</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sons-of-the-forest">Sons Of The Forest</a> is about being chased by fithy cannibals who cannot swim, so the latest update ought to be useful to players. Its major new feature is the addition of rafts, which players can construct and then float about on like a 2000s Tom Hanks. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Rafts come in three flavours ranging from small, slightly less small, to a full on houseboat with walls and ceilings. All three can be tied to the shore with a new mooring structure, and otherwise paddled about the lakes and waterways of the island.
</p>
<p>There are some other neat new features, too. Players can now draw plans for defensive walls around their base and leave Kelvin to do the hardwork of constructing them. Kelvin also now has a faster swim animation and both he and Virginia are able to pull themselves out of water at its edge, both of which seem useful when they inevitably fall off your raft.
</p>
<p>If you make the mistake of ever coming back to land, there are apparently impprovements to aiming with the crossbow, compound bow, crafted bow, shotgun and slingshot, all of which you'll see while scrabbling to survive against the cannibals.
</p>
<p>The full <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1326470/view/526458302147592280">patch notes are available over on Steam</a>. We already liked the game plenty when it hit 1.0 early last year, as Matt Cox (RPS in peace) explained in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sons-of-the-forest-review">Sons Of The Forest review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>'s developers have agreed to pay a $20 million (around £16.4m) fine to settle charges brought by the US Federal Trade Commission. The FTC allege that HoYoverse "unfairly marketed loot boxes to children that obscured real costs and misled all players about the odds of obtaining prizes." HoYoverse will also be banned from selling lootboxes to children under 16 without parental consent.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/cognosphere_complaint.pdf">complaint</a> (PDF) alleges that Genshin Impact's warren of different currencies is "challenging and confusing, particularly for children and teens.
</p>
<p>"Players must exchange real dollars for bundles of virtual currency that then have to be re-exchanged multiple times to open loot boxes, with exchange rates in unusual denominations. This complicated system, according to the complaint, misleads consumers about the amount of money that players spend on loot boxes on an ongoing basis, and the amount of money that players would likely need to spend to obtain certain prizes."
</p>
<p>The same complaint also alleges that HoYoverse collected personal information about children in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA). 
</p>
<p>The allegation that Genshin Impact misleads children about the odds of winning "Five-Star Prizes" in part relates to the Event Banners and "influencer campaigns", which the FTC says "give players the impression that they will have better odds of obtaining the five-star prize being promoted than they have in reality."
</p>
<p>The ruling which would see HoYoverse pay the fine, delete the data held about children aged under 13, and no longer sell lootbnoxes to children under 16, requires approval by a federal judge before it can go into effect.
</p>
<p>"Genshin Impact deceived children, teens, and other players into spending hundreds of dollars on prizes they stood little chance of winning," said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection in a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/genshin-impact-game-developer-will-be-banned-selling-lootboxes-teens-under-16-without-parental">press release</a>. "Companies that deploy these dark-pattern tactics will be held accountable if they deceive players, particularly kids and teens, about the true costs of in-game transactions."

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-red-hulk-mystery-skin/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-red-hulk-mystery-skin/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new mystery skin is going to be coming to Marvel Rivals for those who purchase tickets to watch Captain America: Brave New World.</p>



<p>The announcement was made by the <a href="https://x.com/RegalMovies/status/1880276448826581174?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1880276448826581174%7Ctwgr%5E0f18271dfee288d41369c312d0387dd4c9b35628%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fembedly.forbes.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3D3ce26dc7e3454db5820ba084d28b4935schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fx.com%2FRegalMovies%2Fstatus%2F1880276448826581174image%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Regal Crown Club</a>, which said that those who purchase theatre tickets to watch Captain America: Brave New World will receive three exclusive items for Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>The three items will be a spray, nameplate, and mystery costume.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-mystery-costume-in-marvel-rivals">What is the Mystery Costume in Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>It’s currently unclear what the mystery costume will be to celebrate Captain America: Brave New World in Marvel Rivals, but the spray and nameplate will be Captain America-related. </p>



<p>However, given that Captain America: Brave New World will feature the Red Hulk for the first time ever (played by Harrison Ford), it will almost certainly be a skin for the Hulk. While it’s not yet confirmed, a Red Hulk skin in Marvel Rivals would be easy to implement without profound changes to the existing default Hulk skin (just a change of skin color, face, and probably shorts).</p>



<p>If the skin isn’t Red Hulk, Captain America is the likely next option.</p>



<p>Luckily though, speculation of what the skin will be won’t have to last long, as Captain America: Brave New World hits theatre on on February 14.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-mystery-skin">How to Get the Mystery Skin</h2>



<p>For those wanting to get the mystery skin, Regal Crown Club says that theatergoers must purchase their tickets by February 17 to collect the skin.</p>



<p>Presumably, ticket purchases will then receive a redemption code in their emails after purchasing the ticket.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals currently has a total of 37 playable heroes in the game, with developer NetEase Games confirming that the game will receive two new heroes a season moving forward. The Thing and the Human Torch are the next heroes to be released, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-thing-human-torch-release-dates-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can find out when here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-hamlet-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.undiscoveredcountryfilm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Grand Theft Hamlet</em></a> is a documentary that follows two out-of-work actors, struggling during UK covid lockdowns, trying to stage a production of <em>Hamlet</em> in Rockstar’s online game. It tells a hilarious and earnestly moving story about trying to make art against the odds, where those odds are both real-world challenges and trying to keep the in-game actors alive long enough to finish the play. </p><p><em>Grand Theft Hamlet</em> stars Sam Crane and Mark Oosterveen who, while playing around in <em>GTA Online </em>in 2021, stumble across the game’s <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Vinewood_Bowl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vinewood Bowl </a>and playfully perform a Shakespeare monologue on its stage. They wonder if they could do an actual play in the arena, and the idea becomes an ambitious plan to hold auditions, have rehearsals, and mount a full production of <em>Hamlet</em> that takes place across Los Santos<em>. </em>They make a recruiting video and enlist Crane’s partner Pinny Grylls to film their efforts using in-game tools.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="GRAND THEFT HAMLET  | UK theatrical trailer | IN CINEMAS FRIDAY 6TH DECEMBER from TULL STORIES" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MLpGIHjwhNE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>There’s a lot of real emotion underneath this setup. The lockdowns are hard on all of them, especially Oosterveen, who struggles with loneliness and familial tragedy and sees value in <em>GTA Online</em> for being “whatever takes you away from the crushing inevitability of your pointless life.” At one point, he relatably rails against transit ads that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/12/ballet-dancer-could-reskill-with-job-in-cyber-security-suggests-uk-government-ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">encourage artists to learn to code</a>. In a Q&amp;A after my screening at New York’s IFC Center, Grylls, new to the game, noted how much NPCs cowering and fleeing reminded her of social distancing during the early days of covid; she likened the in-game feed that records player deaths to the updates of covid deaths happening in the real world at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>In light of the tragedy happening around them, <em>Hamlet </em>feels like the right play for the moment (in the Q&amp;A, Oosterveen noted that its “To be or not to be” speech is “about men being depressed and not knowing what to do”). And <em>GTA Online</em> is an unexpectedly fitting place to stage it: The grandeur of its nightclubs and mansions reflect the ostentation of Elsinore, and <em>GTA Online</em>’s violent premise and gruff emotes fit right in with a play where basically everyone dies. But all this appropriate violence is also in conflict with the group’s efforts to get anything done, as auditions, rehearsals, and even the most innocuous meetings devolve into chaos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, it simply never gets old to watch the actors get interrupted by a car chase, a gunfight, a plummeting plane, or a team of virtual cops. (At the screening, they wore tshirts that read “You can’t stop art, motherfuckers.”) And what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCUvXc5ESFo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starts</a> as a challenge soon becomes just another part of the production, the particular twist on <em>Hamlet</em> that every Shakespeare staging leans on to differentiate itself. In the Q&amp;A, Grylls noted that “We’re putting on a play inside a game, but the game is a kind of play, because we’re playing.” That playfulness shines through in how the cast interacts with the bloody reality of <em>GTA Online</em>; everyone faces things with good humor and shows remarkable fortitude.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="GRAND THEFT HAMLET | Official Trailer | Coming Soon" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OloHiBOMPm8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>And the challenge seems to bind the cast together. The audition scenes are particularly charming: someone identifying themselves as a literary agent who’s always wanted to act gets on her nephew’s account to try out, her voice incongruous against her shirtless male avatar. GTA roleplayers, real-life friends, and even <em>Overwatch</em> voice actor <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1788608/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jen Cohn</a> join the cast, each finding their own value in <em>Hamlet</em>, the game, and the support of their colleagues. A young trans woman early in transition relates to the play’s themes, seeing a connection between her real-life relationships and the way that Hamlet uncovers who his friends and family really are. The production also attracts hangers-on–a mysterious defacto stage manager, a player dressed as an alien who supports the project through to the end. “We just keep coming across these people who want to help us,” the filmmakers marvel.&nbsp;</p><p>But it’s not all fun, especially as real-life stresses intervene. Oosterveen becomes, as he said in the Q&amp;A, “more emotionally attached to the project than I realized.” Grylls and Crane argue over how the project is impacting their real-world relationship, at one point having an early morning spat as their in-game avatars before reminding each other that they’re sitting in the same house. There’s a broader question of how “real” the production is, whether it’s a legitimate theatrical project or just a silly diversion from the pain of the real world. It’s a question that might resonate with anyone who spends a lot of time in video games.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Q&amp;A, Oosterveen suggested that Shakespeare, now considered “high” art, <a href="https://www.seattleshakespeare.org/who-were-these-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t seen that way</a> in the playwright’s time, and the way many people might look down on video games today isn’t dissimilar to how they saw the theater back then. <em>Grand Theft Hamlet</em> feels like a celebration of both an under-looked side of Shakespeare productions and performances and a celebration of how weird video games can be, something broader audiences might not be familiar with. It made me both want to rewatch my <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116477/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorite <em>Hamlet</em></a>, and, maybe less wisely, check out <em>GTA Online</em>. <em>Grand Theft Hamlet</em> is playing now in <a href="https://www.undiscoveredcountryfilm.com/screenings-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">select theaters</a> and coming to streaming on <a href="https://mubi.com/en/us/films/grand-theft-hamlet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mubi</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-elon-musk-asmongold-twitch-path-of-exile"><h3>Elon Musk Has Once Again Revealed That He’s A Fraud, This Time By Beefing With A Twitch Streamer</h3></a><p>"He needs to believe, for his own sake, that it’s possible for him to jump into the deep end of anything and excel"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-executive-producer-job-description"><h3>A Video Game’s Executive Producer Is Just Trying To Make It All Work</h3></a><p>'Management is making stuff with other people, it's a creative problem'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/but-i-like-to-slide-the-joy-con"><h3>But I Like To Slide The Joy-Con</h3></a><p>The most fun part of the Switch</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>If you're looking for some scares to see you into the new year, there are plenty of great ones scattered throughout the next 12 months. Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we saw some fantastic horror games</a>, but this year also has a ton of potential if you're looking for multiplayer horror or single-player horror experiences.</p>
<p>Here's our shortlist for the five most anticipated horror games of 2025. All of them will be available on all main platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X), and they also share the trait of not having a fixed launch date yet.</p>

<h2>Dying Light: The Beast</h2>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a bit more of a horror game compared to the survival elements of the previous iterations in the franchise. While they, too, had a slight horror vibe, it seems to be more of a focus in this game. You follow the story of Kyle Crane, who returns from the first entry, and the experiments that he underwent, which gave him significant strength and power. However, it comes at a cost. You have to work to keep the remaining survivors of Castor Woods safe while keeping your powers in check. While the signature parkour is still here, the ability to drive vehicles also returns from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-following-review-zombies-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light: The Following</a>.

According to the Polish developers, it is&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-combat-will-lean-towards-resident-evil-dead-space-featuring-a-special-mechanic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired</a> by the survival mechanics of Resident Evil and Dead Space</span>. The story will see players traveling between past and future: in the past, they'll experience a world in the throes of The Change, a cataclysmic event that has changed humanity forever. In the future, which has become a ravaged wasteland, they'll fight for survival against dangerous abominations.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, the protagonist is a time traveler, an agent for the enigmatic Collective, tasked with scouring the wastelands of the future in search of specific time rifts that will transport them back to 1980s Poland. In the past, the mission is to locate key figures who perished in The Change, save them, and bring them into the future to change it.</p>

<h2>Little Nightmares 3</h2>
<p>Little Nightmares is a beloved franchise in the horror games community, and it's not hard to see why. On the surface level, it seems like a cutesy little puzzle game with horror sprinkled in, but it often tells a much more horrifying story in character design and environments. <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-3-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>, which was originally scheduled to launch in 2024, is the next game in the series and brings optional (you can also play with the AI) co-op multiplayer to the franchise, which is a massive step for the Little Nightmares games. We can only hope it won't be as damaging as it was for Dead Space, which also added co-op with its third installment.</p>

<h2>The Dark Pictures Anthology: Directive 8020</h2>
<p>For the most part, you can't go wrong with games in The Dark Pictures Anthology. The last game in The Dark Pictures Anthology was the spin-off VR-exclusive game named <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-dark-pictures-switchback-vr-qa-supermassive-talks-utilizing-ps-vr2s-fantastic-new-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switchback</a>. However, this is the first game in the second and final season of the horror series created by Supermassive Games.</p>
<p>The game stars actress Lashana Lynch as Brianna Young, an astronaut and pilot of a colony ship called Cassiopeia, which crash-lands on Tau Ceti f, a planet 12 light-years away, after setting out to find a new home to save humanity as Earth is dying. The game's creative director has described it as "The Thing in deep space," which is certainly an intriguing premise as far as horror games go.</p>

<h2>Tormented Souls 2</h2>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tormented-souls-replicating-classics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tormented Souls</a> was a rather brilliant survival horror game for a first outing, and it is now getting a sequel. In this game, you reprise the role of Caroline Walker and get to explore brand-new horrifying locations that promise to keep you on edge the entire time. After the events of the first game, Caroline longs for a normal life with her younger sister, Anna. However, Anna suddenly falls ill due to a mysterious affliction against which conventional remedies prove futile. In a desperate attempt to save her sister, Caroline must turn to the supernatural again, heading to the remote and sinister Southern American town of Puerto Miller, where she'll be forced to explore eerie monasteries and other nightmarish locations to discover how to help Anna.</p>

So if you’ve got strong feelings about where, say, the Punisher should land in such a tally, you can see for yourself just how right or wrong we are. Also, this week gave us our first glimpse of the next <em>Mario Kart</em>, and even though it was fleeting, eagle-eyed fans have still honed in on several details they think might reveal a thing or two about the game. We rounded those up as well. And the true ending of <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League </em>has emerged, and to say that it’s leaving players underwhelmed would be putting it mildly. These and other stories await in the pages ahead.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f1496f0a7a5f0c211c8fe699366a9b7e" data-recommend-id="image://f1496f0a7a5f0c211c8fe699366a9b7e" data-format="png" data-width="1446" data-height="813" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luna Snow casts ice magic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luna Snow casts ice magic." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f1496f0a7a5f0c211c8fe699366a9b7e" data-recommend-id="image://f1496f0a7a5f0c211c8fe699366a9b7e" data-format="png" data-width="1446" data-height="813" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luna Snow casts ice magic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Support characters are the backbone of any team-based game.

			<p>Work on the PlayStation 6 seems to be in a much more advanced stage than most people thought, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF Forums, well-known AMD leaker Kepler L2 commented on the next-generation system from Sony, revealing that its SoC is <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-to-utilize-amds-3d-stacked-chips-amd-udna-flagship-gpu-revived-for-2026-zen-6-halo-with-3d-stacking-technology-and-zen-6-all-on-tsmc.1679744/page-2#post-270022279" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design complete</a> and is currently in pre-silicon validation already, with A0 tapeout scheduled for late this year. While this may mean little to most, this new information suggests that the console may not be too far from release, as Sony's usual cadence between A0 tapeout and the release of a system is <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-to-utilize-amds-3d-stacked-chips-amd-udna-flagship-gpu-revived-for-2026-zen-6-halo-with-3d-stacking-technology-and-zen-6-all-on-tsmc.1679744/page-2#post-270023151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 years</a>, meaning that, if this will be the same for the PlayStation 6, we could see the launch of the system in 2027.</p>
<p>The AMD leaker also provided some additional information on the PlayStation 6 GPU, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-to-utilize-amds-3d-stacked-chips-amd-udna-flagship-gpu-revived-for-2026-zen-6-halo-with-3d-stacking-technology-and-zen-6-all-on-tsmc.1679744/page-2#post-270022949" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealing</a> it is a fork of AMD gfx13, which was formerly known as RDNA 5 and is now known as UDNA. The leaker couldn't say how big it will be, but the fact that it will belong to the gfx13 will eventually provide some information on some of its features once AMD fully unveils the architecture.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the PlayStation 6 as of now besides the fact that it will once again be powered by AMD. This was revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year</a> in a report which confirmed that Intel lost the bid to produce the console to AMD due to a dispute over how much profit Intel would make from each chip sold to Sony which prevented the company from settling on a price.</p>
