			<p>On September 6, 2018, South Korean game developer Pearl Abyss (Black Desert) <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-to-acquire-eve-onlines-ccp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> CCP Games and the MMORPG EVE Online, the flagship product of the Icelandic studio, for around $425 million.</p>
<p>Nearly seven years later, Pearl Abyss might be reconsidering their stake in CCP Games. At least, that's what <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025061910371430049" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new report by Korean website MTN</a> alleges today: PA has reportedly reached out to multiple game companies to gauge their potential interest in acquiring CCP Games.</p>
<p>We don't have public visibility on the sales performance of CCP's games, but we do know that there were several missteps along the way, both prior and after the acquisition by Pearl Abyss. Over its nearly thirty-year history, CCP canceled at least four games (an MMO set in the World of Darkness, Project Legion, Eve: The Second Genesis, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-nova-developers-drawing-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Nova</a>), while other projects notoriously fizzled too early, such as Dust 514. For a while, CCP even released several Virtual Reality games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/196685-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVE: Valkyrie</a>, Gunjack, Gunjack 2: End of Shift, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sparc-virtual-sport-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sparc</a>), although eventually it gave up once it became crystal clear that the VR market was too small.</p>
<p>More recently, CCP <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-frontier-goes-public-today-with-founder-access-new-era/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> EVE: Frontier, a survival spin-off of EVE Online, in 'Founder Access'. Perhaps Pearl Abyss isn't thrilled with the direction of Frontier and the other new project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-online-frontier-vanguard-fanfest-2025-qa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanguard</a>, CCP's umpteenth at a shooter game connected with its MMORPG.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, the MTN report alleges that the Korean company would be glad to be rid of this subsidiary and focus on its own games, such as Crimson Desert and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-reportedly-moved-to-q2-2025-dokev-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DokeV</a>. This is the same source that <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-on-november-2-says-korean-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a tentative internal release date for Crimson Desert, by the way, to which Pearl Abyss only referred back to official announcements coming from its own social channels.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we'll update this article if PA chooses to comment in any way. Stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/689708/summer-game-fests-best-games-were-small-and-personal<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Summer Game Fest 2025 was definitely a weird one, but even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/688568/summer-game-fest-2025-los-angeles-ice-arrests">with everything going on outside</a>, the games on display were still immaculate. My favorites, the ones that I <em>live </em>for, are small, unique, and made for pure love of expression. Being able to see that love so clearly on display, expressed through such painstaking and often thankless work, and also being able to show them to our audience who might not otherwise encounter them, is the defining privilege of my job. That’s what I love about Summer Game Fest, weirdness and all, and hopefully when these games come out, you’ll check ‘em out too.</p><div><p id="escape-academy-2-tbd"><h2>Escape Academy 2 - TBD</h2></p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23218887/escape-academy-review-xbox-playstation-escape-room-puzzle-game">I loved the first <em>Escape Academy</em></a> and vibrated through my chair seeing that Coin Crew Games had returned to Summer Game Fest with <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3296060%2FEscape_Academy_2_Back_2_School%2F" rel="sponsored">a bigger, more expansive sequel</a>. Instead of selecting levels, now you can explore an open world, solving puzzles as you discover them in a college campus setup. I love this new direction: the open-world exploration better melds the quirky / cute storytelling of <em>Escape Academy</em> with the actual act of solving puzzles. </p><p>In the short demo I was introduced to a cat who lived in my dorm room and wanted a snack. As I explored the campus, I found the cafeteria was closed but the special of the day was fish and milk. I solved the puzzle to open the cafeteria and was rewarded with my feline dorm-mate following me around campus for the rest of the demo and hopefully the full game. There’s no release date yet, but whenever it’s out, I’m enrolling.</p><div><p id="petal-runner-tbd"><h2>Petal Runner - TBD</h2></p></div><p>Speaking of pet companions, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2795110%2FPetal_Runner%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Petal Runner</em></a> is a somber exploration of the tension between the joy of owning a pet and the inevitable devastation that comes with that, only disguised as a lighthearted pixelated <em>Pokémon</em>-like minigame-a-palooza. You, as a newly minted motorcycle courier, are tasked with helping people with their living Tamagotchis known as HanaPets. Install them, feed them, and bring them items while along the way you explore your relationship with your own first-generation HanaPet, who might not be around for much longer. I did not expect to sit down and play this game, which had all the hallmarks of a quote-unquote “wholesome game,” and be emotionally devastated. It ruined me... 10/10, can’t wait to play.</p><div><p id="relooted-tbd"><h2>Relooted - TBD</h2></p></div><p>When I tell you I sat the hell up seeing <em>Relooted</em>’s trailer. Here’s a game, stuffed full of African folks, talking about <em>stealing back their cultural artifacts??? </em>Hell, and I cannot stress this enough, yes. <a href="https://nyamakop.co.za/relooted/"><em>Relooted</em></a> really captures the feeling of pulling off your own <em>Ocean’s Eleven</em>-style heist. You have a team of experts with their own specialties, and before your heist, you have to position them strategically so that the right person is in the right place to hack locked doors and help you reach unreachable places for a smooth escape. </p><p>While some of the Black members of the game’s African developer team <a href="https://aftermath.site/relooted-game-africa-museum-visa-nyamakop-interview">couldn’t secure the visas they needed to attend SGF</a>, Ben Myres, the creative director who I was able to speak to, said that each item you’re stealing is a real-life artifact currently being withheld from its country of origin. Each gets its own encyclopedia-like entry giving you its history, where it is now, and where it actually belongs. Nathan Drake, Lara Croft, Indiana Jones are all weaksauce compared to these heroes.</p><div><p id="directive-8020-october-2nd-2025"><h2>Directive 8020 - October 2nd, 2025</h2></p></div><p>I enjoyed Supermassive Games’ spooky narrative choice adventures in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/17/22980954/the-quarry-supermassive-horror-game-release-date-ps5-xbox-steam"><em>The Quarry</em></a> and its <em>Dark Pictures Anthology</em>. So I was really glad I had the chance to see what the team is doing next with <a href="https://www.thedarkpictures.com/games/directive-8020"><em>Directive 8020</em></a>. This time, instead of haunted schools or cabins in the woods, we’re going to space with Lashana Lynch — a favorite actress of mine for whom I will show up no matter what.</p><p>The neat thing about <em>Directive 8020</em> is its replay system. At critical decision-making moments, you have the option to replay events without having to replay the game. Shoot a guy you shouldn’t have shot? You can immediately go back and see what happens when you don’t. You’ll also have the option to disable that, so the choices you make stick. I had the option to unshoot someone, but I chose to live with my mistake, and all these days later, I still think about that.</p><div><p id="possessors-tbd"><h2>Possessor(s) - TBD</h2></p></div><p>Heart Machine, maker of <em>Hyper Light Drifte</em>r and its sequel, <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, are back with another game guaranteed to mess with your emotions. <em>Possessor(s)</em> is a Metroidvan— excuse me, <em>search action </em>game. I had a spirited and convivial conversation with one of the developers on the merits of using “Metroidvania” versus “search action” as a descriptor and I gotta say, I’ve been convinced. Not enough to remove “Metroidvania” from my vocabulary, but definitely enough to think more about how I use these terms when I write about games.</p><p>In <em>Possessor(s)</em> you play as a young woman escaping a city under attack. She is grievously wounded and enters a pact with a demon to heal her wounds and grant her powers so she can escape from the city. Speaking to the developer, he told me the game was about toxic relationships and what they can do to a person. The demon you make your pact with is not nice; he is not the hero. And yet, the developers at Heart Machine decided to make him smokin’ hot, which they know will obscure the very necessary message they’re trying to relay… which, I’m thinking, is probably the point. </p><div><p id="out-of-words-tbd"><h2>Out of Words - TBD</h2></p></div><p><a href="https://www.outofwordsgame.com/"><em>Out of Words</em></a> is my game of the show. Developed by Kong Orange and published by Epic Games, <em>Out of Words</em> is a stop-motion co-op adventure game akin to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/623660/split-fiction-review-hazelight-studios-it-takes-two"><em>Split Fiction</em></a> with a much, <em>much </em>better story. This is the kind of game that reminds me that video games are more than just vehicles for making money or simple entertainment; they are works of art, expressions of a developer’s heart and mind.</p><p>It’s about two teenagers who, after a moment of miscommunication, have their mouths removed, forcing them to communicate and navigate a fantastical world without words. </p><p>Everything in the game is made by hand and with love so evident it was incredibly moving. When I asked the game’s director, Johan Oettinger, why he and the team spent so much time — he told me they’d been working on this game for a decade — and money to make something that could potentially get drowned out by bigger, flashier releases, he looked me in the face, serious as a cemetery, and said, “Because it has been my dream to make something like this since I was a child.”</p><p>As a games journalist I <em>live </em>for the moments when I can see a developer’s fingerprints in a game, their personal quirks and the idiosyncrasies of their lives reflected in their art, and that was all over <em>Out of Words</em>. The developer told me how each blade of grass was made from paper, and how the blue clay they used to make the quirky clay men that populate the world comes from a specific place in Denmark where they harvested it by hand. It was so beautiful I spent most of the 20-minute demo in tears. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hideo Kojima has been out and about and doing interviews at the Sydney Film Festival as part of the build-up to the release of his upcoming, Australian-set sequel, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>.</p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/i-almost-gave-up-hideo-kojima-on-looking-into-the-abyss-death-stranding-2s-australian-setting-working-with-his-idols-and-connecting-with-koalas/">GamesRadar</a>, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> director openly chatted about a whole bunch of topics, including one rather cool Game Boy Advance title by Konami that he produced back in 2003. During the conversation, as he discusses his creative spark and how eureka moments come about, he mentions <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/boktai_the_sun_is_in_your_hand">Boktai: The Sun Is in Your Hand</a> as an example of his interest in infusing game experiences with new tech.</p><p><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97frziwuq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhK3W_3CW7w">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Indeed, with this in mind, Kojima gave an example of how Konami's toy division once manufactured a UV-light-detecting teddy bear (just what we've always wanted!). It failed to gain any traction, for some reason, and so, with Konami sitting on a load of unused components, Kojima pounced, striking a deal on the UV-sensor tech on the cheap to incorporate into the Boktai cartridges so that the game could detect actual real sunlight and charge up your in-game weapon to kill vampires. Pretty rad, right?</p>
<p>"UV sensors were so expensive at the time," he said. "You have to select the ideas at the best time."</p>

<p>And so it proved, as Boktai released to cracking reviews, and sits on a rating of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/boktai-the-sun-is-in-your-hand/">83% over at Metacritic</a>, which is actually 1% more than <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/death_stranding">Death Stranding</a>, so maybe someone should look at sticking some UV tech into the sequel, eh.</p>

			<p>A new Battlefield Labs update has gone live today, introducing new features to the test version of what will presumably be the next entry in the popular first-person shooter series.</p>
<p>As reported on the franchise's official subreddit, the new patch that went live a few hours ago introduced a few changes and improvements, such as NVIDIA DLSS 4 support and the option to turn off the border around the capture zone. Additionally, the new update has changed the watermark from PRE ALPHA to ALPHA and has added files related to a battle royale mode. With the promise of news coming soon regarding the class system, there's the chance the update has been pushed in preparation for something, possibly the official announcement of the next Battlefield which is still scheduled for this <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">summer.</a></p>

<p>Although Battlefield Labs footage was not meant to be shared, plenty of it has made its way <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-new-leaked-footage/">online,</a> providing an early look at what the next entry in the series should offer.

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> is out now on Switch and Switch 2, and we thought it was really rather good. In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">9/10 review of the Switch 1 version</a>, we said it's "a must-play for Rune Factory fans and would be well-enjoyed by newcomers to the series as well," praising the sheer amount of compelling stuff to do alongside the "edgy and dramatic" story.</p>
<p>The kind folks over at Marvelous have sent us the physical Limited Edition of the Switch 1 game to check out, and we thought you might like to see exactly what's included in this edition. So we've put together a cheeky little gallery to peruse at your leisure.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xosjtg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>What's included, exactly? Well, the star of the show is a rather beautiful Sacred Fan with an accompanying clear display stand. You've also got a Woolby Plush Keychain, a 161-page softback art book, a two-disc soundtrack CD, and the game itself on cartridge.</p>
<p>Definitely some high-quality goodies, and we're particularly enamoured with the art book – it's chock-full of character designs and environment paintings. Gorgeous stuff. Let's take a closer look.</p>

<p>The Limited Edition is still available and priced at <strong>£79.99</strong> in the UK and <strong>$99.99</strong> in the US (if you can find one). A proper physical edition for the Switch 2 (i.e. not a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Card</a>) is also available for <strong>£59.99 / $69.99</strong> (or alternatively you can opt for the upgrade pack for <strong>£10 / $10</strong> if you already have the Switch 1 version).</p>

			<p>Elden Ring Nightreign has just become more challenging, thanks to the introduction of a more powerful variant of the Nightlords.</p>
<p>Following the release of the game's latest minor update mainly focused on fixing bugs, Nightfarers will now encounter <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged-elden-ring-nightreign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everdark Sovereigns</a> during Expeditions. Over the next few weeks, they can take on more powerful variants of the Gaping Jaw, Sentient Pest, and Darkdrift Knight bosses, with other Everdark Sovereigns getting added to the game later. Every week, a new Sovereign will arrive in Limveld for everyone who has already defeated the base version of the boss, and when the time is up, they will disappear. Those who manage to take down these limited-time versions of the Nightlords will be rewarded with Sovereign Sigils that can be exchanged for special Relics and other items. The first Everdark Sovereign, an enhanced version of Adel, Baron of the Night, will be available until June 26 9:59 JST 2:59 CEST 5:59 PM PDT.</p>
<p>Considering there isn't much to do in Elden Ring Nightreign after defeating the game's final boss, the introduction of more powerful Nightlords is more than welcome. Not that the game needed more challenge, as some of the base Nightlords are among the most challenging bosses created by FromSoftware, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">review.</a></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

            <p>Gears of War Reloaded developer The Coalition has extended the second weekend of the game's beta, which along with more time will also include more modes and more maps for participants to check out.</p>
<p>The upcoming weekend's beta will now run between 20th June 8pm UK time until 23rd June 5am UK time, and feature five maps for both Social Team Deathmatch and Competitive King of the Hill and Execution. Initially, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-reloaded-multiplayer-beta-coming-this-weekend">things were planned to be wrapped up within 48 hours and with less variety</a>.</p>

<p>As to why the team has decided to do this? Well, "we heard you," is what it wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/GearsofWar/status/1935414750034411784">post on social media</a>.</p>
<p>You see, the first Gears of War Reloaded beta weekend didn't <em>exactly </em>go all that smoothly for the developer, and there were multiple reports from players of <a href="https://x.com/SASxSH4DOWZ/status/1934359201523929512">server instability</a> as well as technical issues. Many were quite <a href="https://x.com/Lilkillsville/status/1934044001050730864">vocal about their experiences</a>.</p>
<p>"Most of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> stream thumbnails are of people sitting trying to find a match. When you eventually can get into a match, everybody is laggy and when you start shooting somebody they just disappear and then randomly you die or they stutter back and forth taking multiple full clips and not dying," read <a href="https://x.com/Freas23Gaming/status/1933863257304875257">one such post on social media</a> following the first beta. "I knew the beta was probably gonna be bad but this is just terrible and unacceptable."</p>
<p>Hopefully things will go a bit better this weekend.</p>

<p>Gears of War Reloaded - which is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-coming-to-playstation">revamped edition of the original Gears of War game</a> - will be making its full arrival on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th August.</p>
<p>It will feature faster frame rates and "deeper visual fidelity", with the studio promising "clarity, smoothness, and immersion that matches the power of today's hardware".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-update-20-1-5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-20-1-5-is-now-live-introducing-stability-improvements-and-more.1222908/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-update-20-1-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Nintendo Switch 2 system update is now live, introducing general stability improvements as well as undocumented improvements.</p>
<p>The official update notes don't leave any doubt regarding the fact that this is a minor update, as it only introduces <em>"general system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience."</em> What's more interesting is that the update reportedly does introduce some undocumented improvements. As reported by well-known dataminer OatmealDome on <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1935542554642051512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, the new update improves backward compatibility, and some previously unsupported titles are now properly playable on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>While not a direct effect of the new system update, Pikmin 3 Deluxe now properly works on the new system, thanks to a new <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1935510351015006422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a> that addressed screen flickering issues. The demo version of the game will also be fixed later.</p>
<p>Backward compatibility seems to be one of the best features of the Nintendo Switch 2, so it wouldn't be surprising to see improvements already being made so soon. Multiple tests have confirmed that even<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-better-original-system/"> unpatched games</a> can take advantage of the new system's better specs to deliver more stable framerates, so hopefully, more of the incompatible titles will become fully playable on the system in the future.</p>
<p>For the rest, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a massive improvement over its predecessor in every possible way. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

            <p>Sloclap launched its football action game Rematch today, but crossplay has not been included due to "unforeseen technical complexities".</p>
<p>Rematch released across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC (Steam), but players are unable to play with others on rival platforms - at least, not yet.</p>
<p>"We understand many of you were looking forward to playing Rematch across platforms from day one," said the studio in a <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps">launch blog post</a>. "We did our utmost to include crossplay at launch, but Rematch is the studio's first crossplay title, and we faced unforeseen technical complexities which prevented us from having this feature ready in time. We should have communicated as soon as it became apparent that crossplay wouldn't be available at launch, and we're sorry for the inconvenience and frustration it caused to some of our players."</p>

<p>The studio noted it's "very important for us that our players are able to enjoy Rematch with their friends" and so crossplay is its "absolute highest priority" alongside bug fixes. It's "committed to delivering this feature swiftly". A basic working version has already been produced from a technical standpoint, but needs to be debugged and polished before full implementation.</p>
<p>The studio also noted other issues it's looking to fix, based on feedback from the early access period. These include: performance optimisations to improve stability; preventing server and client desynchronisation; and resolving game-breaking bugs.</p>
<p>Beyond these issues, the studio will be working on broader updates with new content like tournament and leaderboard systems, social features like spectating and (ironically) easier rematches, as well as more casual game modes such as quick play and implementing AI bots to train against.</p>
<p>Sloclap will also tweak the core gameplay, with improvements to the sliding tackle, goalkeeper mechanics, the dribbling system, and wall contacts, among others. "Our general objective is to keep adding depth and granularity to our mechanics, to make the game as interesting as possible in a competitive environment," the studio said.</p>
<p>"Please remember that we are not a huge team, and that these features take time, so don't expect all this by the end of the year!" Sloclap concluded. "We will communicate on a more precise roadmap for upcoming seasons as soon as we have better visibility on when we can deliver on these intentions."</p>
<p>The studio added: "We're dedicated to making Rematch the outstanding multiplayer football experience you deserve, and we're committed to communicating regularly and transparently with our community to keep you updated on our progress. Thanks to all players who joined us already for your incredible enthusiasm and support, this is really what motivates us to make this game as great as it can be!"</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Tom Orry has been playing Rematch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-the-challenging-new-online-football-game-hitting-game-pass-immediately-transported-me-back-to-my-schools-playground">likened it to being transported back to the school playground</a>, stating "the same blinkered overconfidence of school days is here to see in Rematch".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-next-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-june">Rematch has also been added to Xbox Game Pass</a>, for those with a subscription.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Hogwarts Legacy on Nintendo Switch was pretty naff, let’s be honest. A remarkable achievement, but one that was inevitably heavily compromised just to get it running at the low level that it managed. By contrast, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is a huge accomplishment that captures so much more of the tone and feel of the game on PS5, Xbox Series X or PC that it feels so much more worth playing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hogwarts Legacy on Switch 2 is a transfigurational new port!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AIeg7MFl6NY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a brand-new port of the game to Nintendo Switch, retaining none of the heavy compromises that were needed to work on Switch, and making its own adjustments to match the new hardware platform’s strengths and weaknesses.</p>


<p>The difference is night and day, though. The often very flat lighting and shading of the interior of Hogwarts on Nintendo Switch is replaced by the rich light and dark of more realistic internal lighting and illumination. This is one of the key areas where the game gets much closer to the game on PS5.</p>

		</div>

<p>To me, that is one of the most impactful changes, but there’s so many other changes that were made for the game on Switch that have effectively been reverted for Switch 2. It’s everything from how thick the grass looks on the ground with the draw distance, to the variety of fidelity of the trees in the grounds around Hogwarts, the shadows that things cast.</p>

<p>It’s seriously impressive.</p>

<p>Alongside this has come a general gameplay experience that better matches the game on PS5. Where Switch 1 had loading transitions to get into Hogsmeade and to walk into shops, Switch 2 is able to get back to the style of PS5, where the doors all just feel like they’re a bit haunted and slow to respond –&nbsp;most noticeable at major area transitions.</p>
<p>Flying around on a broomstick has also been sped back up, the faster storage and larger amount of RAM in the Switch 2 allowing for dynamic loading to keep up better. It’s one of those things you might notice most in side-by-side comparisons, or if you ever compare your records for time trials.</p>
<p>On a simplistic level, Hogwarts Legacy on Switch 2 is able to hold onto a 30fps target very well, Running through Hogwarts grounds on the path to Hogsmeade is basically just locked to 30fps, and when you reach Hogsmeade itself, you don’t have a loading screen like on Switch 1 and can just run straight into the tight village streets where, once again, performance is great.</p>

<p>Really, the main issues we’ve found have been with instances of loading stutter when coming up to the hidden loading screens at doors between areas –&nbsp;which when Hogwarts itself is a maze of doors and courtyards, does add frequent little blips, in addition to some pop-in and the fade of new lighting conditions. Flying around on a broom also leads to poor frame pacing, so this introductory time trial, for example, is 30fps, but it feels more juddery than it should be.</p>
<p>In any case, this all makes for a much more pleasant experience than the Switch 1, which can pretty much never maintain its 30fps target. Just running through the halls dips to the mid-20s, and the broom flying is seriously taxing for the system, such that this port slowed down the speed of flight to try and keep up.</p>
<p>You can, of course, play the Switch 1 port on Switch 2 via backward compatibility, and this does make it much more palatable. Dynamic resolutions will be better (though I’d argue still not exactly good), and the frame rate does steady up to 30fps, but there’s bad frame pacing here when running to Hogsmeade in particular. I guess Shiver Entertainment who did this Switch 1 port didn’t feel the need to look at this when they had much bigger problems!</p>
<p>Of course, even 30fps is a big step back from what is possible on PS5 and other more powerful platforms. They have graphics performance options, ranging from 30fps fidelity and ray tracing modes, through a standard 60fps performance mode and even a higher frame rate mode.</p>

<p>The main comparison, to my mind, would be from Switch 2 to PS5 performance mode. Not the max fidelity or performance, but the safe middle-ground. With this, you definitely notice some of the compromises still being made for Switch 2. And…. well, honestly you don’t even need to make this comparison to see how the Switch 2 relies on lower resolutions and upscaling to get the job done. The key area that always grabs my attention is when in the dialogue scenes and you can see the low resolution hair with jaggies and floating isolated strands. The diffuse reflections on shiny walls and floors through Hogwarts also have much more of a speckled look at you get to the ends, though intriguingly, it does seem that there are more of these reflections by default on Switch 1, vs. performance mode on PS5.</p>

<p>However, in general, this is an incredibly impressive new port of Hogwarts Legacy for Nintendo Switch 2. Yes, there are of course compromises, but it really captures the look and feel of the original game release that makes it feel of that generation, and not like the necessarily cut down port of the original Switch.</p>
<p>It’s also nice to see that, while this is new work, Warner Bros. is offering upgrade pricing. If you own the game on Switch 1, you can access a DLC from the game’s main menu to enable a discount price for the full Switch 2 game to bring it down to $10 or £8.50. This could have been made more obvious with a Switch 2 Edition style release, but has the major benefit that you won’t need the Switch 1 cartridge to play anymore, if you’re coming from a physical copy. For one of the biggest generational leaps you’ll ever likely see, that’s a bargain, but it’s also just a nice good faith upgrade in general.</p>

<p>Hogwarts Legacy is a great port for Nintendo Switch 2, and another great showcase of how the console can punch above its weight.</p>

			<p>A new game project titled Lionhearts <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/612741239/lionhearts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared on Kickstarter</a> yesterday, seeking a minimum of $100K, of which over half has already been pledged. ROBLOX fans might recognize the name from <a href="https://www.roblox.com/communities/1160789" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lionhearts: Crusade</a>, a conquest experience developed by Credenzio Studios that reached over 6.3 million plays in the popular game since its original release in 2018.</p>
<p>Now, Colorado-based developer Credenzio is turning the concept into a standalone game developed with Unreal Engine 5. It will be a persistent multiplayer feudal simulator inspired by games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-to-get-war-sails-nautical-expansion-this-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mount and Blade: Bannerlord</a>, Assassin's Creed, Helldivers, and EVE Online.</p>
<p>The game is set in a historically authentic 12th-century medieval world, specifically during the Third Crusade. The developers pledged to respect the bounds of historical plausibility and accuracy. In this context, players will be given nearly complete reign, with NPCs having little to no presence in the game world. They'll start with having to gain favor in their kingdom to ascend the religious, military, or trade hierarchies and acquire wealth, tools, lands, and power. To do so, they'll choose one of the three career paths of the age: military, religious, or trade. With 16 factions, 14 guild types offering 60+ career paths, and 4 religions, players can become a knight, blacksmith, bishop, merchant, or even a king, eventually ruling the Holy Land itself.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lionhearts Official Cinematic Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UEj2d-uBhEY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Lionhearts, there will be 12 player-run kingdoms and 4 military orders, in which every position of power, from lord to king, is controlled by real players. Players can command retinues, wage wars, and navigate diplomacy in an ever-changing struggle for land and influence. Monarchs must balance internal politics, trade, and religion while competing for dominance in the Holy Land and beyond. As mentioned earlier, Credenzio is promising a persistent MMO-like world. This is supposed to happen through a server meshing-like technology where servers are stitched together to create a single, seamless shared open world. Each location will exist in a single instance, so there will be no need for server hopping or loading screens.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Lordship of Belmont Lionhearts Demo" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KnhlOcNb7F0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Needless to say, it's an incredibly ambitious project, especially for an indie studio. There is, however, a 'visual demo' available for download (the link is on the Kickstarter page) for those interested. Otherwise, you could simply add <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3348690/Lionhearts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lionhearts</a> to your Steam wishlist.</p>

            <p>You thought the summer showcases were done? Well, no they are not! Capcom has today announced its own showcase, scheduled for next week.</p>
<p>Capcom Spotlight, as it is known, will shine a light on upcoming games Pragmata and Resident Evil Requiem, as well as existing titles <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>
<p>The whole thing will last for around 40 minutes, Capcom has said, offering us all the "latest news and extended commentary with developer interviews". It will kick off on 26th June, at 11pm here in the UK.</p>

<p>While the specifics of what Capcom will be spotlighting next week remain mostly under wraps for now, this showcase will include some information on the newest update for Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>As for those other games, we got our first look at Resident Evil Requiem earlier this month, when the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">introduced us all to Grace Ashcroft and a destroyed Raccoon City</a>.</p>
<p>Our Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>. Bodes well!</p>
<p>Capcom also gave us <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-pragmata-coming-2026-developer-promises">another look at Pragmata earlier this month</a>. This is the studio's long in the works astronaut and small girl-starring game. "Pragmata is a fascinating genre mash-up, and Capcom at its experimental best," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pragmata-is-a-fascinating-genre-mash-up-and-capcom-at-its-experimental-best-hands-on">Eurogamer's hands-on Pragmata preview</a>.</p>

            <p>Grant Kirkhope, composer of the DK Rap, wasn't aware it would be used in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Nintendo detailed more on its forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> gorilla platformer and fans spotted the inclusion of the DK Rap, originally created for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a>.</p>
<p>But Kirkhope was not aware it would be used again in Donkey Kong Bananza. Based on past use, it seems unlikely he'll be credited too.</p>

<p>"Well, what can I say, the worst rap track in the history of rap tracks seems to be back again!" joked Kirkhope to Eurogamer.</p>
<p>"It's so bizarre that people seem to like it now considering the backlash that I got when DK64 first came out, nobody seemed to get the joke except me... haha... I've only had to wait 25 years for that to happen! Actually I think that little kids got the joke but the cool teenagers didn't!"</p>
<p>He added: "My tombstone will read, 'Here lies the body of Grant Kirkhope, he wrote the DK Rap and the Goldeneye Pause Music'... Nothing else will matter!!"</p>
<p>Eurogamer previously spoke to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dk-rap-composer-explains-why-nintendo-didnt-credit-him-in-the-super-mario-bros-movie">Kirkhope about the inclusion of the DK Rap in Nintendo's The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>. Kirkhope was not credited for its use.</p>
<p>"[Nintendo] said we decided that any music that was quoted from the games that we owned, we wouldn't credit the composers - apart from Koji Kondo," he explained. "Then they decided anything with a vocal would get credited, so the DK Rap scores there. But then they decided if we also own it, we won't credit the composers. And that was the final nail in the coffin.</p>
<p>"I said I appreciate you've got your policies and all the rest of it, but by the time the credits roll in the movie to show the songs, the theatre's completely empty, everyone's gone, it's only me and my wife and my two kids sat there going 'look daddy's name!'. I said 'for the sake of a couple of lines of text…', but that was that."</p>
<p>Considering Nintendo owns the DK Rap score, it would appear Kirkhope may once again not be credited for its inclusion in Donkey Kong Bananza.</p>

            <p>Well, there you go. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s great enhanced bossening has begun, with the first of the toughened up terrors FromSoft had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-new-enhanced-boss-fights-have-leaked-early-thanks-to-nosy-modders">previously teased</a> having just rocked up.</p>
<p>It's the Gaping Jaw boss, and it'll be followed by other Everdark Sovereigns in a time-limited weekly rotation of advanced adversaries for folks to test their mettle and friendships against.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged-elden-ring-nightreign?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=NIGHTREIGN-Everdark-News">announced by FromSoft</a> at 6AM UK time today, June 19th, in what I assume to be a commendable effort to get everyone out of bed on a very hot Thursday, the Everdark Sovereign version of Gaping Jaw is now available to battle. That's assuming you've managed to defeat the base version of Gaping Jaw already. If not, you'll have to take that on as a pre-megajaw warm-up.</p>
<p>If you can beat enhanced Gaping Jaw, you'll get some Sovereign <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sigil">Sigil</a> tokens as a reward you can then trade in for "special relics and other items", with your first victory over each of these extra-resilient rivals netting you more tokens than subsequent wins. If you want an idea of what you're in for with this first time around, the sorts of streamers who specialise in beating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-malenia-walkthrough">Malenia</a> with one health while doing a handstand and pressing keys with the power of their minds have already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWMWNVZB2YY">taken on the fresh foe</a>.</p>
<p>This initial crack at Gaping Jaw will run until June 26th at 1:59 AM BST, which is 20:59 on June 25th in ET, at which point enhanced Gaping Jaw will be whisked away, possibly to return at some point down the line. The enhanced versions of Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight are next up in the rotation, with FromSoft adding that Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast, and Fissure in the Fog's Everdark Sovereigns will be arriving at a later date.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that in order to take on these enhanced bosses, you'll need to launch the game in online mode, but it looks like modders may have already found a way to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/202?tab=description">make them available offline</a> as they arrive by swapping them for their regular counterparts. So, if you want to take them on using modded gear or as a twosome via the duos mod, you should be able to do just that.</p>
<p>If you'll be diving back in for your first expedition in a while, make sure to check out what the first few <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-latest-patch-is-good-news-for-madness-fans-and-should-save-you-from-auto-death-after-boss-fight-revives">patches</a> for Nightreign have tweaked and our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">guides</a> if you fancy a refresher to help you get back up to top speed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>I’m a massive fan of&nbsp;TRON, but more specifically, I’m a massive fan of TRON: Legacy. The 2010 sci-fi sequel has been cemented in my subconscious since the day it came out. The world it built has always been so captivating to me, with sleek metal obelisks and neon colorized highlights dancing around in my dreams most nights. It’s all complemented by gripping audio design, from the roar of the light cycles to the zap of a bouncing identity disc and the iconic Daft Punk&nbsp;curated score. Every opportunity I get to revisit that world is a thrill, so I’ve been chomping at the bit to get my hands on the latest spinoff of my favorite sci-fi property –&nbsp;TRON: Catalyst.</p>

<p>While it doesn’t have a number in the title, TRON: Catalyst pretty much a direct follow-up to Bithell Games’ 2023 visual novel, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tron-identity">TRON: Identity</a>. The two titles make a really complementary pair and, after rolling credits on this latest release, it’s clear they’re aiming to continue this story further with a third entry. TRON: Catalyst focuses our sights on Exo, a program working as a courier in the virtual city of Vertical_Slice who lands in hot water when her last delivery of the night ends up being an explosive device that goes off in her hands. She makes it out alive, but not unaffected. Whatever she was tasked to deliver ended up giving her the ability to Glitch, which lets her rewind time to an earlier point whenever she chooses. Hunting for answers on why she can do this and who’s responsible lands her in the middle of a plot of resistance and uprising, and a race against the clock to stop a Glitch storm from wiping out the entire system.</p>


<p>Mechanically, the glitch ability is a lot less exciting than it sounds. I’m a sucker for a good time-loop game, but it needs to smartly loop that concept equally through the narrative and the gameplay. TRON: Catalyst doesn’t strike that balance. Your hand is often held tightly by the game as your objects guide you on when to press the loop button to reset the current chapter, retaining your obtained info and abilities to progress down a new path. Despite the illusion of dialogue choices and branching exploration, the entire experience is incredibly linear, never once feeling like you have the ability to shape any outcomes yourself.</p>


<p>Despite the middling use of time-loop gameplay, I was still in awe getting to run around the world of TRON and explore such lovingly crafted locales. The dense Iso-populated cities and barren, green-tinted Outlands perfectly matched my memories of them from other TRON properties, and the pink-tinted Automata add a new element to the mix that I loved exploring. You’re given iconic tools like the Identity Disc and a Lightcycle to play around with, too.</p>
<p>Tossing and slicing your disc plays out in pretty basic real-time combat, with a skill-tree that helps expand your abilities. It’s hardly the focus of the game or it’s strongest suit, but it helps break up the exploration heavy segments that occupy the rest of the game. Lightcycle chases and battles, on the other hand, are a delight. The top-down viewpoint of the game never properly captures the sense of speed you’d hope for from these moments, but the battles are so satisfying and I could honestly see myself getting lost in a mode that was nothing but those bike battles for hours, if it was on offer.</p>

<p>If there’s one element of TRON: Catalyst that actively disappointed me, though, it was the soundtrack. A major part of the modern identity for the TRON franchise is it’s music. TRON: Legacy introduced us to the electronic and orchestral fusion of Daft Punk excellence that has gone on to influence the music of every spin-off title since then, and the upcoming TRON: Ares film promises to carve out an equally exciting audio identity for itself with a soundtrack composed by Nine Inch Nails. TRON: Catalyst fails to ignite the same excitement that most Tron music does, its score often playing it safe and basic and remaining buried far too deep into the background. It also doesn’t buck trends and try to establish it’s own identity with those tracks. Instead, it feels like the safest, undetectable interpretation of what TRON: Legacy introduced to us.</p>
<p>That’s probably the best word I could use to describe TRON: Catalyst –<strong>&nbsp;</strong>safe. It has a lot of big ideas, but only gives you the faintest taste of each of them. As a fan of the franchise, I still adored every second of it, but I was never truly wowed or inspired playing this as I was from any other entries in the series. With an ending that so clearly queues up a sequel, my biggest wish is that whatever comes next is bigger, bolder, and louder in every way possible.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		TRON: Catalyst is a safe spin-off of the iconic TRON: Legacy world - it presents big ideas but only ever dips it's toes into those waters, wrapping things up as a mostly okay game that existing fans will likely find a lot of joy in nonetheless. 	</p></div>

<p>She ain't no Odd Rock</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="DK Bananza 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e21dc5f3ea534/dk-bananza-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">Direct</a> from Nintendo revealed that DK's new companion, Odd Rock, isn't actually Odd Rock at all, but rather a young Pauline. Gasp!</p>
<p>We all kind of knew this was coming, of course, thanks to a previous leak, but it's still pretty cool to see just how vital she'll prove to be with the overarching story.</p>
<p>Thanks to a new page via the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aaaca/index.html">Japanese Nintendo Store</a>, even more details regarding Pauline have been revealed, including her age. According to a very brief summary of her character, she is 13 years old at the time she encounters DK in Bananza.</p>
<p>Translated via Google, the sumary reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A 13-year-old girl who loves to sing. She used to live above ground, but for some reason she was brought to the underground world and turned into a rock."</p>
</blockquote>
<figure><a title="Pauline - DK Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5fdc75f17bb9a/pauline-dk-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Direct revealed that Pauline can use her singing abilities to point DK in the right direction during gameplay, while also transforming him into one of three new forms: Kong Bananza, Zebra Bananza, and Ostrich Bananza.</p>
<p>Co-op play is also supported, with a second player taking on the role of Pauline to sing out deadly words to defeat enemies and blast away chunks of the environment. GameShare has also been confirmed for DK Bananza, with users of Switch 1 consoles able to join the fun.</p>

            <p>I actually can't remember the last time I played a shmup. Maybe a Gradius? I don't know anything about ZPF's genremates or even what its name stands for, but I do know a good colourful big bastard turtle when I see one, and that was enough for me to try the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3095410/ZPF/">Steam demo</a>.</p>
<p>"Great score!" Zam Pankman-Fried told me after I died 45 seconds in. From this, I learned that ZPF is a massive liar, but also that I actually quite like shmups still. Pretty compelling as far as avoid the bad thing 'em ups go.</p>

<p>There is/was/are going to be <a href="https://megacatstudios.com/pages/zpf">physical carts of this one available</a>, and while I appreciate the commitment to the 16-bit, I know where buying one physical game ends, and it ends with me buying so many I'm forced to start an unsuccessful retro gaming YouTube channel where I film myself in front of my heaving collection to adopt an air of legitimacy like a Netflix documentary trying to convince you to heed an MBA's opinion on magic mushrooms because they're sitting in front of a very large bookshelf. Steam suits my purposes fine for now. Here are some features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Inspired by classic horizontal shooters like Lords of Thunder, Elemental Master, and the Thunderforce series, ZPF is a passion project from the designer and developer of Super XYX and Tänzer.</li>
<li>Players will dodge and weave through intense bullet patterns, unleashing a barrage of firepower upon hordes of unique and challenging enemies.</li>
<li>Brace yourself for epic encounters with mid and end-stage bosses, each demanding a different strategy to defeat.</li>
<li>Upgrade your arsenal and gain valuable tips between levels at each of the world’s in-game shops.</li>
<li>Finish every stage and discover a treasure trove of hidden secrets.</li>

<p>Needless to say I really like how this one looks, even if I lack the language this morning to call it anything more precise than "colourful and cybery". Rainbow Geiger? Enlighten me, art style knowers. Reminds me quite a bit of <a href="https://hollow-press.net/collections/cyberflesh/products/cyberflesh-boardgame">Hollow Press's Cyberflesh</a>. Will I get good enough at it to see that turtle in the cyberflesh? Doubtful, but I'm motivated.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has been shadow dropped, bringing stronger Nightlords to defeat on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>These limited-time versions of bosses are known as the Everdark Sovereigns and will have new moves and increased power. The first to appear will be an enhanced Adel, Baron of the Night (Gaping Jaw) for this week, to be followed by the Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight.</p>
<p>The remaining Nightlords will be added at a later date. At the end of each week the "Sovereign will disappear from the available Expeditions… for now".</p>

<p>Note that these Everdark Sovereigns will only be available once the original form of that Nightlord has been defeated.</p>
<p>What's more, defeating the Everdark Sovereigns rewards players with Sovereign Sigils. These are unique tokens that can be exchanged for special Relics and items. Additional Sigils will be rewarded the first time an Everdark Sovereign is defeated.</p>
<p>"This is only the beginning of the Everdark Sovereign cycle," read the <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged-elden-ring-nightreign">update notes</a>. "As the power of the Night ebbs and wanes, the Sovereigns will soon return to the abyss they came from."</p>
<p>At the start of the month, FromSoftware stated that "enhanced fights against existing Nightlords" would be on the way, while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">duo mode is coming "at a later date"</a>. Even before this, though, dataminers discovered game files for new phases of each Nightlord encounter, so this update was very much expected.</p>
<p>What wasn't expected, perhaps, was the weekly cycle of these encounters. It's a smart live service-esque twist to keep players coming back regularly and exactly what the game needs to extend its longevity.</p>
<p>Once all the Nightlords are defeated, the only reason to return is to complete Remembrances with each character. This may not be attractive enough for some, so seeing the beginning of regular updates is a welcome addition.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-confirmed-dlc-but-what-could-be-included">DLC is also on the way</a>, although it's unknown what this will include. Would a Bloodborne pack of returning bosses be too much to ask?</p>
<p>The Everdark Sovereign version of Adel, Baron of the Night is available from today, 19th June until 26th June at 1:59am UK time.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is FromSoftware's online multiplayer spin-off to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>. It's "an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Eurogamer's Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>There's no doubt that Mario Kart World is the most important launch game for the Nintendo Switch 2. Not only is it the only new game (no, the Welcome Tour definitely doesn't count) made by Nintendo for the launch lineup, it's also the sequel to one of the best-selling games ever. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, at last count, has sold nearly 70 million units on the original Switch.</p>
<p>Whether Mario Kart World can match it with similar success remains to be seen over a long period of time. Still, the early reception is promising. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, the game earned an 8.5 out of 10 score from Nathan Birch, who wrote:</p>
<p><em>Mario Kart World is a bold and ambitious new entry in the world’s most popular racing franchise, delivering smartly updated mechanics, a collection of gorgeous courses, and an open world that impresses with its scope and variety. Admittedly, the game doesn’t quite manage to eclipse the giant that is Mario Kart 8 and some classic modes don’t mesh perfectly with the new sandbox approach, but there’s no denying Mario Kart World gets the Switch 2 off to a peppy start.</em></p>
<p>Making the new open world-style game required a much larger workforce, though. Japanese analyst Papen (<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/mario-kart-world-had-a-significantly-larger-dev-team-than-past-entries-with-art-related-positions-increasing-threefold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Automaton</a>) has looked into the headcount, discovering that around 300 developers worked on Mario Kart World, compared to 163 on MK8 Deluxe. That shows how Nintendo is following the market trend in this regard, with larger and inevitably more expensive teams making bigger games.</p>
<p>The biggest increase was in the art department, which tripled in size from one game to another. Furthermore, like most of the gaming industry nowadays, Nintendo leveraged several development teams beyond Nintendo EPD, such as Monolith Soft, Bandai Namco, Imagica Geeq, and 1-Up Studio. This could go some way to explaining why Mario Kart World was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infamously priced at $80</a>.</p>
<p>Did you purchase the game alongside the Nintendo Switch 2? If so, please comment below with your impressions.</p>
