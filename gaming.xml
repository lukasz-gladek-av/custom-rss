            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/max-payne-remakes-control-spinoff-remedy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>developer Remedy Entertainment has released its financial report for the first half of the 2025 fiscal year, and it contains some encouraging news about&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and the forthcoming&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes.</p>
<p>Per Remedy's <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-plc-half-year-financial-report-january-june-2024-codename-condor-and-max-payne-12-remake-in-full-production-and-alan-wake-2-night-springs-expansion-launched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes, which still don't have a release window, have now entered "the full production stage", having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/max-payne-remakes-remedy-production">entered the "production readiness stage" back in October last year</a>. This suggests development on the remakes is progressing pretty smoothly.</p>
<p>The report also offers an update on&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/control-2-announcement-promises-more-mind-bending-fun">first announced in November 2022</a>. The upcoming sequel has entered the aforementioned "production readiness stage", according to Remedy, which means we can likely expect full production to ramp up a few months from now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/remedy-revenue-max-payne-remakes-control-2.jpg?itok=FwHIS0o9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/remedy-revenue-max-payne-remakes-control-2.jpg?itok=FPf1yaQg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>is apparently ready to enter production.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, if you're looking for an update on Remedy's&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>spinoff <i>Codename Condor</i>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-trademark-fbc-firebreak">may or may not end up being called&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>, that's also in full production, according to Remedy.</p>
<p>All of this info comes from a financial report that also sees Remedy's revenue increasing by 33.7% year-over-year, although profits are down by around 10%, so it's not an entirely rosy picture for the Finnish studio.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like things still aren't looking up for horror sequel&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>, either, as the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-budget-remedy-financials">has yet to turn a profit</a> ten months after its release. Despite that, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala says the game has "recouped most of its development and marketing expenses" at the time of the report's publication.</p>
<p>Virtala also says that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-codename-kestrel-canceled">cancellation of Tencent collab&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-codename-kestrel-canceled">Codename Kestrel</a>&nbsp;</em>back in May has given the studio "increased focus and better development synergies", as well as allowing it to "move experienced developers into other game projects".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/remedy-alan-wake-2.jpg?itok=RpW5fNxs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/remedy-alan-wake-2.jpg?itok=gVRYcChq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>still hasn't made Remedy any money, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what's next for Remedy? Right now, the studio has "two games in full production" (that's the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes and&nbsp;<em>Condor</em>, so it looks like Remedy is counting those remakes as one project) and one "in the production readiness stage" (i.e.&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>).</p>
<p>The studio also says that since it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-control-franchise-rights">acquired the rights to the&nbsp;<em>Control</em> franchise</a>&nbsp;from 505 Games, it's able to "choose how to bring [its] future games to the market", which involves "weighing self-publishing" and "different partner publishing opportunities".</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens next, but we'll likely get more info on the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes, as well as&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Condor</em>, in the coming months. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Headsets, keyboards, mice, and other peripherals form the remainder of revenue, with all except mice being $1 billion-plus market categories. It is the Other category that will see the strongest rises to 2029, buoyed by sales of higher-value peripherals and accessories such as gamer chairs and steering wheels.</span></p><p>Source: Omdia’s Games Peripherals and Accessories Market Forecast 2024</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The latest data shows that global peripherals spend has kicked on from its new post-pandemic baseline, with 2023 revenue now surpassing the previous high from 2021.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While games themselves face strong consumer resistance to price increases, there is more price elasticity for premium peripherals, with products such as PlayStation’s DualSense controller selling strongly despite costing $200+. With leading PC games storefront Steam stating that controller usage on its platform has tripled since 2018, there are positive factors beyond the ebb and flow of the console cycle contributing to what will be 2.9% annual growth from 2024 to 2029.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This year, for the first time Omdia has broken out gamepads revenue by brand, sizing Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, and other brands’ gamepads. Nintendo’s growth comes from the runaway success of the Switch, but it has not tested the premium gamepad market in the same manner as its console rivals, with its top branded controllers coming in at well under $100.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Conversely, Microsoft’s current-generation Series X/S console has underperformed expectations, but the company’s position as the leading gamepad brand for PC has led to respectable growth nonetheless; Steam has stated that 59% of its greatly increased gamepad sessions were derived from Xbox controllers. Like Sony, Microsoft is also adept at providing offerings for the premium market, further boosting revenue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sony, however, enjoys both strong gamepads sales tied to console and an increased PC presence—Sony gamepads revenue is expected to break $2 billion by 2029—as well as providing desirable audio equipment such as the $200 Pulse earbuds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other gamepad brands straddle a wide range, from cheap, third-party versions of console controllers to top-of-the-range products from the likes of Turtle Beach, Razer, and SCUF.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A sector to watch within this category is mobile controllers – gamepads from companies such as Backbone that attach to a smartphone, transforming it into a gaming device with a similar form factor to the Switch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The potential to improve both mobile gaming itself, and the cloud gaming experience on mobile, is self-evident, and a factor behind Omdia’s belief that the Other category will surpass Microsoft gamepads revenue by 2029.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and Omdia are sibling organizations under Informa</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Research Director, Game, Omdia </p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dom Tait is Omdia’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/authors/dom-tait">Research Director</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for games, music and audio, and consumer platforms and AI research.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dom joined Omdia in 2014 and has worked across the spectrum of entertainment and media on high-profile consulting projects, with a specialization in games and—increasingly—how they converge with other media.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dom’s background is in media, having played editorial roles for a range of publications before joining Omdia.

Its launch back in February was marked by a meteoric ascent to the top of the charts, but the past few months have been marred by controversy and upheaval that has hurt the game and the reputation of the the team behind it.

It cast players as highly replaceable pawns in Super Earth’s army, which finds itself in the middle of a “second Galactic War” against other forces vying for control of the system. It’s an inherently ridiculous premise that walks and talks like a playable version of <em>Starship Troopers</em>.</p><p>At first, you could only face off against the Terminids, which are a bug-like alien species that descend on players in overwhelming numbers. Soon enough though, a second front of the war manifested against an army of robots that really plunged players into the deep end. To combat those odds, <em>Helldivers 2 </em>encouraged folks to invite their friends into the fray and rendered momentous experiences from the chaos that’d ensue.</p><p>That was the real thing that I feel sold <em>Helldivers 2</em> to so many people: it seemed to love mess. The game itself ultimately proved to be a little too glitchy for its own good, but at the outset, it kind of valued this sense of incongruity and wrongness, and even spun it into a fun aspect of the game. I don’t log in to <em>Helldivers 2</em>, drop into the action to “do my part,” and feel terribly triumphant. I certainly exclaim after we successfully extract from a mission, but I walk away from these skirmishes thinking, “What the hell are we doing here? We’re getting lit up by killer robots who are thinning our literal manpower and then getting vivisected by bugs. We’re barely making it, what the fuck.” And that was an exhilarating feeling that nothing else was providing.</p><p>I spend most of my time in the game running away from all the things trying to kill me. In the meantime, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kill-beat-impalers-guide-update-1851614495&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kill-beat-impalers-guide-update-1851614495">Impalers’ tentacles are bursting out of the ground </a></span>and sending me flying. Robots are tearing me to bits. My own flying laser sentry <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-friendly-fire-always-on-arrowhead-ps5-pc-1851329269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-friendly-fire-always-on-arrowhead-ps5-pc-1851329269">can’t distinguish between friend and foe</a></span>, often setting me on fire or slicing through an ally in an instant. My own friends will call down heavy artillery from our battleships in orbit that wind up incinerating fellow team members in order to eradicate bug nests. And when you finally extract from a nightmare of a mission, you emerge back onto the ship a bloody mess.</p><p>Things continued to look up for <em>Helldivers 2 </em>for a few months. New features like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-mechs-tien-kwan-1851317710&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-mechs-tien-kwan-1851317710">pilotable mech suits</a></span> were woven into larger storylines playing out over the weeks. Major orders taught the community to work together toward common goals. Strategies formed, teams were decided on, and battles were fought. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-malevelon-creek-memorial-capes-1851384481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-malevelon-creek-memorial-capes-1851384481">Malevelon Creek</a></span>, a famously embattled planet in <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s first months, became an almost religious site, and is now commemorated with an in-game holiday. For months, writing about <em>Helldivers 2</em> felt like writing about an entirely different beast every few weeks.</p><p>For a while there, <em>Helldivers 2 </em>was almost perceived as punk by the players who loved it. Here was this game that bucked every big trend, from pricing to release cadence. This game that was heavy metal and messy and audacious. It was an overnight sensation in an industry that often glorifies highly polished and sanitized experiences over something as rough and tumble as <em>Helldivers 2</em>. It was an outlier blazing some new path forward.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-patch-1851614478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-patch-1851614478">Flamethrowers Were King In <em>Helldivers 2</em>, But Not Anymore And Players Are Threatening Mass Desertions</a></span></p><p>Before long though, things shifted for the worse. Suddenly, the sweeping changes that Arrowhead Studios was making all the time stopped being novel, and became more of a hindrance. Arrowhead stopped being the architects of players’ dreams and fantasies; instead they became this kind of collar around the community’s neck. Balance changes continued to drastically change the game every other week, upsetting both veteran and casual players alike. Sure, <em>Helldivers 2 </em>prided itself on being a bit of a mess, but what it really needed was some foundation that wouldn’t be eroded by an update five days later. </p><p>Everything that people championed about the game at the beginning came right back around to bite it in the ass, but how could we expect anything else? <em>This </em>is what these games do and are about. These are the incredibly fickle “models” of games that we’re inheriting and continuously propping up. By throwing your weight behind them, you tacitly approve of these kinds of shifts. For better and certainly for worse, you commit to the ups and downs of this journey.</p><p>Unfortunately the community hasn’t always seen it that way. While <em>Helldivers 2 </em>has its loving and loyal fans, video games tend to have audiences capable of immense vitriol, and <em>Helldivers 2 </em>and its developers have certainly experienced their fair share of that venom in a short time. Look no further than the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071">PSN login drama</a></span> that nearly ended the game, and from which Arrowhead is <em>still </em>reeling. An unforced error in judgment from the game’s publisher caused an unpopular mandate to go out which quite literally ripped the game’s burgeoning global community apart. I’m almost sure that there are <em>still </em>countries and regions in the world where <em>Helldivers 2 </em>hasn’t returned to PC storefronts because they couldn’t support PSN and were forced to pull the game.</p><p>Anyone with some sense might’ve told Sony that requiring a PSN account to play a game you bought on a different platform was boneheaded, but the move really put Arrowhead on its backfoot since it had to bear the brunt of the backlash. Due to an incredibly reckless ploy, a studio and game that requires an engaged and recurring community to stay afloat suddenly found itself on the outs through no fault of its own. The worst part is that even though Sony eventually walked back the mandate, the target on Arrowhead’s back has never really gone away, and as I wrote a few months back, it started to seem like the game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-dark-fluid-mission-fix-arrowhead-1851512049&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-dark-fluid-mission-fix-arrowhead-1851512049">just couldn’t catch a break</a></span>.</p><p>Now, every update is met with some level of trepidation. If Arrowhead does something the community deems even remotely out of line, its fans pounce on it with an intensity I’ve rarely seen so up close. Sometimes, that means that the studio is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-patch-buff-stratagems-1851540317&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-patch-buff-stratagems-1851540317">heralded when popular changes are implemented</a></span>, like a balance patch that strengthened some abilities in the game over a month ago. However for every one of those patches, there are ones like the most recent update, which has once again sparked a fire under the community and is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-patch-1851614478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-patch-1851614478">motivating many to up and abandon the game</a></span>. I fear that <em>Helldivers 2 </em>and Arrowhead are now in a vicious cycle of their own making.</p><p>It’s a shame because <em>Helldivers 2 </em>is still as great as it ever was. I’ve recently picked it up again after a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">major update released earlier this week</a></span>, and when you’re <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-farming-grinding-max-level-samples-ps5-pc-1851287157&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-farming-grinding-max-level-samples-ps5-pc-1851287157">not preoccupied with being the very best player</a></span> ever, it’s still a blast unlike most anything else on the market. I just hope others wise up to that before the various forces pushing and pulling on the game and its developers undo everything that they worked so hard to create.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to a new <a href="https://s26.q4cdn.com/977690160/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/Unity-Q224-Transcript.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earnings call</a> released this week, Unity CEO Matt Bromberg states that the upcoming Unity 6 game engine upgrade is expected to release in Fall 2024.</p>



<p>Bromberg says that Unity 6 is “on track for release this fall,” and adds that Unity believes “it will be the most stable, best-performing version we’ve ever delivered.” </p>



<p>Additionally, Bromberg reinforces that “Unity 6 is going to be the bedrock of our offering for years to come.” </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>One analyst specifically asked about Unity’s upcoming runtime fees, the Pro transition, and any potential tier pricing changes. </p>



<p>Regarding price increases, Bromberg said that “we don’t expect to see them right away, but we do see them coming in over time.” </p>



<p>The divisive Runtime Fees apply to games created with or upgraded to Unity 6. The thresholds also include $1 million USD revenue trailing 12 months, and 1 million initial engagements. </p>



<p>In a separate <a href="https://s26.q4cdn.com/977690160/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/Q224-Shareholder-letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shareholder letter</a> today, Unity also reported that “second quarter results exceeded guidance for both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.” </p>



<p>However, the letter also mentions that revenue from Unity’s strategic portfolio was “down 6% year-over-year.”</p>



<p>Unity recently faced fan backlash, and in May 2024, reports surfaced that new Unity CEO Matthew Bromberg <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-ceo-salary-new-bonus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">netted millions</a> to sign on for the role via base salary and a bonus. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-ceo-stepping-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous CEO stepped down</a> in October 2023.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-eternal-modding-tool-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>id Software and Bethesda have released a new&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>update that includes a preview of the game's new modding tool, which you can use to download, organize, and play your favorite mods.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/782330/view/4328607063611272123" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>Steam page, the two studios say that they're "so impressed" with&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal</em>'s modding community and its ability to create mods without any tools.</p>
<p>These community efforts were the inspiration behind the release of idStudio, which allows you to create and play&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>mods, and they were also the inspiration behind the PC Mod Preview, which lets you check out the mods others have made.</p>
<p>This feature is only available on the PC versions of&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal</em>, so you'll only be able to check it out if you're playing on Steam or the Microsoft Store. It's supported on both storefronts, though, so if you're playing on Game Pass, you can still check it out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-eternal-modding-tool-pain-elemental.jpg?itok=4v3uAcAK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-eternal-modding-tool-pain-elemental.jpg?itok=E_ZwDpPP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>has some new modding tools for you to enjoy.</figcaption></figure><p>Sadly, the idStudio beta is only available via Steam, so if you're interested in building your own&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>mods, you'll have to be playing on the Steam version to do so. However, the mods you build can still be enjoyed by Microsoft Store players.</p>
<p>If you want to opt into the PC Mod Preview build on Steam, all you've got to do is head into&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal</em>'s Properties, then select the PC Mod Preview beta from the Betas drop-down menu. You can read more about&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal</em>'s shiny new modding feature <a href="https://idstudio.idsoftware.com/faq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h2><em>Doom&nbsp;</em>fans have more to look forward to as well</h2>
<p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>modding tools that&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>fans have to enjoy right now, as Nightdive Studios has also stepped forward with a brand new surprise release.</p>
<p>The studio, which is behind the re-release of retro classics like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/90s-classic-shadow-man-remastered-coming-to-pc-in-april">Shadow Man</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-the-thing-remaster-tease"><em>The Thing</em></a>, dropped remasters of the first two&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>games yesterday as part of Bethesda's QuakeCon celebrations.</p>

<p>Available across PC and consoles, the two remasters pack in a huge amount of content, including&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Doom 2</em>, all of their expansions, and even a brand new episode created as a collab between id, Nightdive, and MachineGames.</p>
<p>In short, if you're a&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>fan, you're eating well right now, especially given that a brand new <em>Doom&nbsp;</em>game is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement">also on the horizon</a>. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Doom</em>.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-dreamlight-valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a> will round out its current roadmap with the addition of Princess and the Frog's Tiana later this month, a new Steam post from developer Gameloft has confirmed. 
</p>
<p>
Owners of the life sim live service's paid expansion Rift in Time will also get the concluding chapter of its story, in which you can see off the evil Jafar for good.
</p>
<p>
Looking towards the tail end of this year, Disney Dreamlight Valley creative director Joshua Labelle <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1401590/view/4325229363897533816?l=english">acknowledged</a> that updates would become lighter than usual as the team ramped up to announce its next all-new roadmap and a larger update before the end of this year. 
</p>
<p>
Still, October will see players return to the game's Lion King realm to this time welcome Timon and Pumbaa. PlayStation owners of the game will also finally get the option to play via cross-platform multiplayer, with cross-save coming later in the year.
</p>
<p>
"Our October update will be smaller in scope and shorter," Labelle wrote, "with a focus on fixes and quality of life improvements to make your game experience smoother and more enjoyable as we ramp up to a bigger update later in the year."
</p>
<p>
In "late 2024", Gameloft has teased that players will be able to "stitch a new mystery together", accompanied by the patchwork dress worn by Sally in The Nightmare Before Christmas. Expect a 2025 roadmap for Disney Dreamlight Valley around the same time. 
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Labelle also wrote in broad terms about the future of Disney Dreamlight Valley, now nearly two years on from its original launch. In short, following fan feedback, improvements will be made to the game's furniture and wardrobe menus, as well as to provide more room for decoration in players' increasingly crowded Valleys.
</p>
<p>
"Last year, we promised to keep delivering free content updates that add new characters, Realms, clothing, furniture, and more surprises. That promise is as important today as it was then, especially when we look at new Villagers," Labelle concluded.
</p>
<p>
"Recent surveys have played an important role by providing us insight into what you'd like to see in Disney Dreamlight Valley and 2025 is already shaping up to be a year full of exciting surprises."

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-c-and-d/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision-starts-to-issue-cease-desists-to-black-ops-6-leakers-and-host-sites.949029/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-c-and-d/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Following a large number of Call of Duty Black Ops 6 leaks, Activision has started to issue Cease and Desist letters to Black Ops 6 leakers and host sites.</p>



<p>One of the biggest Black Ops 6 hosts was ‘PSLAN,’ who claimed that they had received a Cease and Desist letter from Activision. According to PSLAN, Activision claimed in the letter that the user was selling Black Ops 6 access for 6 euros a month and is claiming 250,000 euros in damages. As Insider Gaming reported a couple of days ago, hundreds of people <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-hundreds-of-people-playing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were already playing Black Ops 6</a> via PSLAN.</p>



<p>PSLAN has since removed support for Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>In addition to the host being issued <span>a C&amp;D, it appears that some Call of Duty leakers have also been issued similar </span>notices. Twitter user&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/HeyImAlaix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@HeyImAlaix</a>, who has been leaking Call of Duty for several years, has also seemingly been issued&nbsp;a C&amp;D (and not for the first time).</p>



<p>It’s unlikely that the Cease and Desists will stop the leakers from leaking Call of Duty, but for now, the flow of Black Ops 6 leaks will likely slow down. In addition to the C&amp;D, Activision has also been issuing DMCA takedowns on all Black Ops 6 content.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 multiplayer is set to be officially&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-watch-codnext/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed at the end of August in a CODNext event</a>, which will be prior to the Black Ops 6 BETA.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Brendan Depa, 18, was sentenced to five years in state prison on Tuesday for "brutally" beating a high school teaching assistant over a Nintendo Switch. The incident, which occurred on February 21, 2023, at Matanzas High School in Palm Coast, Florida, was captured on video and widely reported. Depa will also serve 15 years of probation following his release, as reported by <a href="https://www.news-journalonline.com/story/news/courts/2024/08/06/live-brendan-depa-florida-teen-who-beat-teachers-aide-to-be-sentenced/74671170007/" rel="nofollow ">Daytona Beach News-Journal</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Depa, then 17, attacked Joan Naydich after an altercation involving the gaming console. The video shows Depa assaulting Naydich in a school hallway, pushing her to the ground, and repeatedly kicking and punching her.</p><p dir="ltr">"Compounding the senseless physical violence was the screaming of obscenities, spitting on Ms. Naydich both before and during the incident," Circuit Judge Terence Perkins said, also highlighting Depa's lack of remorse. "He pursued her down the hallway, pushed her so violently from behind that she flew through the air and was knocked unconscious when she landed on the hallway floor. He then proceeded to kick her, then jump on top of her, striking her in the head and body more than 15 times."</p><p dir="ltr">Depa's defense argued that his autism spectrum disorder and his mother's criticisms of the sentence should be considered. Leanne Depa claimed that the sentence was influenced by racial and disability biases and criticized the school for not managing her son's disabilities properly.</p><p dir="ltr">Assistant State Attorney Melissa Clark argued for a substantial punishment, stating, "He almost killed a woman. He should be punished for that." Naydich, who suffers from PTSD and other long-term impacts, noted the significant personal and professional consequences of the attack.</p><p dir="ltr">Depa has the right to appeal the sentence but is ordered to have no contact with Naydich and to remain 500 feet away from her home and workplace.</p>

<p>Zelnick added: "I think that offering a frontline title with a premium price in a subscription service, day-and-date, will push consumers to that subscription service for at least a period of time."</p><p>Zelnick has been saying a version of this for years. In 2021, the executive said Take-Two <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-doesnt-want-new-games-on-game-pass/1100-6494686/" data-ref-id="1100-6494686">doesn't put its major new games on subscription services at launch</a> because "the economics are much more difficult to make sense of." In 2022, Zelnick said doing this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-launching-new-games-into-a-subscription-service-like-game-pass-makes-no-sense/1100-6509015/" data-ref-id="1100-6509015">makes no economic sense.</a></p><p>Zelnick maintains that there are major differences between the linear entertainment (TV/film) business and interactive entertainment (video game) business, and while a subscription service may make sense for linear entertainment, Zelnick doesn't see the same viability for games.</p><p>"The interactive entertainment business is very different than the linear entertainment business. People consume far fewer hours of interactive entertainment in a given month than they do of linear entertainment," he said. "And within that consumption, there are far fewer titles consumed in interactive entertainment than there are with linear entertainment. So I, at least, pose the question as to whether subscription makes as much sense for interactive entertainment as it does for linear entertainment and registered some skepticism, which I still hold."</p><p>Launching a major new game into a subscription services is "just a lost opportunity for the publisher," Zelnick said.</p><p>Take-Two has over the years experimented with bringing its biggest games, including GTA V and Red Dead Redemption 2, to services like Game Pass and PS Plus. Theses games have rotated in and out of the catalogs. Zelnick has said bringing its older titles to a subscription service might make sense, but for new titles, it's not something Take-Two is looking to do.</p><p>While Microsoft launches all of its first-party games into Xbox Game Pass on day one, Sony doesn't do this with its own PlayStation Plus membership program. PlayStation's former president Jim Ryan seemed to agree with Zelnick and previously discussed how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-on-why-it-wont-launch-games-day-one-on-ps-plus-like-xbox-game-pass/1100-6501975/" data-ref-id="1100-6501975">this doesn't make economic sense.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/thank-goodness-youre-here-impressions-north<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Britain: it's a complicated place. Take the name, for example: am I talking about the nation, whose full name is The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland? Am I talking about the <em>land</em>, which could be the island of Great Britain (the big one with England, Scotland and Wales in it), or the British Isles as a whole, which is a bunch of island that would also include both Irelands and the Channel Islands?</p><p>Confusing, right? No wonder so many Americans always get it wrong when talking about the place. It's also no wonder, then, that a lot of people not from the British Isles have no interest or capacity to learn about the differences between the peoples and regions of the place. It's probably hard enough for an American or European to remember which one Wales is, let alone the West Country, Ulster and the Midlands.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Thank Goodness You’re Here! - Reveal Trailer - Nintendo Switch" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/siT1HTSCY4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Those differences can be very important to the people who live there, though. And while some centuries-old relationships and rivalries are pretty well-known internationally--you don't need me explaining <em>Braveheart</em> to you--others might be less obvious to outsiders. Few more so than the north.</p><p>England might look like one country on the map, but for around 1000 years now--as long as it's been England, basically--it's been a country divided. There's the north, and everyone south of the north. I won't bore you with the full history here, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North%E2%80%93South_divide_in_England" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can study that in your own time if you're interested</a>, just know that from the Viking age through to the legacies of Thatcher and Brexit, England has not been as united as it might appear from the outside.</p><p>Countries always have their differences, but what I've always found interesting about England’s divide is the way that so much of what has been defined as English culture, so much of what has represented the country in its most popular media around the world, revolves around the South, especially London. I'm going to <em>wildly </em>generalise here, but from Dickens to <em>Notting Hill</em>, the streets and accents of England as depicted on the screen tend to be those from the South. </p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Every “Northern” character in a musical" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8uQ7VCWOnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>When the north must be portrayed, it's usually as a downtrodden caricature (see: <em>The Full Monty</em> or <em>Billy Elliot</em>), or in service of a fantasy universe's hardiest and most workmanlike peoples (see: the Starks). Imagine my surprise, then, when I first discovered then spent all weekend playing <em>Thank Goodness You're Here</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/thank-goodness-youre-here-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a game Riley already covered</a> because it's "hilarious and helpful", but which I also found of huge interest because it's a game that isn't just set in the north (and developed by a small studio based in Yorkshire), it's a <em>celebration </em>of it.</p><p><em>Thank Goodness You're Here</em> takes the piss out of itself at every given opportunity, but at the same time there's so much love for the culture and setting that I think it's the most defining thing about the game, even more than its brilliant writing and cast of unforgettable weirdos.</p><p>The fictional town of Barnsworth feels like a <em>place </em>in the best way, in the way all great video game places do, by being simultaneously small yet huge, intimate but expansive, a place where you know everybody and every street corner but are still always finding new things. And it's a place that's unashamedly of the north. If you've played the game and wondered why there are dialect options even though the game is set in England, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language_in_Northern_England#:~:text=There%20are%20traditional%20dialects%20associated,the%20nineteenth%20and%20twentieth%20centuries." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that's why</a>. Why the intro shows a region stuck in the 1950s <a href="https://jacobin.com/2023/03/the-north-will-rise-again-alex-niven-book-review-thatcherism-england-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even though it's the modern era</a>; <a href="https://www.yorkshirehandmadepies.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why</a> it's so proud of its pies.</p><figure></figure><p>It's great! My own English family is from Birmingham and I used to live just outside Brighton–which is as south as it gets–so I feel like a bit of an outsider writing this, but my wife's family is from Hull, and they roared with laughter at just about every part of the game I showed them last week, from the voice acting to the architecture to<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siT1HTSCY4g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the Peans commercial</a>. The idea that a <em>video game</em> would pitch itself like this was as welcome as it was surprising to them. And seeing their reaction as locals (or at least in their case former locals) made me wish more "Western" games could be this distinctly regional (with a shoutout here to another recent example of this,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88c-k4jQB-c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>A Highland Song</em></a>).</p><p>I actually meant to publish this piece earlier in the week, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg55we5n3xo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but then events transpired</a> and a blog about a quaint northern town suddenly seemed a bit ill-timed; this was not a great moment to be exploring a game that was so enthusiastically proud of everything great about the place while the world was seeing the absolute worst of it. At my lowest point I was wondering which of <em>Thank Goodness You're Here's</em> otherwise cheerful residents could I picture <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d1yq4552no" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">firebombing a library in a fit of anti-immigration rage</a>.</p><p>Thankfully common sense and human decency have prevailed; as destructive as a minority of hateful bigots have been, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/07/anti-racism-protesters-fill-streets-of-english-cities-as-far-right-threat-recedes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">good and normal people have banded together across England--but especially in the north, where the initial attacks made the headlines</a>--and with a series of counter-protests shown the country and the world that fascists belong in only one place: the bin.</p><p>So I got to publish this little blog about how much I love a lovely little town after all. And only had to add one caveat: if anyone in Barnsworth was going to be a fascist, it would probably be this guy:</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Redemption Road's time-travelling bring-an-assault-rifle-to-a-medieval-sword-fight shooter and strategy game, Kingmakers, isn't even out yet, but it's already secured a movie adaptation.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2109770/view/4339866697716610827?l=english">update</a> on Steam, the studio said it was "absolutely thrilled" that the unreleased game was "making its way to the big screen" in partnership with publisher tinyBuild and Story Kitchen.</p>

<p>Story Kitchen - which specialises in "the adaptation of video games and other 'non-traditional' IP into film and TV" shows - was founded in 2022 by Sonic the Hedgehog producer, Dmitri M. Johnson. As well as the Sonic movie franchise, it's also involved in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cosmic-horror-fishing-game-dredge-gets-film-adaptation">Dredge's adaptation</a>, and Pheobe Waller-Bridges <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-project-adds-wandavision-writer-to-its-team">Tomb Raider project</a>.</p>
<p>As for the game itself? Redemption has yet to provide a definitive release date, but it's still slated to release later this year.</p>
<p>"Over the last decade or so, alongside the bigger, fewer bets publishers have made - which has also often led to formula, to conservatism - an onward march in graphical fidelity means that a certain kind of game has become obsessed with the details. I love details, and I love that games do this," Donlan wrote when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingmakers-is-the-glorious-embodiment-of-one-of-gamings-most-powerful-rules-and-i-am-here-for-it">Kingsmakers memorable teaser dropped</a>.</p>
<p>"But as a trend, it can sometimes lead people to think that blockbusters are things that are made to be admired more than anything else. And it's nice to have someone drive a Mazda Barracuda, or whatever it is, right through that idea now and again. Don't admire this game. Thrill to it. Lose yourself in it. Break it and laugh wildly as it responds to what you've just done."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-kingmakers-tech-interview">Digital Foundry's John Linneman recently sat down with four members of Road Redemption Games</a> to discuss the third-person shooter's gameplay, real-time strategy elements, and its plan to have thousands of soldiers on-screen at once.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The change has been made for several reasons, game director Corinne Busche told Edge magazine (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard-wont-let-you-control-your-companions-because-you-cant-handle-it-this-is-a-much-higher-actions-per-minute-game">GamesRadar</a>), most notably the additional options instead available to controlling main character Rook. 
</p>
<p>
The Veilguard "is a much higher actions-per-minute game," Busche explained. "It is more technically demanding on the player. So when we tried allowing you full control of your companions as well, what we've found is it wasn't actually adding to the experience. In fact, in some ways it was detrimental, given the demanding nature of just controlling your own character."
</p>
<p>
Another reason was that BioWare wanted to give companion characters a sense of autonomy - to feel like "fully-realised" personalities "in control of their own actions", Busche added. 
</p>
<p>
Players will still be able to trigger abilities via the activity wheel in battle, as part of The Veilguard's focus on combo-based combat. (This is something BioWare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a> introduced to fun results, where you could set off chain biotic explosions with the correct combo of abilities.)
</p>
<p>
"I will admit that, on paper, if you just read that you have no ability to control your companions, that might feel like something was taken away," Busche concludes. "But in our testing and validating with players, what we find is they're more engaged than ever."
</p>
<p>Other changes added by BioWare include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-difficulty-options-let-you-turn-off-death-and-manually-adjust-enemy-health">suite of difficulty options to let you turn off death completely</a>, if you so choose, and adjust enemy health.</p>
<p>
"Whisper it, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard has me thinking the unthinkable</a>: it looks like BioWare is back," our Chris Tapsell wrote after going hands-on with the game. There's still no firm release date yet, but it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date-narrowed">set to arrive between 1st October and 31st December</a>.

Arkane founder Raphael Colantonio has said he was saddened by the closure--but he doesn't think the studio's unique brand of immersive sim is going anywhere.</p><p>"It's sad, of course," Colantonio said in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/arkane-founder-was-saddened-by-the-closure-of-arkane-austin-but-says-immersive-sims-arent-going-anywhere-the-studio-is-gone-but-the-people-survive/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "I wanted to see our game going forever, for obvious reasons. But the company is [gone], but not the people. The people survive."</p><p>The Arkane founder discussed the history of the company and the genre itself, pointing to Looking Glass Studios, which he described as "the originator of the immersive sim." Despite shuttering in 2000, Looking Glass released a number of influential games including System Shock and Thief, and eventually inspired the founding of Arkane, which also employed a number of ex-Looking Glass developers.</p><p>Colantonio also pointed to Black Isle Studios, which closed in 2003, but carried on its legacy through its people. "You had Brian Fargo make his own company, you had Troika, you had Obsidian," Colantonio said. "We still remember Black Isle as a great company in that genre, but then we still have their games."</p><p>Arkane isn't fully gone, of course, with the Lyon studio still in operation, but Colantonio himself has since moved on with his new project Wolfeye Studios, which released its first game Weird West in 2022.</p><p>"We're doing more with Wolfeye," Colantonio added. "The spirit of the immersive sim, I think sometimes that's what you need--sometimes you need a renewal, you need a new impulse. And I think that's going to spawn more little immersive sim companies. So while [the Arkane Austin closure] is a sad event, I don't think it necessarily means that immersive sims are going to go away."</p><p>Colantonio very recently teased more about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arkane-founder-says-his-studios-next-game-will-make-dishonored-and-prey-fans-happy/1100-6525576/" data-ref-id="1100-6525576">Wolfeye's next game</a>, a retro-sci-fi RPG he says will make fans of Dishonored and Prey very happy.</p>

                <p>The government of Turkey has issued a nationwide block on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a>, a gaming platform popular with children that hosts mostly user-generated content. The ban was instigated due to concerns around alleged child exploitation and inappropriate content.</p><p>While no explanation was initially given for the ban, an official from the Turkish Directorate of Communications quoted by <a href="https://www.turkiyetoday.com/turkiye/roblox-banned-in-turkiye-following-nationwide-instagram-block-37398/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Turkiye Today</a> (via <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/roblox/roblox-gets-banned-indefinitely-in-turkey-over-child-exploitation-2855423/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>) said that the move was motivated by reported inappropriate sexual content on the platform. The official alleged that the platform was a gathering place for pedophiles, and that its in-game currency Robux was being used to incentivize childrens' participation in inappropriate activities, a claim backed up by a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?srnd=undefined" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent Businessweek report</a> on how predators have used Roblox to groom children.</p><p>The official also raised the issue of gambling on the platform, alleging predatory tactics targeting children. In addition to all of these issues, the official also said there was an overall issue with regulation of inappropriate content on the platform, with Roblox's existing oversight measures not enough to address said issues.</p><p>The Roblox ban comes just days after Turkey blocked Instagram for all users in the country, while other Meta-owned apps and platforms remain accessible. The Instagram and Roblox bans don't appear to be related at this time.</p><p>Roblox has put out a statement on the ban, saying it is "currently working with local authorities with the goal of resolving it," noting that it has millions of users in Turkey, including some developers who may rely on the platform for their entire income. "We're committed to doing everything we can to keep our community safe, and we share global policymakers' commitment to protecting children," Roblox said.</p><p>As a platform built on user-generated content, Roblox has faced accusations of a different kind of child exploitation in the past, with concerns the company is profiting off child labor. Roblox's studio head <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-boss-talks-teens-making-money-on-the-game-disputes-exploitation-claims/1100-6522420/" data-ref-id="1100-6522420">disputed this claim</a>, saying that a majority of its creators are over 20 years old, and that young developers were benefitting from learning valuable skills.</p>

            <p>The first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate">Splitgate</a> was a cracker mash-up of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-infinite">Halo</a> multiplayer gunfights and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/portal">Portal</a>'s nifty spacetime windows. It was a gimmick that made flanking fun again, at least until you died to a distant rifle that was right next to you all along. Its sequel, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> is continuing that gimmick but is also sprucing up the free-to-play arena shooter with a few modern additions, like bum-sliding around corners and big deployable bubbles called "time domes" that slow down your enemies yet speed up your allies. All this and more comes from a gameplay trailer that went up yesterday.</p>

<p>There you have it. Basically, the 4v4 arena <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> is adding character abilities, which you can mix and match according to faction. One faction, Aeros, is all about moving fast with a speedy sprinting ability and a faster reload time, popping stims to keep themselves alive. The bulky Sabrask faction get sticky grenades and a pop-up "smart shield" that blocks enemy bullets but allows their own to pass through. And the healing-focused Meridian can briefly spot folks through walls. There's also a "health grenade" suggesting you'll be able to blast buds with feel-good sparkles from afar. Plus that "time dome", which speeds up friendly player movement (and shooting) while they stand inside. Enemies who enter will feel the opposite effect, slowing down noticeably, which I imagine makes it a decent area denial tactic as well as a support option. Cool.</p>
<p>As you can probably tell from the trailer, it seems to be taking an esportsy angle. I'm more of a casual bullet basker, so seeing a cadre of Twitch streamers doing call-outs does nothing for me in terms of excitement. And if this is the approach, I can't help but fear some of the scrappy fun of the first game will be sanded away in favour of clinical and competitive match-ups. I know it's early days for this sequel (we've only seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/portal-hopping-shooter-splitgate-2-revealed-looks-like-the-original-cult-fps-but-with-a-lot-more-money">one other cinematic trailer</a>) but there are no signs of daft stuff like the rocket launchers and baseball bats that made the first game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-review">such a riot</a> at times. They're only showing off a vanilla 4v4 mode for now. I take some comfort from <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/faq">a developer FAQ</a>  in which they say they are "focused on creating different and distinct experiences". But what those experiences will be? I shrug at you.</p>
<p>There are some other interesting moments in the trailer, mind. A weapon called the Splitstream looks like an SMG that can split into two guns to be dual wielded, similar to the Strelak Verso dual pistols in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a>. At one point a player jets up between balconies full of spectators, where they are suddenly surrounded by puffs of confetti as they gun someone down from on-high. Hooray! If you're desperate to see more, the devs will be streaming a 2-hour demonstration on August 14 on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitch.tv%2Fsplitgate">their Twitch channel</a>.</p>
<p>It's due out sometime in 2025. Meanwhile, Splitgate The First faces an uncertain future as a result of developers 1047 Games focusing on the sequel. And although they say the studio has "no plans" to shut down the first game's servers before the end of this year, they are still leaving that possibility open for the following year. </p>
<p>"We know that it is common to kill the servers of the previous version of a game when a new one comes out. We know why companies do this," say the shooter devs. "What we do with Splitgate next year is, to be completely honest, unknown to us right now."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Over two years since the official announcement, the Max Payne 1 and 2 remake has finally entered full production, Remedy Entertainment confirmed today.</p>
<p>In its l<a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-plc-half-year-financial-report-january-june-2024-codename-condor-and-max-payne-12-remake-in-full-production-and-alan-wake-2-night-springs-expansion-launched/">atest financial report</a>, the development studio provided an update on the projects currently in development, starting from the highly anticipated remake that will combine the first two entries in the series. According to today's update, the remake entered full production in the second quarter of 2024, and the current goal is to have the game in an early functional state from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Besides providing an update on the Max Payne 1 and 2 remake, Remedy Entertainment also revealed more on the state of Control 2 and the project codenamed Condor, a multiplayer game set in the world of Control. The second entry in the series entered the production readiness phase in the second quarter of the year, the final one before entering full production. A build showcasing important features in playable form has also been created. Regarding publishing the game, Remedy is talking to potential partners but still has to decide whether to self-publish the game and Condor or find a publisher. Project Condor also entered full production in March 2024, and the team is currently focusing on creating maps and mission types while continuing playtesting internally and externally, the latter in a limited capacity.</p>
<p>The Max Payne 1 and 2 remake developer also provided a small update on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">Alan Wake 2</a>, its latest title. The game has yet to recoup its costs, and The Lake House is currently in the works for a yet-to-be-confirmed release date.</p>
<p>Not much is currently known about the Max Payne 1 and 2 remake as of now. Back when the remake was announced, Remedy confirmed it will be powered by the studio's Northlight Engine and will be in line with a typical Remedy AAA-game production. A release window has yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <p>Dead Rising will no longer reward players for taking intimate in-game photos of female characters.</p>
<p>While players can still level up by taking in-game photos of gory, violent, or funny scenes - categorised as horror, brutality, and outtake shots respectively - the hitherto "erotica" category will be removed when the remaster drops next month.</p>

<p>Capcom hasn't expanded on why the feature has been removed for the upcoming remaster, but given the original game released way back in 2006, it's perhaps a testament to how times - and tastes - have changed over the years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-rising-deluxe-remasters-spruced-up-zombie-mall-slaughter-arrives-in-september">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster it coming to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on 19th September</a>, with a physical release to follow.</p>
<p>Capcom's Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster revisits the original 2006 game - in which players, as photojournalist Frank West, have three in-game days to investigate Colorado's sprawling, zombie-infested Willamette Parkview Mall - giving its slapstick action a new lick of paint, quality-of-life improvements, and more.</p>
<p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will be available in two digital editions - there's the £39.99 Standard Edition, plus a £49.99 Digital Deluxe edition, which includes 17 costumes for Frank and 17 additional mall music tracks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Destiny developer Bungie has issued a short statement acknowledging concern over the future of its decade-old sci-fi franchise following "recent changes" at the studio.
</p>
<p>
Those "recent changes" are, of course, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">sweeping layoffs that have seen 220 Bungie staff out of a job</a>, less than a year after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">further 100 employees were let go last October</a>. A further 155 Bungie staff are also departing the studio for roles within parent company PlayStation. 
</p>
<p>
In response, Bungie has now said it remains "committed" to Destiny, though details of what's next remain thin on the ground. There's also no mention of the departures of key Destiny creatives Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy, who were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-destiny-project-payback-no-longer-happening-senior-execs-depart">reportedly developing a now-cancelled Destiny spin-off named Payback</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, Bungie makes vague mention of a new "multi-year journey" to be had, presumably via further additions to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We know that recent changes at Bungie have created uncertainty surrounding the future of Destiny," Bungie <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1821619810645766275">wrote</a> on X. "Rest assured we remain committed to Destiny, to supporting our community with transparency, and to delivering regular updates about the game.
</p>
<p>
"We'll be talking with you all about the future of Destiny and plans for our next multi-year journey soon. Once we plant a flag for the date, we'll let you all know. Thank you for your patience, and we'll see you again soon." 
</p>
<p>
Bungie typically communicates with its Destiny fanbase via a weekly blog post, which was cancelled last week as the layoffs were announced and a wave of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">criticism from current and former employees</a> and the wider games industry followed. 
</p>
<p>
This week, Bungie has returned to its weekly blog posts and stated there that all previously-announced Destiny 2 content plans "remain unchanged".
</p>
<p>
"The recent changes within Bungie will present challenges that we'll need to work through," Bungie <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-08-08-2024">wrote</a>, "so please pardon our dust over the next few weeks. We may experience a few bumps here and there, but our teams are committed to keeping you in the loop and hearing what you have to say."
</p>
<p>
Bungie's cuts come at a climactic moment for Destiny 2, which completed its main 10-year narrative arc this year. Planned updates will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-post-final-shape-future-includes-vampire-hunting-and-the-dreadnaught">now take the shape of thrice-yearly "Episodes" with standalone stories</a>.
</p>
<p>
The developer is also still working on its new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon-2023">Marathon</a> reboot -  a sci-fi extraction shooter for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S expected to arrive next year.

<p>Remedy Entertainment has revealed that Control 2 is now playable, the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake has entered full production, and Project Condor seems to be progressing, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remedy recently spoke on the development progress of their upcoming titles through their latest <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-plc-half-year-financial-report-january-june-2024-codename-condor-and-max-payne-12-remake-in-full-production-and-alan-wake-2-night-springs-expansion-launched/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">half-year financial report</a>. Control 2 has entered the “production readiness stage”, and a build of the game has “showcased several important features in playable form”.</p>



<p>Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake is even further in its development cycle, progressing from “production readiness to the full production stage.” The developers are aiming to create an “early functional state from beginning to end while focusing on key differentiating gameplay features”.</p>



<p>Lastly, Project Condor has entered full production too. Developers have already worked on “multiple maps and different mission types”. They are also organising increased “internal and limited external playtesting”, which will help towards “feature validation and feedback’.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/remedy-gives-update-on-control-2-and-max-payne/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last year</a>, Control 2 was still in its “proof-of-concept stage” as the plans for the sequel were “ambitious”. On the other hand, Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake was in its “production readiness stage”, as the developers had just “gained clarity on the style and scope of the game”. Moreover, Remedy also revealed this year that Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remakes are “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/max-payne-remakes-have-a-budget-similar-to-alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enabled by a similar development budget as Alan Wake 2</a>“.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/09/tombi-special-edition-review-tomba/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>If you’re as old as I am, you might remember the heyday of demo discs that came with Official UK Playstation Magazine and, if you do, you might remember Demo Disc 37. On this disc was a demo for an odd little platformer called Tombi! (Tomba! In other territories), a demo that I quickly fell in love with. Whether you only played this demo or successfully begged your parents for it, I have great news, Limited Run Games have brought it back with Tombi! Special Edition.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomba! Special Edition | LRG3 2024 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfYtEggYPI0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Opening with pigs beating up a child like a horror parody of Peppa Pig, I can tell you right now that Tombi! gets no less strange during its runtime. The premise is that you are said child and have been robbed by said pigs of your grandpa’s bracelet. So, the only thing to do is to follow them and get your precious keepsake back, drawing you into a wider plot surrounding Seven Evil Pigs and the curses they have placed upon the world.</p>


<p>In Tombi!, you’ll be doing a lot of platforming… very floaty platforming. It’s forgiving at most points to balance that out, and you do get some abilities and items later to help you with tighter and trickier platforming challenges, but you will notice immediately how long it takes for you to land, especially when it comes to combat in the game. Combat is basically jumping on the enemies to bite them and then throwing them at walls, the ground or other enemies.</p>
<p>You do acquire various weapons in the game, some of which provide a dual purpose of dispatching enemies and collecting distant items, but most of the enemies (and some of the allies) can be managed simply by the pounce and munch technique. The bonus with the weapons though is that you can aim and power them up by holding the attack button, so if a tricky enemy is causing you problems, you can dispatch them in a single hit.</p>


<p>This game is divided up into quests, of which there are 130 in total. Some of them are compulsory, such as the ones to hunt down and catch the Evil Pigs, and others are just for fun, really. The interesting thing about this being that each Evil Pig accounts for more than one quest. Clearing their curse on an area, and finding the correct Evil Pig Bag (yes, you read that right) to trap them in are separate quests.</p>
<p>Even more interesting is that the Evil Pigs are never hiding in the areas they have cursed, so you must find the Evil Pig Bag first to be able to see the doors they are hiding behind… but you also need to figure out where said doors will be. Once you do, you’re thrown into a simple puzzle encounter with these potent porcine adversaries as you need to work out how to throw them into the bag in the arena. They range from insultingly easy to infuriating, but honestly finding their doors is the hardest part.</p>
<p>Most of the other quests in the game involve simply fetching something either for someone or that you need to clear the way to progress, but the trickier ones are downright esoteric to work out – looking at you “Red+Blue=?”, which is not as simple as that sounds. I will say though that this game is so daft and charming throughout that you will likely find all the quests – or at least the lion’s share of them – simply by wistfully exploring and engaging with the various characters.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, also littered throughout the game are chests of increasing value. Each of these you can only access after befriending the old men of increasing ages in the world, where you’ll be given a key that is precisely the same age as each of them, so it’s a great idea to swing back through previous areas from time-to-time. Between these chests, the hidden quests, a ton of optional items and everything else Tombi! throws at you (including a little go kart mini-game), there’s a lot of “game” here to play in the best possible way.</p>
<p>Tombi! Special Edition’s release is pretty much the experience as it was back on the PlayStation – the in-game visuals don’t appear to have been touched at all in the game. It’s still the same colourful, cartoonish nonsense it was in the original release – with Limited Run Games instead focussing on a handful of&nbsp;quality-of-life changes, extras and an enhanced soundtrack.</p>
<p>The biggest of these additions is the ability to save anywhere instead of at signposts in the world which is an absolute godsend in this game, while a rewind feature gives added assistance, but honestly hinders more than helps. Another&nbsp;neat little addition is a new gallery, containing promotional graphics, box art, and other art pieces from the game not only from the European release but the Japanese and North America releases too.</p>

<p>Even the FMV cutscenes have been left untouched, so they retain their grainy appearance and wonky voice acting, which I’m so thankful for. The Special Edition has, however, remastered the soundtrack, and I’m unsure about this change. It feels odd to remaster the soundtrack but not the visuals, especially if you have kept the sound in the cutscenes unchanged. It’s hardly a dealbreaker, but you’d expect a remaster either do it all or none of it, right? That said, the soundtrack is joyous, and I’m happily humming it as I write.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/middle-earth-strategy-battle-game-second-edition-updates-war-for-ring<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game Second Edition</em> is on its way. Games Workshop's ongoing support for the miniature war game set in the fantasy world of Tolkien will lead to the first major change to its foundation since 2018, providing new streamlined rules and updates to various armies.</p>

<p>The announcement of <em>Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game Second Edition</em> came via an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/08/08/new-edition-of-middle-earth-strategy-battle-game-coming-soon/">Warhammer-Community post</a>. According to the post, this new edition will contain a new streamlined game manual containing revisions to armies and core rules.</p>

These books will contain new rules for miniatures from <em>The Lord of The Rings</em> and <em>The Hobbit</em> film trilogies. Each character's profile has been reworked for game balance and on-screen presence.</p>
<p>Regarding what major changes will come with <em>Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game Second Edition</em>, the post is light on detail. Aside from the supplements, the post mentions no major armies or core rules changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement was made alongside a new supplement for the game:<em> <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/08/08/middle-earth-strategy-battle-game-the-rise-of-angmar/">Rise of Angmar</a></em>. The book focuses on the Witch King, his wars with the kingdom of Arnor, and the chieftains of the <span>Dúnedain.</span> In addition, the post concludes with a tease for the next major addition to the game: <em>The War for the Rohirrim</em>.</p>

It originally started in 2001 as <em>The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game</em>, which released alongside the Peter Jackson film.</p>
<p>Updated rules came out coinciding with the theatrical release of <em>The Two Towers</em>, <em>Return of the King</em>, and finally in a comprehensive 2005 book titled <em>The One Ring Rulebook to Rule Them All</em>. A similar approach was taken with Peter Jackson's <em>Hobbit</em> trilogy before both games' rules were consolidated into the cohesive and cross-compatible <em>Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game</em> in 2018.</p>

            <p>Yesterday, Nic took James and I on a tour of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>'s co-op campaign. A merry old time was had, romping through fortress cities like a small herd of crusader buffalo, using the game's absurd jetpack functionality to pancake invading Tyranids, and getting our screens so slathered in gore we couldn't work out who was killing what.</p>
<p>It looks like the gargantuan <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game's PvP <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> will be even messier. Saber and Focus Home have released an extended trailer that walks you through two major modes - the PvE boss and wave-slaying frenzy of Operations, and the 12-player PvP carnage of Eternal War, which spans a range of match types. The ecstasy of dying for the Emperor aside, both give me frightful flashbacks to the early days of Gears Of War.</p><!--more-->

<p>Each multiplayer mode gives you six upgradeable and fairly self-explanatory classes - Tactical, Assault, Vanguard, Bulwark, Sniper and Heavy. Class abilities include a camo cloak and a banner you can heroically plant to saturate your battle-brethren's veins with zeal and allow them to brush away mortal wounds like cobwebs (i.e. it buffs their defences). Teams are divided into regular Ultramarines and perfidious Chaos Marines: they look and sound different, but function the same. You don't get to play as a Tyranid or other non-human species in PvP.</p>
<p>The Gears Of Warriness of the Space Marine 2 is prominent in the outsized character models, the stompy handling, the phatness of the weaponry, and the bulky regularity of the map layouts I've seen, which favour diagonals over curves. It doesn't have a cover system, of course. Space Marines don't take cover. Their faith is their shield. Also they are genetically engineered, century-old giants who wear elephant armour. One of the classes does get a handheld shield, though.</p>
<p>Look out for our collective thoughts on Space Marine 2 next week. My immediate verdict on the campaign is that it's great fun if you turn your brain off and just wallow in the spectacle of dozens of Tyranids swarming the fittings. With allowances for choice of difficulty setting/effectiveness of comrades, it's a game for button-mashers and AOE-fanatics and anybody who reacts to the suggestion of subtlety with righteously flared nostrils and a bellow of "heresy!" It's out 9th September. If you're tempted, here are the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/omnissiah-be-praised-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2s-system-requirements-are-here">Space Marine 2 system requirements</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Another Nintendo Switch 2 rumor emerged today on the Internet via the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Famiboards</a> forum, where users shared some details from supposed leaked shipping manifests. According to this information, the upcoming Nintendo console has a second cooler, which is likely to be placed on the dock.&nbsp;That being the case, fans already speculate that the dock might grant a stronger performance boost than the original Nintendo Switch. Additionally, references to a 60W charger have been found, potentially hinting at a fast charging option for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumored-to-launch-in-h2-2024-oled-version-already-in-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> to launch at some point in the latter half of 2024, at least according to credible rumors. However, the most recent info <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">points</a> to March 2025 as the most likely release window. That would be around eight years after the debut of the original Switch. The console's reveal should happen at some point this Fall, though.</p>
<p>Previous leaks suggest that the console (once again a home/handheld hybrid will be powered by an NVIDIA Tegra 239 SoC, combining the Ampere GPU architecture with 1280 CUDA Cores and 8 Cortex A78 Arm CPU Cores with 12 GB of RAM. The game cards should use a Samsung 5th generation V-NAND with up to 1.4 GB/s Read Speed.</p>
<p>The console is expected to support NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction (the Nintendo Switch 2 will also have hardware ray tracing capabilities thanks to its GPU architecture), but not DLSS Frame Generation. Even with these technologies, it won't be able to match the performance of the current generation's least powerful console, the Xbox Series S. Even Valve's Steam Deck may be superior. However, the Nintendo Switch 2 will receive games custom-made for its hardware, unlike Valve's portable PC.</p>
<p>Speaking of the lineup, Square Enix's Naoki Yoshida recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-xiv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Final Fantasy XIV might be ported to the console at some point, but it could take years. That was certainly the case with the Xbox port, which was in the works for years and ultimately only launched a few months ago.</p>

<p>Valorant players everywhere are preparing to bust open their wallets as the next Night Market window is revealed by Riot Games. It hasn’t been all that long since the last Valorant Night Market was held, and this will be the fourth window this year alone, but it’s always a welcome sight for Valorant fans worldwide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-valorant-night-market">What is the Valorant Night Market?</h2>



<p>The Night Market is a term used to describe a period where Valorant’s cosmetics are offered at drastically discounted prices. It’s a unique event that sees players take advantage of draws that offer them randomised skins, subsequently giving them a discount based on the ‘rarity’ of the skins they roll. It means that users can secure skins for up to a 50% discount, and the ‘gambling’ mechanic of the roll system makes for an exciting practice.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-valorant-night-market">When is the Next Valorant Night Market?</h2>



<p>Riot Games has confirmed that the next Valorant Night Market will be held from August 15 – 28. This is the typical duration for a Night Market, so it’s nothing out of the ordinary.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-will-the-valorant-night-market-be-on-console">Will the Valorant Night Market Be on Console?</h3>



<p>Riot Games revealed that both PC and console players will get access to the Night Market at the same time. It was just days ago that Valorant was released on console, so this marks the first time that the event will take place outside of the PC platform. </p>



<h2 id="h-keep-your-eyes-open">Keep Your Eyes Open</h2>



<p>The Valorant Night Market is a time for players to cross their fingers and hope for the best. It may be that you land your dream skin in your first roll, or you could go the distance and not get anything you like the look of. </p>



<p>The beauty of the Night Market is that you’re not obligated to buy any one skin that you roll – you can hold out for something new in your next roll. </p>



<p>What skin are you waiting for in the Night Market?</p>

<p>Betby has become the first esports betting operator in the business to offer markets for Escape from Tarkov: Arena and Stormgate. While there were expectations that Stormgate betting would be a thing, it was considerably rare to think that Escape from Tarkov: Arena would be backed by esports betting markets, given the game’s struggling profile and lack of tournaments.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-there-regardless">There Regardless</h2>



<p>In a statement, the Head of Betby Games, Kirill Nekrasov, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Although Stormgate’s release is still a few days away, we at BETBY have long anticipated its success. To support interest in this upcoming RTS game, we have added pre-match odds for exhibition matches and Will continue to offer betting opportunities for all future tournaments. We are proud to be the first esports feed to provide Stormgate as betting content to our partners.</p>



<p>The same applies to Escape from Tarkov: Arena. Since its launch late last year, the game has garnered a significant following. As it continues to gain popularity, we recognise the need to offer this game to our partners. We are pleased to announce that&nbsp;Betby Games is currently the only esports feed offering content<strong>&nbsp;</strong>for official tournaments of Escape from Tarkov: Arena.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Last year, Escape from Tarkov: Arena was ushered into the competitive scene with a tournament that boasted a €100,000 prize pool. It took place at DreamHack Hannover and went hand-in-hand with the release of the game, but since then, nothing has replicated the magnitude of that event in the Tarkov space.</p>



<p>Tarkov Arena has a decent enough grassroots tournament space, but it’s not the kind of thing you’d actively bet on.</p>



<p>Stormgate is expected to be much more impactful when it comes to esports betting. Many operators are poised to offer markets – however mundane – for the ‘disruptive’ RTS title that’s finally being released worldwide on August 13.</p>



<p>Will you bet on either of these games?</p>

<p>In an age where projects are being cancelled, postponed, and pushed back left and right, it’s encouraging to see that the most highly anticipated game in history is still on track to be delivered in the promised window. In a recent financial update, Take-Two Interactive confirmed that Grand Theft Auto 6 is still being released in the ‘Fall of Calendar 2025’, which is the window we’ve now been working with for a few months.</p>



<p>This news comes despite some rumours that GTA 6 would be pushed back into 2026 by Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar Games. It still <strong>could be</strong>, but for now, we’re on track, and that’s just perfect.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-hold-firm">Hold Firm</h2>



<p>GTA 6 is expected to be the biggest single-game release in the history of the industry. In December 2023, Rockstar Games dropped the first official trailer for the ambitious, open-world title, promptly breaking the internet and setting viewership records on YouTube. Now, gamers are patiently awaiting the arrival of the next-generation title, which will be the first new GTA game in more than a decade.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/606b4f51-58cd-4838-a9e2-55138ff5d8eb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent financial update</a> handed out by Take-Two Interactive, the firm highlighted the future line-up of the business, which included <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-release-window-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Civilization VII</a>, Judas, WWE 2K25, and of course, Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<p>Many rumours are still surfacing online regarding the content we’ll discover in GTA 6 when the game is eventually released late next year. However, almost all of them should be taken with a pinch of salt, as following the monumental leaks that tore apart the project in 2022, Rockstar Games has locked things down, requesting that all employees return to the office for security purposes.</p>



<p>That means that almost <strong>nothing </strong>is being revealed outside of official teasers.</p>



<p>Are you still excited about the impending arrival of GTA 6, or do you think the hype has worn off a bit?</p>
