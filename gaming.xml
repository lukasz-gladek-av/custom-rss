It’s all part of the “Seek and You Shall Find” side quest, which involves tracking down the Journalist’s Stashes across the map. One of the first locations you should focus on is in Rostock, northwest of Zalissya and just outside Garbage. It’s a trek but a worthwhile one.</p><figure id="" data-id="43284b68ffa83d3cf9e4e8975c28417c" data-recommend-id="image://43284b68ffa83d3cf9e4e8975c28417c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Stalker 2 map shows the location of the Riemann SMG at the player’s location." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Stalker 2 map shows the location of the Riemann SMG at the player’s location." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="43284b68ffa83d3cf9e4e8975c28417c" data-recommend-id="image://43284b68ffa83d3cf9e4e8975c28417c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Stalker 2 map shows the location of the Riemann SMG at the player’s location." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the screenshot above, you’ll note the green icon denoting the player’s location at a rectangular military complex northwest of Rostock. It’s a short walk from the Slag Heap, though you’ll encounter plenty of mutants, anomalies, and bandits on the journey, so be mindful of your surroundings and don’t walk through the swamp. It’s deadly.</p><p>Once you arrive at the barracks, be wary of the gravity anomalies outside and inside. You can toss a screw into any of the floating anomalies to disperse them momentarily, allowing you to pass. Once you’re through the anomalous obstacle course, head inside the Eastern entrance, then turn left inside the building to navigate through the broken barracks. You’ll find the blue crate containing the Riemann SMG in the far back corner between two bunk beds.</p><figure id="" data-id="3d0439b17de57362aeb02bcd30a668e5" data-recommend-id="image://3d0439b17de57362aeb02bcd30a668e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Journalist’s Stash in Rostok containing the Riemann SMG in Stalker 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Journalist’s Stash in Rostok containing the Riemann SMG in Stalker 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3d0439b17de57362aeb02bcd30a668e5" data-recommend-id="image://3d0439b17de57362aeb02bcd30a668e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Journalist’s Stash in Rostok containing the Riemann SMG in Stalker 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Riemann SMG, is a competent submachine gun capable of propelling you through the mid- and late-game missions in <em>Stalker 2</em>. It features a high rate of fire, exceptional accuracy, and moderate range/ Its relatively low damage per shot is offset by the high DPS . Lastly, it goes for approximately 32,000 coupons if you choose to sell the rifle.</p><p>Of course, the Riemann SMG in <em>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl </em>is only one of the many unique weapons across the Zone. The Lullaby is another high-end assault rifle you can track down even earlier!</p><p>.<br>  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Humble has revealed its December lineup of games, and this month, there's a great selection of intriguing sci-fi, sandy action, and cyberpunk fun to pick up. In case you haven't used it before, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fmembership&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble Choice costs $12 monthly</a> and offers several perks, including a monthly batch of PC games that are yours to keep forever, even if your cancel your subscription. Other benefits include exclusive discounts at the Humble store and access to the Humble Vault--an additional rotating library of games exclusive to members.</p><h2>Humble Choice December 2024 Games</h2><ul><li>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</li><li>Old World</li><li>Atlas Fallen: Reign of Sand</li><li>Crime Boss: Rockay City</li><li>The Invincible</li><li>Moonstone Island</li><li>Inkulinati</li><li>Venba</li><li>Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip</li></ul><p>This month you can grab Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, a spiritual successor to Sega's Jet Set Radio. Like the games that inspired it, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk has a cel-shaded art style and it's set in a city where local gangs compete for clout by being as <em>extreme</em> as possible. There are various ways to get around New Amsterdam--from rollerblades to skateboarding--and you can leave your mark on the city with fresh graffiti. Assemble your crew, explore the five boroughs, and avoid the fuzz as you take on rival crews and strange enemies.</p><p>Another noteworthy game this month is Atlas Fallen, a solid action-adventure that recently received new enemies, quests, a reworked campaign, and a revamped progression system through a major update. It's a satisfying game where you wield strange powers to take on deadly beasts and cruel gods, so if you've been looking to pick this up, then this is a good time to do so following its overhaul.</p><p>For anyone looking to explore a seemingly deserted alien planet, you can check out The Invincible. Billed as a story-driven game inspired by the sci-fi stories of Piolish writer Stanislaw Lem, The Invincible is a philosophical look at humanity's place in the cosmos. Then there's Crime Boss: Rockay City, a bad game about pulling off heists and escaping with some sweet loot. It's basically Payday with a cast that includes Chuck Norris, Vanilla Ice, Danny Glover, Kim Basinger, Danny Trejo, and Michael Madsen, and reviews were lukewarm at best when it launched last year.</p><p>Other highlights this month include the cozy life-simulator Moonstone Island, medieval turn-based strategy with a unique look in Inkulinati, delicious storytelling in Venba, a colorful tale of burnt rubber and love in Monster Roadtrip, and incredibly deep strategy in Old World.</p><p>As a reminder, 5% of every Humble Choice membership is donated to charity, and this month, proceeds will go to the humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief. If you're looking to grab a few Humble Bundle deals this month, you can also check out the list below of what's currently available.</p><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fscifi-shooters&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sci-Fi Shooters Bundle</a> -- 8 items for $19</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fdisney-classics-black-friday&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Disney Classics: Black Friday Bundle</a> -- 17 items for $10</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fthe-telltale-collection&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Telltale Collection</a> -- 8 items for $12</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Frawcember-to-remember&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Raw Fury: Rawcember to Remember Bundle</a> -- 14 items for $15</li></ul>

Developer GSC Game World <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-gets-day-one-patch-improvements-but-problems-remain-across-pc-and-xbox/1100-6527951/" data-ref-id="1100-6527951">released a day-one patch</a> to address some of Stalker 2's lingering issues. However, the title is still missing the A-Life 2.0 system that was initially promised on its Steam page. Now, GSC Game World is opening up about why A-Life 2.0 isn't in the game and how the Steam page was changed.</p><p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, creative director Maria Grygorovych explained that A-Life 2.0 is still in Stalker 2; it just isn't working as intended yet. The first Stalker used the initial A-Life--which was created as an AI program to give NPC characters in the world of the game a life of their own beyond any interactions with the players. A-Life 2.0 was meant to be the next generation of that program, if it can be made to function correctly.</p><p>GSC CEO Ievgen Grygorovych told IGN that as the game's launch date neared, the team attempted to shrink the area around the player affected by A-Life 2.0 before they encountered game-breaking bugs that forced the team to turn off the feature for now. Maria Grygorovych added that the change in the game's Steam description came from someone in the marketing department who made the edit without telling her. Both Grygorovychs also insisted that the developer is still committed to implementing A-Life 2.0 and ironing out its issues.</p><p>"For now we [are] committed to players to make it work and it can be done from directions both optimizing, giving more resources to A-Life, fixing bugs, making it work properly, and then putting more efforts to make it more advanced," said Ievgen Grygorovych.</p><p>As if that issue wasn't enough to deal with, Russian propaganda outlets recently began accusing of Stalker 2 of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/russian-propaganda-claims-stalker-2-is-drafting-players-into-the-ukrainian-military/1100-6528177/" data-ref-id="1100-6528177">drafting players into the Ukrainian army</a>. The documentary <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/war-game-trailer-chronicles-the-making-of-stalker-2-during-wartime/1100-6526549/" data-ref-id="1100-6526549">War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a> demonstrated how GSC Game World's team was affected by Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Half of the team was forced to flee the country to finish Stalker 2, while the rest remained and some among them choose to fight in the war. Regardless of the game's ongoing issues, Stalker 2 has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/day-one-game-pass-launch-stalker-2-crosses-major-sales-milestone/1100-6527971/" data-ref-id="1100-6527971">sold over 1 million copies across PC and Xbox</a>, and it remains available on Game Pass.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deceive-inc-developer-sweet-bandits-shuts-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</em>developer Sweet Bandits has announced that it will close down, but the studio says it's currently "considering options" with regards to what will happen to the game itself.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/a-message-from-sweet-bandits.2340721/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the forum of <i>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</i>publisher Tripwire, lead designer and Sweet Bandits co-founder&nbsp;Philippe Pelletier Baribault, also known as Baribandit, says he and his company have "reached the breaking point", and that they are "unable to continue this adventure".</p>

<p>Baribault says he and Sweet Bandits walked a "long and difficult road of trying to get&nbsp;<em>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</em>in a state where it could thrive", but that they haven't managed to achieve this goal, hence the studio's closure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deceive-inc-sweet-bandits-shut-down-punch.jpg?itok=MzxVFU2h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deceive-inc-sweet-bandits-shut-down-punch.jpg?itok=QUe5-KeL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</em>developer Sweet Bandits is shutting down.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to "the path ahead" for&nbsp;<em>Deceive Inc</em>., Baribault says that he and his studio are considering the best way for "maintaining this game that we all love". It's possible, then, that&nbsp;<em>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</em>won't be shutting down.</p>

<p>In fact, right now, servers and access to the game will remain active, although a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/820520/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">quick look at the game's SteamDB numbers</a> indicates that this might not be the most meaningful decision, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Even if&nbsp;<em>Deceive Inc.</em>'s servers do remain available for play, however, it doesn't look like we'll be getting any new games from Sweet Bandits in the future, which is a shame.</p>




<p><em>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deceive-inc-release-date-unmasked-for-march" rel="nofollow">released back in March last year</a>. It's a competitive multiplayer shooter based on espionage and subtlety; you're better off sneaking around rather than going in guns blazing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems that the game's quirky, cartoony art style and focus on stealth rather than arena combat failed to help it find an audience.</p>

<p>That said, Sweet Bandits' demise is just the latest tragedy in a long line of studio closures, project cancellations, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">widespread industry layoffs</a> that have affected both big companies and small developers alike.</p>

He likes listening to lo-fi music, drinking matcha, eating sushi, taking care of his succulent plants, and writing haikus. There’s just one thing that makes his life hard: he’s so anxious about being in social situations that his head would explode if he ever talks to anyone. Fortunately, that’s never happened yet: as you’ll see, Giraffe has gotten good at sneaking around, distracting, and avoiding the overly chatty residents of Friendly City (voted friendliest city in the world!).</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>Ubisoft recently made the shocking announcement that it would shut down its Call of Duty competitor, XDefiant, close Ubisoft San Francisco, and lay off nearly 300 people in what was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/#:~:text=In%20just%20the%20first%20two,a%20developer%20at%20Riot%20Games." data-ref-id="1100-6521799">just the latest unfortunate development for the people who make video games in this business</a>. Now, internal memos from CEO Yves Guillemot and chief studios boss Marie-Sophie de Waubert have emerged.</p><p>Guillemot said in a memo obtained by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-yves-guillemots-internal-memo-about-xdefiant-closure-and-the-future-of-ubisoft/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a> that the decision to cancel XDefiant, close Ubisoft San Francisco and Osaka, and ramp down its Sydney office was "among the most difficult decisions we've had to make." Guillemot praised the XDefiant development team and its ambition to "challenge the best shooter on the market." However, "it was not enough," he admitted.</p><p>For those being laid off, Guillemot said he expresses his "deepest gratitude" and that the company will do "everything possible" to help affected staffers.</p><p>Guillemot went on to say Ubisoft is indeed going through "turbulent times," adding that he is working with his executive team to find the "best solutions so we can maintain control of our destiny." When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-stock-sinks-to-10-year-low-as-star-wars-outlaws-underperforms/1100-6526262/" data-ref-id="1100-6526262">Ubisoft's stock price</a> began to tank earlier this year, some theorized the lower company value might make the company an acquisition target.</p><p>In October, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-reportedly-considering-a-major-change-to-its-structure/1100-6526909/" data-ref-id="1100-6526909">a report claimed Ubisoft was talking to Tencent about all manner of options</a>, including turning Ubisoft private or having Tencent acquire the company. Nothing has materialized from this as of yet, but Guillemot's wording about being able to "maintain control of our destiny" suggests something may be afoot, or perhaps it doesn't mean that at all.</p><p>"I'm doing everything I can to help us regain momentum, so that we can continue to make Ubisoft a key player in our industry, a creator known for its unique and exceptional video games," Guillemot said in his memo to staff.</p><p>As for the memo to staff sent by Marie-Sophie de Waubert, it was <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-au/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">published on Ubisoft's own public website</a> and shed some additional light on what happened with XDefiant. She said the game had an "encouraging start" but failed to "attract and retain" enough players.</p><p>"The game is too far away from reaching the results required to enable further significant investment, and we are announcing that we will be sunsetting it," she said.</p><p>The executive went on to say that Ubisoft's lack of success with XDefiant doesn't mean the company will stop pursuing games-as-a-service titles. In fact, she said games-as-a-service remains "a pillar of of strategy," citing examples of success like Rainbow Six, The Crew, and For Honor.</p><p>"It's a highly competitive market, and we will apply the lessons learned with XDefiant to our future live titles," she said.</p><p>XDefiant was developed by Ubisoft San Francisco, and about half of the developers are shifting to other projects within Ubisoft as a result of the game's shutdown. The game was produced by Call of Duty veteran Mark Rubin and launched in May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-launch-reportedly-hit-1-million-players-in-under-3-hours/1100-6523688/" data-ref-id="1100-6523688">attracting lots of players right out of the gate.</a> The momentum could not be sustained, however. On October 15, Rubin responded to claims that XDefiant would shut down after Season 4, saying there were <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1846272225491484763" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">no plans to do that and in fact, he was already planning content for the game's second year.</a></p><p>De Waubert also teased larger, structural changes coming to Ubisoft in the future in the areas of production and business practices. Guillemot, for his part, said in his memo that Ubisoft will try to have "fewer unnecessary processes" so its workers can focus more on making games.</p><p>These latest layoffs at Ubisoft come after a previously announced cost-cutting program that already resulted in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">more than 1,000 layoffs at the company.</a></p>

            <p>When <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2</a>, from Ukrainian developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a>, was released last month after multiple delays, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-sold-1-million-copies-so-far">sold exceptionally well</a> but received a mixed reaction from critics due mainly to issues with its performance and bugs. </p>
<p>However, another delay simply wasn't an option for the team, which found itself exhausted at the end of a long development during a time of war.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer this week, GSC Game World studio CEO Ievgen Grygorovych compared the game's development and delays to running multiple marathons. "It's very hard to explain your state when you're in a very intensive work process for many months until release, and you're working over, over, over what you usually can do and in the highest possible stress and overwhelming period," he said.</p>

<p>"You have no energy at all and you decide - should we take one more marathon? And you just can't say yes, let's make one more marathon, because you're already broken."</p>
<p>Even with more time to polish the game, there was never a time where everything was fixed, added Grygorovych. And with the end of the year and its key sales period looming, the decision was made to continue on and release Stalker 2 in the best state possible.</p><p>"You're so tired that you would just die if you say let's run an additional marathon," said Grygorovych. "We didn't have a chance to say let's do it more. We just had a chance of 'let's do until this moment - the release date - as much as we can'." After that, further patches and story expansions can then always be added, he continued.</p>
<p>I spoke with Grygorovych, and creative director (and his wife) Mariia Grygorovych, after a screening at BAFTA of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-documentary-shares-personal-stories-from-development-against-the-backdrop-of-war">documentary War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a> (which you can watch on YouTube, above). The film follows development of the game during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It's a powerful and harrowing watch that provides further context to the game and explains its status as a political piece of art.</p>
<p>In particular, one thread of the film explores the development team grappling with traitorous feelings as they fled Ukraine for their own safety - though other team members did remain in Kyiv to lend support. I had to ask, then: has that feeling changed since the release of the game?</p>
<p>Grygorovych noted the "good response from players from our nation" and the extent of coverage from TV news outlets mentioning the game and the release of its patches. "It's something so unimportant in the scale of the country, but they were talking about the game!" he said.</p><p>"It touched everyone in the country, but after releasing this it slightly justified that, yes we left our country and decided not to stay there, but we still made something that could help Ukraine in some way. We are artists, we are creative people, but it was our way to bring value to our country."</p>
<p>He continued: "When you finish the project, you release it and show that it's a good game. And not everyone will love it, that's ok, but for the people who like it we made them happier."</p>

<p>Releasing the game (and the documentary) has helped highlight the plight of Stalker 2's developers, but also raise awareness of the continuing situation in Ukraine at large, Grygorovych continued. "It's very important to remind people what's going on, because when there is something evil and you stop calling it out and mentioning it... it won't help to stop it," he said.</p><p>"One layer is we are making the game and we want to entertain people and make it as good a game as possible. And second, it's about what we can do for our homeland, because we are in a hard situation. I would love to stay in my country and live in my country and make games in my country, but it's nearly impossible now."</p>
<p>As such, the only way to develop and release the game was to divide the team and make it work across two offices in two countries - one in Kyiv and another in Prague. Yet Mariia Grygorovych added that had the team remained in Kyiv, it still would've released the game in some form. "I can't imagine that we would give up in this theoretical situation," she said, "because giving up is something not about even our culture. It's hard but you will do it. Why? Because we don't have any options. Why is Ukraine even fighting with big evil Russia? Because we don't have any options."</p>
<blockquote>"I would love to stay in my country and live in my country and make games in my country, but it's nearly impossible now."</blockquote>
<p>Stalker 2 has proven so popular in the studio's homeland that there were countrywide internet issues for five or six hours once the game was released. "It was hard for the whole country and it's a bad thing because the internet is important, but at the same time it's like whoa!" she said.</p>
<p>"For us and our team what's most important is, for some people in Ukraine, they feel a little bit happier than they were before release," she continued. "We did something for our home country, something good for them.</p>
<p>"It's not perfect, we need to fix everything, it has some problems. But it's a game! It's a game with soul, with feelings there, with love there. Even the problems, you can't fix them if you don't have a game."</p><p>As for fixing those bugs, Ievgen Grygorovych said doing so was the easy part in comparison to the creative process of making the game itself. Still, it struggled with wanting to release the game in a playable state, and not make matters worse by introducing fixes to some issues that then destablised other parts of the game elsewhere.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, GSC Gameworld's team say they are still adjusting to their new normal, split over two locations and with Ukraine's future still uncertain. Grygorovych believes the studio is now forever changed. "It's like an evolution," he said. "There's no way for evolution to move somewhere in the past... it leads you to the place where we are now and it's impossible to get back to the place that was safer, better, warmer. We are in this state and sadly we can't go back, but we can move forward and we can be better."</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-gets-third-big-patch-in-less-than-a-week-this-one-targeting-crashes-memory-leaks-and-more">Stalker 2 received its third major patch</a> in less than a week, bringing crash fixes and more.</p>
<p>The game's success has also reportedly made it the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-reportedly-target-of-russian-disinformation-campaign-claiming-its-used-to-draft-players-into-ukraine-war">target of a Russian disinformation campaign</a> claiming it's used to draft players into the Ukraine war.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced that it will shut down the servers for its competitive first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>next year, and two of the company's studios will close while a third will "ramp down" production.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/xdefiant-our-message-to-players" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on its official website</a>, Ubisoft says that the "sunset process" for&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>has already begun. As of yesterday, you can no longer download&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>as a new player, register to play it, or purchase any in-game content.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>is shutting down, its third season will still launch, although after that, no new content will be added to the game. We don't yet know when Season 3 will launch, but you can expect it to land in the next couple of months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-shooting.jpg?itok=-vVJW1Sb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-shooting.jpg?itok=md2O6Kdl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>will shut down next year, Ubisoft has announced.</figcaption></figure><p>If you bought&nbsp;<em>XDefiant</em>'s Ultimate Founders Pack, you'll be entitled to a full refund, and if you bought any virtual currency or DLC for the game on or after November 3rd, you'll get a refund for that as well.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you do want to keep playing&nbsp;<em>XDefiant</em>, you'll be able to do so until the servers shut down, which will happen on June 3rd. That's only if you've already signed up and downloaded it, of course.</p>

<p>What's more, according to Ubisoft's chief studios and portfolio officer <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Marie-Sophie de Waubert</a>, Ubisoft's San Francisco and Osaka studios will close down.</p>

<p>The San Francisco studio was the one responsible for developing&nbsp;<em>XDefiant</em>, while the Osaka studio has worked on several of Ubisoft's games over the years, including series like&nbsp;<em>Petz&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rocksmith</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-san-francisco-osaka-shutdown-rocksmith.jpg?itok=3jHrMorJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-san-francisco-osaka-shutdown-rocksmith.jpg?itok=2mQNZ7gi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Both Ubisoft San Francisco and Ubisoft Osaka have worked on the&nbsp;<em>Rocksmith&nbsp;</em>franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>In her post, de Waubert also refers to the "ramp down of the Sydney production site". She expresses her "deepest gratitude" to "those team members leaving Ubisoft", although she doesn't confirm how many people the shutdowns will affect.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1864109024939049085" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>, up to 277 people could lose their jobs, although Totilo also says that half of the&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>team will be reallocated to other Ubisoft projects.</p>

<p>It's been a rough year for Ubisoft; the company has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">hemorrhaged money</a>&nbsp;this year after seemingly suffering high-profile financial flops, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">the likes of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">Star Wars Outlaws</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown </em>(and now&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>as well).</p>

<p>Ubisoft's performance has led to angry investors calling for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change" rel="nofollow">structural change</a> at the company, with heads the Guillemots and investor Tencent reportedly considering <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report" rel="nofollow">taking the company private</a> in response.</p>

<p>Layoffs at Ubisoft are part of a wider industry wave that has affected big and small companies alike. Latest <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rajio.bsky.social/post/3lcgx6aeglk2i" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">estimates</a> suggest that 2024's layoffs total more than 2023's and 2022's combined, and that this year is just a few hundred layoffs away from doubling 2023's total.</p>

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 Pro comparison video covering over 20 games was shared online this week, providing a comprehensive look at how the new system improves and sometimes does not both patched and unpatched games.</p>
<p>The new video, which was put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a>, puts several patched and unpatched games like Marvel's Spider-Man 2, God of War Ragnarok, The Last of Us Part 1 and 2, Dragon's Dogma 2, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and many others running on the base and Pro models side by side, highlighting the improvements the new system brings in the vast majority of cases. In unpatched games, unsurprisingly, the improvements aren't massive, but they are still noticeable, as in the case of Final Fantasy XVI, which sees a small performance improvement.</p>

<p>Besides featuring a more powerful GPU, the PlayStation 5 Pro's most notable feature is the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, which is the first AI-powered upscaler in the console space. Unfortunately, PSSR leaves something to be desired as of now, as it doesn't deliver great image quality in some titles, especially if they have low internal resolution, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-upscaler-not-good-4k/">Alan Wake 2.</a> These disappointing results could be caused by developers having used older versions of the upscaler, as future batches of games should look much better, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-bad-pssr-older-version/">according to a developer.</a></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the system by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>

            <p>"Bestest best?!

"RPS have never steered us wrong before!" they said, thus cementing our reputation as the most selflessly heroic gaming website, seven years running. What we can’t take credit for, however, is the 1.2 million quid they’ve raised already. If you want to make that number bigger, you can pick up the bundle <a href="https://jinglejam.tiltify.com/">here</a>, and get 19 Steam keys for your trouble with a minimum donation of £35.</p>
<p>19 is such an annoying number in terms of the page layout that I’m almost convinced to never give to charity again, but there are some very nice games, including the aforementioned Shadows Of Doubt, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeons-and-degenerate-gamblers">Dungeons And Degenerate Gamblers</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab’s Treasure</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/two-point-campus">Two Point Campus</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathsprint-66">Deathsprint 66</a>.</p>

<p>The bundle itself is joining a bunch of other streaming events over December in raising money for eight charities. That’s War Child, CALM, Autistica, Cool Earth, Sarcoma UK, The Trevor Project, Bristol Children’s Hospital, and Whale And Dolphin Conservation. You can find the details of each, including the stream times <a href="https://www.jinglejam.co.uk/">here</a>. If there’s a specific charity from the list you’re especially interested in supporting, different streams each have specific causes they’re fundraising for.</p><p>Of the games, I’m quite fond of both Two Point Campus and Dungeons And Degenerate Gamblers. I suspect my actual favourite will turn out to be Citizen Sleeper - I’ve just been holding off on playing it for the right time. I like to meticulously block-in calender dates on which I expect to experience strong emotions, lest they interfere with my usual schedule of detached ennui.</p>
<p>My autocorrect won’t let me write ‘Brendy’ today without changing it to ‘Brandy’. Is this you trying to be Christmassy, Google docs? Please do not try and enforce your regime of cheer on me, it’s horrible. Anyway - Brendan’s favourite from the list would, I imagine, be Shadows Of Doubt, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadows-of-doubt-review">to which he awarded </a>a coveted and delicious RPS Bestest Best. “Officers! Arrest this game, it's brilliant,” wrote he. "I think the immersive detective sim has found its first true killer". Come for the thoughtful breakdown, stay for a detective named Dick McClumps.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Breakout musical movie success Wicked has signed itself up to a crossover with... Funko Fusion, meaning you can wobble around its world as big-headed versions of Elphaba, Glinda, the Wizard and Madame Morrible.
</p>
<p>
For the uninitiated, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/funko-fusion-is-a-co-op-clash-of-big-headed-pop-culture-brands">Funko Fusion is an action-adventure game solely based around the power of brand crossovers</a>. Character packs are available for a range of prices, from free up to around a tenner for a few extra figures.
</p>
<p>
Funko Fusion is developed by 10:10 Games, the Warrington-based studio founded by Jon Burton, former boss of licensed Lego outfit TT Games. Similar to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-dimensions">Lego Dimensions</a>, Funko Fusion hosts an eye-opening array of intellectual properties, from Back to the Future's Marty McFly to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> Freddy Fazbear to Hot Fuzz's Nicholas Angel and Danny Butterman.

<p>
Alongside those are characters from (deep breath) Battlestar Galactica, Chucky, Jaws, Jurassic World, Knight Rider, Masters of the Universe, M3gan, Mega Man, Scott Pilgrim, Shaun of the Dead, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>, The Walking Dead and Xena: Warrior Princess. KFC's Colonel Sanders is also in. Also, Bob Ross.
</p><p>
What is this feeling? Gameplay-wise, Funko Fusion is very much a spiritual successor to Lego Dimensions - though without the natural charm of Lego and with more digital plastic. Does its array of licensed IP outweigh its simple gameplay? Well, you can't defy gravity.
</p>
<p>
Next up for Funko Fusion? Characters from the US version of The Office.

            <p>It appears The Thing: Remastered has secured itself a release date, and not only that, it appears that date is imminent.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/29/next-week-on-xbox-new-games-for-december-2-to-6/">Xbox Wire post</a>, The Thing: Remastered is set to arrive tomorrow, 5th December.</p>
<p>However, as noted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-thing-remastered-release-date-quietly-revealed-for-later-this-week">IGN</a>, other platforms such as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958970/The_Thing_Remastered/">Steam</a> still have the upcoming game listed as simply 'Coming Soon'. The <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10011616">PlayStation store</a> has The Thing: Remastered down as 'Announced', but with no further release date information provided. Meanwhile, a recent post on social media platform X by developer <a href="https://x.com/NightdiveStudio/status/1864064101829554268">Nightdive</a> stated the game was set for a December release, but it didn't specify a date.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Nightdive - which was also responsible for last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> remake - for clarification on The Thing: Remastered's release date. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>The Thing: Remastered was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nightdives-the-thing-remaster-is-official-and-coming-later-this-year">announced earlier this year</a>. It casts players as United States Army Special Forces member Captain Blake, who heads to the Antarctic outpost seen in the movie to find out what happened to its ill-fated research team.</p>
<p>The game itself promises players plenty of "blood-curdling events" and "enigmatic deaths". So, even though The Thing: Remastered may well be releasing this December, it is less about sleigh bells and more about slay bells.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you want to take a look at the studio's previous work, we were rather impressed with its System Shock remake, giving it four out of five stars on release.</p>
<p>"The System Shock remake faithfully recreates a classic, retains most of its appeal, reframes everything with a horror tilt, and as a result, makes it more playable for everyone," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-review-shodan-steals-the-show-in-this-faithful-remake">Eurogamer's System Shock review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/consoles-close-final-spec-playstation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Consoles are never getting a big leap in power again, as current systems are close to the final spec for what a console could be, according to former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/there-comes-a-time-when-we-all-declare-the-war-is-over-former-playstation-studios-boss-shawn-layden-on-the-future-of-video-game-consoles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eurogamer</a> about the current state of the gaming industry and consoles, Shawn Layden provided some interesting insights on whether consoles can continue to exist in the long term, and if the console war will continue in the future. Taking Nintendo out of the equation, as the company has always managed to do things differently than anyone else, according to the former PlayStation boss, it's time to start thinking about what the purpose of a proprietary console is. Generational leaps in the past have been huge on pretty much every front, but right now, we are getting to the point that differences between generations and systems are minimal, and most people are not interested in teraflops and ray tracing.</p>
<p>As such, the former PlayStation boss thinks that a big generational leap in power is never happening again, as the only leap that's left to make is the creation of<em> "perfectly-realised human actors in a game that you completely control,"</em> which is something that he thinks will eventually happen. At this point, however, the innovation curve of hardware is starting to plateau, and the homogenization of gaming hardware results in very little differences between PlayStation and Xbox hardware, since both are powered by AMD. There will be improvements in the future, but we are now close to the final spec for what a console could be.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this could be the end of the console war, according to the former PlayStation boss, who gave the example of the Betamax, Sony's short-lived answer to the VHS format. Eventually, the industry came together on the format, and the competition switched on the content. This should be the same in the gaming industry, as <em>"content should be the competition for publishers, not which hardware you get behind."</em> For this reason, according to Shawn Layden, the console will become irrelevant in the next few generations.</p>
<p>Speaking about content, the former PlayStation boss provided some interesting comments regarding the possibility of Sony's games releasing on either Xbox or Nintendo systems. PlayStation has been the market leader for almost every generation it has been, and with such a strong lead, there would be no reason to release games on competing hardware, as the small additional sales wouldn't be worth it against the brand impact. Sony is already getting anger from users when they release a former PlayStation exclusive on PC 18 months later, and if this is happening on PC, it would be much, much worse by releasing games on Xbox consoles.</p>
<p>The former PlayStation boss's comments on how there will never be a massive generational leap in the future are quite interesting, especially in light of Microsoft promising the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-doubles-down-on-game-preservation-and-largest-generational-leap-claim/">biggest leap ever</a> with their next Xbox. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-xbox-next-machine-learning/">machine learning</a> will probably play a huge part in this leap, it will be very interesting to see how console gaming will evolve in the future, and if consoles will ever become irrelevant, as Shawn Layden expects.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a> arrives soon, which will be exciting to many of you who like the guy who runs from large boulders and occasionally cracks a whip. It may be worth holding back that excitement, though, until you've had a glance at the just-released PC requirements. If you want to run it so Indy's hands are rendered at the recommended spec, you'll need quite the beefy rig. If you want his hands ray traced, you'll need something even juicier.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I've popped an image of the PC requirements below. Running the game at minimum specs (without ray tracing) isn't <em>too</em> costly to be fair. I'm no hardware editor, but I do think my own several-years-old PC could churn it out fairly comfortably, even if my slow broadband speeds would take about a year to download the hefty 120GB needed before I could even get started. If you're after ray tracing at minimum, you'll need a RTX 4070 12GB. One thing I do know - that 4070 ain't cheap, chief.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Microsoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for those recommended specs (again, without ray tracing), you're looking at a pretty pricey system, firmly planted within that midrange tier. The work-supplied PC I'm writing this article on can run most games smoothly at 1080p, but if I wanted to get into Indy on the recc specs, I'd need to double my RAM. If I wanted to even tickle Ultra settings? Hah. No.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo will no longer launch its Alarmo alarm clock to the general public this January within Japan, the company has said, blaming its "production and inventory situation".
</p>
<p>
Alarmo has been available for several months here in Europe, and in America, but only to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. In Japan, the popularity of the product - and the lack of stock - led Nintendo to open a lottery for subscribers to get a chance of obtaining one.
</p>
<p>
A wider launch for Alarmo had been set for January worldwide, but Nintendo has now <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2024/1204.html">said</a> this won't happen - at least in Japan. Eurogamer has asked Nintendo UK whether there has been any similar impact to the company's European plans.

<p>
There's no word yet on when Alarmo's postponed public launch will actually occur in Japan. As it is, Nintendo Switch Online subscribers in the country who pre-order an Alarmo from mid-December face a wait for delivery until February 2025.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's stock issues come as the company quietly prepares for the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. Nintendo is yet to make any comment on the device's manufacturing or production schedule, but has said it will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">publicly unveil the console before the end of March 2025</a>.  Last month, an analyst told Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">the "ship had sailed" on Nintendo lifting the lid this year</a>.
</p>
<p>
After a couple of weeks waking up to Alarmo each morning, I ultimately decided its fun probably wasn't worth the £99 price tag, despite an array of tunes themed around <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin">Pikmin</a>, Mario, Zelda and other top franchises.</p>
<p>
  "Alarmo's clever motion sensor is the star of the show in this pricey Nintendo-coated lifestyle gadget that otherwise skimps on the fun," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-review-marios-charm-cant-justify-alarm-clocks-90-price-tag">Eurogamer's Nintendo Alarmo review</a>.

						<h5>FANTASIAN Neo Dimension</h5><p><span>December 5th, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Since Hironobu Sakaguchi left Square Enix to create his own development studio, Mistwalker, the Final Fantasy series has never been the same. Although debating the quality of individual titles past the ninth entry in the series, the last the franchise's creator worked on, has never produced an actual consensus, there's no denying that the little spark that made Final Fantasy one of the most loved Japanese role-playing game series ever made went away together with the series creator.</p>
<p>This has been made painfully clear by <a href="https://wccftech.com/fantasian-neo-dimension-launches-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FANTASIAN</a>, Mistwalker's return to a classic JRPG formula after a while. Originally released in two parts for the Apple Arcade service, the game is effectively a Final Fantasy game in all but name, featuring an engaging turn-based combat system with a very peculiar twist that is very reminiscent of the amazing Chrono Trigger, another legendary game Sakaguchi-san contributed to make in the late 90s, a unique visual style which employs hand-made dioramas for the locations, a clear callback to the PlayStation entries in the Final Fantasy series with their pre-rendered backgrounds, charming characters and a beautiful soundtrack created by Nobuo Uematsu, the man behind the soundtrack of the vast majority of Final Fantasy games.</p>
<p>All the above contributed to making FANTASIAN the best JRPG that only a few played due to the fact that it has stayed as an Apple Arcade exclusive up until the release of <a href="https://fantasianneodimension.square-enix-games.com/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FANTASIAN Neo Dimension</a>, an enhanced port that is a worthwhile purchase for both JRPG fans and those few who already experienced the original Apple Arcade release, thanks to some welcome additions and tweaks over the original.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241119111309_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The world of FANTASIAN Neo Dimension is far from a world at peace. A deathly mechanical infection called Mechteria, which robs humans of their emotions before taking their lives, is spreading at an alarming rate all over the world, and there's little humanity can do to prevent it from spreading any further. The only one who has the chance to save the world is the young amnesiac boy called Leo, who begins the adventure in a strange land filled with machines. Narrowingly making his escape from the machines that wanted him dead, Leo finds himself back into the world of humans with no recollection of his past.</p>
<p>After a fortuitous encounter, the young protagonist starts understanding that his past is way more complicated than that of any regular boy and that his destiny is deeply intertwined with the Mechteria infection and the mysterious being known as Vam, the Malevolent. By traveling the world together with the companions he will meet on almost every step of his journey, Leo not only gets to remember his past and understand his destiny but will also embark on yet another journey spanning multiple dimensions to get rid of an evil that threatens to swallow all.</p>
<p>FANTASIAN Neo Dimension's story is among the most JRPG stories we have seen in modern games, featuring almost every single trope the genre has featured up until this point. Despite this, Mistwalker made it rather endearing, with some solid writing that brings about some extremely emotional moments here and there. These emotional moments are mostly confined to memories, special events featuring beautiful hand-drawn sequences that cover events that happened before the story began, but they do an excellent job rounding up the tone of the adventure, which is generally on the lighthearted side.</p>
<p>While ultimately, the FANTASIAN Neo Dimension story treads some very familiar ground, it's the characters that truly elevate the experience. Every member of the cast is rather likable, and their interactions help develop them considerably. Cheryl's interactions with Leo, for example, are quite good and give both characters a little more depth beyond the tropes of the headstrong princess and amnesiac adventurer they wholly embrace.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241120113805_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Besides going full-in with tropes, albeit in a compelling way, Mistwalker did not shy away from going full-in with references to the Final Fantasy series in FANTASIAN Neo Dimension as well. Listing all of them would take a long time, but just in the first few hours of the adventure, you will get to understand how Leo is not all that different from thieves like Locke and Zidane, although he isn't as likable as either of them, how Kina is Aerith in not-so-effective disguise (their color pattern is essentially the same as well), how the short battle against Sebastian is a clear callback to the legendary battle between Edward and Tellah only lacking a spoony bard and so on. As a long-time fan of the Square Enix series and Hironobu Saguchi, I really enjoyed spotting these references, which made the adventure even more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Even in regards to gameplay, FANTASIAN Neo Dimension doesn't exactly push the boundaries of the genre. On the contrary, it fully embraces them, only providing some twists that make the experience feel instantly familiar yet engaging. The first half of the adventure sees a linear story progression that brings Leo and his companions from one place to another, but this is completely shaken up in the second half with the introduction of non-linear progression reminiscent of the second half of Final Fantasy VI. Players can technically go whenever they want but have to look out for very powerful enemies and bosses, as the challenge level increases considerably over the first half.&nbsp; The story is told in a slightly different manner and has a slightly increased focus on the characters and their personal journeys, but overall, the experience holds itself up pretty well, although those who prefer a tighter pacing will inevitably feel a little more disappointed.</p>
<p>Regarding actual exploration of the game's many locations rendered with the aforementioned gorgeous hand-made dioramas, FANTASIAN Neo Dimension doesn't do anything different than the PlayStation-era Final Fantasy games have done. Both towns and dungeons are generally on the small side, which is not surprising given the mobile origins of the game, and feature the usual selection of treasure chests, some of them requiring keys to open and simple puzzles. Unlike the aforementioned Final Fantasy games, however, the camera is way more dynamic on the field, which allowed the developers to add more secrets inside locations</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241122180357_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Just like a classic JRPG, FANTASIAN Neo Dimension features random enemy encounters but with a twist that gives players control over when to fight. Shortly after the beginning of the adventure, the Dimengeon system will be unlocked, allowing Leo to send enemies that haven't been encountered for the first time to a parallel dimension where they are stored until defeated. As the Dimengeon system features a limited capacity, there will always come a time when enemies must be fought, so it is not possible to use the system to completely get rid of random enemy encounters. However, it is always a good idea to take advantage of this unique game mechanic, as it is in these Dimengeon battles against huge enemy numbers that the turn-based combat system shines.</p>
<p>The one mechanic that defines the FANTASIAN Neo Dimension combat system is the ability to aim certain skills to hit multiple enemies. Spells like Holy or Ice, for example, can also be curved using the upper and lower boundaries of combat arenas to hit multiple enemies or targets that sometimes wouldn't be possible. This system, which is somewhat reminiscent of Chrono Trigger with skills having different ranges and areas of effect, truly shines in Dimengeon battles not only due to the massive amount of enemies but also because it is possible to destroy some special objects that randomly appear on the battlefield that grant a variety of beneficial effects, such as an increased attack, getting an additional turn and so on. This way, it is possible to manipulate the turn order somewhat and make these battles more manageable and, ultimately, more fun. For boss battles, it is not possible to use the Dimengeon system, and they must be fought with no option to escape or postpone the confrontation. These battles are generally well put together, challenging the player's knowledge of the game mechanics in plenty of different ways. Unfortunately, they become a little stale as the adventure proceeds due to the excessive use of the "Mode Change" mechanics that power the bosses up briefly and force a more defensive approach, but the challenge level they usually present still makes them engaging.</p>
<p>While the combat system wasn't changed in FANTASIAN Neo Dimension over the original Apple Arcade release, I feel the new version of the game will be more enjoyable than the original for the vast majority of players thanks to the introduction of multiple difficulty options. The original game was a rather challenging experience, but in Neo Dimension, the challenge level has been toned down with the introduction of a Normal, more manageable difficulty setting, relegating the original balance to the Hard difficulty setting. No matter the difficulty setting, the game still offers a decent level of challenge, so things are never a walk in the park, especially in boss battles in the more open-ended second half of the game, where they become more like puzzles than actual battles. In the original Apple Arcade release, these battles were way too difficult, but with the new difficulty setting, they are more manageable without too much grinding with the proper building of characters</p>
<p>Character building and progression in FANTASIAN Neo Dimension follows the same trajectory of the story. In the first half, the only customization options are granted by equipment and jewels that can grant a variety of passive skills. Later on, the character-building options expand a lot with the introduction of the Growth Maps granted by Divine Artifacts. These big skill trees feature a lot of different nodes containing a variety of skills that allow for the creation of more specialized builds to take on the challenge Leo and his companions will have to overcome after reaching the Chaos Realm. The game incentivizes experimentation by allowing players to reset each Growth Map at no cost straight from the menu. So, if any boss battle proves to be too much, it is possible to try out different strategies with different character builds with little to no hassle.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241127190422_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The jump from iOS devices to PC and consoles hasn't changed FANTASIAN Neo Dimension's presentation in any significant way, for better or worse. While the dioramas continue to look stunning at every resolution, the character models, while personable and detailed enough, do look on the simple side, bringing to mind the models used for characters in JRPG from a couple of console generations back. The interface hasn't seen any major change over the original release, although it remains functional even with regular controls, including mouse and keyboard controls on PC that work surprisingly well, especially in battle, as aiming skills with the mouse pointer feel way better than doing the same with any controller.</p>
<p>Being a remaster of a mobile game, FANTASIAN Neo Dimension should run well on the vast majority of system configurations. The machine used for the test (i7-13700F, RTX 4080 GPU, 32 GB RAM) was overkill for the game, considering the official recommended specs, so it had no trouble running the game at 4K resolution, High Graphics Quality preset and locked 120 FPS. The graphics options available are limited so there's not much room for tweaking, but this is hardly surprising, considering the type of visuals involved.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241128111220_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Besides a new gameplay balance and 4K resolution support on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X, the vast majority of changes introduced in FANTASIAN Neo Dimension over the original Apple Arcade release pertain to the audio experience. While there is no real reason not to listen to the amazing soundtrack created by Nobuo Uematsu, the new version of the game allows players to change the battle music with tracks lifted from other entries in the series, including Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth, the Pixel Remasters, Final Fantasy XVI and Final Fantasy XIV expansions Endwalker and Dawntrail. Tracks can even be changed during battles themselves, giving players great flexibility. The remaster also introduces new English and Japanese voiceovers that are well done and enhance the story presentation quite a bit.</p>
<p>Instead of attempting to do away with the tropes that have dominated the genre for a very long time, FANTASIAN Neo Dimension fully embraces them to deliver a compelling experience that feels markedly "Final Fantasy" without being an actual part of the&nbsp;series. The story, as a whole, may not be anything special, but the little interactions between the characters, some emotional moments, and the solid combat system, which only improves as the adventure proceeds and the challenge level increases, make for one of the best JRPGs released in the past few years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24312363/fantasian-xbox-ps5-switch-pc-launch-hironobu-sakaguchi<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fantasian</em> was an easy game to recommend <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad">when it launched in 2021</a>. Developed by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"><em>Final Fantasy</em> creator Hironobu Sakaguchi’s Mistwalker studio</a>, <em>Fantasian</em> was an approachable old-school roleplaying game that had a lot of clever ideas, along with an adorable aesthetic thanks to its world made out of hand-crafted dioramas. There was just one problem: it was exclusive to Apple Arcade, so anyone who wasn’t a subscriber missed out. Now, that has finally changed as the game launches this week on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and the Switch.</p><p>The new port is called <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em>, but it’s mostly identical to the Apple Arcade version, aside from the very welcome addition of voice acting. (In a nice bit of circular storytelling, <em>Neo Dimension</em> is being published by <em>Final Fantasy</em> maker Square Enix.) In many ways, <em>Fantasian</em> is classic <em>Final Fantasy</em> in all but name. It stars a hero named Leo, who — with the help of a tough princess, a mysterious magic wielder, and a grizzled ship captain — gets pulled into a quest that spans multiple realms, as they attempt to thwart a mechanical infestation led by a tall, dark, and dangerous villain.</p><p>There’s plenty that <em>Final Fantasy</em> fans will recognize: the amnesiac lead character, the playful love triangle, a world that blends fantasy and sci-fi, similar spells and items, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586744/fantasian-soundtrack-apple-music-nobuo-uematsu">a beautiful soundtrack from famed composer Nobuo Uematsu</a>. Hell, there’s even <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_EU/news/final-fantasy-cid">a character named Sid</a>. The basis of <em>Fantasian</em> is Sakaguchi and his team working with the framework they know but building on top of it in interesting ways. So you’re left with a rock-solid RPG that makes some nice tweaks to the formula.</p><p>The most obvious difference is the visual style, which is like a hand-crafted take on the old prerendered backgrounds from PlayStation-era <em>Final Fantasy</em>. It lends the game a very tactile aesthetic, and it’s surprisingly flexible; there are warm and cozy forests and cabins but also cold mechanical areas made of metal and old circuit boards. And while the game has its origins on mobile, it still looks sharp and clear on console. I’ve been replaying it on the Switch, and the only issue has been the occasionally long load time before a battle.</p><p><em>Fantasian</em> also makes some tweaks to the turn-based RPG formula that make it both more approachable and less frustrating. The first is a fun twist on combat that lets you aim many of your attacks, which can be incredibly satisfying when you line things up <em>just right</em> and hit a whole bunch of enemies in one shot.</p><p>Even more useful is the awkwardly named feature Dimengeon — a portmanteau of dungeon and dimension — which takes the sting out of random battles. When you have it switched on, those pesky monsters are zapped to another dimension, where you can battle them at your leisure. The twist is that they accumulate. So when the device fills up and you have to finally fight them, you can get into a battle against a whole bunch of bad guys at once. These fights have a strategic, almost puzzle-like feel.</p><p>Those seemingly subtle tweaks are more than enough to make <em>Fantasian</em> an easy recommendation if you’re looking for a classic RPG. Much like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24297436/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">the recent remake of <em>Dragon Quest III</em></a>, a large part of the appeal of <em>Fantasian</em> is how traditional it is, while smoothing out the rough edges that can make the genre feel clunky and tedious. And as <em>Final Fantasy</em> itself <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5">continues to expand</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23767669/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5">in different ways</a>, <em>Fantasian</em> is a comforting look back at how things used to be.</p><p><small>Fantasian Neo Dimension <em>launches on December 5th on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and the Switch.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-yves-guillemots-internal-memo-about-xdefiant-closure-and-the-future-of-ubisoft/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closure of XDefiant and its studios</a>, Yves Guillemet sent an internal memo to Ubisoft employees about its future.</p>



<p>The internal memo reads,</p>



<p>“Hello everyone, </p>



<p>It has been some time since I last spoke to you, and I apologize for this silence, especially as the past months have been challenging and unsettling for Ubisoft and likely for each of you. </p>



<p>The announcement by Marie-Sophie regarding the discontinuation of XDefiant, the closure of the San Francisco and Osaka studios, and the ramp down of the Sydney production site is among the difficult decisions we’ve had to make. </p>



<p>I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the tremendous work done by the XDefiant’s teams. Their goal was to challenge the best shooter on the market, but despite the intensity of their efforts, it was not enough. </p>



<p>To everyone leaving Ubisoft, I want to express my deepest gratitude for the work you have accomplished and the contributions you have made. We will do everything possible to provide you with the best support during this transition phase. </p>



<p>We wanted to take a firm and clear decision to enable us to concentrate our investments and forces on more profitable projects. </p>



<p>I am well aware that, given the current context, such announcements may worry you, and that’s understandable. The entire industry is facing similar difficult decisions, yet often the scale of the impact is much larger. Our organization has allowed us to limit the impact of these kinds of decisions and make more targeted restructurings, and all our efforts are focused on trying to maintain this course and philosophy. We will continue working on evolving our organization to adapt it to market changes, and with a long-term perspective in mind. </p>



<p>Over the past few weeks, I’ve had the chance to read the results of the Ubisoft XP 2024 survey. The vast majority of you participated: the response rate was over 86%, and you’ve shared your questions and concerns about the future of Ubisoft via more than 55,000 comments.</p>



<p> I would like to sincerely thank you for your commitment, the quality of your feedback, and your collective intelligence. It’s very impressive. We are compelled to take your critiques to heart, live up to your expectations, and be accountable to you and your needs. </p>



<p>I want you to know that all my energy is focused on finding the means to guide Ubisoft through these turbulent times. I am working tirelessly with my team to identify the best solutions so we can maintain control of our destiny. </p>



<p>This company – the incredible gem we’ve built together over the past 38 years – means everything to me. It’s a part of who I am, it’s in my core. </p>



<p>I’m doing everything I can to help us regain momentum, so that we can continue to make Ubisoft a key player in our industry, a creator known for its unique and exceptional video games. </p>



<p>In the coming days, some members of the Executive Committee will reach out to you. Cécile Russeil will share new initiatives aimed at addressing some of the questions raised by Ubisoft XP. Marie-Sophie de Waubert will present initiatives to bring back a daily focus on creation, ensuring fewer unnecessary processes and more time dedicated to what truly matters to each of us: making the best games possible. Alain Corre will provide updates on the launch of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, progress made in strengthening our relationship with gamers, particularly regarding The Crew Motorfest and Star Wars Outlaws. </p>



<p>Thank you sincerely for your daily commitment and the quality of your work. The greatest strength of Ubisoft is its people. That strength is you. Thank you. </p>



<p>Yves”</p>







<p>Yves’ email came following the internal announcement from Marie-Sophie de Waubert that XDefiant and some of its studios would be closing. XDefiant’s closure will see 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney.</p>



<p>You can read Marie-Sophie de Waubert’s internal memo below:</p>



<p>Marie-Sophie</p>



<p>Hello all, Today, I wanted to share with you that we’ve made the difficult decision to discontinue development on XDefiant. </p>



<p>Despite an encouraging start, the team’s passionate work, and a committed fan base, we’ve not been able to attract and retain enough players in the long run to compete at the level we aim for in the very demanding free-to-play FPS market. As a result, the game is too far away from reaching the results required to enable further significant investment, and we are announcing that we will be sunsetting it. </p>



<p>Concretely, that means that as of today, new downloads, player registrations and purchases will no longer be available. Season 3 will still launch, and the servers will remain active until June 3, 2025, out of appreciation for both our dev teams who worked on it and for XDefiant’s active players. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the discontinuation of XDefiant brings difficult consequences for the teams working on this game. Even if almost half of the XDefiant team worldwide will be transitioning to other roles within Ubisoft, this decision also leads to the closing of our San Francisco and Osaka production studios and to the ramp down of our Sydney production site, with 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney. To those team members leaving Ubisoft, I want to express my deepest gratitude for your work and contributions. Please know that we are committed to supporting you during this transition. </p>



<p>Developing Games-as-a-Service experiences remains a pillar of our strategy, and we’ve achieved significant successes, like Rainbow Six, The Crew, and For Honor, among others. It’s a highly competitive market, and we will apply the lessons learned with XDefiant to our future live titles. </p>



<p>Globally, we are determined to take the necessary steps to put the company back on a path to growth, innovation and creativity and make sure we can set you up for success. This means continuing to radically evolve our mindset for Production and Business practices, which we will share more about soon, and doing targeted restructuring when necessary. I know that the situation brings questions and expectations, and we will share regular and transparent updates. </p>



<p>My sincere thanks for your continued dedication as we navigate these trying times together. </p>



<p>Marie-Sophie”</p>

<p>UFL is finally making its way to the pitch with a full Trophies and Achievements list. The free-to-play soccer title is looking to rival the best in the business, and while competing on the pitch, you also need to be as adept off it if you want every UFL Achievement and Trophy.</p>



<p>Multiple betas and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ufl-launch-delayed-strikerz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushbacks</a> later, and it’s time for UFL to make its mark. The new kid on the block wants to disrupt an established market dominated by the same two names—EA FC and eFootball. Using the last few years of the Premier League as an example, EA FC is Manchester City, and eFootball is Liverpool—which hurts to say as a Liverpool fan. The point is that few others have laid down a creditable title challenge, and this is where UFL steps in.</p>



<p>With high-profile investors on board—including Cristiano Ronaldo—UFL is looking to shake things up, and its Achievements and Trophies list is sure to appeal to many.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-trophies-amp-achievements-in-ufl">How Many Trophies &amp; Achievements in UFL?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Many matches come down to the wire. Credit to Strikerz Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>UFL has 25 Xbox Achievements and a further 26 PlayStation Trophies to obtain in the soccer simulation title.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re on PlayStation, you get an extra intangible award thanks to the Platinum Trophy. This is awarded once you complete the other 25 Trophies on the list. Xbox players simply get to pat themself on the back once they bag the 25th and final Achievement!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-ufl-achievement-amp-trophy">Every UFL Achievement &amp; Trophy</h2>



<p>Many of the UFL Trophies and Achievements are standard objectives for what you’d find in a game like this. Completing Ranked Matches, changing tactics, and being active in the transfer market all reward you with Achievements and Trophies.</p>



<p>Check out the full UFL list in its entirety—thanks to <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/UFL/achievements#:~:text=Here%20is%20the%20full%20list%20of%20all%2025,squad.%20Add%20your%20squad%27s%20third%20kit%20in%20Customization." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TrueAchievements</a>.</p>
