<p>It's now been just over a week since the Switch 2 landed and Nintendo is already wanting to know how users are finding the experience in a new survey.</p>
<p>If you happen to be located in places like Australia, New Zealand, the UK or Europe, you might have already found this email in your inbox. In it, you can expect to answer the usual details like your age, the number of people in your household, some general gaming questions, and then more specific Nintendo and Switch 2-related questions.</p>
<p>Some of the questions about the Switch 2 include if you've purchased one, if you plan to make the new console your main gaming device and how you got the system. There are even some sections requiring written replies – like why you decided to purchase a Nintendo Switch 2, what you've enjoyed about it so far, and anything about the new system you're <em>not</em> really enjoying.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f241e228e1196/nintendo-switch-2.large.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo, Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to Nintendo, places for this survey are "limited" – so if you would like to participate, be sure to respond to your survey email "quickly" so you can <em>directly</em> share with Nintendo how your time has been with the Switch 2 after a week, or if you've even got one yet.</p>

<p>Join new and familiar friends on a magical adventure</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Hot off the heels of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atelier_yumia_the_alchemist_of_memories_and_the_envisioned_land">Atelier Yumia</a>, Koei Tecmo revealed it would be releasing another Atelier game. In case you missed it, this time it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atelier_resleriana_the_red_alchemist_and_the_white_guardian">Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</a> and it's now confirmed to be launching on <strong>26th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release date, a "first look" video has been released including commentary from the game's development team. Players can meet "new and familiar characters of this new magical world" and get a first glimpse at the game system and world they'll be exploring.</p>
<p>Here's the official PR and you can take a look at the developer commentary in the video above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</em></strong> takes players on a new mysterious and cosy adventure alongside new characters Rias Eidreise, an adventurer with a talent for alchemy, and Slade Clauslyter, a young man capable of opening entrances to dimensional paths leading to alternate dimensions. These two protagonists will join forces in an attempt to discover the reason for the disappearance of the inhabitants of Hallfein, while also trying to follow in the footsteps of their loved ones and restore their hometown. During their journey, they will meet various characters who will help them, including familiar faces from the Atelier series such as Sophie Nuenmuller, Razeluxe Meitzen, Totori Helmold and Wilbell Voll-Ersleid.</p>
<p>Set in the universe of <em>Atelier Resleriana: Forgotten Alchemy and the Polar Night Liberator</em>, this new <em>Atelier</em> title will transport players to the continent of Lantarna, where they can explore, gather ingredients for synthesis and discover every secret corner, day or night, rain or shine. Players will also have the opportunity to explore multi-level dungeons, known as “Dimensional Paths”, where the structure will change randomly with each visit, allowing players to gather different ingredients and challenge new enemies depending on the difficulty level chosen.</p>
<p>Fights in <strong><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</em></strong> will blend strategy with turn-based combat for strategic timeline command battles where players can form a team of six characters (three in the front line and three in the back). By using action points and equipped items to their advantage, users will be able to inflict damage and influence the timeline of characters’ turns, triggering consecutive turns for allies and activating powerful unite attacks.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Using ingredients gathered during exploration or combat, Rias will be able to synthesise various items during a process called “Gift Colour Synthesis”. During this synthesis process, players will have to connect the “Gift Colours” of the ingredients together to create new items. They will also be able to assign traits or change recipes depending on the ingredients used. When certain characters come to lend Rias a hand, this will further strengthen the item created.</p>
<p>In addition to the traditional Atelier gameplay system alternating between exploration, combat and synthesis, users will be able to sell items via Rias’ shop while helping to develop the town. By selling synthesised items, players will earn money they can invest in the development of Hallfein, thus unlocking new recipes and progressing through the main story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you end up purchasing either a digital or physical edition of this game "up to the first two weeks after release" you can also receive the "Activewear Adventuring set" for Ria and Slade, as well as the "Adventuring Charm Set" as an early bonus.</p>
<p>There's no mention of a Nintendo Switch 2 version of this game just yet, but if we hear any updates, we'll let you know. And if you haven't played Atelier Yumia yet, you can check out our Nintendo Life review:</p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Banaza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6208a08d7ff13/donkey-kong-banaza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 only arrived last week, but Nintendo is already building up the hype for its next game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, or want something else from the new hardware, this new 3D Donkey Kong will be launching next month on <strong>17th July</strong>. Nintendo has issued a reminder about this via social media, which gives fans another quick glimpse at DK destroying <em>everything</em> in sight and "surfing on a rock".</p>

<p>We went hands on with Donkey Kong Bananza in April and described it as a "brilliantly bonkers" game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While Donkey Kong has been living on the sidelines for a while now, Bananza truly is his time to shine, and what we got to play around with was a solid and delightfully stress-relieving bolt of silliness that we desperately need right now. We're hoping there are some more jungly levels out in the wilderness, but this could well be DK's breakout game. And he more than deserves it."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>While we wait for DK to arrive, there are plenty of other first and third-party Switch 2 games to enjoy including titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:180448,182523 @ 1749883356 -->
<p>So, the countdown for DK's 3D outing is officially underway. Will you be adding this one to your Switch 2 library when it arrives next month? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Liam is a news writer and reviewer across Hookshot Media.

<p>According to Piscatella, this is an "all-time launch week unit sales record for video game hardware in the US", with "over 1.1 million units sold" (week ending June 7, 2025). The previous record was held by Sony's PlayStation 4, and the sales calculated here for the Switch 2 exclude My Nintendo Store purchases.</p>
<p>Additionally, 79% of US buyers purchased the Switch 2 exclusive launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> on release – either physically or as part of the system bundle.</p>
<p>On the software front, Mario Kart World is leading Switch 2 physical game sales in this same location, followed by CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> in second place, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Switch 2 Edition</a> in third. Unsurprisingly, the new Mario Kart has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">dominated software sales</a> on the Switch 2 in other regions in the first week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/to-a-t-game-keita-takahashi-impressions-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've spent the last couple of weeks playing <em>To A T</em>, the latest from Keita Takehashi and his team at Uvala. And I could not have picked a better time to play something that is built from the ground up to bring you nothing but joy.</p><p>You're in control of a 13-year-old who spends their life locked in a T-pose. Which presents some unique challenges, because you can't fit through a lot of doors properly, need help from your dog to brush your teeth and simple acts like eating a sandwich turn into a whole <em>process</em>. If those sound like awfully mundane things to have been made aware of while playing a video game, there's a reason for that: it's exactly the stuff you do in <em>To A T</em>, a game which puts you in such complete control over your character that you have to do everything, from change your shoes to going to the bathroom.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="TO A T | Reveal Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nD9H6__29A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Imagine if <em>Heavy Rain</em>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUQZurjxQAE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with all its door opening and door closing and egg flipping</a>, was a feel-good cartoon instead of a dreary murder slog. <em>To A T's</em> attention to details really helps ground you in both the place and your character, but more importantly, it centres you on their struggles as well. This is, without making a huge deal of it, a beautiful little tale about disability, a light-hearted way of putting the player in the shoes of someone who is doing their absolute best to live their day despite the constant obstacles (and sometimes even bullying!) in their way.</p><p><em>To A T</em> takes place over a number of episodic days, over which you're slowly introduced to a town, its inhabitants, stores and storyline. I cannot stress how nice it is just to be around it all. The people, the jibberish language everyone speaks, how nice everyone is, the colours, the music–for the past week I have jumped into this idyllic little place every chance I've got and just hung out. Sometimes I'll nudge the story along, sometimes I'll just collect coins and buy a new pair of sneakers for no reason.</p><p>I want to give special praise to the game's bathroom. So much of <em>To A T</em> is about helping you accomplish very set tasks: you can only eat your cereal a certain way, you can only brush your teeth the way the game wants, you have to go to school, etc. But every morning, rain or shine, you need to pee as soon as you get out of bed, and once you get inside the bathroom the guardrails are off. You are<em> let loose</em>. The game's insistence on making you press specific buttons at specific times to complete specific actions gives way to an orchestra of grunts, plops and wet fart noises, as every button on the controller is eventually unlocked and bound to a toilet sound, allowing you to freestyle your own cistern-based symphony</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="TO A T | Coming to PC, PS5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S May 28" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E-QlrrC4vFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Oh, and one last cool thing: the game has the most casual way of letting you create your own character, once again without making even the tiniest fuss about the specifics of it. You name them at the start then that's it, as you're then left to choose your own hairstyles and clothing options, change them whenever you want, and the game will never once reference your gender or care what you're wearing.</p><p>The game has some game-shaped issues, sure. Traversing the town is a disorienting nightmare thanks to a bizarre decision to employ a semi-fixed camera that constantly swoops to new positions, and while the minutiae of performing every little task is a fantastic introduction to your character and the world initially, by the time you're drawing near the end of the story it gets a little bit tiring. But the episodic structure of <em>To A T</em>, its length and enormous heart makes those annoyances fairly insignificant. They don't ever get in the way of what the game's really trying to do, which is tell you a cheery and weird little story, spread out over episodes like the best kid's TV show you've ever seen.</p><p>I have not had a great week, alternating between stress and being extremely sick (it's flu season here!), but the one bright spot has been jumping into <em>To A T</em> each night to say hi, explore the happiest town on Earth, eat some sandwiches made fresh every day for me by a giant giraffe and enjoy every second of some of the catchiest theme songs ever written.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/relooted-game-africa-museum-visa-nyamakop-interview"><h3>How Relooted, A Game About Reclaiming African Artifacts From Western Museums, Ended Up Being Shown By A White Guy At Summer Game Fest</h3></a><p>"Fucked up to be making a game about reclaiming African artifacts that are in Western countries, and Africans can't even visit those artifacts"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/disney-universal-midjourney-ai-lawsuit-case-copyright"><h3>Disney’s Big AI Lawsuit Includes Some Very Damning Images</h3></a><p>Disney isn't the only one calling Midjourney a 'bottomless pit of plagiarism'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-demo"><h3>Dispatch Is A Superhero Logistics Game</h3></a><p>All the paperwork bits instead of the pew-pew bits</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmata-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">An all-new third-person shooter might be the most exciting thing in Capcom’s lineup.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has been firing on all cylinders with its marquee franchises – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-for-march">Monster Hunter is seeing increasing success</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview">Resident Evil train is continuing to roll,</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launch-helps-street-fighter-6-hit-5-million-sales-2-years-after-launch">Street Fighter continues to be a staple in the fighting game community</a>. It has a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gets-new-summer-game-fest-trailer-showing-more-slashy-combat">new Onimusha on the way</a>, and the last time we saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/06/devil-may-cry-5-review">Devil May Cry was on a high note</a>. But every now and then, Capcom experiments with something new, to varying degrees of success. And that latest experiment is in Pragmata, a sci-fi third-person shooter that stole the show for me at Summer Game Fest 2025 – even after just a brief 15-minute hands-on demo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another sci-fi third-person shooter may not sound too enticing on the surface, but Pragmata is an example of how a single idea can go a long way in distinguishing a game from the rest of the pack. Here’s the thing – in Pragmata you don’t just damage your enemies by shooting them, you have to hack them to open up their weaknesses. The way this works is by aiming down sights and engaging in a hacking minigame where you navigate a five-by-five grid using the face buttons to draw a path that connects specific nodes together. And you have to do this in real-time. Along that path, you can hit additional nodes to inflict status effects or open up weak spots, which can be risky when you’re locked in a room of multiple menacing robots chasing you down.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pragmata - Preview Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re nimble enough with your rocket-boosted dodge and smart with your positioning, you can pull this off unscathed, and it is so damn satisfying when it all comes together. When you’re mostly fighting in tight spaces, creating space to hack and shoot can be challenging. Pragmata isn’t exactly a fast-paced game in the same way as Vanquish or Returnal, and it moves more like a Dead Space or Gears of War, and I enjoy that chunky, heavy feel. You’re also not outfitted with a ton of weapons – while you have a six-shot pistol with unlimited magazines, you pick up disposable weapons like a slow, powerful heavy rifle and a Bola gun to temporarily immobilize enemies. These effective, limited-use weapons push you to be more resourceful and make combat more interesting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since you’re not blasting through waves of robots and drones, the combat encounters feel more deliberate – and I think that’s important for not overdoing it with the hacking minigame. My worry for now is that the novelty of the hacking minigame will wear off the deeper you get into Pragmata, but that’ll be determined by how the gameplay mechanics evolve and the way further combat encounters present new challenges. I’m actually bummed that the demo ends right when you approached a huge mech for what appeared to be a boss fight because it could’ve been an opportunity to showcase more of Pragmata’s potential.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>[Capcom's] latest experiment is in Pragmata, a sci-fi third-person shooter that stole the show for me...</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hacking is also integrated in environmental puzzles and exploration, presenting you with different styles of sequential button prompts to deactivate security locks or access terminals. Little things like this to break up the pace are important in a fairly linear game where you’re chomping at the bit for the next big fight. You need that variety to balance out even the best parts of a campaign, and I at least enjoy the fact that engaging with levels still revolves around the hacking premise in some form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it be in combat or in exploration, I find a lot of fun in games that give you a more active element to engage with in its core gameplay. Although completely different genres, the timing-based mechanics of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 made its turn-based RPG combat feel fresh, and even the gesture-based inputs for abilities in Scarlet Nexus were a fun way to distinguish itself from other action-RPGs, which I still praise to this day. If Pragmata can build on its best ideas in smart ways, it might be able to wedge itself into this conversation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The demo didn’t have much in terms of story (and I’m glad it focused on its enticing gameplay hook instead), but it does leave me curious as to what the hell is going on in Pragmata. The basic premise is that you’re stuck on a high-tech space station on the moon, and you control a man named Hugh who dons a mech suit and uses a small arsenal of high-powered firearms, all while a mysterious little girl named Diana, who’s the hacking genius, sits on your shoulders to hack enemies. But even if the story is simply a vehicle to take you through its uniquely thrilling combat scenarios, I’m inclined to believe that’s all it has to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I had no idea what Pragmata was when it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pragmata-capcom-release-date-2022">first revealed in 2020</a>, and after years of silence and delays, we know that it's real and on its way in 2026. I’m not expecting it to be the next greatest game or become a pillar of Capcom’s catalog, necessarily, but I’m all for new and well-executed ideas – especially at a time when AAA releases sometimes blend with each other.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mouse-pi-for-hire-might-fill-the-animated-void-cuphead-left-behind.1218339/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mouse-pi-for-hire-might-fill-the-animated-void-cuphead-left-behind<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Cuphead did something in 2017 that we'd arguably never seen before in a video game, or at least nowhere near the degree Cuphead went to: it built an entire game around completely hand-drawn art and animation a la a 1930's cartoon. We haven't seen it since probably since doing all of that painstaking visual work by hand is incredibly difficult, time-intensive, and laborious. But now, a new hand-drawn and hand-animated project is getting ready to grace our PCs and consoles. It's called Mouse: P.I. for Hire, and fully handcrafted art is about the only thing it's got in common with Cuphead. Mouse is its own, equally gorgeous game, and after getting a look at a hands-off demo, I'm just as interested in it as I was when I first saw Cuphead. Which is to say, I’m very interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can obviously see, Mouse is in black and white. It's reminiscent of the Steamboat Willy era of early animation, complete with guns that are always wobbling even when they aren't in use, as if they're made of rubber. (More on the guns in a bit.) As you can also plainly see, Mouse is a first-person shooter. In it, you play as Jack Pepper, who in-demand video game voice actor Troy Baker plays with a stereotypical-on-purpose New York accent. He's an early-20th-century gumshoe, after all, see? He's got to sound like one. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mouse screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What I really liked about the demo I saw of Mouse was that it wasn't just a mindless run-and-gun first-person shooter (not that there's anything wrong with that). Instead, the mission I saw part of was set at an opera house, where Pepper had to find and question the stage designer. We started at the back door, where we spoke to a waiter and asked about Roland, the aforementioned stage designer. He hasn’t seen him, so in we go to investigate for ourselves.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What I really liked about the demo I saw of Mouse was that it wasn't just a mindless run-and-gun first-person shooter.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Inside, the kitchen gives you a better look at the visual aesthetic at play here. Notice how the characters are 2D within the 3D space, not unlike the monsters in the original Doom. A peek through the porthole window of the kitchen door shows off one of Mouse’s detective-y features: reconnaissance, as Jack takes a photo and sees some members of the Big Mouse Party – aka not guys we want anything to do with.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving to the back of the kitchen, we meet up with a slick waiter who’s happy to help sneak us upstairs to where we need to go quietly – for $30. We decline the bribe and instead find a vent we can sneak through. A bonus stash of cash hiding in the vent is appreciated, but the bottom falling out of the vent, crash-landing us back outside where we started, is very much not appreciated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Attempt number two takes us back through the kitchen and into the same vent, carefully crawling around the newly made hole in the floor and taking us to the dressing room, where a Thompson machine gun and some ammo await. You’re not supposed to be in here, of course, and the Big Mouse Party members don’t take kindly to your presence. It’s here that we get our first look at the first-person shooter combat, including one of the gorgeous reload animations.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We hear a muffled voice that might be Roland, but first a safe gives us a chance to see the lockpicking minigame in action, along with what the safe was hiding: a cup of coffee? Then things get really loud, as the wall in front of us blows up and we have to snuff out the bad guy that emerges from the smoke before using TNT ourselves to make a hole in the floor so we can make our way down into the bowels of the opera house.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, we’ve found Roland. He’s been beaten up by the extras, who Jack deduces aren’t extras at all, and learns the Big Mouse Party’s real plan: to assassinate mayoral candidate Stilton, who’s sitting in the balcony for that evening’s show, during intermission, using the cannon on stage that is both full of live ammo and pointed directly at him. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast-forward to more combat, including the shotgun, which looks like it packs a nice wallop – and also has a pretty awesome reload animation of its own. Plus a look at explosive barrels that leave the bad guys burning in the most cartoonish way possible. There’s even an ice barrel – liquid nitrogen, perhaps? – that freezes nearby foes when detonated, allowing you to kick them so they shatter into a thousand pieces, Terminator 2-style. Moments later we also got a look at the third weapon featured in the demo: the turpentine gun, which melts these cartoon characters who are literally made of paint, not unlike the Dip from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The turpentine gun melts these cartoon characters who are literally made of paint, not unlike the Dip from Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After a bit of platforming and fighting a new helicopter-tailed enemy type, we found our way back upstairs…only to have a trap door below our feet open up, dumping us back into the basement. It’s here we meet the Old Rat Stuntman, who teaches Jack the double-jump maneuver. After testing it out and discovering a secret – a baseball trading card of “Brie” Ruth (get it, because they’re mice and love cheese?) – we find our way back on stage to sabotage the cannon and save Stilton, which triggers a boss battle with a raging opera performer. The turpentine gun finishes him off, and we get a look at its reload animation, which if you ask me is even cooler than the others we’ve already seen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The fire from the stage has spread to the rest of the opera house, and we’ve gotta get out of here. But we’re going to have to shoot our way out using every weapon at our disposal. No problem for Jack Pepper. Let’s watch some combat now, uninterrupted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally escaping the building, we meet up with the stage designer, who coughs up what he knows about the performer who’s vanished. Something about a secret lab underneath his mansion? No, that doesn’t sound suspicious at all… And with that, we exit the level and the demo ends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so, though I haven’t yet played it myself, from what I’ve seen of Mouse – and you just saw most of what I saw – I’m really eager to give it a try. It seems like it’s got the right lighthearted, somewhat comedic tone while also being self-aware but offering a solid first-person shooter at the core of it. After all, as gorgeous and admirable as its hand-drawn art and animation are, if the gameplay can’t back it up and also maintain my interest in it over the course of its campaign, then it won’t really matter how pretty it is. But at this point, I’m extremely optimistic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-x-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I play a lot of competitive shooters – and I mean <em>a lot</em> of competitive shooters. Whether it’s being an unfortunate son in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gray-zone-warfare-early-access-review"><u>Grey Zone Warfare</u></a>, flipping cards in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fragpunk-review"><u>FragPunk</u></a>, or smashing and grabbing  in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-finals-review"><u>The Finals</u></a>, this has been my default “gaming night with the friends” genre since I was in school many, many (many) years ago. And even after many thousands of hours spread across Destiny, Call of Duty, Halo Infinite, and Valorant, there is something about the action on the Rainbow Six series that stands out and just feels right. Now that Rainbow Six Siege is celebrating its tenth year with a massive new update in the form of Rainbow Six Siege X, it seems like a perfect time to reevaluate how this popular tactical shooter stands among its peers after a decade of tweaks, updates, and additions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fundamentals of Siege are as strong as ever, which is great to see. Bomb is the headliner mode: Two teams take turns on offense and defense trying to either fortify position and protect a bomb, or battle their way in to defuse it. That setup has been around for decades (and is also the core mode of games like Counter-Strike) but Siege’s distinctive entrenchment and destruction mechanics make its version stand out, and both sides of that coin are extremely fun. I love throwing down a bunch of temporary walls, setting up razor wire or other boobie traps, and getting ready to ambush attackers. And it’s just as satisfying on offense, knowing the other team has set up similar defenses, and blowing a wall open with some thermite to bypass all of it and get the drop on the enemy. The fast time-to-kill rewards position over twitch skill, and I appreciate the way the relatively slow aim-down-sites animation forces you to decide before a fight how you want to engage. This is a thinking man’s shooter, through and through. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The cast of playable characters is an impressive 75 Operators. Each has a different loadout and slightly unique playstyle, with half reserved for Attackers and the other playable only when you are on Defense. They do a great job catering to different playstyles, whether you want to smash through walls with your big hammer as Sledge, or dash around at high speed as Oryx. It is surprising that the Siege X update didn’t add anyone new to the roster, though we did get Rauora just a few months ago. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Dual Front mode hasn’t yet grown on me in the time I’ve spent with it so far.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to Bomb, Siege X adds a new 6v6 mode called Dual Front, but that one hasn’t yet grown on me in the time I’ve spent with it so far. Here, both teams have an area to attack and another to defend simultaneously. There are no restrictions on what type of character you can use, though only 37 of the 75 operators are eligible selections. The single available map is enormous, which, combined with the fast time-to-kill of Siege, means you tend to spend just a very small fraction of the match duration involved in actual action. Unlike in Bomb you can respawn after you die, which seems like it would make this a good mode for onboarding new players, but so far I feel like it really just takes away the pulse-pounding stakes that make Siege what it is. </p><div id="rank-rainbow-six-siege-xs-operators" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank Rainbow Six Siege X's Operators</h3><h3>Rank Rainbow Six Siege X's Operators</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Siege X is built around a limited free-to-play model. I say limited because, while you can absolutely play Siege X for free, it locks some key modes, like Ranked and Siege Cup, behind a paywall. You’ll need to spend around $20 USD if you want access to those. That seems like an odd choice for something that already has a robust shop and battle pass system for generating money, particularly when other popular games, like Marvel Rivals, don’t do any such segmentation between paid and unpaid players. The community has long been a bit weary of how slow progression and a protracted Operator unlock pace push people towards the paid battle pass, but with the revamps in Siege X I still need to spend more time unlocking things to get a feel for how much better or worse that has gotten. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>One of the hallmarks of Siege has always been the way you can punch through walls.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the hallmarks of Siege has always been the way you can punch through walls, breach barriers, or come crashing down through the ceiling into your assault, but that feels like it could’ve used an update for this relaunch. For all the walls you can Kool-Aid Man through, there are still a surprising amount of invincible barriers, like thick walls, certain window coverings, and any sort of furniture that make its destruction system less flexible than a more modern game might be. This is especially true on rooftop maps, which limit your options for a vertical breach to the small number of predetermined access points. Those limitations really stand out when other games that’ve come along since Siege first paved the way let you smash through almost anything. I’m not saying Siege needs to let you literally bring down the house, but the fact that I can’t throw some thermite under the bomb and drop it through the floor like I can with the bank in The Finals really sticks out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A decent audio system, especially headphones, has always been an advantage in Siege thanks to its outstanding sound design, and Siege X has noticeably improved it. Explosions and gunfire sound as great as ever, but it’s the ability to locate the general direction of sounds really impresses me. It’s always been handy for finding enemies trying to get the drop on you, but the revamped soundscape now feeds a lot more detail into it. The most significant difference I’ve heard is in footsteps above and below you – once you learn to recognize the difference between the boomy noise above versus the more hollowed-out sounds below you can start to close your eyes and pinpoint exactly where threats will come from, which is such a cool gameplay-based reward for paying attention to the details. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Justin's favorite multiplayer shooters</h3><p>Fragging is better with friends, and these are the best games for it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few other extremely situational upgrades I quite like. Rappelling is one of the most fun offensive options in Siege X: Hanging upside down like a tactical Spider-Man and getting the drop on enemies watching stairways and doors is supremely satisfying, though until now the actual usefulness in combat has always been somewhat limited. That’s because the rope has tended to leave you a sitting duck – or a pinata – if the enemy sees you. But new options to sprint along the wall or jump around corners means getting spotted isn’t instant death, and I’ve found myself using it a lot more as a result. On top of that, new destructible objects like gas pipes and fire extinguishers can be shot to create jets of flame or smoke. It’s extremely rare for that to matter in a fight, but it does have a very cool cinematic flair with just a touch of area control that I really appreciate. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All that said, I’m still early enough in my return to Siege that I’m not quite ready to render a final verdict on its new iteration. I can certainly say that Siege X is a lot of fun to play, and mastering every Operator will be enough to keep me busy for the long haul. I’m a big fan of most of the new additions like the improved sound design, more mobile rappelling, and destructible elements, though at this point I don’t know if Dual Front will be a destination mode – I need to give it more time to gel before I write it off. Overall, I think this a solid step forward that I’m eager to keep playing and evaluating, so stay tuned for the full review next week.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Earthquake’s Aftershocks hit hard, making them perfect for inflicting a large bleed on tankier enemies. Gladiator provides explosions thanks to Gratuitous Violence, and easy defenses through Block scaling nodes like More than Skill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe/build-guides/rolling-magma-mines-saboteur-league-starter" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rolling Magma Mine Saboteur</u></a> from Goratha is a hot league starter that unleashes bouncing balls of fiery destruction.

This mapping-focused build is all about going fast and clearing screens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maxroll’s Necromancer-in-Chief HelmBreaker has updated all 3 of his minion guides. The classic <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe/build-guides/poison-srs-necromancer-league-starter" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Poison Summon Raging Spirits</u></a> is still a great choice in 3.26. Alternatively, if you want to go all in on the minion fantasy, use the <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe/build-guides/chaos-minion-army-necromancer-league-starter" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Chaos Minion Army Necromancer</u></a> to roleplay as a battlefield commander while your mindless dead kill everything for you.

This setup from Crouching_Tuna gets you off to a strong start and can later be converted into Elemental Hit of the Spectrum.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If melee is more of your style, check out Carn’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe/build-guides/ground-slam-of-earthshaking-slayer-league-starter" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ground Slam of Earthshaking Slayer</u></a>, a titanic build designed to shatter foes with ease. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aer0’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe/build-guides/ice-trap-trickster-league-starter" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ice Trap Trickster</u></a> creates icy doughnuts of destruction, trapping monsters within an icy grave. While a bit less tanky than some of the above builds, Ice Trap is easy to get off the ground and frozen enemies can’t fight back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you prefer mines to Traps Aer0’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe/build-guides/ice-shot-of-penetration-miner-deadeye-league-starter" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ice Shot of Penetration Deadeye</u></a> is a glass cannon screen-clearing machine. Fire a barrage of icy arrows that explode into smaller projectiles, covering your screen in icy explosions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another miner on offer is the <a href="https://maxroll.gg/poe/build-guides/exsanguinate-miner-trickster-league-starter" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Exsanguinate Miner Trickster</u></a> from CptnGarbage.

The front is accented by glossy gold artwork, and the back is purple with "Thanos" written in large block letters across the center.</p><p>The face buttons are purple and gold (two of each), and the D-pad and triggers match the glossy gold accents. It comes with one purple stick and four gold sticks.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4513531-marvelcontrollers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4513531" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4513531-marvelcontrollers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4513531"></a><figcaption>GameSir G8 Plus Galileo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4513531-marvelcontrollers.jpg"></figure><p>The G8 Plus is equipped with Hall Effect sticks that feel smooth and precise. Hall Effect sensors are considered "anti-drift," so they should hold up well over time. The Joy-Con 2 Controllers have ALPS sticks, and some users have already started experiencing problems with drift.</p><p>As mentioned, there are several other features that make it a compelling option for Switch 2. It has a pair of remappable back buttons, one on each side, and a traditional D-pad. The back buttons can be remapped on the controller itself or in GameSir's mobile app.</p><p>It also has a 6-axis gyroscope for motion controls and rumble motors on each side. With a more traditional controller form factor, the G8 Plus has better ergonomics than the Joy-Con 2.</p><p>The face buttons have the Xbox Controller layout, so A/B and X/Y are flipped. By default, Nintendo consoles will register the buttons <em>as they are labeled</em>, which may confuse some players. But there are two solutions to this problem. The G8 Plus has hot-swappable face buttons and sticks, allowing users to remove the faceplate, pop off the button caps, and switch their positions. If you don't want to do this every time you switch between playing on mobile and Switch 2, you can enable "Switch mode" by holding the program button (M) and A. In this mode, the Switch registers A/B and X/Y as opposites.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4513536-gamesirg8plus.png" data-ref-id="1300-4513536" data-ratio="0.558" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4513536-gamesirg8plus.png" data-ref-id="1300-4513536"></a><figcaption>GameSir G8 Plus with Nintendo Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4513536-gamesirg8plus.png"></figure><p>Inside the box, you'll find three additional stick caps that can replace the traditional sticks that come preinstalled. The trio of alternatives includes a domed model, a tall stick for FPS games, and a short stick with a smaller cap. Speaking of FPS games, you can enable hair trigger mode, which actuates the right and left triggers with shorter pulls.</p><p>There are a couple potential downsides to keep in mind when using the G8 Plus with the Switch 2. While the grip holds the Switch 2 securely in place and has a rubberized bridge and pads on each side to help prevent scratches, it doesn't connect to the console like the Joy-Con controllers. When carrying the console around, you probably want to make sure you are holding the Switch 2 itself, not just the grip. Due to the Switch 2's size, the edges extend beyond the top and bottom of the grips, leaving them exposed. You may want to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=switch+2+protective+shell&amp;crid=2HOI563YOYZEL&amp;sprefix=switch+2+protective+shell%2Caps%2C88&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">add a protective shell to the Switch 2</a> when using the controller. Additionally, keep in mind that you will need to remove the Switch 2 from the cradle to dock it.</p><p>I often use the G8 Plus when gaming on iPhone. Platform versatility is a major perk here. It's inevitable that manufacturers will release handheld Switch 2 controllers, but it's unlikely many of them will work with other devices. So even if you wind up purchasing a different controller or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dbrands-nintendo-switch-2-killswitch-grip-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6532032/" data-ref-id="1100-6532032">adding an ergonomic grip to the console</a>, the G8 Plus doesn't need to collect dust. You can even use it as a wireless controller on Switch 2 (or Switch) when playing on your TV.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Marvel's Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering Preorders Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-bogo-50-off-movie-sale-includes-brand-new-4k-blu-ray-steelbooks-box-sets/1100-6529351/">Amazon BOGO 50% Off Movie Sale Includes Brand-New 4K Steelbooks &amp; Box Sets</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off-fantasy-sci-fi-horror-novel-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon B1G1 50% Off Book Sale - Popular New Novels, Box Sets, And All-Time Greats</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-nintendo-switch-2-controller-compatibility-how-to-guide-best-switch-2-controller-deals/1100-6532267/">8BitDo's Best Controllers Get Switch 2 Support - How To Set Them Up And Why It's A Big Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-5440-page-complete-history-of-middle-earth-box-set-is-only-106-at-amazon/1100-6526926/">The 5,440-Page Complete History Of Middle Earth Box Set Is Only $106 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-microsd-express-card-deals-nintendo-switch-2-samsung-sandisk-amazon-walmart/1100-6530578/">Walmart Has 512GB Switch 2 MicroSD Express Card For $65</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/">Nintendo Switch 2 Restocks - Where To Buy The New Console</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-dualsense-edge-ps5-controller-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet/1100-6531846/">DualSense Edge PS5 Controller Drops To Best-Ever Price For Days Of Play</a></li>   </ul> </div>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is having an incredible launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/">selling 3.5 million units</a> in just four days, and selling twice as fast as the original <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
<p>Adding to that incredible launch, Circana analyst and executive director <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrj7u74vi22v">Mat Piscatella just reported</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 set a new record for launch week sales in the US, selling 1.1 million units in its first week on the US market, which beat out the previous record holder, the PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>Piscatella also reported that <strong>79%</strong> of players who bought a Switch 2 during its launch week also bought Mario Kart World, either through the console bundle or separately. Cyberpunk 2077 and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom were the next two best-selling Switch 2 games behind Mario Kart World.</p>

<p lang="en">Nintendo Switch 2 set a new all-time launch week unit sales record for video game hardware in the US, with over 1.1 million units sold during the week ending June 7, 2025 (excludes sales from the My Nintendo Store). The record was previously held by PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x?ref_src=embed">Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3lrj7u74vi22v?ref_src=embed">2025-06-13T19:57:22.329Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Everyone expected the Switch 2's launch to be a major event for the year, but no one could have expected it to do this well so quickly. It'll be interesting to see how well sales keep pace throughout the rest of the year, and if the Switch 2 will be able to set even more records by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>While no one could have expected the Switch 2 to do this well, it's also not the biggest surprise. The new handheld has been extremely well-received by critics and fans alike. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">In his review, Wccftech's Chris Wray wrote</a>, "<em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is an excellent console, a clear upgrade from the Switch with some clear quality of life improvements. It also feels like a more professional console, with a larger screen, crisp and clear, and the ability to run up to 4K when docked. For all its benefits, of which there are many, this will be a console to buy</em>."</p>

Tabletop studio Maestro Media and developer Supercell have announced <em>Clash of Clans: The Epic Raid</em>, which will bring the comedic tactics game to gaming tables via a Kickstarter campaign this Summer.</p>

<h2><em>Clash of Clans: The Epic Raid</em> is Coming to Kickstarter</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Clash of Clans: The Epic Raid</em> will adapt the 2012 mobile game enjoyed by millions into a rewarding strategic tactics board game. Players will build bases, deploy troops, and raid opponents in fast-paced battles designed to capture the excitement of the source material.</p>

The game will include miniatures of different <em>Clash of Clans</em> units and outposts. The map will be composed of hexagonal tiles. There is even some resource management elements used for building defenses and recruiting new units.</p>

<p>The lead designers of <em>Clash of Clans: The Epic Raid</em> are Eric M. Lang and Ken Gruhl. Lang is an award-winning board game designer who has a history of adapting beloved video game properties to the tabletop format.

With the game just a few months away from release, the development team at Gearbox Software has created a new YouTube show, Beyond the Borderlands, to chronicle its progress. And the first episode focuses on what it takes to create a memorable <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-all-vault-hunters-classes-skills/2900-6583/" data-ref-id="2900-6583">vault hunter</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBouTQJONGw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mBouTQJONGw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"We want them to be somebody that players and ourselves can relate to," explained art director Adam May. "A comic book [hero] is frequently a good reference point for us. You want to get something that feels familiar and play as somebody [you] actually want to be in real life. It starts with the ideation of trying to define and decipher what kind of fantasies we want to build for players."</p><p>The team also explained that pitches for new vault hunters come in from all over the company, and sometimes character pitches are combined into new combinations. According to lead character designer Nick Thurston, "The guiding principle of Borderlands, just in general, is just to be badass. The abilities, the gear, everything; it all has to be the things that our community expects. They can be from any walk of life. They can bring anything to the table, but ultimately they have to be cool and they have to be fun to play."</p><p>The price for Borderlands 4 hasn't been announced yet, but Gearbox Software boss Randy Pitchford caused some controversy when he suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/real-fans-will-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen-if-borderlands-4-costs-80-says-randy-pitchford/1100-6531677/" data-ref-id="1100-6531677">"real fans"</a> will find a way to come up with $80 to buy it, if it costs that much. Pitchford subsequently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-says-he-didnt-mean-to-trigger-people-with-comments-on-the-price/1100-6531910/" data-ref-id="1100-6531910">walked that statement back a bit</a>.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will hit PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on September 12. A port will also be released on Nintendo Switch 2 at a later date.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> may be Nintendo Switch 2's headlining attraction, the most alluring part of the system's launch lineup for Olds like me is its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/">GameCube library</a>. After more than 20 years, Nintendo has finally decided to crack open its vaults and bring some of GameCube's most-beloved titles to a modern console--the first time most of these games will be available officially since their original release.</p><p dir="ltr">For many, however, the excitement over GameCube titles was quickly tempered by the fact that a meager <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-get-gamecube-games-through-nintendo-switch-online-new-gamecube-controller/1100-6530559/">three are available at the outset</a>--the thinnest selection any Switch Online classics library has launched with. But as frustrating as it may feel to have to wait for more games to hit the service, this methodical rollout has long been an intentional strategy on Nintendo's part, and it took me many years to understand and appreciate its benefits.</p><p dir="ltr">This slow release cadence is hardly exclusive to the Switch Online service. Ever since Nintendo first established its own digital storefront with the Wii Shop, the company has been deliberately measured when re-releasing its legacy titles. In the lead up to the Wii's launch, Nintendo touted its digital shop as a repository of classics--a place where players could easily purchase the best Nintendo games of yesteryear and play them alongside new releases on one system. And indeed, by the end of the Wii's life, more than 400 had made their way to the Wii Shop, giving Wii owners access to a wealth of beloved games from years past.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4513506-6734618043-22653.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4513506" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4513506-6734618043-22653.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4513506"></a><figcaption>The biggest draw of the Wii Shop was being able to purchase games from older consoles, but Nintendo's own classics arrived sporadically.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4513506-6734618043-22653.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That was certainly not the case at launch, however. While a selection of older games was available right from day one, the early offerings left much to be desired. The Wii Shop launched with fewer than a dozen first-party titles, most of which were Nintendo Entertainment System games from back in the 1980s and 1990s. Anyone eager to revisit a particular classic such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/" data-ref-id="5000-1272">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> was out of luck; the only Nintendo 64 title available at the outset was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-64/" data-ref-id="5000-2007">Super Mario 64</a>, and it would be months before more N64 games arrived.</p><p dir="ltr">This trickle of games was even more exasperating on the Wii U. After spending the previous six years steadily amassing a respectable selection of Virtual Console games on the Wii, Nintendo effectively wiped the slate clean when launching the Wii U eShop. Since the extant Virtual Console lineup was incompatible with Wii U's GamePad controller, Nintendo decided to release new versions of these games tailored specifically to the system--which meant the company once again would be building up its retro catalog from scratch.</p><p dir="ltr">To Nintendo's credit, it did take steps to mitigate the inconvenience for users. Wii owners had the option to transfer their system data--including their Virtual Console collection--to the Wii U, so customers weren't forced to buy their games a second time. The Wii Shop was still accessible on the new console as well, although it was nested within the separate Wii menu. Thus, any games purchased from it (or transferred over from a Wii) had to live within a separate user interface and could not take advantage of Wii U features like off-TV play. Even more notably, Nintendo also offered an upgrade path for returning users. If you previously purchased a Virtual Console game on the Wii, you could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wii-u-virtual-console-getting-n64-and-nintendo-ds-/1100-6426337/">upgrade to the Wii U version</a> of the same title for a small fee.</p><p dir="ltr">As welcome as these steps were, however, they were once again undermined by Nintendo's slow release schedule. The Wii U eShop launched with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/nintendo-announces-launch-lineup-for-virtual-console-on-wii-u/" rel="nofollow ">just eight Virtual Console games</a>, the biggest of which was Super NES launch title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-world/" data-ref-id="5000-3700">Super Mario World</a>. It would take another several months for other classics like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past/" data-ref-id="5000-4617">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-metroid/" data-ref-id="5000-17693">Super Metroid</a> to hit the storefront, while N64 games wouldn't arrive until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wii-u-virtual-console-getting-n64-and-nintendo-ds-/1100-6426337/" data-ref-id="1100-6426337">two years later</a>. Nintendo did ramp up the rate of releases as the Wii U struggled to gain traction, and the eShop eventually offered Game Boy Advance, DS, and even Wii titles, giving it an even broader range of Nintendo classics than the Wii Shop ever boasted. Still, the paltry early lineup, coupled with Wii U's frequent software droughts, made the wait for a particular game excruciating.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4513509-4972425557-maxre.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4513509" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4513509-4972425557-maxre.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4513509"></a><figcaption>Game Boy Advance games didn't start hitting the Wii U eShop until a year after the system's first Virtual Console titles launched.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4513509-4972425557-maxre.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Given this history, then, it was not unexpected to see Nintendo continue this strategy on the Switch. With the advent of the Switch Online service, the company has opted to take a different approach to repackaging its legacy games, offering players access to a growing library of them for a subscription fee rather than selling each title individually on the eShop. But though the delivery model may be different, the pace of releases remains just as languid.</p><p dir="ltr">Early adopters had to endure a lengthy wait before the first Nintendo classics appeared on the system. The Switch Online service did not launch until 2018, more than a year after the Switch itself hit the market, and the only titles available at the outset were, once again, NES games. It would take several more years for Nintendo to gradually introduce SNES and Game Boy libraries to the base Switch Online service, while a premium Switch Online + Expansion Pack plan launched in 2021 and offered N64, Sega Genesis, and eventually Game Boy Advance titles as well.</p><p dir="ltr">As frustrating as it has been to see Nintendo repeat this slow rollout, its advantages have become much clearer in the Switch era. Most obviously, Nintendo often uses classic games to fill in any gaps in its release calendar. While titles are added to Switch Online fairly regularly, the company likes to trot out a particularly beloved game when there is little else on the way to the console, ensuring users remain engaged even during quieter months. The wait between releases is also more bearable when there's a library of other titles to sample in the meantime. A curio like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/devil-world/" data-ref-id="5000-12883">Devil World</a> may not be attractive enough on its own to convince someone to plunk down $5, but it's much more enticing to try when it's part of a service you are already paying for.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1977821385" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

savor each of these titles for the classics they are. With the sheer number of games available to play nowadays (and the increasing prominence of subscription services offering access to them), many publishers and platform holders have come to treat gaming as disposable entertainment. By overwhelming their audience with options, companies are implicitly encouraging players to only dabble in a game and then move on to the next whenever the fancy strikes. This inexhaustible array of choices means few users actually play a game to completion before their attention is diverted to another one. In contrast, by doling out only a handful of legacy games every month, Nintendo positions each as a noteworthy release in its own right, while also giving players ample time to experience it before more arrive.</p><p dir="ltr">This is especially relevant for GameCube games. Whereas NES and even SNES titles can often be completed in a handful of hours, N64 and GameCube games are much closer in depth and duration to modern titles and require a much more significant time investment to play. Many can take more than 20 hours to finish, which makes Nintendo's decision to space them apart a boon to players. As eager as I am to revisit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fire-emblem-path-of-radiance/" data-ref-id="5000-20450">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> for the first time in two decades when it eventually joins the service, it's been nice to leisurely devote my attention to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker/" data-ref-id="5000-3301">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>--the only single-player adventure currently in Switch Online's GameCube lineup--in the interim.</p><p dir="ltr">Although it's undoubtedly still aggravating to wait for a particular favorite to hit the service, Nintendo's methodical drip-feed of classics has its merits. By meting out its legacy games gradually, Nintendo gives players enough time to properly delve into and appreciate them, which in turn preserves the allure of these games and makes their eventual arrival feel like a significant occasion. More than other publishers, Nintendo understands the value of its vast back catalog and treats it with the reverence and care these titles deserve. And unlike on Wii and Wii U, there's no shortage of other games to tide fans over while they wait for their favorite classic to arrive.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-more-than-doubles-sonys-previous-steam-ccu-record-for-single-player-games/">Stellar Blade</a> has been a huge success for its independent developer, Shift Up, which was previously a mobile game developer before it embarked on making a triple-A action game. With a sequel confirmed to be on the way, and Shift Up still working on the mobile series that helped grow the studio in the first place, the future should be incredibly bright for Shift Up.</p>
<p>And it largely still is, but some of the company's investors are fearful that Shift Up could lose its independence, putting a fog over the future of the studio and its current path. According to a report from the South Korean publication <a href="https://g-enews.com/article/ICT/2025/04/202504141448301089c5fa75ef86_1">Global Economic</a> (spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-studio-shift-ups-independence-at-risk-due-to-tencent-ties-investors-fear/">Automaton</a>), Shift Up's investors are concerned with how narrow the split is between Shift Up chief executive officer Hyung-Tae Kim's shares and Tencent's.</p>
<p>Hyung-Tae Kim currently owns 39% of the studio, while Tencent is just under 5% behind him, owning 34.58% of Shift Up. The concern is that Tencent could overtake Hyung-Tae Kim by buying up more shares, and combined with the fact that Tencent is the company Shift Up works with to publish its mobile games, the studio could lose its power to make decisions for itself.</p>
<p>Tencent has been making strategic investments in companies across the video game industry for years now, with their fingers in the pies of studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">Ubisoft</a>,<a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-is-getting-a-e15-million-loan-from-tencent/"> Remedy</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-china-tencent/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-become-funcoms-largest-single-shareholder/">Funcom</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-has-increased-its-stake-in-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-edging-closer-to-sonys-share/">FromSoftware's parent company Kadokawa</a>. In the case of Riot Games, Tencent outright <a href="http://wccftech.com/tencent-buys-the-rest-of-riot-games-owns-league-of-legends-maker-outright/">bought the studio after consistently increasing its stake</a>.</p>
<p>It's still too early to tell if Shift Up is in real trouble of being acquired by Tencent, but considering that Tencent is a key factor in Shift Up's revenue through the studio's mobile games, and how close Tencent is to being the studio's largest shareholder, it does feel like Tencent is primed to add Shift Up to its internal portfolio of studios.</p>
