              <p>Nintendo has dominated portable gaming with the Switch 2, but Sony finally offers a compelling alternative for PlayStation owners who want their games on the go. The company built an empire around the PS5 as a living room powerhouse and the <strong>PS Portal extends that experience beyond the couch and into your hands</strong>.</p>
<p>This device <strong>streams your entire PS5 library to a beautiful 8-inch screen</strong>, and lets you play God of War or Spider-Man anywhere in your home or via cloud gaming on the move. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/">dropped it to $179 for Black Friday, down from $199</a>. That’s a record low, one which already moved over 8,000 units and counting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>PS5 Games to Your Hands</h2>
<p>The <strong>full HD 1080p display stretches across 8 inches of screen</strong> real estate, creating an immersive portable gaming experience. You see game details clearly with vibrant colors and sharp text, making even busy action sequences easy to keep track of. Screen brightness handles a wide range of lighting conditions, from dimly lit bedrooms to bright living rooms.</p>
<p>The<strong> 60fps capability</strong> ensures smooth gameplay that matches what you experience on your TV. Frame rates stay locked during intense action sequences, maintaining the responsive feel that PS5 games deliver on the console itself. The visual quality impresses given the streaming nature of the device, with minimal compression artifacts during stable WiFi connections.</p>



<p><em>Remote Play</em> <strong>connects directly to your PS5 console over WiFi</strong>, and streams games installed on your system to the portable device. You play your whole digital and disc library without buying games a second time or waiting for separate downloads. The PS5 does all the processing while the Portal displays the video output and transmits your controller inputs back. The upside of this is that you get complete PS5 graphics instead of downgraded portable versions.</p>
<p>The <strong>cloud streaming through Playstation Plus Premium</strong> unlocks gaming without needing your PS5 powered on: you access hundreds of titles from the Game Catalog and Classics Catalog streamed directly to the device. Select PS5 games from your digital library stream sans downloads, affording instant access to big titles wherever decent internet is found.</p>



<p>The<strong> features of the DualSense controller integrate</strong> directly into the Portal’s design: haptic feedback and adaptive triggers are built into the grips. You feel immersive sensations, from terrain textures to weapon recoil, the same as the standard PS5 controller. A familiar button layout means PlayStation players don’t need an adjustment period. The ergonomic design spreads the weight comfortably during long play sessions.</p>
<p>Tempest 3D AudioTech provides for spatial sound through the headphone jack or wirelessly via Playstation Link compatible devices. You really hear enemies coming from specific directions and environmental audio placed precisely in three-dimensional space. This audio quality adds a layer of immersion that most portable gaming devices lack. The experience approaches what you’d get through a proper home theater setup, compressed into a personal audio bubble.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life reaches several hours</strong> of continuous play and sees you through extended gaming sessions without the need for a charge. USB-C charging makes use of standard cables you already own, ensuring that topping up from portable batteries or wall chargers is a breeze. The device goes into sleep mode fast when you pause a game to conserve battery life for when you return.</p>
<p>At $179, you’re getting a premium portable streaming device with DualSense features and an 8-inch display for 10% off. The Switch 2 costs significantly more while running native games at lower graphical fidelity than streamed PS5 titles.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has announced "Teammates", an "AI experiment to change the game" and "deepen the player experience".</p>
<p>The developer/publisher said the project is "more than just talk" and will add "depth to gameplay by going beyond AI chatbots and turning NPCs into real teammates" as you play a first-person shooter.</p>
<p>The reveal comes after Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot told investors yesterday that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-believes-generative-ai-is-as-big-a-revolution-for-games-as-the-shift-to-3d-as-tech-is-embraced-company-wide">generative AI has been integrated across the entire company</a>, calling it a "revolution" for video games as big as the shift from 2D to 3D.</p>

<p>"First and foremost, Teammates is an experimental research project, albeit a playable one," Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/3mWlITIuWuu0MoVuR6o8ps">explained</a>. "Built around the mechanics of a first-person shooter, players take on the role of a member of the resistance in a dystopian future, tasked with moving through an enemy base to locate five missing members of their team.</p><p>"In the short playable level, players must recover the final memories of those who were sent in previously to discover their fates, while fending off squads of enemies along their path. Besides the AI voice assistant – Jaspar – the player is accompanied by two NPC squad members – Pablo and Sofia – also featuring the new advanced capabilities."</p>
<p>AI assistant Jaspar can highlight enemies or objects, provide story and lore details, alter game settings "on the fly", or even pause the game, all through simple and natural vocal instructions.</p>
<p>"But more than this, he is a dynamic and responsive character within the story," the company added. "The underlying systems can process the information available within the Teammates experiment’s environment, and contextual cues, interpreting and adapting to the player’s vocal input and actions."</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Today we’re unveiling Teammates, an AI-driven research project exploring how new tech can deepen the player experience.</p><p>More than just talk, this brand-new experiment adds depth to gameplay by going beyond AI chatbots and turning NPCs into real teammates. Find out more:… <a href="https://t.co/SyISwjJ5af">pic.twitter.com/SyISwjJ5af</a></p></div>— Ubisoft (@Ubisoft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1991930899252810021?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>

<p>You can also directly command - or "chat with" - your NPC teammates, Sofia and Pablo.</p>
<p>"Our early experiments showed players were quickly connecting with the AI-driven NPCs and the voice assistant concept," director of gameplay GenAI Xavier Manzanares added.</p>
<p>"Jaspar was helping players when they got lost or weren’t sure what to do, he could access menus and settings, tell players more about the world and the story. We really started to like Jaspar and saw how a system like this could be interesting for many different kinds of games."</p><p>“This technology opens doors to new, personalised experiences,” added data &amp; AI director Rémi Labory. “Player input shapes character reactions in real time, something traditional development can’t achieve. We’re also delivering a full pipeline, with the experience taking players from onboarding to debrief, which is a first.”</p>
<p>The team said it was "aware of the criticisms around AI in games", but insisted the goal "is not to replace creatives, but rather to find ways to enhance it by combining the strengths of the technology and the human creativity and ingenuity that are crucial to making games".</p>
<p>"At first, I had the same concerns as many others," explained narrative director Virginie Mosser. "But I discovered that it’s the exact opposite of removing the human from the process. I still write the story and character personalities, but instead of fixed lines, we create these kinds of fences that let NPCs improvise within the world but stay within the boundaries of the lore and motivations we have given them. They can improvise, but we still set the rules and direct the story and characters."</p>
<p>Ubisoft finished by saying that "Teammates" has already been shared with a few hundred players in a closed playtest. It will continue to test and develop the technology, "building the tools and gathering vital reactions and suggestions from real players and creative teams within Ubisoft to refine and expand the systems they have built, all with a philosophy of human creativity, ingenuity, and curiosity at the heart of their work".</p>
<p>This news follows the cessation of trading for Ubisoft, which sent the entire industry into mass speculation. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-116bn-tencent-investment-into-assassins-creed-maker-is-on-track-following-last-weeks-surprise-delay-to-financial-report">Ubisoft later confirmed that this was due to an issue with new auditors</a>, despite broad speculation of a grander acquisition.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, the estimated digital file sizes for the Switch and Switch 2 Edition of Samus' long-awaited adventure have also gone live on the eShop and official Nintendo website. So, if you didn't already know, here's what you can expect:</p>
<h3>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Estimated File Size<br></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>- Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (Switch) - <strong>28.9 GB</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>- Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition - <strong>31.6 GB</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Of course, these sizes are still classed as an "estimate" at the moment and are subject to change before and after release, depending on the patches and updates distributed. The eShop also has Metroid Prime 4's Upgrade Pack listed as <strong>1.5 GB</strong>.</p>
<p>In comparison, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> (based on the first Prime entry) is just under 7 GB according to the Switch eShop.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/metroid-prime-4-beyond-will-be-a-cross-gen-title-for-switch-2">previously confirmed</a>, the Switch 2 version of Metroid Prime 4 supports higher resolution, faster frame rates, HDR and mouse controls. When in docked mode, players can choose from 4K at 60fps (quality) or 1080p at 120fps (performance). And in handheld/tabletop mode, the options are 1080p at 60fps (quality) and 720p at 120fps (performance).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has unveiled Teammates, a short playable experience powered by generative AI. It was developed by the team behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-blows-up-at-gdc-2024-between-ubisofts-neo-npcs-xboxs-narrative-graph-tool-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024's Neo NPC demo</a>, which was recently honored under the France 2030 program for advancing French innovation.</p>



<p>In the initial prototype from 2024, Neo NPCs demonstrated novel cognitive and natural language abilities, but they were still confined to a static environment. In Teammates, Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) are placed in a traditional first-person shooter setting and are equipped with advanced AI features. This allows them to respond dynamically to real-time voice commands, adapt their behaviour to each situation, and reveal their distinct personalities.</p>



<p>From mission briefings to battlefield commands, they react naturally, adapting to players' strategies, moods, and even personal slang. Ubisoft states that NPCs can interpret player intent and tone, as well as environmental cues, generating fluid, context-aware reactions that enhance immersion and player agency.</p>



<p>Virginie Mosser, Narrative Director on the project at Ubisoft, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>It’s really about experimenting with entirely new ways of creating interactive stories. Our role is to give AI meaning, to narrativise it, ensuring logic doesn’t replace soul. We designed Teammates to leave space for player creativity, finding that balance between emotion and unpredictability.</em></p>



<p>Ubisoft also showed a new in-game companion called Jaspar, a personal assistant designed to support players throughout their missions. Jaspar recognises players by name, assists with onboarding and understands the game's lore. He can also highlight threats or key objects in the environment, remind players of their mission objectives, suggest next steps, and act as a tactical guide when they are unsure what to do. The companion even has the ability to manage HUD elements, open menus, and adjust settings.</p>

<p>The Teammates experiment serves both as a playable prototype and a testbed for the underlying technology. Xavier Manzanares, Director of Gameplay GenAI at Ubisoft, explained:</p>



<p><em>Games of tomorrow will listen, understand and react to players far more than today, and our research gives a glimpse of what adaptive, generative play could add on top of proven game systems. It’s the first time we’ve shared an experiment this early with players, but our goal is to pave the way with a strong technology layer so our creators can start imagining the value it could bring to their project and players.</em></p>



<p>The team has also built an API that abstracts the complexity of generative systems, embeds necessary guardrails, including hallucinations, bias, toxicity, among others, and helps control its power to put it at the service of human creativity and play.</p>



<p>In the press releases accompanying Teammates, Ubisoft co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot stated that creativity will remain 'deeply human', with AI tools only helping to bring creative visions to life in new ways. </p>



<p>But in the quarterly earnings call, Guillemot added: </p>



<p><em>We are making great strides in applying GenAI to high-value use cases, delivering tangible benefits to our players and teams. It's as big a revolution for our industry as the shift to 3D, and we have everything to lead on this front.</em></p>



<p>It's probably going to be a while before we see this technology applied to actual games. However, Teammates has already been shared with a few hundred players in a closed playtest. The team behind the experience will continue to test, build tools, and gather feedback and suggestions from real players and creative teams within Ubisoft to refine and expand these systems. An explainer video is also coming soon for those who'd like to see it in action.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>The end of 2025 is fast approaching, so I've found myself going back to some of this year's releases to see which games might make their way into my top five. It was perhaps a mistake to boot up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>, however, as those who have played it will know what an absolute monster it is. Maybe I'll put a few hours into it before moving on to something else, we'll see...</p>
<p>I've also recently gone back to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/evil_within">The Evil Within</a> on the PS5. I can't believe it's over ten years old already! I do really love it though, even if it doesn't quite reach the lofty heights of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>.<br>
Happy gaming, folks!</p>

<p>The <em>tap, tap, tap</em> of 2026 on my door has kicked me into gear to finally finish <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. I am about 15-20 hours in, and boy, do I feel pain. It's a lot — like, <em>a lot</em> — but I haven't been this all-consumed by a game in a long old time.</p>
<p>I'm breaking up my Lumière sad times with the odd run of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>, which has also proven to be right up my street. Karl has been my go-to for longer runs so far, but I am becoming increasingly attached to my beloved frog wizard, Brome, and his adorable little animations. Let's hope I can get at least one run wrapped up before a certain space bounty hunter zooms into view next month.</p>

<p>With GOTY approaching, I'm in catch-up mode. This weekend, I'll be carrying on with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a>, and hopefully returning to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a>. Non-2025, I've also dipped back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID</a> recently. How I wish Nintendo would put analogue triggers back in their controllers!</p>
<p>Not 'playing', but game-related, I'm eager to catch up with the movie-length <a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2WDfsiLiRA" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2WDfsiLiRA" rel="noopener noreferrer">NES 40th anniversary Portland Retro Gaming Expo panel</a> which went up earlier in November. And news of Rebecca Heineman's passing had me looking back over 40+ years of her work, so the 3DO port of Doom and <a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbIil2HPSU" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBbIil2HPSU" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burgertime videos</a> are calling. <a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://bsky.app/profile/textfiles.com/post/3m5ugvjyzkk2m" href="https://bsky.app/profile/textfiles.com/post/3m5ugvjyzkk2m" rel="noopener noreferrer">F cancer, indeed</a>.</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<div><p>A couple of Steam releases caught my eye this weekend, and I do hope to see them both on consoles down the line. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1710820/Cleared_Hot/">Cleared Hot</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2105620/Sektori/">Sektori</a> are the spiritual sequels you never knew you needed to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/desert_strike_return_to_the_gulf">Desert Strike</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/geometry_wars_galaxies">Geometry Wars</a>, respectively. Princess woes continue with both Zelda and Melinoë still at odds with Ganon and Chronos (and Typhon, I guess) in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> (now in physical cartridge glory, hurrah!) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. I do hope I get to tackle more of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>, it is one of the biggest surprises of the year IMO. In the middle of all this, I feel a lot of folks are overlooking a stellar Switch release that was nearly my game of the week if not for a certain pink ball: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/neon_inferno">Neon Inferno</a>. I have been eagerly waiting for this one for some time now, and it is delivering on every front.</p><p>

Game of the week is, without surprise, Kirby Air Riders. I know the original GameCube title (which is on my shelf) didn’t really raise many eyebrows back in 2003, but I am hopeful a lot more people get to slide around with it this time. It is another finely crafted SORA masterpiece that will certainly keep yours truly occupied until December arrives.</p></div>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I found a very neat game on Steam called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3503440/Astro_Prospector/">Astro Prospector</a>. It's about £5. Maybe less. And it's brilliant — this little snack-sized incremental game that's all about shooting asteroids and dodging bullets. Think <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cobalt_core">Cobalt Core</a> meets <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> with coffee theming.</p>
<p>Other than that, still plugging away at Hades II! I stopped for a while to let the ending get patched and to help judge an indie game competition (which is where I discovered Astro Prospector), but now both of those are done, I'm back on the grind. I'm not rushing towards the ending just yet, as I'm having more fun trying out silly builds and unlocking new weapons, and after that, I might move on to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, since I'm hearing good buzz about it (and the new <strong>Monster Factory</strong> episodes have me wanting to play <strong>Fallout</strong>-type games again).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the North they come, via the sea. For pillage, plunder, and slaughter, before disappearing back across the ocean, leaving the survivors to pick up again amongst the destruction. But the last few times have been different, and warriors have remained and are pushing further and further South, and they will continue to do so unless someone pushes them back into the ocean. The Chaos Marauders have arrived with the <em>Warhammer The Old World</em> Chaos Marauders Reinforcement Set. In this article, we'll have a look at the boxed set and the&nbsp;Arcane Journal: The Razing of Westerland supplement that contains their rules.</p>

<p><i>Warhammer The Old World </i>is a rank and flank wargame, brought back from retirement and based on the original <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy tabletop game after Games Workshop changed the setting into the current <em>Age of Sigmar</em>. You can check out our review of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-old-world-review-hit-refresh" rel="nofollow">Warhammer The Old World Starter Set</a> that launched the release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-2.jpg?itok=DuLOSkZB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-2.jpg?itok=uD0DAF_W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Warhammer The Old World</em> Chaos Marauders Reinforcement Set contains 50 miniatures to expand or begin your invasion force.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Components of Conquest</h2>

<p>To celebrate the release of the new Chaos Marauders miniatures, Games Workshop is launching them with a Reinforcement Set that contains:</p>

<ul><li>40x Chaos Marauder miniatures that can be built as 2 units of 20, or 4 units of 10, each with a headman (champion), standard bearer, and musician, and they can be armed with either&nbsp;hand weapons and shields, great weapons, or flails.</li>
	<li>10x Chaos Marauder Horesmen that can be built as 1 unit of 10, or 2 units of 5, each with a horsemaster (champion), musician, and standard bearer, and they can be armed with either cavalry spears, or flails.</li>
	<li>2x new Warriors of Chaos transfer sheets, each containing 246 Norscan tribes icons and rune decals.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-3.jpg?itok=Faas2KC5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-3.jpg?itok=JERmuLXY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new command units for the Chaos Marauders really stand out against the rest of the unit.</figcaption></figure><p>The multitude of weaponry and head options means that you can create several unique-looking units with the set, and the option to have all units (6 if split into their smallest forms) with a champion, standard bearer, and musician is great for optionality. The Chaos Marauders are also now on 30x30mm bases (25x25mm base before), which they fill, so they look a lot more beefier than before, accurately reflecting the battle-hardened warriors that they are. I love the Marauder standard bearer with axe, he looks like an absolute unit, only held back from devastating his enemies because he's carrying a huge banner.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-5.jpg?itok=5WUoq2nc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-the-old-world-chaos-marauders-reinforcement-set-5.jpg?itok=prLCd6iB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new Arcane Journal has the rules and background for the Chaos Marauders, and an awesome Path to Glory campaign for them.</figcaption></figure><h2>Rules Of The Arcane</h2>

<p>The new&nbsp;Arcane Journal: The Razing of Westerland, sold separately from the Mauraduers Reinforcement set, but containing their profiles, fits alongside the <em>Warhammer The Old World</em> Ravening Hordes rules for making your Warriors of Chaos army, supplementing and replacing some rules.</p>

<p>The book starts by detailing Frydaal the Chainmaker’s invasion of Westerland, along with a map of the invasion and background on the Marauder tribes and their 4 cults. It also includes a Path to Glory campaign, where players start with a small force and build up to full-sized armies over several linked games. You will need the Arcane Journal: The War of Settra’s Fury book as well, which details how to play the smaller-scale games that make up the first few campaign games. To supplement the campaign, the Razing of Westerland contains 3 scenarios that you can use in your Path to Glory campaign, reenacting&nbsp;the Chainmaker’s early battles in Westerland.</p>

<p>Arcane Journal: The Razing of Westerland also includes new profiles for Chaos Marauders and Marauder Horsemen, which replace those in Ravening Hordes. The main change is taking away the option to take a Chaos god mark and changing it to a mark of 1 of 4 Chaos Cults, either the Bloodied Hound, Carrion Crow, Slithering Serpent, or Fell Raptor. I prefer the Cult of the&nbsp;Bloodied Hound, which can gain the Marauders a +1 boost to their weapon skill once per game by passing a leadership test in the command phase, because if Chaos Marauders aren't attacking, what are they doing?</p>

<p>The journal also has a new magic lore for Chaos Sorcerers, Lore of the Shadowlands, which has spells like Shadowed Assailants, that deals 3D6 strength 1 hits to an enemy the caster is engaged with, with no armor or regeneration save allowed. The book closes with 18 new magic items that can be used by any Old World army.</p>

<p>The new Chaos Marauders and Marauder Horsemen miniatures are fantastic, and really capture the frozen waste barbarian nature of the warriors. The Chaos Marauders Reinforcement Set is a great way to start or expand your force with them, containing either 3 large units or 6 smaller ones, with full optionality, no matter how you spread your units. The Arcane Journal: The Razing of Westerland has some great background, and the Path to Glory campaign feels very in keeping with the Chaos Marauders campaign as they ravage Westerland. The new Cult and Chaotic Traits also allow you to flesh out your forces a lot more, giving some real individuality to your units and flexibility on the battlefield.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Swedish developer Fatshark is getting ahead of Black Friday sales by offering Warhammer: Vermintide 2 completely free to keep <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/552500/Warhammer_Vermintide_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>. If you add it to your library before November 24 at 10 AM Pacific Time, you'll keep it forever.</p>



<p>The promotion is part of the so-called '10 Years of Tide', the event that celebrates the tenth anniversary of the release of the first Vermintide game. For its part, the second franchise entry, launched seven years ago, has since more than doubled its original release content through free updates, DLCs, and major additions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/chaos-wastes-free-expansion-adds-rogue-lite-elements-to-vermintide-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chaos Wastes</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-gets-versus-mode-with-4v4-battles-and-several-characters-to-choose-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Versus</a>.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Fatshark released a free new map called "Return to the Reik," a beloved location from the first game that has been reimagined in Warhammer: Vermintide 2. River Reik returns with expanded, boat-focused gameplay that puts deck skirmishes front and center. Players will battle their way across swaying platforms, using the barge and riverbank environments to transform every encounter into a cinematic co-op spectacle.</p>



<p>This mission is a reimagining of the Warhammer: End Times Vermintide's popular level, blending nostalgia with deliberate changes and new encounters. Fatshark says they added new routes and set-piece moments, as well as boat props, to give the River Reik mission a distinct Vermintide 2 flavour, while maintaining the core story elements. The result, according to the studio, is a familiar yet surprising experience that will reward Ubersreik Five veterans and invite newcomers to discover a classic in a new light.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The studio's most recent game, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, is also part of the 10 Years of Tide campaign. As announced this week, the game will be updated with the new (and free) Hive Scum class on December 2. Hive Scum is a class that focuses on dual-wield expertise thanks to twin‑wield pistols and dual-wielding shivs. The December 2 update will also introduce a new Operation mission set in the trenches of Atoma, as well as a new time-limited special event in Darktide.</p>

<p>With this in mind, the latest one is now live and it offers up a Whimsicott based on the same one used by Federico Camporesi to win the 2025 Pokémon North America International Championships (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://x.com/SerebiiNet/status/1991841929357893758">Serebii.net</a>).

<p>The same titles are currently giving trainers the opportunity to catch a Goodra with the Mightiest Mark. This event is now underway and will repeat on 28th November - 30th November 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon loves to push its own brands during Black Friday, and the Echo Dot always gets the deepest cuts. By selling these smart speakers at razor-thin margins-or even at a loss-Amazons ensures Alexa finds her way into as many American homes as possible. The strategy works brilliantly for the company, but it also gives shoppers some incredible deals. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">newest Echo Dot now drops from $49 to just $31</a> which is a record low price found only on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Best Sounding Echo Dot Ever Made</h2>
<p>Amazon says this is the <strong>best-sounding Echo Dot they’ve ever made</strong>, and the difference is actually appreciable: clearer vocals, deeper bass, and altogether punchier sound well above its weight class. Music fills a bedroom or office surprisingly well for something this small. Previous Echo Dot generations sounded thin and tinny in comparison. The audio upgrade alone justifies replacing older models you might have scattered around the house.</p>



<p><strong>Alexa integration</strong> makes this speaker a genuinely useful daily assistant: ask for the weather while you get dressed, set timers while you cook, or get quick answers to random questions throughout the day. The voice recognition works reliably from across the room, even with music playing. You can even tap the top to snooze your morning alarm when you need a few extra minutes.</p>
<p>Music streaming connects to all of the services you probably already use. <strong>Amazon Music, Apple Music, Spotify, among others, all work seamlessly through voice commands</strong>. Bluetooth connectivity lets you stream from any device when you want manual control. You can fill your entire home with synchronized music by pairing multiple Echo devices in different rooms. The ecosystem grows naturally as you add more speakers over time.</p>
<p>Smart home control makes the Echo Dot a<strong> central hub for any connected device</strong>: lights, thermostats, plugs, and many more accessories follow your every simple command. With its built-in motion sensor, routines can be automatically invoked as soon as you turn up in a room. The indoor temperature sensor allows you to create comfort-based automation, where you start the fan once it gets too hot.</p>



<p>Privacy controls certainly help mitigate these concerns about always-listening devices. The dedicated microphone off button physically disconnects the mics when you need guaranteed privacy. Amazon has built layers of protection into the system, stating explicitly that they do not sell your personal information. You can review and delete voice recordings at any time through the Alexa app, a big improvement over previous models in terms of data transparency.</p>
<p>Pairing options extend the functionality well beyond basic speaker duties. Pair with Fire TV devices for a home theater-like audio experience, link with compatible Eero mesh systems to extend Wi-Fi coverage throughout the house, and create speaker groups that play synchronized audio across multiple rooms. The Echo Dot works great on its own but really shines as part of a larger system.</p>
<p>At $31, the Echo Dot introduces smart home capability for a near-disposable price. In one small package, you’re getting better audio quality, Alexa integration, smart home control, and integrated sensors. This Black Friday deal brings the newest model to its lowest recorded price.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-inspired-sandbox-game-hytale-canceled-after-a-decade-of-development/1100-6532646/" data-ref-id="1100-6532646">Hytale was canceled</a> after spending a decade in development and the studio behind it, Hypixel, was slated to be closed as well. Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme subsequently revived the company and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/canceled-minecraft-competitor-hytale-isnt-canceled-after-all/1100-6536298/" data-ref-id="1100-6536298">purchased all of the rights for Hytale</a> from Riot Games. Collins-Laflamme also reiterated his commitment to releasing Hypixel in early access. Now, we know how much the game is going to cost.</p><p>On social media, Hypixel revealed that Hytale <a href="https://x.com/Hytale/status/1991884477816300023" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will retail for $20</a>. However, there will be more expensive editions with perks including cosmetics that fans can purchase in support of the team. After confirming the price, Collins-Laflamme noted that this decision puts him financially at risk because he's already committed to bankrolling his company and funding the game out of his own pocket.</p><p>"I'm pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible," wrote Collins-Laflamme on X. "I'm taking on a considerable personal risk after repurchasing the game and getting it ready for early access for a growing team of now 50 talented individuals. I said I was all in, and I am delivering on that promise. The game is unfinished and runs on a build from over four years ago. Charging more didn't feel right. I don't think the game is good yet. My team and I will push hard to make it good, then great. The vision is clear and progress is fast."</p><p>Collins-Laflamme added that he wants to attract as many players as possible, even during rough economic times. Hypixel has also released a post detailing <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-modding-strategy-and-status" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">how far along the modding feature is</a>. The short answer is there's still a lot of work to be done. For now, Hytale doesn't have a release date, but Collins-Laflamme has implied that the game's early-access period will begin relatively soon.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Capcom surprised fans with the announcement of a remaster of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/onimusha_2_samurais_destiny">Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny</a> for the Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>The same title eventually arrived in March of this year, and now in another update, Capcom has this week released a demo, which you can download right now from the eShop. According to the official description, it will allow players to experience the "gripping prologue" as you dive into the samurai action.</p>
<p>In our review of Onimusha 2 on the Switch, we mentioned how it was a faithful revival of one of the PS2's best games and included plenty of quality-of-life updates and extras that fans (and newcomers) were sure to appreciate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is a strong, worthy successor to the original that is now at its absolute best on Switch. Some of it feels dated by modern standards, with fixed camera angles that arguably should have been ditched back in 2002, but it still feels incredibly fun regardless."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/onimusha_warlords">Onimusha: Warlords</a> was also previously released on the Switch in 2019, if you want to start from the beginning.</p>

While we're still waiting on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-2025-black-friday-sale">Nintendo's deals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">Xbox</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-sale-2025-early-deals">Amazon</a> launched Black Friday sales earlier this week. Now <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">PlayStation</a> has entered the fray with a spread of discounts on games, accessories, and even PS5 consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's worth checking your wishlist and doing some scrolling, as a starting point, we're seeing great discounts for anyone looking to start or fill in the gaps on a Final Fantasy collection. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Final Fantasy Games on Sale for Black Friday </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, you’ve got options. The PlayStation Store offers the best discounts on the FF7 Remakes, but Amazon is actually offering physical copies. It really comes down to how much you care about having those games lined up on your shelf vs. sitting in your digital library. If you’re on the PC side, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/playstationpublishersale2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam is also running a PlayStation publisher sale</a> that includes roughly the same discounts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Final Fantasy Pixel Collection is pretty unreal bang for your buck. It includes the pixel remasters of the first six Final Fantasy games for just $30 total with the current price drop, making it a great choice for something you can really dig into over the holidays. The discount also applies to the <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrRWl?object_uuid=464cd0b5-f8e2-4b16-a1ca-a7eee5a1762f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch version</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for news on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-a-completed-story-at-square-enix">third and final part</a> of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy, you can pick up the first two games at a discount. Remake Intergrade (Intergrade just meaning the PS5 version) has dropped to $19.99 for physical and $14.99 for digital. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, released just last year, has dropped to $39.99 for the physical copy on Amazon and $34.99 through PlayStation. Michael Higham's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">9/10 review of Rebirth for IGN</a> describes how it "impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion as both a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenge and depth, and as an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most recent mainline release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-review">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, has dropped to its <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0BPMTJJ6D" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest ever price on Amazon</a>, which happens to be $5 cheaper than you can find it on the PlayStation Store. While outside of Black Friday deals themselves, Amazon does have a teensy tiny 5% discount on the most recent spin-off release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review">Final Fantasy Tactics: Ivalice Chronicles</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>More PlayStation Black Friday Deals </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation has knocked $100 off both its PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles, the only real console deals we’ve so far this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-predictions-and-latest-news">Black Friday</a>. There’s also PlayStation Plus discounts and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dualsense-ps5-controllers-black-friday-early-deals">spread of DualSense controllers</a> on sale, including my personal favorite, the limited edition Ghost of Yotei version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Blythe (she/her) is an SEO Coordinator at IGN who spends way too much time in character customization screens and tracking down collectibles. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-game-deals-ps5-black-friday-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s AirPods Pro have dominated the premium earbud conversation for years, but Samsung finally built a serious challenger. The <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro pack AI-powered noise cancellation, adaptive sound optimization, and a completely redesigned fit</strong> into a sleek package. The kicker is the price: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">At $159 instead of $249 on Amazon, these earbuds now cost almost half what Apple charges for the AirPods Pro</a>. This Black Friday deal exists only on Amazon since Samsung isn’t running this discount on its own website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AI-Powered Audio That Learns How You Listen</h2>
<p>The <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro put AI right inside your ears</strong>, exactly where it needs to be, in ways that matter most. Adaptive Equalizer in Samsung’s earbuds analyzes the shape of your ear canal and adjusts the audio output for the best sound delivery. What you get is a kind of personalized listening that automatically improves from how the earbuds are fitted in your ears. You don’t have to fiddle with EQ settings or guess which preset sounds best as the AI does everything for you and gets it just right.</p>



<p><strong>Adaptive Active Noise Cancellation</strong> is another strong suit for Galaxy AI. It continuously monitors your environment and adjusts the cancellation intensity in real time. Louder subway noise will trigger maximum blocking, while a quiet office gets lighter treatment. The transition happens seamlessly without any need for you to manually change it. You can stay immersed in your music while remaining aware of important sounds with ease.</p>
<p>The redesigned fit addresses one of the biggest complaints about previous Galaxy Buds generations: Samsung <strong>reworked the shape and materials for long-lasting comfort</strong> during extended listening sessions. The earbuds stay secure during workouts and commutes without creating pressure points. You can wear them for hours without that fatigue from cheaper earbuds.</p>



<p>Sound quality is top-notch and delivers on the promise of this premium tier. Rich bass, clear mids, and crisp highs seamlessly come together in immersive audio across each genre. The dual drivers take everything from podcasts to orchestral music with amazing accuracy. Supporting spatial audio adds three-dimensional depth to compatible content. Movies and games feel more immersive when the sounds seem to be coming from every direction.</p>
<p><strong>Touch controls are responsive</strong> and allow you to customize actions to your liking. Tap or swipe to pause playback, skip tracks, adjust volume, take calls, and more. You can program different gestures on each earbud to make the most of the functionality. Controls reliably work, even when you are working out and your fingers are a bit sweaty. Voice assistants are just one tap away if you need hands-free assistance.</p>
<p>Battery life keeps the music going through long days without anxiety.: The earbuds give you hours of playback with ANC enabled, and the case offers multiple additional charges. Quick charging gets you back to listening fast when you’re running low. Wireless charging support means that you can drop the case onto any compatible pad. USB-C handles wired charging when you need it.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro go for $159 and offers flagship features at a mid-segment price tag. You’re getting AI-powered ANC, adaptive sound optimization, premium comfort, and striking design all rolled into one. This Black Friday deal on Amazon saves you $90 off regular pricing, but more importantly, cuts the AirPods Pro by a significant margin.</p>

              <p>Amazon started <em>Black Friday Week</em> off with a bang on Thursday by knocking the AirPods 4 with ANC down from its usual $179 to $109. Shoppers jumped on it immediately, but Amazon decided to go even harder on Friday: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4602/">Now the price is at an unbelievable $99 (44% off)</a>, a record low for earbuds that are barely into their first year. The standard <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3769/">AirPods 4 without ANC also hit a new low at $79, down from $129</a>. Neither of these deals exists on Apple’s website because it will not run Black Friday promotions. Amazon clearly has different plans.</p>

<h2>Premium ANC Earbuds Finally at an Accessible Price</h2>
<p>Until Apple figured it out, active noise cancellation seemed impossible on open-ear earbuds with the H2 chip. The <strong>ANC model of AirPods 4 blocks out the ambient noise without the sealed feeling of traditional in-ear designs</strong>. Airplane engines, office chatter, and street noise fade into the background so you can focus on your music or calls. The technology adapts continuously to your environment, adjusting cancellation levels in real time.</p>



<p><strong>Transparency mode flips the script</strong> when you need to hear your surroundings. A quick press lets in ambient sound so you can have a conversation or listen for announcements without removing the earbuds. The transition between ANC and Transparency is genuinely instant and seamless. It’s this flexibility that makes the AirPods 4 truly useful for everyday life, rather than just an isolated listening session.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptive Audio goes even further:</strong> it automatically blends noise cancellation and transparency, depending on your environment. Walk down a busy street, and it ramps up awareness of your surroundings. Sit at your desk, and stronger noise cancellation kicks in to help you focus. In essence, the earbuds read the room and adapt-without any input from you. It feels almost magical once you experience how seamlessly it works.</p>
<p>With <strong>Personalized Spatial Audio</strong>, an immersive three-dimensional soundstage is built around your uniquely shaped ears. Technology utilizes the TrueDepth camera on your iPhone to scan your ears and optimize audio delivery. Movies and music acquire depth and dimension that standard stereo simply cannot match. It feels like the sounds are around you, not inside of your head. Immersive audio will enormously improve the gaming and video content.</p>



<p>All these advanced features are powered by the <strong>H2 chip</strong>, and it does so with great battery efficiency. You get up to 30 hours of total listening time with the charging case, ample for a week of commutes and workouts. The earbuds themselves will last around 6 hours on a single charge with ANC turned on. When you’re in a real hurry, a quick 5-minute charge gives you about an hour of playback.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort remains a strong suit for the open-ear design</strong> that Apple has refined generation after generation. The earbuds sit securely without creating pressure or fatigue during extended listening sessions. No silicone tips means no irritation in the ear canal, no plugged-up feeling. And most people can wear them hours on end without discomfort. The fit works for workouts, commutes, and everything in between.</p>
<p>For $99, the Apple AirPods 4 with ANC deliver flagship audio features at a mid-range price point. You are getting active noise cancelation, adaptive audio, spatial audio, and the H2 chip in comfortable open-ear earbuds.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/return-to-the-year-2000-with-classic-multiplayer-dos-games-in-your-browser/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<blockquote><p>Chrono Divide is a fan-made project which aims to recreate the original “Red Alert 2” from the “Command &amp; Conquer” series using web technologies. The result is a game client that runs in your web browser, with no additional plugins or applications installed.</p>
<p>The project initially started out as an experiment and was meant to prove that it was possible to have a fully working, cross-platform RTS game running in a web browser. Now, with a playable version already available, the end-goal is reaching feature parity with the original vanilla “Red Alert 2” engine.</p></blockquote>
<p>It works with a client-server model (“say goodbye to port forwarding and firewall exceptions”), supports mods, offers both modern and classic mouse control schemes, and works “on any device and operating system, directly from your web browser,” including phones and tablets. You (understandably) have to have a copy of the game files to play, though.</p>
<p>Further, there are leaderboards and a <a href="https://discord.gg/uavJ34JTWY">Discord server</a>, plus modern-game-style “seasons” (with no monetization, of course) that feature special rules and map rotations. So there’s a decent-sized community playing <em>Red Alert 2</em> on the regular in 2025, which is pretty wild.</p>
<p>Chrono Divide joins a handful of similar projects in bringing older multiplayer PC games with modern bells and whistles to web browsers. One example: <a href="https://dos.zone/mp/?lobby=*">DOS Zone</a> offers one-click joining of online matches of <em>Doom</em>, <em>Quake 2</em> and <em>3</em>, <em>Unreal Tournament</em>, and <em>Half-Life: Deathmatch</em>—again, with a Discord server for an extra community layer.</p>
<p>So if you want to spend your Friday night reliving the TCP/IP and LAN party multiplayer games of the early 2000s, well, there you go. I’ll see you there—I still think <em>Unreal Tournament</em> is the best multiplayer first-person shooter ever made.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">We are fast approaching the end to another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> chapter, and that means it's nearly time for a huge live event that will introduce a new era for Epic Games' metaverse. It's Fortnite's biggest party, typically drawing its biggest concurrent player numbers by a wide margin each year. In 2023 it drew more than 11 million players, and 2024's event pulled more than 14 million.</p><p dir="ltr">And with this year's chapter finale, titled Zero Hour, looking like it's going to rope in every collab Fortnite had over the past 365 days <em>while also</em> picking up old storylines that Fortnite abandoned years ago, this one's looking like quite a doozie.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4609075-g6tarewx0aalrhx.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4609075" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4609075-g6tarewx0aalrhx.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4609075"></a><figcaption>The Fortnite Chapter 6 finale event looks like it'll be quite a spectacle.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4609075-g6tarewx0aalrhx.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">When is Fortnite's Chapter 6 finale event going down?</h2><p dir="ltr">The live finale event, which will only take place one time, will begin at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET on Saturday, November 29.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll be able to join the mode 40 minutes prior to start time, which likely means there will be some sort of pre-show entertainment. Prior to the event at the end of Star Wars season back in June, there was an X-Wing vs TIE Fighter PvP space flight sim for players to enjoy before the main event, so these things can get pretty elaborate.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Will Fortnite go offline afterward?</h2><p dir="ltr">Yes. You can expect that Fortnite's servers will go offline for the Chapter 7 update once the event ends. But if all goes well, Fortnite should only be down for about 4-7 hours. Expect Chapter 7 to start in the evening on November 29.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Fortnite Chapter 6: Zero Hour live event teaser</h2><p dir="ltr">Epic has offered a cinematic teaser for the event, and it looks like<em> a lot. </em>Check it out.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwh7WFCW3f8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mwh7WFCW3f8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr">What can we expect to happen during the Zero Hour event?</h2><p dir="ltr">Based on the teaser, we're going to get some kind of Avengers: Endgame-level confrontation with Chapter 6's ultimate big bad, whose tentacles have made sporadic appearances throughout the chapter. All the past year's Fortnite collabs will team up like it's the end of Ready Player One, and then whatever happens will usher in the Chapter 7 island.</p><p dir="ltr">We're expecting characters from tons of different IPs that collabed with Fortnite in the past year to show up, with Godzilla x Kong, Star Wars, Halo, K-Pop Demon Hunters, Hatsune Miku, Power Rangers, TMNT, and Superman already being teased. Likewise, at least two upcoming Chapter 7 collabs--Kill Bill and Back to the Future--will also have parts to play.</p><p dir="ltr">But Zero Hour won't just be about the collabs. The Fortnite original superhero group known as the Seven are almost guaranteed to make their return during this event. None of the members of the Seven have been seen since the end of Chapter 3, so it's been a while.</p><p dir="ltr">The big question is whether they'll be the same versions of the characters as before. We've already had two different versions of The Paradigm, who were entirely different characters from alternate realities, so we might get to meet a new version of The Foundation not played by Dwayne Johnson. But there have been no rumors either way on that front just yet, so we'll have to wait and see.</p>

                <p>In October, Bethesda announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-and-fallout-new-vegas-are-getting-anniversary-editions/1100-6535649/" data-ref-id="1100-6535649">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</a>, an updated version of the game that was released 10 years ago this month. What was meant to be the definitive version of the game launched with numerous bugs and other issues that sparked a backlash against Fallout 4. Now, Bethesda is releasing an update for November and looking ahead to a December update as well.</p><p>Bethesda shared the patch notes on social media. The message didn't directly address the negative response to Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, but it did thank players for their "continued communication with us on your current Fallout 4 experience." The dev team notes that it's focused on DLC installation issues, occasional crashing, and general user experience in the patch.</p><p>The team added that it still plans to add a mod storage expansion on Fallout 4's console versions. However, the devs state that more time is needed before that feature is ready to be released.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>If you predicted ten years ago that Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson would grow his YouTube channel into an empire that spans snacks, toys, an anime meant to sell those toys, and now a theme park, I would very much like for you to come lottery ticket shopping with me. Despite the long odds, it’s all come true, with the latter materializing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia after a frenzied couple months of construction. It looks… <a href="https://kotaku.com/beast-land-mrbeast-theme-park-saudi-arabia-2000645495?ref=aftermath.site"><u>really bad</u></a>! But a lot of things about MrBeast look bad when put under a magnifying glass, like his many <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-chaos-1235217834/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>recent scandals and controversies</u></a> – as well as his whole <a href="https://aftermath.site/mrbeast-beast-games/"><u>persona</u></a> of being a Willy Wonka wannabe meets Jigsaw from <em>Saw</em>. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we discuss why none of those issues have managed to meaningfully chip his armor.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by two of the finest internet culture reporters to ever lace up their boots and wade into the muck, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kattenbarge.bsky.social?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kat Tenbarge</u></a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/asarch.bsky.social?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Steven Asarch</u></a>, to talk about why MrBeast’s new theme park, Beast Land, is so bad – and why quality was never the point in the first place. Spoiler alert: It’s a giant ad, as many so-called theme parks, activations, and experiences are these days. We live in an era of flimsy disposability where nothing – whether it’s a short-form video or a branded IRL pop-up – is built to last.</p><p>Then we discuss the latest platform to go all in on invasive age verification tech: <em>Roblox</em>, which will <a href="https://www.polygon.com/roblox-age-verification-id-check-user-issues-child-safety/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>require use of a facial age estimation system and ID checks</u></a> to access chat. On one hand, <em>Roblox </em>has had more than its fair share of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>child predation scandals</u></a> at this point, so it has every incentive to at least perform comprehensiveness here. On the other, <em>Roblox</em>’s real problems run much deeper, and a suite of data-hungry surveillance tools won’t solve them.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Kat shares a wild story about the time someone commissioned her, then an ASMRtist, to make a video in which she turned them into a puppet.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can build our own theme park in Australia (or maybe just the cozy little countryside office <a href="https://aftermath.site/aurumek-simon-hintermann-new-shirt-print-design-aftermath/"><u>featured in our latest piece of merch</u></a>, available now!)</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Kat:</strong> It’s weird to think that YouTube, in a way, has this incestuous relationship with [MrBeast]. They want the views his content brings, so despite the personal controversy he might start, YouTube as a company are willing to relentlessly promote him and invest in him. The last person I can remember them having that kind of relationship with was Shane Dawson before his fall. The CEO of YouTube would go to his house and hang out with him, and that was not really a relationship YouTube had with a lot of people.</p><p>But I think with MrBeast, we’re almost in a post-controversy era, because previously in a different decade, you’d think major multinational corporations would be scared by the types of things MrBeast has been credibly accused of doing. But now they’re actually less scared of working with him even when now the general public consensus around him is that he’s kind of a bad guy.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Why do you think that is? What do you think made brands in general go from being very squeamish around these creators – being very brand safe in their approach – to being like “Now that people’s opinions have soured, this is actually safer for us”?</p><p><strong>Kat:</strong> When we were talking about MrBeast’s controversies, it’s like, in a certain sense, now that he’s had them, they know that it doesn’t really matter anymore. Of course there are still worse things he could do; there are still things that could bring down the empire. But I think these companies and brands realized over the past five years in particular that the longevity of the influencer does not depend on how bad the controversy gets.</p><p>I imagine that the lesson from Logan Paul, for example, was [that cancellations don’t stick]. At a certain point after the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42644321?ref=aftermath.site"><u>suicide forest video</u></a>, it seemed like Logan would never make money again. But the reality is that he makes exponentially more money now than he ever did before or during that controversy. In a weird way, I feel like the brands almost push the creators more than the audience pushes the creators.</p><p><strong>Steven:</strong> Cancellation in general when it comes to this style of influencer is now a myth. I don’t think an influencer – outside of an extreme grooming or sexual assault scandal – can’t bounce back from any sort of controversy at this point. <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/trisha-paytas-past-drama-mom-life-1234983378/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Trisha Paytas</u></a> is doing better than she’s ever done before. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jeffree-star-sexual-assault-allegations-violence-accused-predator-myspace-payments-2020-9?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jeffree Star</u></a> is still thriving.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper/"><u>Dr Disrespect</u></a> still exists.</p><p><strong>Steven: </strong>Guy Beahm is doing photoshoots and thriving with his weird audience. You can’t really be cancelled anymore, because all it takes is a weird niche audience that can fund your content for a really long time. You don’t need to go mainstream. Guy Beahm – I’m not calling him The Doc, I refuse – is never going to hit that same level he hit in the pre-2020 TwitchCon era. He’s now sort of cemented himself as an anti-cancel culture warrior, and the audience that’s fallen for it is willing to give him enough that he can survive. Influencers don’t need to be for everyone anymore. They can find their niche and thrive in a way that didn’t work just five years ago.</p><p>I think when it comes to MrBeast, his scandals only reached the level that they did because he couldn’t talk. He claims there was a law firm looking into his company. I believe that from talking to people inside. But in general, these influencers can’t be canceled. There’s no such thing. Brands are full of older folks who see a big name and think “Oh, I can throw my thing behind them.” I don’t think Jack Link’s Beef Jerky – which is now doing a MrBeast collab – really cared too much about the Ava [Kris Tyson] controversy from last year when they signed that seven-to-eight-figure deal to slap his name on a bunch of meat sticks.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Just to give people an idea of what we’re talking about here – especially as you have been kind of the chronicler of MrBeast’s many scandals – what are the most egregious things he’s done?</p><p><strong>Steven:</strong> I’ve been reporting on MrBeast since 2018, when I interviewed him about a real-life battle royale he decided to do. I would say up until 2024, MrBeast was uncancellable. Criticism was not even allowed of MrBeast because he did philanthropy; he helped people. He helped cure blindness singlehandedly, according to his video thumbnail.&nbsp;</p><p>But in the summer of 2024, it came out that Ava Kris Tyson – who was his second in command and his closest friend – had been talking inappropriately with minors on a Discord and had allegedly sexually assaulted their assistant while they were working. This led to a series of other controversies coming out. A YouTuber named DogPack made a whole bunch of videos. Other YouTubers came out claiming they were tortured trying to film a video.&nbsp;</p><p>All these controversies grew on top of each other to the point that when the first season of The Beast Games came out, I <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-chaos-1235217834/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>reported</u></a> that the crew members were treated very poorly. They were underfed, they were overworked. One crew member I spoke with was hit by a 200 lb piece of wood that fell on his neck, causing him to fall backward and hit his head with blood shooting out of his mouth. He is still recovering. His left side doesn’t work very well. When he was in the hospital, a MrBeast executive offered him $1,000 in Uber Eats and DoorDash gift cards as a way to make amends.</p><p>In general, all those controversies didn’t really mean much. MrBeast was sort of able to just continue posting content and wave it all away with a law firm investigation into the company that found, yeah, there was some bad stuff, but overall they did their best. You’ve gotta remember that MrBeast for a while was just a bunch of teenagers running around and doing wild stuff. Now it’s a major corporation that has just hired a bunch of executives from Shopify and NBC to try to change their image, and it’s clearly working. I would say if Ms Rachel is for the really young kids, MrBeast is for the young kids. Scandals are now unimportant when looking at MrBeast, because they didn’t really stick.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-corvette-independence-day-ship-build-2000646306</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/someone-built-the-independence-day-ship-in-no-man%E2%80%99s-sky-and-it%E2%80%99s-as-terrifying-as-it-is-awesome.1361323/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Since <i>No Man’s Sky</i>’s Voyagers update, players have been obsessed with making some incredible ships. And with the help of some mod tools, the most daring of ship builders out there are pushing the boundaries of Hello Games’ procedurally created universe. One of the most impressive demonstrations I’ve seen of this yet is this <i>NMS</i> player’s tribute to <i>Independence Day</i>.</p>    <p>Built by Vilxir, this build is reminiscent of his epic, and perhaps equally terrifying, <i>No Man’s Sky</i> <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-death-star-star-wars-2000635367">Death Star I highlighted last month</a>. Like the Death Star before it, Vilxir’s <i>Independence Day </i>“Destroyer” leveraged the power of open-source 3D modeling software Blender and the handy <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/nomanssky/mods/984">Base Builder mod</a> that allows users to import 3D models from Blender into <i>No Man’s Sky</i>.</p>

 <p>While <i>NMS</i>’ in-game ship-building tools can produce incredible results, Vilxir tells me that the ability to use Blender is a game-changer, “Blender has opened up an entirely new level of creativity for me. It lets me make things I genuinely didn’t think were possible in <i>NMS</i>, so huge shoutouts to the creators of the Blender Plugin and the Base Editor.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646307" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646307"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646307">© Screenshot: Hello Games / Vilxir</figcaption></figure> <p>The Destroyer took about four hours to build, according to Vilxir. One of the most interesting challenges? Nailing the dome-like flying saucer structure of the <i>Independence Day </i>ship. “Anyone who’s made a dome in <i>No Man’s Sky</i> or worked with Blender spheres knows the pain,” he told me. “You get merged pieces, overlaps, and a bumpy surface. To get something closer to a smooth dome, I had to build it in individual layered rings instead of using a single sphere.”</p>

 <p>Impressive though it may be, the ship isn’t finished. Vilxir now has his sights set on building out the interior of the ship, but he’s not looking to crash anyone’s console or PC with aggressively complicated ship architecture. “I’m aiming for something optimized for performance and fun, especially if I share it publicly,” he said. “Right now my plan is to build dedicated spaces for the core, the hangar, and a command deck. I also want to experiment with making a separate Corvette that acts as a small fleet of the fighter ships that Will Smith and the others flew in the movie.”</p> <p>Vilxir’s reign of building impressive ships to stalk the procedurally generated vacuum of Hello Games’ galaxy won’t conclude with the Destroyer. “For the next big project,” he told me, “I’m considering tackling Thanos’ Sanctuary II, or the Crimson Dawn ‘First Light’ yacht from <i>Solo</i>. I’ve also thought about the Lucrehulk battleship from <i>The Clone Wars</i>. My goal is to build ships that nobody has tried yet, or that hasn’t been done at this level of detail.”</p>

<p>The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake is coming sooner than some might think.</p>



<p>As first mentioned on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQeluxqHMIE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest episode</a> of Insider Gaming Weekly: A Video Game Podcast, Insider Gaming has learned when the remake of the 2003 action-adventure game is set to release.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-releasing">When Is Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Releasing?</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson has regularly reported that Ubisoft’s plans called for the Prince of Persia remake to release prior to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake</a>. And, as of publish, that remains the case.</p>



<p>According to sources close to the game, the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake is <strong>scheduled to release in mid-January 2026</strong>. In addition to the release plan, sources believe it’s likely that the next look at the game will come at The Game Awards on December 11, 2025. That’s always where the official date could be revealed.</p>



<p>First announced back in 2020, the Sands of Time Remake has had an up and down development cycle. It was originally scheduled to release in January 2021 but was delayed to March 2021 in December 2020. A month before its March release, the game was delayed again to an unspecified date.</p>



<p>After that, Ubisoft went silent for a while until it was announced that development was being moved to Ubisoft Montreal in May 2022. When Ubisoft Montreal took over, development on the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was completely restarted</a>. The restart included a more ““realistic approach” to the game, including a graphical overall, new animations, and new mechanics for both combat and parkour. </p>







<p>Another two years later, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-toronto-joins-development-on-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Toronto had joined</a> the development and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-remade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the game was planned</a> for a 2026 release.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Developer Roblox Corporation recently introduced a new face-scanning feature as a way to increase child safety protection on its game creation platform, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a>. CEO David Baszucki is very excited about this initiative, giving some rather intense and questionable answers during a new podcast episode about the age-gating technology.</p><p>Baszucki sat down with The New York Times journalists Casey Newton and Kevin Roose for an episode of their Hard Fork podcast. Posted on November 21, the three engaged in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/podcasts/hardfork-roblox-child-safety.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a wide-ranging conversation</a> that started with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-will-try-harder-to-keep-kids-from-talking-to-strangers/1100-6536311/" data-ref-id="1100-6536311">the face-scanning feature</a>, moved to misnomers about data, and peaked at disgreements regarding the use of AI for moderation. Newtown opened with an inquiry about the problem with predators on Roblox, which Baszucki said is a good and bad dilemma.</p><p>"We think of it not necessarily just as a problem, but an opportunity as well," he said. "How do we allow young people to build, communicate and hang out together? How do we build the future of communication at the same time? So we, you know, we’ve been, I think in a good way, working on this ever since we started. And when we were--this was almost 18 or 19 years ago--when we first launched the company and we had just four of us sitting in a room, we were literally the moderators, like we would rotate all the time."</p><p>Baszucki continued, saying that with the scale Roblox has grown to, the company decided that "the latest tech" (that is, "using facial age estimation with A.I.") is what it's looking toward to complement its moderation tools with. He mentioned text filters as one example, particularly since chatters tend to use "hashtag, hashtag, hashtag" and other keyword tricks to bypass the system.</p><p>"With A.I., these filters have gotten better and better," Baszucki said. "The state of where we are now is primarily getting into the blocking of adversarial attempts to broach the filter, and adversarial attempts to try to share PII [personally identifying information], which we're getting better and better at as well. On the age estimation, it's just--I would say--recently come of age to the point where we would complement it. But I would say our strategy is always [to] complement with whatever technology is out there to put that together."</p><p>Before long, the three were interrupting each other, interjecting statements and questions to get a leg up. Baszucki "categorically rejected" the assertion in recent lawsuits claiming predators use Roblox to find kids. He said the platform is doing "an incredible job at innovating" when compared to other online social platforms, repeating that the company is "constantly getting better" at protecting kids' ability to chat in-game.</p><p>"There's enormous benefits for having people be able to communicate, and we think we see those benefits," Baszucki explained. "There's a lot of kids who find their peeps on Roblox. There are a lot of kids when they're lonely or isolated actually--I'm not going to use it as an excuse or anything--but I get a lot of calls from famous parents who said, 'Look, my kid would be dead if it were not for finding a community on a platform like Roblox to stay connected with.' And I would also say we do take it as an enormous responsibility to design for not the sophisticated parent who goes in and says, 'Look, I'm going to turn off who you can chat to and all of that.' We have to design for all parents and think through that. But we do believe we have enormously great technology up and down the stack. We think it's part of building an experience like this. You know, if you go out there in the gaming space, I think it is very common to support communication. I'm not going to list any other games. And typically, we are way beyond in, I'd say, our innovation level, responsibility level, on both the filtering, on the image sharing, on all of these things."</p><p>After more tense exchanges around the 150 million daily active users--which Baszucki claimed is now "self-reported [to be] almost two-thirds over 13"--Roose asked about <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hindenburg Research's October 2024 findings</a> on the company allegedly disregarding child safety in the name of profits. He deflected, instead opting to focus on the fact that the activist fund "went out of business for some reason" and asked the hosts if they've researched that information themselves. He then responded by saying that AI is making everything better.</p><p>"So it's really interesting, because I think we're diving into a situation where we're getting better, better, better," Baszucki said. "But would you ask the same situation of someone who converted from maybe hypermanual labor making cars by hand to an assembly line? The assembly line might be infinitely better and at the same time not have so many people. So, I think what they're referring to is moving more and more and more and more to A.I. Arguably, is it better to have A.I. systems reviewing every image, every piece of text, all of that, or to keep doing that manually? So I think that was a misnomer. And I think if you interview anyone in our safety team or safety systems, that would be just part of making our systems better."</p><p>It's at this point that Baszucki's mood became a little flustered--though not "frustrated," as he said on multiple occasions--as he apparently went around high-fiving Newton and Roose for "aligning" with the company's decision to use AI tools for content moderation and "supporting our Roblox decision matrix."</p><p>"Is this a stealth interview where actually you love everything we’re doing and you’re here to stealthily support it?" He asked the hosts, later adding that he's "excited to talk." </p><p>"I thought we were going to be talking about fun, funny things in the industry and all of that," Baszucki said. "So I'm not frustrated, I’m just kind of figuring out how much fun time I have with you guys and how much fun time we have versus kind of this superfocus. But I'm happy to talk about whatever you guys want."</p><p>Something fun that Baszucki started talking about was a hypothetical "prediction market inside Roblox" that Roose tossed out. A "terrible idea," Roose thought, he wondered if the company would ever consider letting children place bets with the Robux in-game currency." Baszucki called it a "brilliant idea" he loves.</p><p>"I actually think it's a brilliant idea if it can be done in an educational way that's legal," he said. "And so, imagine no free Robux, no free prizes, just a game called the Dress to Impress Predictor, where it's not like trying to get kids' money or anything like that. I would be a big fan of it."</p><p>In the end, Baszucki seemed adamant in defending the fact that Roblox's content moderation tools are ever-evolving, pointing to text filtering in the past and face-scanning in the present as ways the company cares for the safety of its user base.</p><p>Roblox Corporation has come under intense scrutiny in recent months following a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">June 2024 Bloomberg investigation</a> that revealed the platform is rampant with predators. States like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/florida-ag-alleges-roblox-is-a-predator-breeding-ground-opens-investigation/1100-6535594/" data-ref-id="1100-6535594">Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/texas-sues-roblox-over-child-exploitation-and-grooming-concerns/1100-6536037/" data-ref-id="1100-6536037">Texas</a> have sued for what lawmakers say is the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-not-doing-enough-to-protect-kids-lawmaker-says/1100-6533929/" data-ref-id="1100-6533929">not doing enough to protect kids</a> from child exploitation and grooming.</p><p>Whether or Roblox or not, the problem with child predators is beginning to reach a fever pitch. According to the European law enforcement agency Europol, European society is seeing a sharp rise in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/children-are-weaponized-through-online-games-to-commit-murder-europol-claims/1100-6536430/" data-ref-id="1100-6536430">criminal networks weaponizing children</a> to commit violent crimes.</p>

      <p>On October 28th, 2025, Aftermath had a party, and you were all there.</p><p>Okay, not <em>all</em> of you were there—but on a Tuesday night in October, nearly a hundred Aftermath fans went to a venue in Queens to celebrate the site, hang out, and eat cake. It was the biggest party I’ve ever thrown and an incredible success. Hopefully, attendees have put their exclusive Aftermath stickers somewhere special.</p><p>Despite the fact that no one other than me and one very enthusiastic couple danced (shout out to y’all!),&nbsp; being at this party was one of the best nights of my life. I kept saying to my husband “I feel like it’s my birthday.” I could barely talk to people because so many people kept coming up to us to say how much they love our website and how much our work has touched their lives. The energy in the room was infectious; I felt like I was walking on a cloud.</p><p>The Aftermath Party was all the more special because of the people who helped us bring it together. Thanks to TV Eye, the venue in Ridgewood that housed us. Thank you also to Rudy’s Bakery for baking the lovely chocolate cake that we all enjoyed. Thank you to DJs Janus Rose, Alien D and Actuator—I truly wish that more people had danced, because these sets were incredible. And especially thank you to <a href="https://decristophoto.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Carmen DeCristo</u></a>, our photographer for the night.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span>All photos by Carmen DeCristo</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure><div></div><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span>All photos by Carmen DeCristo</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>And also, thank <em>you </em>for coming to the Aftermath Party. I was so happy to see you. Let’s do it again next year.</p>
