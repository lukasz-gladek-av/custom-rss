		<p>Sometimes you hear of a project that is so preposterous that you immediately dismiss it as it is never, ever going to come to fruition. I am not talking about climbing Everest or cycling around the globe – we know those can be achieved – I am talking about performing all of Shakespeare’s Hamlet in Grand Theft Auto Online. That barmy idea has made its way all the way through to now being available to <a href="https://mubi.com/en/us">stream on MUBI</a>!</p>
<p>How did this come about, though? As we entered the third Covid lockdown in January 2021, two out-of-work theatre actors Sam and Mark joined millions of others online and played<span> video games, specifically Grand Theft Auto Online. While exploring the map they stumbled across the Vinewood Bowl, a huge outdoor amphitheatre, and this backdrop planted an idea in their heads. They can’t act in real life, so why not put on a play inside Grand Theft Auto Online?</span></p>
<p><iframe title="GRAND THEFT HAMLET | Official Trailer | Now Streaming on MUBI" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OloHiBOMPm8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><span>Hamlet was chosen, a decision which turned out to be more fortuitous than they could have imagined as they slowly discovered the world GTA Online, and how the perfect neon city hides a dark seedy underbelly of lies and deceit, themes that can also be found within play. “It’s got the same recognisability in theatre as GTA has to gamers,” said Sam “It’s glamorous but under the surface, there is a relentless focus on death.” Hamlet also has a play within the play, so staging a play within a game seems the obvious modern equivalent.</span></p>
<p>Sam brought in his partner, Penny, to document the entire process. Over 300 hours of footage were captured on PlayStation 5, shot completely within the game and without using the Director mode, so you can see the HUD, NPCs, and of course many players who have nothing to do with the film trying to murder the cast at every opportunity. The only thing that wasn’t done in-game was chopping it all up and editing it in Adobe to create the documentary film Grand Theft Hamlet.</p>

<p><span>“One major planning point was when the guys realized that they could do a promenade performance,” says Sam. “They didn’t have to stay in the amphitheatre they had found in the game. In fact, the whole of the game was a potential stage, and they could even utilize different vehicles to move between locations.”</span></p>

<p>The team start trying to recruit a cast for the play and gathered together not just actors, but full-time mothers, cooks, and an alien who offers to audition with his ass… but ends up reciting a passage from the Quran. It soon becomes clear that the documentary is not just about the play, but that so many of the cast across the globe are in the same situation, locked inside with no real human contact and we get to hear their personal stories of lockdown. It also shows just how positive video games can be, bringing a random group of people to create something new. “I do think there should be more films about the positivity of gaming,” said Penny, “I thought [gaming] was a negative place to begin with.”</p>
<p>There are some amusing moments when Sam, Penny and Mark meet an auditionee for the first time, but found the voice does not match the on-screen persona as the player has gender-swapped that avatar. I asked them if this was a help or hindrance when casting and they explained that made casting even easier. “We could do this gender neutral,” said Penny. “People’s flexibility in games meant it was easy to be flexible when casting.”</p>

<p>There are also many, many laugh-out-loud moments throughout Grand Theft Hamlet, something you don’t often expect in a documentary, but as the team had no control over NPCs or other players, they often found squads of police cars racing into their rehearsal space. A solution came in the shape of some volunteers players who acted as the play’s own security force, taking down any players who were encroaching on the scene. I’m not sure what Shakespeare would have made of his soliloquies being recited by Hamlet while a jet patrols the skies above, its chain gun thundering and blowing up incoming helicopters, but I loved it.</p>
<p>None of what the Penny, Mark and Sam have created makes any sense; Hamlet in GTA Online should not work, the idea should have been shut down before it was even suggested. Somehow it does, the documentary is funny and touching, but also shows that people with no existing connections whatsoever, people from different countries and all backgrounds, can work together and make something beautiful. Given what is going on across the planet these days it’s nice to be reminded that, even in murderous world of GTA Online, there are good guys.</p>

Team D-13's top-down sci-fi shoot ‘em up originally debuted on Steam as “Monolith.” The re-branding seems to be partly about giving the indie gem a catchier name, and also partly about avoiding potential legal trouble with Warner Bros. Games, who has the original title trademarked for its studio of the same name.</p><p>But for many, <em>Star of Providence </em>will essentially be their first introduction to the roguelike’s striking retro art style and vast array of enemies, weapons, and secrets.

Here’s all the new content the game got this week:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>2 new upgrades.</li><li>1 new playable character.</li><li>5 new normal enemies.</li><li>More new bosses than enemies for some reason.</li><li>13 new unique weapons.</li><li>20 new cartridges.</li><li>43 new keywords (including those exclusive to Skully and Unique weapons).</li><li>A nearly complete rework of the loop mechanic, including capping it to a maximum loop of 13.</li><li>A nearly complete rework of the Skully playable “ship”.</li><li>Face the Gauntlet, a new sub-branch which appears on late-game floors and offers valuable rewards in exchange for defeating esoteric challenges.</li><li>“Boss” “Rushes”.</li><li>Hundreds of new room layouts, featuring a variety of new hazards and gimmicks.</li><li>Massive balance changes, visual improvements, and performance optimizations across the whole game.</li><li>The unknown diminishes, ever so slightly.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Games rarely get second chances, especially beloved small indie releases that got lost in the shuffle, so it’s neat to see <em>Star of Providence</em> getting another shot at the limelight.

In this game, Shotgun Cop Man must travel to hell and arrest Satan.</p><p>Shotgun Cop Man's main mechanic revolves around propelling the titular character using firearms across levels and platforms. Its simplistic and minimalist art style complements its chaotic gameplay, allowing players to keep track of incoming bullets while also leaving room for players to make last-minute decisions on how to evade them. Solo dev DeadToast Entertainment said that adding on extra visual flair only increased "cognitive load," leading to a decrease in gameplay flow.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWSNEN2mZH8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cWSNEN2mZH8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I mentioned earlier the simplicity of the shotgun-propelling being something that spoke to me. And I wanted to stick with that word, simplicity, and try to make a game where I could strip away or minimize anything that wasn’t contributing to that core flowy feel and experience," DeadToast explained. "Hence the minimalist look and straightforward nature of the game."</p><p>Shotgun Cop Man also includes a level editor, which was one of My Friend Pedro's most-requested features. All of Shotgun Cop Man's levels are built with the same level-editor tools that players will have access to in the full release through Steam Workshop. There will also be No Damage and Speedrun modes for hardcore players.</p><p>The game will cost $10 when it launches on PC and Switch later this year, but a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966850/Shotgun_Cop_Man/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">demo is now available on Steam</a>. It contains 17 levels for players to go through. It wasn't revealed whether Shotgun Cop Man would get PlayStation and Xbox releases, but My Friend Pedro eventually came <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-friend-pedro-comes-to-ps4-next-week/1100-6475317/" data-ref-id="1100-6475317">to all platforms</a>, so it's possible that Shotgun Cop Man will too.</p><p>It's also possible that Shotgun Cop Man will be playable on Switch 2, but it's currently unclear what the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">upcoming system's backwards compatibility limitations are</a>.</p>

Team Jade and TiMi Studio Group have released a free downloadable co-op campaign for their 2024-launched multiplayer shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/delta-force">Delta Force</a> - the first new Delta Force game since 2004. Inspired by the Ridley Scott film Black Hawk Down, the add-on campaign is designed for a squad of four, but you can play solo if you're up for a challenge.

Released in 2001, the Black Hawk Down movie is an adaptation of Mark Bowden's book about the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia - a clash between Somali National Alliance forces and United States troops, who had arrived in the country as part of a United Nations intervention during the Somali Civil War. </p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2507950/view/542224071645987075?l=english">The game's version of these events</a> is broken into seven chapters, beginning with an attempt to abduct SNA lieutenants and escalating into efforts to escort rescue convoys to downed helicopter crews. It builds on input from one the movie's production companies, Revolution Studio.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time a Delta Force game has tried its hand at Black Hawk Down. 2003's Delta Force: Black Hawk Down largely cut Scott out of the equation, taking inspiration directly from Bowden's book. The battle remains legendary in the States - it's been memorialised and revisited from different angles in several books and films. In 2013, pieces of the crashed US helicopters were recovered and turned into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150908082526/http://www.asomf.org/2014/11/06/task-force-ranger-and-the-battle-of-mogadishu/">a museum exhibit</a>. Now, the story is being adapted by a team from China.</p>
<p>The Somali Civil War, meanwhile, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_Civil_War">still on-going</a>. In a recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gx0jw5v1lo">BBC article</a>, published ahead of a new Netflix documentary, several Somali people recount the storming and bombing of their homes by US troops. Many of the survivors continue to call for <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03063968231155358">reparations</a>.

		<p><em>All games are built on the games before it, in ways big and small.</em></p><p><em>In some cases, it might mean being the latest in a long running franchise, like Civilization VII, where you're navigating conversations on leading a genre and being a sequel. Who to serve? In another, such as Avowed, it might be trying to navigate around the game people think of when they look at screen shots, aka Skyrim, to find your own identity.</em></p><p><em>Rob has spent time with one of these games, while Patrick has spent time with the other. But both are dealing with similar issues in different ways. </em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>In recent weeks, I’ve played a decent chunk of the new Obsidian RPG, <em>Avowed</em>. You know that I didn’t have a great impression of that game when I first played it, but upon revisiting, I’ve found the combat, exploration, and storytelling clicking into place. It’s the kind of game where you are compelled to describe it, both positively and negatively, as “scratching an itch.”&nbsp;</p><p>An “itch” suggests that a need that’s not being fulfilled. (It also might mean I fall off the game, because an itch can go away, as you realize the reason you were invested was to address the itch.) The reason <em>Starfield</em> was so anticipated was precisely because nobody makes games like Bethesda Game Studios. Putting aside how <em>Starfield</em> turned out (boring! safe!), it’s also because nobody <em>can</em> make games like Bethesda Game Studios, because not everyone has the seemingly infinite resources and time to toil away at a formula they helped pioneer ages ago.</p><p>It’s also a game whose faults stick out—and sting more—because we likely won’t Bethesda take another swing for…half a decade? It’s impossible to know, but Elder Scrolls isn’t coming “soon.”</p><p>What Obsidian, as a studio, has been trying the last few years is fascinating. <em>The Outer Worlds, Grounded, Pentiment,</em> and <em>Avowed</em> are different from one another, but in other ways, there’s fascinating overlap. These are games made with smaller teams, with lower stakes and smaller budgets. That’s no guarantee from the crushing and irrational pressures of the games industry, but it means Obsidian games are as interesting for what they <em>aren’t</em>, as for what they <em>are</em>.</p><p>I started thinking about this after Obsidian spoke at this year’s DICE event. Per <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/obsidian-plans-to-make-rpgs-for-100-years-by-not-trying-to-grow-aggressively-expand-our-team-size-or-make-super-profitable-games/?ref=remapradio.com"><em><u>PC Gamer</u></em></a>:</p><p><em>One of the pillars of the plan is staying "lean and invested," meaning small enough that none of Obsidian's employees feel like a cog in a machine. Morgan and Britch said that in recent years they'd been considering opening multiple international offices, but in the end decided to partner with existing studios rather than risk weakening Obsidian's culture by getting too big.</em></p><p><em>Leanness can also refer to Obsidian's games: It doesn't aim for unprecedented scale or the most advanced graphics, and before it greenlights a game, Britch says the studio spends a lot of time determining how much to invest in the project with the assumption that it will be a "mild success," not a smash hit.</em></p><p>In <em>Avowed’s</em> case, I’ve seen some grumbling about how you can’t steal money, objects, anything. <em>Avowed</em> carries the aesthetics of a <em>Skyrim</em>-like game, and inarguably has pitched itself as a game that would, in theory, appeal to players who liked <em>Skyrim</em>, aka games laughably big and open-ended worlds, but intentionally limits its possibility space. Would <em>Avowed</em> be better if it had…a badly implemented version of stealing? It’d be an option over no option at all, I suppose, but it feels like we’re headed, more generally, towards a world where video games are more like <em>Avowed</em>, gesturing at the sprawling games of the past but with more modest ambitions, while we’re graced, at best, once in a generation with a new audacious Bethesda or Rockstar game.</p><p>Whether it scratches <em>your</em> itch, then, depends on what you wanted scratched in the first place.</p><p>I ask you this, Rob, in the context of the latest <em>Civilization</em> and the swings that game took. We get <em>Civilization</em> games more often than Bethesda games, but it’s still a big moment in the genre.</p><figure><figcaption><i><em>Avowed</em></i><span> sure is pretty, both in screen shots and while playing the game.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Patrick that is a good question but first I want to get a quick rant off about stealing.</p><p>It is one of the most problematic mechanics in RPGs. I am wracking my brain to think of a game where I really like how it works. I feel like even as far back as the Ultima series it felt like it highlighted how odd RPG worlds are.</p><p>Think how games struggle to signal what even counts as stealing. You’ll come across an item and its description pops across the interface but with a tag: “steal”. Across the room, a similar item bears no such tag. So does that mean it’s fair game? In a lot of RPGs it does. You walk into people’s stores and houses and just start ransacking them right in front of them, and as long as you don’t grab a forbidden item you’re all good. But say you do grab a forbidden item? What happens? Well, that opens an entirely new can of worms: how do characters detect when you have stolen? Does the game just flag you as a thief whether you were seen or not? Do I have to be observed by the character I’m stealing from? By any character? If I am detected, what are the consequences? Do I just have to kill or run away from this one person, or am I marked as a thief in a way that will follow me to other locations, like you walk into a store in New York and you see a wanted poster of yourself for swiping a water bottle in Racine? Does that even make sense for the setting, given how frequently you’re in a low-tech fantasy world where information does not travel easily?&nbsp;</p><p>Even if an RPG figures out a way to communicate all this and create some consistent, sensible rules to handle theft and detection, the odds of it actually being <em>fun </em>to play as a thief are low. Most RPGs aren’t anything like stealth games and pass / fail skill checks don’t make for the most riveting stories, so stealing turns into yet another thing that drives constant quicksaving and probably even more boring inventory management.</p><p>Larceny feels like one of those things where you either need to really make it a major focus in a game, or you need to steer clear of it because it cannot help but highlight the barely held-together artifice of game worlds. Usually my flirtation with a life of crime in an RPG ends when a small theft leads to me depopulating an entire village with sword and spell, as I am swarmed to the death by every man, woman, and fantasy critter in the town because I grabbed “Soup [steal]” and not “carrot.”</p><p>In a funny way, I think the <em>Civilization </em>series is also one that has been transformed and maybe a bit tortured by a need to encompass activities and goals that don’t come naturally to it. If you go back to the early games, they involved a <em>lot </em>of combat. You could build a space ship and win the game that way but even then, you’d probably have to smack down a couple other civilizations along the way. The grand historical sweep of it was a theme draped over a game about acquiring resources to turn into more resources or into armies to go pulverize other people.</p><p>That kind of game would have gotten stale regardless, but also it kind of hit a point where you were making a game about colonizing as much of the world as possible and your primary interaction with other players was “so is it time for genocide?” So <em>Civilization </em>started giving players other goals and tried telling different stories about history from this foundation of “colonize land, build armies, crush enemies.”</p>

Julian Gollop, creator of the original X-COM game - known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ufo-enemy-unknown">UFO: Enemy Unknown</a> here in the UK, and followed up by Firaxis' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xcom-enemy-unknown">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a> later on - has told Eurogamer that he would be quite happy to return to the series in some form. Also, that he's fine with still being known as just "the X-COM guy" - despite the few decades' worth of subsequent games he's made since.
</p>
<p>
Speaking with Gollop as part of an interview on his new action-RTS hybrid, Chip 'n Clawz vs. The Brainiods, where Eurogamer discussed the wider state of strategy and tactics games (on which he has some opinions), the conversation naturally ended up back at his original series. I wondered if he ever felt pigeon-holed by the X-COM label, given how many games he's made since.
</p>
<p>
"I am perfectly happy being known as the X-COM guy," he said when I asked. "I mean, it was a foundational game in my career, and probably also, in some ways, a foundational strategy game in strategy gaming at the time - even though not long after it game out, the RTS scene really took over."
</p>
<p>
But then, he added, "as we know, turn-based came back, X-COM came back and so you know, I'm quite proud of what we managed to do then. Can I ever beat that? Well probably not, no," he laughed. "You know, I'm still interested in making games, maybe not always in the turn-based genre. Chip n' Clawz is something a little bit different. So you know, I don't mind. It's fine!"
</p>
<p>
As for a hypothetical return - which I was particularly curious about after he made such a close spiritial successor, in 2019's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phoenix-point">Phoenix Point</a> - in whatever form that might take? "Yeah, sure," he said. "I'm still waiting for the call from Sid," he joked, referring to Firaxis' long-serving boss Sid Meier. "Let's see if he calls."
</p>
<p>
As for his current project, it's a smartly-made twist on the genre - a genre Gollop hopes it'll add at least a small dose of innovation to - but whether that smart twist can help a slightly more family-focused game take off in such an intensely competitive field these days is another question. You can read more about that in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/x-coms-creator-believes-the-strategy-genres-in-dire-need-of-innovation-and-his-new-game-is-his-attempt">Chip n' Clawz preview, and full interview with Gollop</a> himself.

			<p>Despite having debuted 11 months ago on the market, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth sold extremely well last month in the United States thanks to its PC release, further highlighting how damaging exclusivity can be.</p>
<p>According to new sales data shared today by Circana (NPD), the second entry in the Remake trilogy, which launched on PC late <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-to-launch-on-pc-on-january-23rd-with-improved-lighting-enhanced-textures-and-nvidia-dlss-support/">last month</a>, was the third best-selling premium game in the United States, right after two huge sellers like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Madden NFL 25. The massive jump in rank of both the standalone game, going from rank 56 to 3, and of the Twin Pack also including Remake, from rank 265 to 16, strongly highlights how well the game sold on PC, despite a port that, while much better than that of the previous entry in the series, still leaves something to be desired, especially in terms of performance.</p>

<p>No matter the platform, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a game that any JRPG fan should definitely experience, as it features an amazing recreation of the remainder of the original's disc one that brings everything good that Remake did to new heights, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>If there’s one word to describe&nbsp;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it would be ambitious. Tetsuya Nomura, Kazushige Nojima, and the rest of Creative Business Unit I at Square-Enix have turned what is merely the remainder of Final Fantasy VII’s Disc One upon leaving Midgar into a 100-hour-long epic. Moments of distracted exploration throughout the massive wide-open environments are often bookended with more linear story segments that balance comedy and somber moments. Players will feel more intimately engrossed with the story of those chosen by the planet and routinely have their fond memories of playing the original tickled with delight. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is an absolute must-play for fans of the series.</em></p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shotgun-cop-man-my-friend-pedro-creator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devolver Digital (because of course) and developer DeadToast Entertainment have announced&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>, the studio's next freewheeling shooter after its debut title&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>.</p>

<p>Described by the two studios as a "devilishly fun ballistic platformer",&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>sees the titular shotgun cop man descending into the depths of hell in order to arrest Satan. Yes, you read that right.</p>

<p>If you've played&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>, then you can probably guess that this game likely won't be too heavy on the story. After all, in&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>'s debut trailer, our hero yells at Satan to freeze, upon which he says "fuck you, Shotgun Cop Man" and flees. It's that sort of soiree.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shotgun-cop-man-gameplay.jpg?itok=xw9FIaSV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shotgun-cop-man-gameplay.jpg?itok=ga44pLn8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>eschews&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>'s 2.5D look for a pure 2D aesthetic.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>promises to continue&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro</em>'s frenetic dual-wielding shooter gameplay, albeit with a much more pleasing to the eye (for me, at least) 2D visual style.</p>

<p>You'll go in armed with Shotgun Cop Man's signature boomstick and pistol, but you'll also be able to acquire other weapons on-site. You won't just be using the guns to shoot bad guys, either; you'll also be using them to traverse the world, propelling yourself through hell by the power of bullets.</p>

<p>Devolver and DeadToast are promising a "hand-crafted campaign" to enjoy, as well as extra No Damage and Speedrun modes if you really want to test your skills against the hordes of hell.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>As well as the aforementioned modes,&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>will also let you create your own levels, and others can play them for "endless replayability". After all, Shotgun Cop Man is going to need a pretty convincing excuse to hang around hell after Satan has been arrested.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966850/Shotgun_Cop_Man/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and Switch when it launches later this year, and a PC demo is available to try out right now.

                <p>NetEase is getting more aggressive when it comes to cracking down on the use of third-party plugins while playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a>. It's now banning the use of an application called Blitz, although NetEase is being lenient in that it won't ban players who previously used the software.</p><p>A notice against using third-party plugins was put out on <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/announcements/20250220/40955_1213199.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals' website</a> today, February 21. It specifically calls out Blitz, a third-party application that can be used while playing games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/league-of-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-40335">League of Legends</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> to gain insight into informative data about competitive games that players can't typically see. In Marvel Rivals' case, NetEase says players using Blitz could see damage and healing statistics, predict the use of Ultimate abilities, and use it to help decide which heroes to ban in competitive play.</p><p>While it's not as aggressive as cheating software that helps players see through walls or always have precise aim, NetEase explained that "we deem this program as cheating software and will no longer allow its use during gameplay." Thankfully for the Marvel Rivals players who use Blitz, this ban is not retroactive.</p><p>"Players who have previously used this software will not face any penalties, as long as you refrain from using it in future games," NetEase explained. "To uphold justice in our gaming universe and protect the integrity of your account, we strongly urge you to refrain from using any third-party plugins. Together, we can forge a vibrant and heroic gaming environment."</p><p>Marvel Rivals is available for free on PC, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S.

			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has launched in a great technical state, bucking the trend of games launching in rather poor states in the 2020s, and feeling almost old-school in this, according to a new in-depth technical analysis shared online.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> recently took a good look at the second entry in the series by Warhorse Studios, highlighting how going with CryEngine was a winning choice. Even in its DirectX 12 form, the game engine developed by Crytek delivers an essentially stutter-free experience even on mid and low-end hardware. On a fairly old Ryzen 5 3600 CPU and RTX 4060 GPU with a truncated PCIe bus, targeting 60 FPS at 1080p resolution at medium settings, which include demanding real-time software ray-traced global illumination, smoothness was impeccable even in areas with high NPC density, with no traversal or shader compilation stuttering, which is quite impressive considering the game doesn't feature visible shader pre-compilation, likely conducted instead during load times and during the game itself in an asynchronous manner that burdens the CPU less, thus allowing even an old CPU to handle the game smoothly. Put against other open-world RPGs running on different engines, like Dragon's Dogma 2 and Avowed, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is the definitive winner in terms not only of performance but of visual quality as well, as the two other games definitely don't deliver the same quality even at similar medium settings.</p>
<p>Besides going over Kingdom Come: Deliverance II's smooth performance, the Digital Foundry analysis goes over the game's excellent lighting and environments, how the Ultra settings are not really worth much, some optimization tips, and more. You can check out the analysis in full below.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about the second entry in the series by Warhorse by reading Chris' glowing<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/"> review.</a></p>

Not only that, but the tool also allows players to predict enemy ultimate cooldowns and "selectively ban heroes", which NetEase says "severely undermin[es]" fairness.</p>

<p>As such, NetEase says it's officially deemed Blitz to be "cheating software", and so using it in the game is no longer allowed. If you've got Blitz installed and you're using it for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it's probably best to uninstall it, and if you aren't using it yet, I wouldn't recommend starting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-blitz-crackdown-magik-black-panther.jpg?itok=vFZbDV8M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-blitz-crackdown-magik-black-panther.jpg?itok=sMYnfYxc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Using Blitz in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is now tantamount to cheating, NetEase says.</figcaption></figure><p>However, if you have used the tool in the past, NetEase says that you "will not face any penalties, as long as you refrain from using it in future games".</p>

<p>The developer closes by imploring players not to use any third-party plugins in order to "uphold justice in our gaming universe and protect the integrity of your account", so it sounds like you'll face a ban if you are caught using Blitz.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Blitz, it's a tool that provides overlays for multiplayer games like <i>League of Legends</i>,&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>, and indeed&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>&nbsp;until today.</p>

<p>Its use is tolerated by other game companies; in fact, according to Blitz itself, the tool is <a href="https://support.blitz.gg/hc/en-us/articles/4415398467737-Can-I-get-banned-for-using-Blitz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">officially recognized by Riot</a>, so&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' stance is perhaps a little unusual among games for which players use the tool.</p>

Heroes like Iron Man, Venom, and Storm do battle across a variety of maps, completing objectives like protecting certain areas or escorting moving objects to their destination.</p>

<p>The game recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">hit 40 million registered players</a>, according to developer NetEase, but that didn't stop the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">closing down the Seattle studio</a> responsible for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em> and laying off all of its employees.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is continuing its run as the best-selling game in the United States (US), taking the top spot for January 2025. It’s the fourth month in a row it has been at number one.</p>



<p>In the latest sales data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxq6xkoc2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, three of the top five spots remained the same with Madden 25 coming in second and EA Sports FC 25 being the fourth-best-selling title. Throughout the rest of the list comes a plethora of changes, including games like Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth having a resurgence after its release on Steam. For comparison, the game was ranked 56th in December 2024.</p>



<p>Rounding out the top five was Minecraft, which jumped up from ninth. </p>



<p>For those looking for new games, only one made the list in January as Donkey Kong Country Returns debuted at number eight. However, in addition to Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, four games finished in the top 20 after being well outside in December</p>

                <p>In late 2019, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds creator Brendan Greene offered the first glimpse of his next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/brendan-playerunknown-greenes-next-game-prologue-i/1100-6472284/" data-ref-id="1100-6472284">Prologue: Go Wayback</a>. Unlike PUBG, Prologue isn't a shooter or a battle royale. Instead, it's a survival game that pits players against bitterly cold elements and a treacherous environment. According to Greene, Prologue's extreme difficulty may cause some players to initially hate it, but he also believes they will eventually embrace it.</p><p>"I expect a lot of people will hate it," Greene told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/i-expect-a-lot-of-people-will-hate-it-pubg-creator-brendan-greene-doesnt-care-if-his-new-game-is-too-hard-for-players-to-handle-as-long-as-it-elicits-a-reaction/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "But that's ok if it elicits a reaction--that's all I want. People didn't get [Battle Royale] at first, but then they did. And I think it's the same with this, the goal here is creating these big, massive worlds for everyone. We already have a demo on Steam, and people understand what it is. So, if it causes a reaction, fantastic. I'll happily talk to them and go, 'Well, yeah, it doesn't handhold because that doesn't serve a purpose.'"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4447932-prologuegowayback.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447932" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4447932-prologuegowayback.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447932"></a><figcaption>A camp fire keeps the player alive in Prologue.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4447932-prologuegowayback.jpg"></figure><p>The player's goal in Prologue is to live long enough to reach a weather station that's randomly located on an 8x8 km map.

The game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> indicates that there are "millions" of possible maps, so there isn't any single path to making it through alive. Regardless of whether the player succeeds or fails, the map will be different the next time they play. Prologue doesn't currently have a release date, but early access is expected to begin in the second quarter of this year.

		<p>The creator of My Friend Pedro has declared his next mission: to blast his way into Hell and arrest Satan. Yup, that’s the plot for the newly revealed ballistic platformer Shotgun Cop Man.</p>
<p>Published by Devolver Digital and by DeadToast Entertainment, Shotgun Cop Man is coming to PC and Switch later this year, but what would you know? It’s Steam Next Fest, so t<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966870/Shotgun_Cop_Man_Demo/">here’s a demo now available for PC</a>!</p>
<p><iframe title="ARREST SATAN in SHOTGUN COP MAN | From the Creator of My Friend Pedro" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cWSNEN2mZH8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>After the balletic combat of My Friend Pedro, solo developer DeadToast has leant into the use of multiple firearms to get through levels. Shotgun Cop Man casts players as the titular lead-slinging cop, heading right down into Hell with the mission to arrest the dark lord armed with nothing bu a shotgun in one hand and a pistol in the other.</p>
<p>These ludicrously overpowered firearms are more than strong enough to propel Shotgun Cop Man through the levels, launching and bouncing him up and over obstacles, acting like Flappy Bird’s wings… but more murdery.</p>

<p>The game will feature feature a hand-crafted campaign, while hardcore fans will enjoy that each level has No Damage and Speedrun achievements to chase after. There will be support for user-generated levels as well.</p>
<p>The demo is out now on Steam featuring 17 levels from the full game.</p>
<p>We loved DeadToast’s last outing with My Friend Pedro. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/20/my-friend-pedro-review/">our review</a> of that sensationalist side-scrolling shooter, Nick said, “If you’ve seen John Wick before, you’ll see Keanu killing about ten villains in mere seconds without breaking a sweat and with insane precision. My Friend Pedro gives you a pretty good idea of what it’s like to be Mr Wick, with time slowing down to a crawl, giving you ample time to shoot everyone in the room. Even better, whenever you kill an enemy, the slow time bar replenishes, enabling you to pull off even more crazy stunts.”</p>

<p>Total video games sales in the United States (US) for January 2025 have fallen 15% year-over-year with hardware taking the biggest nose dive. This comes from the latest information for Circana and continues a trend of declining sales across the board.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lioxqlzmm42w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the data company</a>, January 2025 saw hardware sales fall by a massive 45% to $205 million while accessories fell 28% to $194M compared to January 2024. The $205 million in hardware spending represents the lowest January total for hardware since January 2020 saw just $131 million.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that January 2025’s data accounts for four weeks while January 2024 was five weeks. However, with drops that substantial, one more week likely isn’t something that would’ve made much of a difference.</p>



<p>Circana’s Mat Piscatella says that double-digit percentage drops happened across all of the major consoles. Nintendo Switch, which has its successor launching this year, fell 53% year-over-year while Xbox fell 50%. PlayStation 5 came in third, but still dropped 38% in total.</p>



<p>Despite the drop, PlayStation 5 remained the top-selling console in terms of both units and dollars. Xbox Series was second in dollars while Switch was second in units sold.</p>



<p>Moving on to accessories, the PlayStation Portal remained the top-selling accessory in terms of dollars. For units sold, the DualSense Wireless Midnight Black controller led the way.</p>



<p>Lastly, regarding the sales of the PlayStation 5 Pro, Piscatella says that its sales pace has fallen behind that of the PlayStation 4 Pro after three months.</p>
