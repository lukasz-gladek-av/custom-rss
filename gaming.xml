			<p>The next entry in the Call of Duty series launching later this year could feature up to a total of six fully-fledged zombies maps throughout its lifecycle, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>A new report shared today by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-zombies-maps-details/">Insider Gaming</a> revealed that developer Treyarch's plan for zombies was to create maps from the ground up to allow them to be used in different play modes, like traditional round-based modes, grief, and outbreak. As for the settings, Treyarch has been experimenting with some extreme scenarios, including a post-World War II New York map devastated by a nuclear attack, a map set in a Japanese temple located at the foot of a volcano, a space station map, and others. It is unclear if all of these maps will make the cut, but according to today's report, some of them are expected to be released for the final game.</p>
<p>The next entry in the Call of Duty series has yet to be officially revealed, but leaks have already revealed that the game codenamed Saturn will be a semi-futuristic sequel to Black Ops 2, which will also feature remastered maps from the classic entry in the series. The game's development is reportedly being led by Treyarch Games, which released the solid Black Ops 6 last year on PC and consoles.

			<p>Despite the deluge of other shopkeep simulators and crafting games, the Atelier series has something like a comforting warm blanket. It’s a long-running RPG series that tends to focus more on the day-to-day life of being an alchemist and creating goods for the common folk. While the series has shied away from the mundane as the series has gone on, the spirit of creativity and crafting remains at its core. After a three-game run with Ryza Stout, Gust has finally introduced the latest entry in the series with <a href="https://wccftech.com/atelier-yumia-ps5-preview-alchemy-finally-comes-to-xbox/">Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</a>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Atelier-Yumia-Memories.png"></a></figure>

<p>As is the case with most of the subseries of Atelier, players don’t necessarily need to play any of the previous titles to fully comprehend the setting or core gameplay mechanics. That’s in part due to most Atelier trilogies mixing up the combat and crafting mechanics from one series to the next, and Atelier Yumia is no exception. The tough constraints of taking time to craft against an ever-dwindling calendar are long gone, and so much of Atelier’s focus this time around is on the adventure outside of the atelier rather than the mysteries within.</p>
<p>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land centers around the titular Yumia Liessfeldt, an already somewhat established alchemist who’s been dabbling in the taboo arts that once sought the great kingdom of Aladiss ruin. In her role as the junior member of an exploratory group put together to explore abandoned ruins and learn the mysteries of what happened, she’s often stigmatized for her craft. There’s good reason for many of these expeditionary forces to be wary of her, as alchemy had led to a number of great catastrophes in their lifetime. Nevertheless, Yumia’s goal in all of this is to uncover the mysteries of just what happened to make alchemy such a feared topic and track down her missing mother in the process.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Atelier-Yumia-Journal.png"></a></figure>

<p>The open world of Atelier Yumia is filled with so many little landmarks and items to gather that you can barely walk ten feet without bumping into another point of interest. In my OCD nature, I found myself aiming to reach 100% of each of the continent’s four regions for both achievements and a sense of completion. From locked treasure chests to small shrines of power that need basic logic puzzles completed before they confer their skill points to Yumia, there are often times too many little side diversions that keep the player from following along with Atelier Yumia’s storyline. In many ways, Gust shows its influence from the likes of Genshin Impact and tries to capture some of that Chinese title’s energy and design. When there’s no time limit to finish the story and bag space large enough to fit the materials of an entire house in your bag, there’s little reason not to just wander the open plains of Aladiss, beat up a Puni or two, and just spend the afternoon ticking off completion checkmarks for every little node that pops up on the map.</p>
<p>Something I didn’t realize until my thirtieth hour of playing Atelier Yumia is that the expeditionary force has a small checklist of activities they would like Yumia to take care of for them in each region as part of their Pioneering Effort. These range from using a specific item or character skill in combat to crafting specific pieces of furniture and the like. Initially, I thought these were just another way to gain experience and skill points, but I finally realized that completing this evergrowing checklist in each region, at least in the case of the first two, unlocks special ammo for Yumia’s gunstaff that can be used to break some of the barriers in her path. If you come across marbled walls that seem brittle to the touch or a spider’s web blocking access to a treasure chest, that’s how Yumia comes across these different ammo types.</p>
<p>One thing that I wish I had known sooner was that she has to return to the leader of the expeditionary force each time she crosses the 10% threshold on the completion list to cash in her current progress, earn a small reward, and unlock the next tier of objectives. Only by completing this list to 100% in a given region does Yumia unlock the special ammo or other tool to aid in her adventure. There isn’t a quest marker or anything obvious to guide the player, so it’s worth checking up on the expedition team once in a while if you feel like you’ve done enough to further the cause.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Atelier-Yumia-Greenhouse-1.png"></a></figure>

<p>Combat in the Atelier series has typically been a turn-based affair, or at least something more methodical. Atelier Yumia mixes up the formula by instead turning the entire focus of combat into an action affair. Yumia and her two party members can all act independently (with some AI strategies for the characters not actively being controlled) and attack the enemy all at once. Rather than being able to freely run around the battlefield, Yumia fights the enemy by circling around them in two set planes where she can fight from either short or long range with a single button press jumping between the two distances. Players can strafe around the enemy or block attacks, with perfectly timed defensive moves giving a powerful counterattack.</p>
<p>Yumia and her crew don’t have your standard attack and separate skill commands, but rather, all four of their attack commands are skills unique to that character and differ depending on if they’re approaching the enemy from short or long range. Each skill has a set number of uses before it needs to recharge over time, so players have to manage whether they want to burst all of their damage at once or play conservatively and keep a couple of skills on reserve for a precision counterattack. The items Yumia crafts operate in a similar fashion and are just a quick button press away to swap from skills to items. Yumia can carry four different attack items into combat, and much like other Atelier games, understanding the crafting system to make overpowered weapons is, while not required, sometimes the most enjoyable way to play as it makes combat little more than a formality. By the time I was set to venture off between the second and third biomes of Aladiss, I already had a wind boomerang and massive ice hammer that could hit for somewhere in the region of 5,000-12,000 damage, depending on the enemy’s weakness.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Atelier-Yumia-Nice-Levelup.png"></a></figure>

<p>Another strange oddity to Atelier Yumia’s combat that helped turn the combat into a breeze was the actual EXP rate. It wasn’t uncommon for me to go two, maybe three fights at a time between leveling up. My concerns of only having two or so combat skills available from my preview of Atelier Yumia last month were quickly resolved as I was already close to level 40 before even setting foot in the Atelier for the first time. It’s hard to say whether this was an intentional growth rate or merely the unintended side effect of testing out the various difficulty levels and the one EXP-boosting accessory I could craft early on. Regardless, I hit the level cap of 100 midway through the second biome of Aladiss and only had to worry about crafting stronger armor and combat items for the growth of my party. Grinding never felt like it was necessary with how quickly I was leveling up, although I did see myself hunting down a few specific enemy types over and over to gather up their raw materials for crafting.</p>
<p>The actual art of crafting items in your atelier is something that sets this alchemy RPG series apart from one another, even in terms of individual trilogies. Where Yumia draws her inspiration from are memories of items, remembering the base materials they’re made from and combining those raw goods with an elemental alchemy core to recreate the image in her mind rather than throwing it all together in a massive melting pot as is series tradition. This allows Yumia to craft simpler things on the go, from bandages and repair kits to the various ammo types for her gunstaff. More complex items, i.e., anything usable in battle, do require the use of an atelier or at least a mobile crafting station she can put down in any of the buildable campsites around Aladiss. There’s a strange minigame to crafting, where Yumia has to install the raw materials into her alchemy core and use the resonance area that each material has to capture stray mana particles and make the particular item stronger based on a number of arbitrary factors per recipe. If all of this sounds too complex, players can just push the touchpad when beginning a recipe and pick whether they want a high-quality item with stronger innate effects or the bare minimum made with the cheapest materials possible.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Atelier-Yumia-Combat.png"></a></figure>

<p>Building campsites and rest stations across Aladiss in also a simple automatically guided affair if you want it to be. Sure, you can build yourself the crafting stations and meticulously craft your ideal atelier on the go and build everything from the walls to the individual chairs yourself, or there are prefab recipe guides where you can just throw your extra wood and metal resources in at once and come out with a perfectly functional two-story abode. It’s a nice touch for those who like to fully immerse themselves in the RPG and show off their own style, but in a single-player JRPG with no way to share your creations outside of posting screenshots on social media, may be a bit much for the average gamer.</p>

<p>Calling Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land a guided JRPG experience is probably the best way to recommend this title to others. Everything bar the combat has been streamlined and simplified to make this entry the most approachable one to date for newcomers. Series veterans might not find much of a challenge to this mystery, but Gust has put together a solid first experience to bring the long-running alchemy RPG series to Xbox.</p>

            <p>Fans of damp tunnels and chatty skeletons may have enjoyed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lunacid">Lunacid</a>, a first-person dungeon crawler which left early access in October 2023. Sin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lunacid-is-lo-fi-first-person-dungeon-skulking-done-right">called it</a> “lo-fi first-person dungeon skulking done right” and suggested that it “could well earn a place in some best of the year lists”. (It didn’t appear on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-24-favourite-games-of-2023">ours</a>, but in fairness, that was the year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> devoured everybody’s brain.) </p>
<p>Lunacid takes copious inspiration from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> developer FromSoftware’s old Shadow Tower and King’s Field games for PS1. Now, creators KIRA LLC are going even further with Lunacid: Tears Of The Moon - a new RPG made using FromSoftware’s ancient Sword Of Moonlight: King’s Field game creation tools from 2000, which came with hundreds of map parts, objects and characters plus scripting features and the ability to insert AVI movies and even a credits reel.</p><!--more-->
<p><a href="https://en.swordofmoonlight.org/wiki/Sword_of_Moonlight">Officially released only in Japan</a>, Sword Of Moonlight granted buyers unlimited use of the King's Field intellectual property, including the right to release and sell their own games. While hardly the Unity Engine of its day, it fostered a quietly thriving fangame scene with projects such as <a href="https://kings-field.neocities.org/som/dom/info">Diadem Of Maunstraut</a> finding an audience overseas.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t jive with elderly fangames, Lunacid - Tears of the Moon has charm. Like many a FromSoftwork, it takes place in a fallen kingdom and sees you journeying underground to soothe/defeat a restless cosmic being. Not being familiar with Sword Of Moonlight, I can’t say how much it tests the capabilities of FromSoftware’s 25-year-old toolset, but I enjoy the lurid smog of the dungeons and the lumbering choreography of the first-person combat.</p>
<p>Tears Of The Moon will release on 12th April 2025 - here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3506110/Lunacid__Tears_of_the_Moon/">Steam page</a>. While reading up on Sword Of Moonlight, I also stumbled on <a href="https://swordofmoonlight.itch.io/k">this King’s Field 2 preservation project</a>, which makes use of the same tools. It seems like a noble enterprise, though sadly the creator has run into difficulties following a schizophrenia diagnosis. If you’re checking out Tears Of The Moon, maybe show this some love, too.</p>
<p>Thanks to SeekerX for spotting this one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Varesa and Iansan join the fray.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.5 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [122 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Day of the Flame’s Return,” will launch on March 26, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [187 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-950103"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Venturing into the southwestern reaches of Natlan, players will meet a new tribe, the Collective of Plenty, and explore the Great Volcano of Tollan, where they may begin their journey towards the sacred city. Meanwhile, Varesa, a new ally, and the long-awaited Iansan will become playable alongside a new Saurian companion, the Tatankasaurus, all to collectively enrich combat and exploration!</p><p>Long revered as a sacred mountain, the Great Volcano of Tollan now extends its fiery embrace to all players who dare to tread its depths— where traces of its rich, layered history lie hidden, where a sacred city built by the Dragonborn slumbers, slowly roused by the restless roiling of magma beneath. Players can enter the Sacred City of Tollan through a special method, and set out to unravel the mystery of the “Flamelord’s Blessing” and the enigma surrounding their Little One.</p><p>On the path to the sacred mountain, players will encounter a new tribe, the Collective of Plenty. The people there are deeply devoted to fitness and love to test their strength in friendly competitions. Nurtured by fertile volcanic soil, the tribe’s harvest is blessed with exceptionally sweet and juicy fruits. However, the volcano, though usually simmering in silence, can occasionally spring to life and spew out showers of falling rocks. When this happens, players can transform into the Tatankasaurus, a new Saurian from the Collective of Plenty, capable of smashing through large chunks of Pulverite and even briefly dashing across water or liquid Phlogiston.</p><p>New Saurians roam this scorching land, as do the Collective of Plenty’s noble warriors. Among them are Varesa and Iansan, who can sprint and perform flying leaps as they traverse Natlan’s terrain.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_950104"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Varesa is a 5-star Electro Catalyst user who uses Plunging Attacks to trigger her Fiery Passion state. While in this state, she deals more Electro DMG, and can access a special Elemental Burst with reduced Energy cost. To quickly enter this state, Varesa can tap her Elemental Skill, then follow up with Normal Attacks to perform swift Plunging Attacks. Additionally, her unique talent helps restore Phlogiston after the party consumes food. As her Tribal Chronicle will reveal, Varesa is only fierce in battle, and leads a daily life almost far too laid-back.</p><p>Known as Varesa’s coach and one of the six heroes of Natlan, Iansan is a 4-star Electro Polearm wielder. She provides powerful support to the party by enhancing the on-field character’s ATK while also healing her allies. Her Elemental Burst increases the on-field character’s ATK even when she is off-field, and her ATK buff scales with the distance that her teammates move. Additionally, when her teammates trigger a Nightsoul Burst, Iansan obtains the Warming Up effect, allowing her to continuously restore HP to the on-field character for a short duration. In the first phase of Version 5.5’s Event Wishes, Varesa and Iansan will debut alongside Xianyun’s rerun, followed by reruns for Xilonen and Venti.</p><p>After a long hiatus, Natlan’s traditional Bloomflower Trials will be making a return. Players will team up with Mavuika, Ifa, and their other Natlan allies to participate in this unique event, and save a brave Saurian afflicted by a rare illness. Moreover, in the “Saurian Treasure Seeker” mini-game, players can also assist a group of baby Saurians in their quest to overcome obstacles and collect shiny treasures. By taking part in the event, players will have the opportunity to invite Ororon for free.</p><p>Version 5.5 also introduces new challenges and system optimizations. A new boss, the Lava Dragon Statue, awaits in the geothermal fissures of the volcano. As for optimizations, the Artifact leveling experience will be enhanced, as upgrading Artifacts defined with Sanctifying Elixirs guarantees at least two upgrades to the defined Minor Affixes.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,048 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,878 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,805 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,599 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.

The player takes on the role of an adventurer tasked with saving a town plagued by a curse, while exploring dungeons filled with hidden treasures. However, within the dungeons, curses can suddenly befall the player due to enemy attacks, treasure chest traps, or certain locations. Curses are not just a disadvantage—if brought back to town and purified, they can be used to strengthen the player. Players will need to decide how long they can endure the curse as they press forward.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The gameplay system follows the traditional command battle RPG format, with turn-based battles that split the party into a vanguard and rearguard. The player’s party will consist of a variety of classes, with the following five revealed so far: Fighter, Barbarian, Archer, Paladin, and Sorcerer. Additional classes are expected to be revealed in the future.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Curse_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Curse_003.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Curse_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Project Name: <em>Gobble</em></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 5, Switch</li><li><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Genre:</strong> <a title="Genres > Side-Scrolling [931 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/side-scrolling">Side-Scrolling</a> Action</li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>Gobble</em> is a side-scrolling action game that originated from Nippon Ichi Software’s annual internal competition, the “Nippon Ichi Project Festival.” The game was conceived by an employee in their second year at Nippon Ichi Software, who is now serving as the project’s development manager. Past contests have resulted in the creation of titles like <em>htoL#NiQ: The Firefly Diary</em>, <em>Yomawari: Night Alone</em>, and <em>The Liar Princess and the Blind Prince</em>.</p><p>The game is set in a world that should have found peace after the defeat of the Demon King. The protagonist, a young boy, encounters a talking “sickle” during a sudden monster attack. The brash sickle and the boy, who is searching for his missing family, form a duo, and a quirky, dark adventure begins.</p><p>The key mechanic in the game is “predation.” By consuming defeated enemies, the sickle can steal their abilities.</p><p>The game stands out with its distinctive use of American comic-style events and cartoon-like animations. Players should also pay attention to the visuals featured throughout the game, during moments like attacking or defeating enemies, or when events occur.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_003.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_004.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_005.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_006.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_007.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_008.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_009.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Project Name: <em>Kyouran</em></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 5, Switch</li><li><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2026</li><li><strong>Genre:</strong> <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,528 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">Action RPG</a></li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Kyouran_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>Kyouran</em> is an action RPG developed by the main staff behind the <em><a title="Series > Disgaea [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> series.

The game features Sayaka Oda’s signature hand-drawn graphics and portrays a darker, more unusual world compared to previous titles. It focuses on young girls suffering from trauma, whose altered picture book worlds are housed within a strange library.</p><p>To return from picture book worlds to the human world, the player must collect “memory fragments” scattered throughout the picture book. This is done by using the powers of a goat monster, which can eat and destroy the picture book world, and a girl who can alter the paper-made backgrounds within the book’s world.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Shinigami-Hime_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Shinigami-Hime_003.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Shinigami-Hime_004.jpg"></a></figure></div><p>Watch the full archive of the Nippon Ichi Software UNTITLED// event below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Since it was first revealed, Rebellion's upcoming game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/atomfall/" data-ref-id="5000-631970">Atomfall</a> has often been compared to Bethesda's Fallout. While both games do share a few similarities--from post-apocalyptic themes to killer robots--Rebellion says the game is more than just Fallout with a British coat of paint.</p><p>"Once you play it for a bit, you're like, 'oh, this is its own thing for sure,'" art director Ryan Greene explained to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-atomfall-developers-knew-it-would-be-compared-to-fallout-as-soon-as-it-was-revealed-average-playthrough-around-25-hours" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "And one of our owners, Jason Kingsley, he's a big Fallout fan, so inevitably there was going to be some parallels in that any kind of survival in the apocalypse, immediately Fallout's going to come up as a thing. And those guys are great at what they do. And that's cool. The reality is, here's this very successful franchise and we're version 1.0. To be compared to those guys--thank you very much--yes, we appreciate it because that’s a skillful team that's making that stuff."</p><p>Another key differentiator in the game is its lack of a traditional main quest, as players will instead work their way through several interconnected stories that all eventually connect to the overarching mystery of the game. Greene added that Atomfall will even allow you to adopt a non-lethal approach to playing the game, and he's "fairly certain" that the game can be completed without needing to kill a single person.</p><p>In his hands-on impressions of Atomfall, GameSpot's Jake Dekkeras wrote about how the game has more in common with cult-classic investigative adventure <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/paradise-killer/" data-ref-id="5000-506065">Paradise Killer</a> than Fallout.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1230313219" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> looks set to let you increase the stats of your Pokémon, fans say, after code snippets relating to the feature were spotted in a fresh datamine. 
</p>
<p>
References to systems for a "stat increase" as well as to a "Hyper Training Service" have been found by <a href="https://x.com/thepokemodgroup/status/1900247443666854310">prolific Pokémon Go dataminers The Pokemod Group</a>, and suggest players will be able to boost a Pokémon's attack, defense or stamina.
</p>
<p>
Hyper Training is a feature from the main Pokémon games that allows you to max out a creature's stats - referred to as its IVs - using a currency known as Bottle Caps.
</p>
<p>
The system means you can turn a Pokémon with good stats into one with better or even perfect stats, making it more competitive in battles, including with other players.
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go has never had a system like this before, though fans have long discussed how it might work. On the one hand, the ability to boost stats brings with it questions of balance, and concerns over how much a Bottle Cap might be sold for. 
</p>
<p>
On the other, there are plenty of players with 98% stat Pokémon who would love to turn them into perfect 100% Pokémon instead, and secure a "hundo".
</p>
<p>
In Pokémon Go, hardcore fans play and pay repeatedly for the chance to earn hundo stat Pokémon from raid battles, with hundreds of tries likely needed. Any item that could be used to shortcut this system would be a major shakeup, and likely be highly valued.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, the suggestion this potentially-lucrative feature is coming to Pokémon Go now has led to discussion among fans that this is a design decision driven by changes to the ownership of the game.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, it was confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">developer Niantic planned to sell Pokémon Go to Monopoly Go maker Scopely</a>, as part of a $3.5bn deal.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Niantic for more.

		<p>It’s been another great week of gaming at TSA Towers, and for me, that’s meant more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. I’m taking my time rounding out my endgame loadout, as I don’t want to burn through literally everything before Title Update 1 drops with new enemies and quests. Other than that, I’ve been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>, enjoying how different it is to my normal fantasy/sci-fi selections. I’m also hopping into Mecha Break, and Titan Quest II, while rounding out a retro-infused review of the Retroid Pocket 5.</p>

<p>First up, as is tradition, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2. Similarly, <strong>Aran</strong> has been in <em>his</em> gaming happy place by playing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt again. He tolds us, “I’ve got the DLC left to do and the final parts of the main quest. All treasure hunts have been completed, all base game contracts fulfilled, and side quests done. Unlike my first playthrough, I have not subjected myself to uncovering all the question marks.”</p>
<p>It’s not all been a Geralt love in though, as he continues, “I’ve also started a new Football Manager 2024 save and a random team picker has pointed me in the direction of FC Brea. They play in the 5th tier of Spanish football, have a 900 capacity stadium, and have no transfer budget. My challenge is to make them a titan unless I get fired. Doesn’t help the board want me to just avoid relegation.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Jim</strong> has been glued to Mafia III this week and hopes to put a bow on it before the end of the month. He says, “As a sucker for third person cover-based shooters, it’s been a while since I’ve seen those mechanics in a modern AAA game and while Mafia III isn’t quite as fun or fluid as the GOAT, Uncharted 4, it’s got some seriously sharp writing and great set pieces.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been in the hospital this week – get well soon buddy! – which he pegs as, “playing real-life Theme Hospital”. He’s hoping to be well enough for some relaxing gaming, which will probably be Nintendo-flavoured.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing some Assassin’s Creed Shadows as part of our upcoming coverage, as well as Phasmophobia and Balatro.This has been mirrored by Ade who’s game-time has been pretty much non-stop 24-7 all encompassing Assassin’s Creed: Shadows to be review ready for next week. Are you excited?</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> is on his travels in Kanazawa, playing the game of parenting on holiday. He says, “I did see an awesome, original PS1 box in the lobby of this hotel when I checked in last night. Was very impressed. Will take a pic on the way out the door today so everyone can partake in the natsukashii!”</p>
<p>And rounding out the week,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has just got code for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/expelled-is-a-murderous-sequel-to-overboard-coming-out-in-march/">Expelled!</a> the boarding school sequel to Overboard! and he’s looking forward to checking it out over the weekend. Aside from that, he got an early look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-going-free-to-play-and-brings-big-tech-improvements/">Rainbow Six Siege X</a>, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-new-dual-front-mode-why-just-attack-or-defend-when-you-can-do-both/">its new 6v6 game mode</a>, and took a trip to see Steel Hunters, the upcoming mech multiplayer game from Wargaming.</p>
<p>How about you? What have you played?</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/atelier-yumia-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atelier-yumia-review-open-world-woes.1134510/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/atelier-yumia-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <em>Atelier</em> franchise has changed quite a bit over the last few decades. Starting as short, slice-of-life stories, modern entries now feature lengthier adventures and more open worlds. <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3637a1d4-7598-4900-8ea2-69bcc2be9585" href="https://techraptor.net/games/atelier-yumia-alchemist-of-memories-envisioned-land" rel="nofollow">Atelier Yumia</a> </em>brings these changes to their natural conclusion, featuring the largest areas seen in the series so far while also simplifying many of the mechanics to make them more appealing to a new audience.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while not being particularly terrible, this leads to a final product that fails to excel in any area. <em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> loses the little depth that was left in the <em>Atelier Ryza</em> trilogy, all for a stale open world and underbaked narrative.</p>



<h2>A World Where Alchemy is Taboo</h2>

<p><em>Atelier Yumia</em> sees the titular alchemist traveling across various regions of Aladiss, a place once home to a great empire before it fell to ruin. Joining the Aladiss Research Team, she makes use of alchemy — something considered taboo due to its perceived dangers — to pioneer this long-unexplored continent.</p>

<p>Alchemy’s role in the <em>Atelier</em> series is one that’s always changed, so having it be something that’s considered “evil” in <em>Atelier Yumia</em> doesn’t feel too out of place. There was definitely some potential for conflict with the main cast and the people that Yumia encounters during her journey across Aladiss.</p>

<p>In practice, this doesn’t actually lead to much. A few party members are slightly wary early on, with the negative history of alchemy having its moments during the story. And yet, there’s not really any depth to the conversation around alchemy at any point. Yumia ruminates over it multiple times, but it all boils to down to “what if alchemy is good… AND bad.”</p>

<p>Yumia herself is fine as a character. Even if the general discussion around whether alchemy is really evil isn’t handled in an interesting way, Yumia’s journey to find her place in the research team is often endearing. Other characters aren’t quite as lucky.</p>

There are only a small handful of events per party member, with most offering very little in the way of characterization or just rehashing what we already know about them thanks to the story.</p>

<p>Things are worse when you look outside of the main party. Other than the 6 core party members, there are surprisingly few characters that actually have any importance. This is especially true of the villains, who barely make an appearance for most of the game and have the depth of a puddle.</p>

<h2>The Open World Still Lacks Purpose</h2>

<p>In many ways, the Aladiss continent itself is intended to be the main star of the show. For the first time in the series, <em>Atelier Yumia</em> contains a fully connected map with no loading screens — well, it’s more like 4 distinct regions connected by short corridors, but the point still stands.</p>

<p>You’re free to explore each region as you reach them, roaming around for materials, chests, and collectibles. Outside of some areas requiring specific items and later regions being locked behind story, you have a lot of freedom in where to go.</p>



<p>After being left to my own devices, it was initially exciting having a less linear experience to look forward too. The <em>Atelier</em> franchise has attempted open worlds in their own ways a few times, but even <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e767a144-72f1-42ad-b6f0-926fbc24ca13" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/atelier-ryza-3-alchemist-of-end-secret-key-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Atelier Ryza 3</em></a> didn’t make use of areas this large.</p>

<p>However, it didn’t take long for me to realise that there just isn’t that much to actually discover in each area. Sure, opening the map shows lots of “?” markers, but the world itself is devoid of actual unique landmarks or secrets.</p>

<p>Across a region, you’ll find the same sets of materials, the same enemies (or slightly resized/recolored ones), and chests with mostly useless items. You’re never rewarded for going off the beaten path, as all you’ll find are materials you have an abundance of already.</p>

<p>Adding to this repetition are the Prayer Shrines scattered across each region. Every single one works the same way: interact with them, go to the points marked on the map, and complete basic tile puzzles. I was already bored of doing these after the first few times, and there are over 50 in total.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-prayer-shrines.jpg?itok=GbuF05zD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-prayer-shrines.jpg?itok=wmBkjlzo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Puzzle design never gets much more complicated than moving a block to the panel right next to it.</figcaption></figure><p>In the end, the world just feels like a checklist, something to fill in and move on rather than properly engage with. Some decent sidequests could have given purpose to more of the map, but most just require you to hand over materials or create a specific item.</p>

<p>Moving to a proper open world also comes with the question of how you’ll balance combat, since players could potentially encounter tough enemies early on if they’re not careful. <em>Atelier Yumia</em> tackles this by removing the challenge from battles entirely.</p>

<h2>Atelier Yumia’s Combat is a Bland Mess</h2>

<p>The <em>Atelier Ryza</em> trilogy started to shift battles to a more actiony style, with <em>Atelier Yumia </em>switching things over to full real-time combat. You can actively dodge attacks, or move out of the way of AOE markers. You don’t have complete control however, with movement constrained to inner and outer rings you can switch between freely.</p>

<p>Each character has access to 4 skills while standing in each ring, which charge up over time. Some skills can be used repeatedly as a combo, while others require recharging after a single use. Items also function this way, though finite consumables have not been a thing in <em>Atelier</em> combat for a while now anyway.</p>



<p>Skill can have certain effects (Yumia can buff her attack or debuff the enemy), but in practice, all you really do is mash your basic combo and then use one of the other skills while it recharges. There’s no depth, no thought you have to put in. What you see in the first few hours is essentially what you’ll be doing during the endgame.</p>

<p>A few systems have been implemented in a vain attempt to give combat some sort of interesting hook. Using physical or magic attacks on an enemy enough times will stun them, letting you follow up with stronger item attacks. But this is never actually needed since your regular attacks are always more than enough to take on every enemy.</p>

<p>It’s annoying that, despite the switch to action combat, everything is more restrictive. You can’t switch targets — a lot of enemies are even grouped together with a single health bar — and you rarely have a reason to switch between characters.</p>

<h2>Alchemy Lost Its Depth</h2>

<p>Another part of why combat is so easy comes down to alchemy. Alchemy has always allowed players to become super powerful if they made use of its systems, synthesizing broken gear or items as soon as possible.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-alchemy.jpg?itok=S59NyV1W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-alchemy.jpg?itok=zV8W0lVQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Alchemy generally boils down to spamming the highest quality materials you have.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Atelier Yumia</em>’s issue is that alchemy has been simplified to a level where making overpowered gear requires very little effort. In the past, you’d have to think more about the types of materials used, taking traits from them and transferring them over to the finished product.</p>

<p>Now, most bonuses are determined by skills you select before synthesis, or via Trait Crystals you can equip after. Alchemy just boils down to throwing in your highest-quality items and making use of the building system to duplicate them for free (more on this in a minute).</p>

<p>By the second region, I was already making gear that easily destroyed anything I encountered — even the few bosses <em>Atelier Yumia</em> has went down in a minute. Again, this is not something completely new to <em>Atelier</em>. But the process of making gear has just been dumbed down completely, meaning that even tackling harder difficulties takes much less preparation.</p>

<h2>Building Had Potential But is Underutilized</h2>

<p>One bizarre aspect of <em>Atelier Yumia</em> is building. Some areas of the map are designated as areas where you can build structures. This system is surprisingly robust, letting you create multistory houses to fill with decorations and crafting stations. There are presets if you want to quickly create a base, and even the option to make random ones.</p>

<p>I call this bizarre because there’s essentially no reason to actually make a proper base. You get the same benefit from building a fully furnished base as you would from making a shack with 50 chairs stacked into each other. A strange choice, when a good chunk of chest rewards in the open world are more building items you’ll now likely never use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-building.jpg?itok=N3mg2MJ1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atelier-yumia-review-building.jpg?itok=xszJi64o 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You might not like it, but this is what peak comfort looks like.</figcaption></figure><p>It has so much potential — imagine if you could build rooms for party members to unlock new events or create new towns for NPCs. Instead, you’re restricted to small squares of land that are spread far apart.</p>

<p>Most of the time, you’re better off using land for greenhouses or manufacturing plants. These let you duplicate raw materials and crafted items respectively, only taking time to do so. Greenhouses unlock incredibly early, reducing the need for gathering materials. It’s convenient, but it also doesn’t mesh with an open world that mostly just exists for gathering materials in the first place.</p>

<p>I can only hope that this is expanded upon in <em>Atelier Yumia 2</em> (or a potential spin-off), as freeform building really feels like it could be an interesting direction for the series to take.</p>

<h2>Some Visual Improvements, Though PC Port Might Have Issues</h2>

<p>Modern <em>Atelier</em> has never been at the forefront of graphic fidelity, though <em>Atelier Yumia</em> does try to improve in some aspects. For one, characters are far more expressive. Early 3D <em>Atelier</em> titles often had character models that could look lifeless, relying on great 2D character portraits to carry things instead.</p>

<p>For <em>Atelier Yumia</em>, it seems like a lot of work has been done to fix this. From subtle eye movements to cocky grins, the main cast are far more lively now. Granted, the actual models still have a few issues (namely, low-resolution textures at times), though it's a welcome improvement.</p>

<p>Environments, on the other hand, aren't a huge improvement, though some of this can likely be chalked up to the focus on bigger areas compared to previous games. Some areas suffer from poor draw distances and pop-in, too, though this isn't overly common.</p>

<p>One area that I'm not 100% sold on is performance. While I have confirmation that a day 1 patch is intended to fix this, I ran into a number of issues with performance. This was almost exclusively tied to travelling between regions or making use of fast travel, causing my framerate to drop significantly until reloading my save.</p>

<p>Outside of this, everything generally ran at a solid 120fps on an RTX 3060 TI, barring a couple of areas with heavier visual effects. Again, this is something that shouldn't be present at launch, though it's worth keeping in mind when looking back at other Atelier ports on PC pre-<em>Ryza 3</em>.</p>

<h2>Atelier Yumia Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Atelier Yumia</em> has no elements that are inherently awful, but the changes it makes to the series don’t work overall. Future games need to rethink some of the simplifications to synthesis while also figuring out a way to make open worlds that are actually worth exploring.</p>

We discussed this Pokémon in detail already, but in short, the new Trainer cards in Space-Time Smackdown have shifted the fundamentals of competitive battling so much that Darkrai’s bench-sitting playstyle is simultaneously one of the safest and most dangerous options you can find.</p><p>That said, a single Pokemon can’t carry a deck, and Darkrai ex really needs a companion that can hit for huge damage on the front lines. You might think this calls for a heavy hitter like Nidoqueen or Toxicroak, but it turns out the answer is…Magnezone? An Electric-type Pokémon who consumes Electric Energy every time it attacks? How does that work?</p><p>It’s a weird card choice on paper, but in practice, Magnezone isn’t just a great companion to Darkrai ex; it’s a powerful card that you can theoretically fit into any deck, regardless of element. Here’s how it works.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: No matter how much I may or may not hype up any cards in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, I <em>do not </em>encourage you to spend money on the game, even if you have cash to spare. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gacha-loot-box-gambling-1851690838&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gacha-loot-box-gambling-1851690838">This is a gacha game at its core</a></span>, and with that comes aggressive psychological manipulation to encourage you to spend more than you normally would.

The new variant of Magnemite found in the Space-Time Smackdown expansion only inflicts 10 damage, but you can use any type of Energy to activate it. Truthfully, you’ll hardly ever use this attack, but it’s nice to have the option in case it’s all you have in the early game. The real hero here is the Magneton variant found in the base Genetic Apex set, all because of its ability <strong>Volt Charge</strong>. This attaches an Electric Energy to the magnet monster every turn (so long as you remember to use it). <strong>Magneton and Magnezone both only <em>need</em> one Electric Energy, so you can still use Dark-type Energy to build up their attacks</strong>.</p><p>In a perfect world, the Darkrai ex and Magneton strategy looks like this: lead with a wall like <strong>Druddigon </strong>or <strong>Kangaskhan</strong>, and keep Darkrai ex and Magnemite on your bench. Evolve Magnemite into Magneton, stall the game so Magneton can passively accrue Electric Energy, and keep attaching Dark Energy to Darkrai ex to chip away at your opponent’s health. Switch to Magnezone once you can (either after your wall is knocked out or by using the <strong>Leaf </strong>Trainer Card), and start laying the smack down with its 110 damage <strong>Thunder Blast </strong>attack. If Magnezone goes down, or it runs out of Electric Energy, bring in Darkrai ex to clean up the rest of the game. Because Darkrai ex is the only ex card in this deck, it’s best used after your opponent has already scored two other KOs, unless you know you can lock in a victory by bringing it in later.</p><p><strong>What makes Magnezone so deadly is that, even if you can’t stall, it’s <em>still</em> very powerful</strong>. For example, let’s say you start the game with a Magnemite, Magneton, <em>and </em>Magnezone. Evolve Magnemite into Magneton as soon as you can, and activate Volt Charge upon evolution. Then on your following turn, make sure to use Volt Charge again <em>before </em>evolving Magneton into Magnezone, and just like that, you have two Electric Energy that are good for two uses of Thunder Blast. Slap Dark Energy on it to meet the three Energy minimum requirement, and you can immediately begin to pick up easy KOs. Alternatively, if your opponent has a relatively weak monster on the front lines, you can keep Magneton in play and use <strong>Spinning Attack </strong>to pick up a KO without consuming valuable Electric Energy. It’s surprisingly versatile!</p><p>Getting doubles of each Pokémon to use in a deck is undoubtedly a pain (I’ve been working with a single Darkrai ex myself, and I consider even that lucky). But once you’ve assembled those pieces, all you need are a handful of trainer cards to complete your deck. <strong>Professor’s Research</strong>, <strong>Poké Ball</strong>, and <strong>Leaf </strong>are common staples in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, and you’ll want two of each of them. You only need one <strong>Cyrus</strong>, and a <strong>Giovanni</strong> can help you lock in KOs. From there you can slot in a <strong>Sabrina</strong>, <strong>Dawn</strong>, <strong>Giant Cape</strong>, or <strong>Rocky Helmet</strong> to round out your support. Just keep in mind that, as the competitive landscape evolves, other Trainer Cards may become more prevalent to counter new threats.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b34c07a284f57dcb56fa6c1c27ad420e" data-recommend-id="image://b34c07a284f57dcb56fa6c1c27ad420e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Darkrai ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Darkrai ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b34c07a284f57dcb56fa6c1c27ad420e" data-recommend-id="image://b34c07a284f57dcb56fa6c1c27ad420e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Darkrai ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As strong as the above cards are, they are absolutely vulnerable to counterplay. <strong>Grass-type decks</strong> can shake off Darkrai ex’s perpetual chip damage thanks to cards like <strong>Erika </strong>and the passive healing of Shaymin’s <strong>Fragrant Flower Garden</strong> ability. <strong>Exeggutor ex</strong> is a standout, boosting a whopping 160 HP while also inflicting 40 or 80 damage per turn at the cost of just one Grass Energy. Since Darkrai ex and Weavile ex are both weak to grass, cards like <strong>Celebi ex</strong> can be especially threatening with average luck.</p><p><strong>Fighting-type decks </strong>also offer some attractive counterplay options, despite being relatively niche in the current competitive landscape. In fact, player JeremiahTheGreat caused a stir in the recent <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://play.limitlesstcg.com/tournament/678569cc1c64910a07ac1929/details&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://play.limitlesstcg.com/tournament/678569cc1c64910a07ac1929/details" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hooglandia &amp; Spragels Open Tournament</a></span> by building a deck around <strong>Aerodactyl ex </strong>and <strong>Lucario</strong>, which was the <em>only </em>non-Darkrai ex team to crack the top eight. Aside from those picks, <strong>Hitmonlee </strong>is practically tailor-made to counter stall strategies with <strong>Stretch Kick</strong>, which completely bypasses walls like Druddigon. Magnezone and Weezing are both weak to fighting attacks too.</p><p>Regardless of your deck’s type, <strong>Sabrina </strong>and <strong>Cyrus </strong>really help against Darkrai ex and Magnezone. Because these two Pokémon need to spend their first turns setting up, you can seriously put your opponent on the backfoot by causing disruptions in the early game. For instance, as long as you know you can get a hit on either of the two monsters by drawing them out with Sabrina, they’ll be vulnerable to your Cyrus card later to finish the job with a strong attack. Remember, while your opponent <em>wants </em>to start with a wall to hide their Darkrai ex behind, they won’t<em> always </em>start the game with the right cards. If you see an opening to hit Darkrai ex early, you can set up for a KO later that can seal the game for you. Your opponent is <em>specifically </em>counting on you to never claim those two points!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Soulslike genre is adding another meaty release to its catalog in 2025—The First Berserker Khazan. There’s a lot to love from intense boss fights to a strong protagonist. Let’s see if Xbox Game Pass has the chance to add The First Berserker Khazan to the subscription service.</p>



<p>I’m very excited for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a>—as are most Souls fans. It’s got a distinct and notable JRPG flair to its graphics, but FromSoftware—and contemporaries such as Stellar Blade and Black Myth Wukong—would be proud of its bullish combat. Each strike and movement is lit up perfectly by the dazzling and striking art style.</p>



<p>I think Khazan will go beyond being a “sleeper hit.” But if it can secure a partnership with Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass, The First Berserker Khazan is on the way to a violent victory.</p>

<p><strong>The First Berserker Khazan is sadly not coming to Xbox Game Pass anytime soon.</strong></p>



<p>It’s simple: Not every title arrives on Xbox Game Pass (or PS Plus) on its first day. Whether it’s because the developer and publisher aren’t interested, or Microsoft isn’t, we do know Khazan is destined to be a solo release available across multiple platforms on March 27.</p>



<p>Xbox Game Pass hasn’t been mentioned in a single The First Berserker Khazan trailer. Another very telling sign is if you go to <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-first-berserker-khazan-standard-edition/9NH8P6S460LD/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Khazan’s Xbox Store Page</a>, you’ll see there’s no Game Pass label. It’s a standalone release not partnering up with any of the big brands for exclusivity.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-first-berserker-khazan-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will The First Berserker Khazan Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>The success of The First Berserker Khazan likely determines a future Xbox Game Pass nod.</strong></p>



<p>This doesn’t mean unsuccessful games are omitted from Xbox Game Pass consideration. Struggling titles gain a bigger, much-needed audience thanks to Game Pass. However, Game Pass doesn’t have too many AAA Soulslikes currently, but it’s silly to think Microsoft doesn’t want some piece of a successful pie.</p>



<p>2023’s Lords of the Fallen is on there. Plus, the semi-Soulsy nature of Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order is available. So it is hit and miss if this ever happens. My advice is to <strong>take a shot on Khazan and see if it’s for you</strong>.</p>



<p>We’ll update this page if The First Berserker Khazan does come to Microsoft’s service.</p>

<p>Am I overplaying the potential of The First Berserker Khazan? Or can it knock on the Game of the Year door come December?</p>

            <p>The Final Fantasy series has now sold over 200m copies across the globe.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> shared the announcement on social media, along with the news the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster">Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</a> series has sold over 5m copies worldwide.</p>
<p>The sales figure further cements Final Fantasy as one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time, even if sales have dipped in more recent years.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy is on a par with the likes of Assassin's Creed and The Sims, having sold more than the Sonic the Hedgehog series and the Legend of Zelda series. However, it remains far behind the Mario franchise, Tetris, Call of Duty, Pokémon, GTA, Minecraft, and FIFA.</p>
<p>In terms of sales, the PS1 era was collectively the most successful for Final Fantasy. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> sold almost 15m copies, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy 8</a> sold 12m copies, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a> sold 8.9m copies. Elsewhere Final Fantasy 12 sold 11.3m, Final Fantasy 15 sold 10.3m, Final Fantasy 13 sold 9.6m, and Final Fantasy 10 sold almost 9m (thanks <a href="https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy#Sales_history">Video Game Sales Wiki</a>).</p>
<p>However, they all pale in comparison to Final Fantasy 14 at 24m sales. In 2021 the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-xiv-the-most-profitable-game-in-the-series">MMORPG was the most profitable game in the series</a>, and in financial reports since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-revenue-kept-afloat-thanks-to-final-fantasy-14">often kept the company afloat</a> where other games have failed to meet expectations.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series has sold over 5 million copies worldwide, and the Final Fantasy series has now sold over 200 million copies across the globe!</p><p>Wherever you joined us on our adventures, thank you. <a href="https://t.co/6eoIoDBXh0">pic.twitter.com/6eoIoDBXh0</a></p></div>— FINAL FANTASY (@FinalFantasy) <a href="https://twitter.com/FinalFantasy/status/1900396747647754617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>More recently, while Final Fantasy 7 Remake sold 8.7m copies, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">both follow-up Rebirth and the next series entry Final Fantasy 16 "did not meet expectations"</a> according to Square Enix.</p>
<p>Still, the 5m sales for the Pixel Remasters - revamped versions of the first six games in the series - is good news for the company, proving both nostalgia and interest in older games from series fans and newcomers.</p>
<p>And with Square Enix's multiplatform strategy, sales are expected to increase. Most recently, Rebirth was released on PC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-final-fantasy-7-rebirths-pc-port-has-promise-but-too-many-problems">even if the port has issues</a>, while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-brings-mana-and-final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-to-xbox">Pixel Remasters were added to Xbox last September</a> in addition to their previous release on Switch, PC, PlayStation, and mobile.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A Rockstar-approved GTA 5 modding tool is on the cars, I mean cards, for all of you PC players out there.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, and several years after the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>'s enhanced edition on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-5s-next-gen-upgrades-finally-arrive-on-pc">the game's next-gen features finally arrived on PC as part of a free update for all existing users</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Cfx.re - that is to say, the team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-hires-a-team-of-modders-it-had-previously-banned-from-playing-gta-5">Rockstar hired in 2023, and which was behind the popular GTA 5 FiveM and RDR2 RedM multiplayer mods</a> - is working on a "conversion tool" which will "assist the modding community in making their assets compatible with the new upgrade". This is as any custom assets used on FiveM and GTA 5 Legacy are not "natively compatible" with Rockstar's newly-launched PC version of GTA 5 Enhanced.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/t/coming-soon-new-official-modding-utility/5312475">laid out by Cfx.re</a>, the team's upcoming conversion tool will support the following formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dictionaries of multiple drawables (*.ydd)</li>
<li>Generic models, geometry, optional embedded textures and lights (*.ydr)</li>
<li>Complex fragmented skeletons/models used for pedestrians, vehicles, destructible objects, etc. (*.yft)</li>
<li>Texture Dictionaries (also known as TXD) (*ytd.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cfx.re noted file types such as .ycd and .ybn will not require any conversion.</p>
<p>The tool itself does not have a release date as yet, with Cfx.re stating it still has a few bits and pieces it needs to sort out before it is ready to be debuted. For now, it just says "coming soon", and the team said it will share a more thorough breakdown of what the tool will include at a later date.</p>
<p>As to why this is a pretty big deal, well, Rockstar has been rather strict with mods in the past.  Back in 2017, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ambitious-mod-project-to-put-liberty-city-in-gta5-canned">called time on the 'Liberty City in GTA5' mod</a>, saying that while it "generally [would] not take legal action against third-party projects involving Rockstar's PC games that are single-player, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property rights of third parties", it would not allow "use or importation of other IP", including its own. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, just this January, the creators of an impressive mod which added a playable version of Grand Theft Auto 4's map to GTA5 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-shuts-down-ambitious-mod-that-put-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-grand-theft-auto-5">removed their own project from the public eye following a discussion with Rockstar</a>. </p>

<p>Following its debut on Steam, GTA 5 Enhanced has welcomed a healthy number of players. At the time of writing, there are still 108,568 of us heisting cars and getting up to who knows what over on Valve's platform.</p>

            <p>
Konami have given us our first proper look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, a new incarnation of the survival horror series from Hong Kong-based Neobards Entertainment, which takes place in 1960s Japan. You are Shimizu Hinako, a schoolgirl equipped with the trademark Silent Hill combo of a broken-off pipe and a cartload of psychological baggage, whose hometown Ebisugaoka is engulfed by a monstrous fog.</p>
<p>The choice of a non-US setting has ruffled the plumage of players who cherish Silent Hill's association with Twin Peaks and New England. Personally, I welcome the departure after the heady retro fidelity of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, and besides, the overall ambience doesn't seem <em>that</em> far removed from the elder Hills. Look, they've even got Akira Yamaoka contributing to the soundtrack. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It looks like Silent Hill's trademark dimension shifts are back as well, but the new game's realm shifts appear to be more bio-horror-ish, with crimson roots and lambent, trumpet-shaped blossoms consuming the geometry rather than Silent Hill's usual flavour of blood, rust and toilet bowl detritus. It's almost pretty, as you might expect from a game that challenges you to "embrace the beauty hidden within terror, or succumb to the madness that lies ahead". Perhaps the "f" in the title stands for "flower". Or perhaps it stands for "face peeling off". Or perhaps it stands for "flipping get a move on and embed the trailer".

<p>

I've never heard of Neobards before, and naturally, I'm wondering whether they have the chops to pull a Silent Hill game off. Founded in 2017, they've worked in a support capacity on games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-avengers">Marvel's Avengers</a> and several Resident Evil projects. They appear to have one first-party release to their name, the mobile game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> M. I don't know what to make of them, but I will give them kudos for having a poem on <a href="https://neobards.com/game-maker/">their portfolio page</a> that (accidentally?) references the Three Musketeers.  
</p>
<p>
Silent Hill f also features writing from Ryukishi07, author of the When They Cry visual novel series. The plot certainly seems to be in keeping with his taste for the macabre: according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947440/SILENT_HILL_f/">the Steam page</a>, the game "contains depictions of gender discrimination, child abuse, bullying, drug-induced hallucinations, torture, and graphic violence". The developers say that some of this difficult material reflects "the customs and culture" of the day. They're probably not talking about the dislocated dolls on stabby stick legs, which strike me as horrifying regardless of era.
</p>
<p>
If you're genuinely floored and flummoxed by this being set in Japan, you might prefer to see it as a spiritual successor to Forbidden Siren, the PS2 survival horror game Keiichiro Toyama directed and co-wrote after co-writing and directing the original Silent Hill. I remember having a ripe old time in Siren lurking behind barrels "sight-jacking" manky Shibito. If it had ever made it to PC, I'd have volunteered it for our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">best horror games</a>.

<p>Call of Duty 2025 zombies could have six fully-fledged round-based zombies maps throughout the games life cycle, Insider Gaming has learned.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that Call of Duty 2025, which will be led by Treyarch Games, could have a total of six round-based zombies maps during the games lifecycle. Details of what Call of Duty 2025 is shaping up to be is already an open secret, including that the game is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 2 sequel</a> and that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original zombies crew is likely making a return</a>.</p>



<p>In the maps early development, it’s understood that the plan for zombies was to build the maps from the ground up to allow them to be played in different gamemodes including traditional round-based, grief, and outbreak. </p>



<p>Its understood that Treyarch was playing around with more “out there” settings this time around, including a map set in post-WW2 New York where the Nazi’s had dropped a nuclear bomb, with another map being described as being set in a Japanese temple at the foot of an erupting volcano. </p>



<p>Other ideas included a map set in Vietnam, one in Afghanistan, and another out-there idea of one being set in a space station in the Dark Aether. </p>



<p>As already leaked from a feedback session, it’s also understood that Call of Duty 2025 zombies will have one of its biggest maps to date and have a similar transportation system to Tranzit. </p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on if Treyarch went with every idea, but we’d expect at least a few to make it into the final game.</p>

            <p>DC Comics and Sega have released a first look at their Justice League and Sonic the Hedgehog comic book series, including Sonic dressed as The Flash and Shadow as Batman.</p>
<p>The crossover was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-sonic-and-dc-comic-collaboration-at-sonic-central-stream">announced at the Sonic Central event</a> last September, following a tease on Batman Day earlier the same week.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fragpunk-team-posts-%E2%80%98disgusting%E2%80%99-response-to-spectre-divide-shutdown-before-deleting-it.1134423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fragpunk-team-disgusting-response-spectre-divide/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, it was announced that after just a few months on the market and amid the failure of the game’s first season, both Spectre Divide and Mountaintop Studios will be shutting down next month. Spectre Divide, an ambitious first-person multiplayer shooter, was first released in August 2024, but the player base quickly dwindled.</p>



<p>The Mountaintop team revealed that, despite funding, the game isn’t making enough money to remain online or support the studio, so it’s being closed down. In response, the team at FragPunk, which is another free-to-play multiplayer shooter released just a week ago, posted an image on social media that has been slammed as ‘disgusting’ by the Mountaintop team.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-might-not-age-well">That Might Not Age Well</h2>



<p>The FragPunk post has now been removed, but not before eagle-eyed gamers grabbed screenshots:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>One of the first people to share this online was Marcus Schubert, one of the producers working at Mountaintop Studios. He <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/schuby_netease-games-this-is-disgusting-shame-activity-7306005072939794432-SxA6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACr_MyIB0LsPQAIci9zs45L99nTb3k_h6f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote on LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>NetEase Games, this is disgusting. Shame on you. For those unaware, the top post is our farewell letter indicating that Mountaintop Studios is shutting down.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>FragPunk is published by NetEase, the same gaming titan behind the overwhelmingly successful Marvel Rivals. The post was likely the work of a social media intern or community manager somewhere, but that shouldn’t be used as an excuse to brush it under the rug. </p>



<p>At a time when studio closures, cancellations, and layoffs are tearing the industry apart, publishers and developers should support one another rather than mocking the downfall of a hard-working team. If recent trends are anything to go by (XDefiant and Concord, for example), then FragPunk shouldn’t potentially be casting stones in a glass house.</p>



<p>Presently, FragPunk has a peak on Steam of more than 110,000 players, while Spectre Divide peaked at just 26,200. However, XDefiant had millions of players, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/">we all know what happened</a> with that.</p>

It’s a theory that would mean the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>nearly 50 million SNES units</u></a> sold may now feature improved performance with games like Super Mario World, Super Metroid, and Star Fox instead of wearing down as the years go on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea of a video game console — or any kind of technology — working more efficiently simply thanks to the passage of time sounds ludicrous, but Cecil’s findings suggest a single component may be what’s setting the SNES apart from the rest.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Fastest Thing Alive</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As explained in an interview <a href="https://www.404media.co/super-nintendo-hardware-is-running-faster-as-it-ages/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>404 Media</u></a> conducted with Cecil, official Nintendo specs say the SNES’s audio processing unit (APU) SPC700 has a digital signal processing (DSP) rate of 32,000Hz dictated by a ceramic resonator that runs at 24.576MHz. Retro console fans have documented that these details aren’t quite accurate, with recordings from the last few decades showing slightly altered DSP rates depending on the physical conditions — such as temperature — the SNES is recorded in. It means the console is often processing audio and sending it to the CPU at a different rate than Nintendo has communicated, and as the DSP fluctuates, so too does the game’s speed even if it’s in small, unrecognizable ways.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/gettyimages-2189100477-1741939851931.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The SNES appears to be getting faster with age. Photo by Aldara Zarraoa/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s all fine and good, but where things get interesting is how that number has changed in the last 34 years. Cecil <a href="https://nextcloud.tas.bot/index.php/apps/forms/s/TJDiEwP6J7HFfYbPRw4A7dHN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>asked SNES owners to record data</u></a> related to their SNES units after noticing slightly higher DSP rates that were even more out of the ordinary than previously documented. The more than 140 responses gathered so far show an undeniable trend in increased DSP rates in recent measurements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some previously recorded average DSP numbers for the SNES’s SPC700 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tas.bot/post/3lkbnvrccek2p" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hovered at 32,040Hz in 2007</a> — Cecil’s findings raise that average to 32,076Hz. Factors such as hot and cold environments do play a part in higher and lower stats, too, but not by enough to alter DSP in the way needed to yield these results. In other words, it looks like the SNES is processing audio faster as time goes on.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Therefore, temperature is less significant. Why? How does it affect games? We do not know. Yet.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“Based on 143 responses, the SNES DSP rate averages 32,076Hz, rising 8Hz from cold to warm,” Cecil explained in a follow-up <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tas.bot/post/3ljqmi5hwbc2p" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bluesky post</u></a> fit with <a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/fpwWkqDcnxXR/SNES-SMP-speed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a layout of the data</u></a>. “Warm DSP rates go from 31,965 to 32,182Hz, a 217Hz range. Therefore, temperature is less significant. Why? How does it affect games? We do not know. Yet.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Any%</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Cecil admits that, while fascinating, more research is needed to determine not only how much faster SNES units are processing game audio but what exactly the cause is. Data related to how consoles performed in their first decade on the market, for example, is limited. For now, at least on the surface, Nintendo’s second major home console appears to be aging quite gracefully as it nears its 35th birthday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of what exactly might be behind these bizarre circumstances, the prospect of a popular gaming console gradually causing games to run faster has made waves in the speedrunning community. An SPC700 progressively processing audio to the CPU quicker than intended could, in theory, impact game performance by shortening load times in certain sections. Audio processing faster in 2025 than it did in an identical speedrun from 1990 could potentially send more than three decades of leaderboard rankings and records into question. Thankfully, how a wiser SNES might affect a Super Mario World speedrun isn’t so straightforward.</p><div id="nintendo-consoles" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Nintendo Consoles</h3><h3>Nintendo Consoles</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">APU speeds aren’t a one-to-one translation to visual game speed. In reality, even the most extreme circumstances related to these new findings would likely only shave off less than one second of your average speedrun. How each game might benefit from altered audio processing is also up for debate, and there’s no indication of how significantly longer speedruns could be impacted at the time of this story’s publication. The speedrunning community's research is in its infancy, but even as further experimentation is conducted, the consensus for now is that players have little to fear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Cecil continues digging into what makes the SNES tick, Nintendo’s console is charging through its 30s and feeling better than ever.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unboxing-seagates-genshin-impact-le-external-ssd/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Back in my day, branded storage solutions were lucky to have more than a small decal slapped onto the side of it. Even my Outsiders-themed external drive that powered my PlayStation 5's extra storage was little more than a silk-screened logo atop one of Western Digital's WD_Black P10 drive. For many gamers, picking a themed hard drive to match the aesthetic of their setup, or merely support their favorite character or franchise, meant sacrificing performance for style. Seagate has proven this wrong with their numerous Limited Edition HDD and SSDs to date. Their latest release is a special collaboration with mihoYo for Genshin Impact, which Seagate sent me to try out for an unboxing and to take on the road to GDC next week.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Today, we're unboxing the latest in Seagate's line of Limited Edition Gaming SSD's based on one of Genshin Impact's earliest Electro Units: Cyno. This pocket-sized 1TB external drive is smaller than your average deck of playing cards. Coming in at just under 100x50x11mm, this&nbsp; drive was a no-brainer to throw into my everyday carry for when I need to capture some footage or snag a recording off a capture station.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The bright purple styling representing Cyno immediately stands out among the packages of other drives and headsets on my office wall, but no one buys a hard drive just to leave it sealed in box. Inside the package are just enough goodies to take this drive for a spin and immediately start storing your favorite content on-the-go. All around the unit are some runic designs, with a logo on the underside not quite the usual icon you'd see for Cyno in game but recognizable enough by the Anubis motif. Similar to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/seagate-releases-starfield-xbox-game-drive-but-your-xbox-series-wont-play-the-game-from-it/">Starfield</a> line of Seagate's Limited Edition drives, there is a full LED bar across the front shorter edge of the SSD. A small status LED also pokes out through the short edge of the drive opposite the USB Type-C 3.2 port.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>With only a 65 gram weight, this Genshin Impact-themed drive can easily fit in a knapsack without even noticing it's there. Thumb drives used to be my transfer method of choice when it comes to snagging screenshots and video footage off my PlayStation 5 for reviews, but now that external SSD's like these have become more readily available and lightweight, I've reformed my ways. Seagate claims that the drive comes with both a three-year warranty and three years of their Rescue Data Recovery Services, so if one of my transfers does wind up going back, at least there's a chance to recover it.</p>

<p>The Seagate Genshin Impact Limited Edition SSD is truly a limited affair, being limited exclusively to their <a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/gaming-drives/special-editions/genshin-impact-external-ssd/">online webstore</a> at $139.99. While the price comes in higher than most of their other themed drives, this one is a unique bit of kit that I could see Genshin Impact fans picking up for more Cyno merch representation in their homes.</p>

		<p>When it comes to game studios that thrive on the personalities who founded and lead them, none are quite as exciting to me as Too Kyo Games. Founded in 2017, it’s a team that has spent the last seven years producing games and even anime based on the combined creative visions of three incredible figures of the industry – <em>Zero Escape</em> series director Kotaro Uchikoshi, <em>Danganronpa</em> director Kazutaka Kodaka and series character designer Rui Komatsuzaki. Since their careers skyrocketed off the cult success of the death-game focused visual novel thrillers all three spent years working on, they’ve developed a variety of other projects that have either been exciting advancements of the ideas from their prior works or entirely new visions altogether. None of these have been a major breakout hit on the scale of <em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape,&nbsp;</em>though. That fact and the common tone of detective death-game mystery that runs through them all has made it hard not to see a game like <em>The Hundred Line – Last Defense Academy,&nbsp;</em>sporting familiarly zany character designs by Rui Komatsuzaki, and assume it’s just another one of those. After spending time with its demo, though, it’s clear this game is so much more than that.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy-｜English Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jLjz8umrD1E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For one thing, this isn’t another game about a bunch of amnesiacs locked inside a school. Our protagonist Takumi Sumino is a regular red-haired anime teenager living in the totally normal Tokyo Residential Complex – which is a place separated from the rest of the world by a giant overhead dome but don’t even worry about that. You also shouldn’t worry about the daily siren alerts indicating nearby monster activity – except one day, those monsters actually break through the giant dome, and amidst the chaos and bloodshed, a weird little mascot character approaches Takumi and hands him a knife – instructing him to transform and fight off the invaders by stabbing himself in the chest with said knife.</p>


<p>Soon after, Takumi wakes up inside a mysterious classroom with no idea how he got there (okay so I lied there’s a <em>little&nbsp;</em>bit of amnesiacs locked inside school in this one), and no idea why he’s surrounded by a bunch of other people. It turns out, the stab-yourself-to-transform deal was pitched to a bunch of other people, and they’re now all tasked with living inside this school and fending off any invading monsters for 100 days in order to save humanity. It’s a pitch that leaves far more questions than answers – both for the player and the characters wrapped up in it. This is the kind of mystery and intrigue that made the very first&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>game so iconic – the story could go anywhere with how layered the mysteries of the game world are, and even after wrapping the demo up I could so the full release going in any direction.</p>


<p>Thankfully, the demo does paint a pretty clear picture of what you’ll be doing for each of those 100 days – and it’s a refreshing blend of tactical RPG combat, life-simulation hangout events, and environmental exploration that will hit hard for fans of <em>Persona 5</em> or&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses.&nbsp;</em>Tactics battles are pretty standard grid-based encounters, where each of your characters has a different shaped grid for their attacks – one character might strike in a straight line, while another hits in a wider cluster of grid squares. Each turn you’ve got a set amount of Action Points to spend to bust out your actions, but there’s a couple other options mixed in that keep things a little fresh. A Voltage gauge fills up as you attack, letting you spend a bar from it to either give a student an additional move or let them perform a special technique.</p>
<p>On top of that, though, characters can bust out an extremely powerful attack that comes at the cost of their own life – just for the battle, though. They’ll come back after the fight, and you even get additional level-up points from that sacrifice, encouraging a risk-reward balance where you’re tempted to axe your characters in every fight to grind out as much upgrade currency without losing so many characters that you can’t actually win the battle. I was surprised by how much this one mechanic improved the excitement of every battle for me – basic RPG bouts suddenly became resource management mania and I was addicted to min-maxing every encounter I could.</p>

<p>The demo for<em> The Hundred Line – Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>is an extremely small slice of the full cake, but it’s already promising to be a more feature-rich and varied experience than prior titles from the creators involved. I’m excited to see just how far this game goes when the full release arrives in April.</p>
