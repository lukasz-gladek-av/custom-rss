		<p>Activision and Treyarch have released the gameplay reveal trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> Zombies game mode and the Terminus map, and it totally has a lot of zombie fighting in it. Also a speed boat, intriguingly… A reveal for the Liberty Falls map will come on 28th August during Call of Duty: Next.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Round-Based Zombies Terminus Reveal Trailer | New Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZexnXA4mMEk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If there’s one thing that Activision wants you to know about this game mode, it’s that it’s “round-based”, just like all the zombies modes were before last year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/15/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-review/">Modern Warfare 3</a> made it all open world. This was not a particularly popular move, and so Activision is backtracking almost as fast as when the backlash to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/11/04/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review/">COD: Infinite Warfare</a> made “boots on the ground” the only thing they would ever say about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/10/call-of-duty-wwii-review/">Call of Duty: WWII</a>.</p>
<p>As featured in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/06/black-ops-6-zombies-cinematic-trailer-promises-gameplay-reveal-later-this-week/">the cinematic reveal</a> Terminus map is set in the Philippine Sea at a remote US naval base turned CIA outpost turned subterranean laboratory. As the Requiem crew are broken out of their confinement, they discover the bio-research in progress for Project Janus, and have to start busting it up.</p>
<p>Treyarch say that you’ll want to pick Grigori Weaver, Elizabeth Grey, Mackenzie ‘Mac’ Carver, and Maya Aguinaldo as player characters to get the richest story experience while playing this.</p>

<p>Getting back to the round-based format will have pretty much all of the zombies mode staples returning as well. There’s a main quest to follow and puzzle your way through across multiple attempts and explorations, but then there’s also plenty of side-content to discover as well with a whole host of easter eggs. It all builds up to (if you survive) a point where you need to extract.</p>
<p>For your character build, both pre-match and with a mid-game progression, there’s the returning systems of perks, weapons and loadouts, field upgrade abilities, and then series staples of perk-a-colas, pack-a-punch, ammo mods and more.</p>
<p>You’ll want to use everything you’ve got to blast away at the new upside-down head spiders called Vermin, flying Parasites, the newly armoured Manglers and the full body horror of the Amalgam</p>
<p>There’s a whole ton of detail to delve into, with specific examples, on <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-deep-dive-terminus-map-intel#Shamblers">the Call of Duty website here</a>.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 lands on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One and PC on 25th October. It will also be available on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a> tiers with day one games.</p>

            <p>Did The Gentlebros come up with the pun "Pi-Rats" and then work backwards from there in deciding that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cat-quest-pirates-of-the-purribean">Cat Quest 3</a> should be pirate themed? Or was "Purr-ibean" the initiating pun? I feel that the action-RPG sequel had to begin with one of wordplay or another, given that its Steam page boasts that it also has "furr-ocious spells" and "gla-meow-rous costumes".
</p>
<p>It's also claws-out now on Steam, which has me feline fine.

<p>I'll be honest, I'm not a huge fan of puns or punworlds, but I am a fan of Cat Quest. The first two games are good, accessible hack-and-slashers, with a colourful world to explore, and Cat Quest 2 introduced co-op. They're great games to play with your kids, as a sort of My First Action-RPG experience.
</p>
<p>Cat Quest 3 continues in kind with solo and local co-op. Its big new features are nautical combat (previous games eventually allowed your character to simply walk on water), a 2.5D world (rather than simply 2D), and a "refined" combat system that allows for attack combos and hot-swapping weapons. The latter sounds great to me, but I hope it doesn't move it beyond the ken of kids.
</p>
<p>The Gentlebros should have some time to enjoy releasing one game, but the introduction of Pi-Rats to the Cat Quest animal ecosystem begs the question of which animal pun-theme might appear in Cat Quest 4. I propose Vi-King Crabs.
</p>
<p>Cat Quest 3 is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305840/Cat_Quest_III/">over on Steam</a> for £15.29/€18/$18.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Callisto Protocol was long billed as the spiritual successor to Dead Space by Visceral Games, especially because it was being designed by Dead Space creator Glen Schofield. However, the game eventually flopped when it launched in December 2022. On Wccftech, Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-callisto-protocol-break-out-outbreak-break-a-leg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave</a> it a 7.2/10:</p>
<p><em>While an incredible looker in screenshots and death scenes, The Callisto Protocol suffers from a lack of intriguing content that makes the twelve-plus hour journey through Black Iron Prison worth two, even perhaps one single playthrough. Crafting and skill trees are both minimal in nature (with both costing a heavy amount of credits where players might only be able to fully upgrade two or three weapons in the full playthrough) while melee combat and combat encounters as a whole feel largely scripted. The horror elements stand out as reason alone to play Striking Distance's debut horror game, but you might want to find yourself getting thrown back into Black Iron Prison rather than see the journey through to the end.</em></p>
<p>Why did the game turn out to be so disappointing? Well, Glen Schofield himself believes it's because it should have been delayed, but publisher Krafton refused. Speaking in a video interview with YouTuber Dan Allen Gaming, Schofield <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IIVia5aiUQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>I wanted about three and a half more months and I was led to believe for about three or four months that that's the way it was going to be. In October or September 21, I was told that we were going to get the time, just no regrets. That was the term that was being used, no regrets, just put whatever you want into the game. Then January comes around, and some of the folks come over, and they just said no, it's December of 2022, and I was like, it's not going to get done, and it's going to cost you more money.&nbsp;It's not like it costs you less money because you're getting it out three months sooner. If you want it done, I got to accelerate everything by three and a half months, which means I need to jam people on here. If I need 20 people, I actually get 30 or 40 because that learning curve will not adjust.</em></p>
<p>Glen Schofield <a href="https://wccftech.com/glen-schofield-leaves-striking-distance-after-the-callisto-protocols-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left</a> developer Striking Distance Studios nearly a year ago. In the above interview, he explained he wanted to focus on his health and taking care of his daughter.</p>

Specifically, the development teams want to address challenges related to 2v8's matchmaking and variety in Killers, along with "a more compelling Survivor experience." </p><p>For those unfamiliar, 2v8 mode, as the name implies, is a game mode in Dead by Daylight that increases the player count from 1 killer and 4 survivors to 2 killers and 8 survivors. With the increase in player count, 2v8 introduces a few changes to the core Dead by Daylight gameplay experience. These include a larger map and the removal of Hooks and Perks. </p><p>In our review of Dead by Daylight, which we awarded a 9/10, IGN wrote: "After almost five years, Dead by Daylight has grown into an incredible slasher film simulator and the best asymmetrical multiplayer game around." </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-promo-codes">Roblox</a> has been banned in Turkey, with a government agency citing concerns over "child exploitation."
</p>
<p>The decision to ban all access to the game and platform was taken by the Turkish Information and Communication Technologies Authority (BTK), who also blocked access to Instagram in the country earlier this week.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The ban was <a href="https://x.com/yilmaztunc/status/1821259391087341579">announced by the Turkish Minster of Justice via X</a>. "According to our Constitution, our State is obliged to take the necessary measures to ensure the protection of our children," said the statement, which is otherwise light on detail.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.turkiyetoday.com/turkiye/4-reasons-why-turkiye-banned-roblox-37404/">Turkey Today reports</a> that the government has four key concerns which led to the ban: the sexual exploitation of children, "rampant" reports of pedophilia, children being incentivised to play Roblox via the virtual currency Robux, and the "inability to effectively monitor and regulate inapproriate content" on the platform.
</p>
<p>Last month, Bloomberg published <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">an investigation into Roblox's "pedophile problem"</a>.
</p>
<p>"We've spent almost 20 years making Roblox one of the safest online platforms for our users, particularly the youngest, and ensuring the safety of our users is at the core of everything we do," said a Roblox spokesperson in a response to the ban <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-responds-to-platform-ban-in-turkiye">shared with Eurogamer</a>. 
</p>
<p>"We respect the laws and regulations in countries where we operate and share local lawmakers' commitment to children. We look forward to working together to ensure Roblox is back online in Türkiye as soon as possible."
</p>
<p>Roblox has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, both for child safety reasons and the manner in which its creators profit from the labour of children. 
</p>
<p>"Like, you can say, 'Okay, we are exploiting, you know, child labour,' right? Or, you can say: we are offering people anywhere in the world the capability to get a job, and even like an income," said <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-studio-head-you-can-say-okay-we-are-exploiting-child-labour">Roblox Studio head Stefano Corazza at GDC earlier this year</a>. "So, I can be like 15 years old, in Indonesia, living in a slum, and then now, with just a laptop, I can create something, make money and then sustain my life."

Among those is Something New, a Stasis hand cannon that's been around for quite a while. With a few new perks available, however, Something New might be a pretty viable option to take into the Crucible, and it sports a few that'll make it fun to use in PvE, too. Here's where you can get Something New and the god rolls you want to keep an eye out for.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_Something_New">How To Get Something New</a></li><li><a href="#Something_New_God_Rolls">Something New God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Something_New_PvP_God_Roll">Something New PvP God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Something_New_PvE_God_Roll">Something New PvE God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_Something_New">How To Get Something New</h2><p dir="ltr">Something New is one of four weapons exclusive to the Solstice of Heroes event, so the best way to get it is from Solstice's dedicated event, Bonfire Bash. Completing the event drops several Solstice weapons, so the most efficient method for chasing new rolls of the gun is there. You can also expect to pick up Something New rolls from completing Solstice bounties, opening Solstice packages, and completing Solstice event card Triumphs, but these are a lot less reliable than just fighting through Bonfire Bash.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Something_New_God_Rolls">Something New God Rolls</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4347319-20240806172132_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347319" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4347319-20240806172132_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347319"></a><figcaption>Something New</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4347319-20240806172132_1.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Something_New_PvP_God_Roll">Something New PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Small Bore  <ul><li dir="ltr">+7 Stability, +7 Range</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Accurized Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Range</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Snapshot Sights / Rapid Hit  <ul><li dir="ltr">Snapshot Sights: Faster time to aim down sights.</li><li dir="ltr">Rapid Hit: Rapid precision hits temporarily increase stability and reload speed.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Precision Instrument / Explosive Payload  <ul><li dir="ltr">Precision Instrument: Dealing sustained damage increases precision damage.</li><li dir="ltr">Explosive Payload: Projectiles create an area of effect detonation on impact.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Range</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Something New carries a few solid perks for PvP that can make it pretty useful. The combination of Snapshot Sights and Precision Instrument can make it a little easier to nail precision hits and to keep the damage coming. Pair that with Nadir Focus, one of the gun's origin traits, and you get a lot of benefits for landing headshots.</p><p dir="ltr">You can alternatively go for Rapid Hit, which also takes advantage of landing headshots, if you're the kind of player with great aim in the Crucible. Explosive Payload is a decent replacement for Precision Instrument if the headshots are a little tougher to land, as you get some increased flinch against your opponent that can help you win duels. In any case, make sure you flip the Origin Trait on Something New to Nadir Focus, as it's way better in this case than the Solstice-specific trait, Dream Work.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Something_New_PvE_God_Roll">Something New PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Corkscrew Rifling  <ul><li dir="ltr">+5 Stability, +5 Range, +5 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Tactical Mag  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Reload Speed, +5 Stability, +1 Magazine Size</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Rapid Hit / Demolitionist  <ul><li dir="ltr">Rapid Hit: Rapid precision hits temporarily increase stability and reload speed.</li><li dir="ltr">Demolitionist: Kills with this weapon grant grenade energy. Activating your grenade ability reloads this weapon from reserves.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Headstone / Explosive Payload  <ul><li dir="ltr">Headstone: Precision final blows spawn a Stasis crystal at the victim's location.</li><li dir="ltr">Explosive Payload: Projectiles create an area of effect detonation on impact.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Reload Speed / Range</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Though Something New has gotten a bit of a revamp with perks that are a bit more useful in PvP, its PvP selection is more or less unchanged from years past. That's okay, though, since the existing PvE perks are solid. Rapid Hit is always useful, as is the boost in grenade energy Demolitionist brings, and Headstone is a Stasis-only perk that's not too widespread, giving Something New an element that feels a little bit unique. Explosive Payload is a decent replacement, though, and great for knocking out minor enemies alone or in groups.</p>

The original 2D-pixel graphics were enhanced to look sharper, the various game soundtracks were rearranged under the guiding hand of series composer Nobuo Uematsu, and there are numerous quality-of-life updates. The games also came with a few extra features, a bestiary, an illustration gallery, and a music player to enjoy the soundtracks on their own.</p></div>                      </div><p>Since some of the Final Fantasy games can feel dated, other enhancements include a modernized UI, auto-battle options, turning off random encounters, adjustable experience points muiltipliers, and other boost features. If you're looking to add a few more of the other almost-as-classic Final Fantasy games to your collection, Square Enix does have physical editions of them readily available.</p><h2>Classic Final Fantasy Games</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VIII-Remastered-Switch-Nintendo/dp/B08L42HJ4P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy 7 and Final Fantasy 8 Remastered Twin Pack</a> -- $33</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-IX-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0C3DMTX14?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy 9</a> -- $41</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD</a> -- $32</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo/dp/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy 12: The Zodiac Age</a> -- $32</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crisis-Core-Fantasy-Reunion-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0B5B1864Z?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion</a> -- $30</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/lego-new-releases-august-2024-mario-star-wars-marvel-minecraft-batman/2900-5655/">Over 100 Lego Sets Released This Month - Here Are The Biggest Ones</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-18-lego-video-games-for-only-15-marvel-batman-lotr-star-wars-and-more/1100-6525462/">Get 18 Lego Video Games For Only $15 - Marvel, Batman, LOTR, Star Wars, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-world-lego-set-preorder-mario-and-yoshi/1100-6525283/">Super Mario World Lego Set Is Up For Preorder At Target</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/7-new-lego-minecraft-sets-are-available-now-including-the-iconic-crafting-table/1100-6523896/">7 New Lego Minecraft Sets Are Available Now, Including The Iconic Crafting Table</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-lite-bundle-with-animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-only-159-at-walmart/1100-6522718/">Nintendo Switch Lite Bundle With Animal Crossing: New Horizons Is Only $159 At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-back-to-school-sale-2024-ps5-games-playstation-vr-ps5-slim-deals/2900-5638/">PlayStation Back To School Sale: Save Over 50% On PS5 Exclusives, $200 On PSVR 2, And $50 On Consoles</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-drops-to-best-price-yet-alongside-more-great-ps5-game-deals/1100-6525363/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Drops To Best Price Yet Alongside More Great PS5 Game Deals</a></li>   </ul> </div>

A video game getting made into a movie used to have fans bracing for embarrassment, expecting some cheap, unwatchable slop to be dragged out and projected onto a big screen bearing the name of their favorite games. While there are some modern game movies that are still bad, it at least feels like somebody’s trying to make a good film rather than just trying to cash in on a big name, even if they don’t succeed.<br></p><p>I guess that’s one thing we can thank the constant corporate franchise plays for— companies don’t want to sully their brands with a low-effort adaptation, so we get well-made movies like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-is-a-little-weird-but-mos-1841623974&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-is-a-little-weird-but-mos-1841623974">the <em>Sonic the Hedgehog </em>series</a></span> and shows like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/golden-globes-the-last-of-us-succession-emmy-awards-1851148385&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/golden-globes-the-last-of-us-succession-emmy-awards-1851148385"><em>The Last of Us</em> winning awards</a></span>. But man, there are still some stinkers out there, and even some still being made today. Let’s run through some of the worst video game movies, all while keeping in mind that there are plenty other bad ones we won’t get to touch on.</p></div></div><div><p>Though the 2005 <em>Doom </em>film ended up on our <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-game-best-adaptations-fallout-last-of-us-movie-tv-1851407286&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-best-adaptations-fallout-last-of-us-movie-tv-1851407286">list of best video game adaptations</a></span>, that was only for one scene. The first-person segment which pays a direct homage to the bloody, demon-hunting FPS games that inspired the film whips ass. The rest of the movie is so paper-thin and uninterested in the pillars of filmmaking like character writing, dialogue, and plot that would make it more substantial than a mock-up you’d see as a proof of concept for a full movie. There were hopes for a second film, but it never came to pass. However, <em>Doom: Annihilation</em> was released in 2019, and that wasn’t a direct sequel, but it was also bad. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>Tom Holland has been Sony’s golden child since his role as Peter Parker in the MCU, so you can see why they’d position him as the face of another hypothetical hit movie franchise. He’s one of the most recognizable young action stars of the past decade, so if they’re trying to turn <em>Uncharted</em>’s Nathan Drake into an iconic movie hero to match his video game status, there are worse picks than Holland. However, where the <em>Uncharted </em>movie falls short isn’t with Holland as Drake, it’s with Mark Wahlberg as Victor “Sully” Sullivan. Where Holland tried his best to capture the swashbuckling spirit of Drake, Wahlberg is playing a character who is wholly unrecognizable from the likable, charismatic father figure that fans know and love. Instead, we get a paranoid bastard who just happens to have his name. The film superficially believes what makes the <em>Uncharted</em> games successful is solely in its big action scenes, several of which it pays homage to like it’s grafting on the best moments of each game into one Frankensteined storyline. As such, it’s content to hand you a bastardized version of the real heart at the center: Nathan Drake’s relationships with the people who follow him to hell and back. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p><em>Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li </em>is the kind of adaptation that feels like the people making it had, at most, only a passing knowledge for what they were working with. Yeah, it’s a martial arts film about Chun-Li fighting series antagonist M. Bison and there are other characters who vaguely resemble <em>Street Fighter </em>heroes, but otherwise it’s just a mess of incoherent plot strictly there to facilitate flying fists and spinning kicks. There’s also a wild subplot about M. Bison transferring his consciousness into his unborn child after killing his pregnant wife. What the fuck are we doing here? — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>A big reason video game movies have a bad reputation is because Uwe Boll was directing a handful of them in the early-2000s that were so bad they collectively turned the public against them.. Boll’s shoddy work on movies like <em>Alone in the Dark</em>, <em>BloodRayne</em>, and <em>Far Cry </em>became synonymous with why video game movies shouldn’t exist. He wasn’t working on <em>huge</em> franchises that would have had a lot of money behind them (with <em>Far Cry </em>maybe being the exception, though the series has become far bigger since the 2008 film), which meant he churned out a bunch of low-budget slop that set the tone for years of people groaning when they heard a movie adaptation was coming, even if he wasn’t involved. There were even petitions asking him to retire <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/07/news&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/07/news" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back in 2008</a></span>. Boll eventually retired in 2016 and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/uwe-bolls-restaurant-is-better-than-his-movies-1793674371&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/uwe-bolls-restaurant-is-better-than-his-movies-1793674371">pivoted to the restaurant business</a></span> but has since returned to filmmaking. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>Listen, I actually like this movie…or at least remember liking it when I mindlessly plopped into a seat at the theater to watch it. I had no affinity for the games that inspired it and came away from the film thinking, “Well, that was a fun time.” However, I literally do not remember a thing that happened, suggesting its plot and characters were either so bland I spaced on them or so bad that I repressed them. I’ll leave the truth of the matter to you all, but years later I can confirm that <em>Warcraft </em>did not turn me into a convert, or betray any real love for the games it adapted, and that is perhaps the greatest sin of one of these adaptations. It’s just kind of there. —Moises Taveras<br></p></div><div><p>Hoo boy, this one is just depressing. The brand-new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-review-rotten-tomatoes-cast-release-1851616912?rev=1723136128180&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-review-rotten-tomatoes-cast-release-1851616912?rev=1723136128180"><em>Borderlands</em> movie</a></span> starring Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jack Black, and Ariana Greenblatt isn’t the kind of bad video game movie that will eventually become a cult classic—it’s just plain bad. It’s not even bad enough to inspire hate-watches or spawn memes like <em>Madame Web</em>, which could afford it a sort of second life after what will inevitably be a disappointing box office performance and that’s largely because it is so thoroughly uninspired. The film, which strips the fun out of a universe that already teeters on the precipice of being irreparably annoying, has dialogue that feels like it was written by an AI trained on the tamest corner of Reddit, CGI that deadens a world steeped in color, and performances that have “I am collecting a check” written all over them. I don’t think time will be kind to <em>Borderlands</em>, and it shouldn’t be. — Alyssa Mercante<br></p></div><div><p>Agent 47 cannot catch a break in the film department. Both attempts to make a <em>Hitman </em>movie have been dreadful. The first attempt in 2007 was dragged for its awful writing and was so poorly received that a sequel was canceled. The 2015 reboot <em>Hitman: Agent 47</em> didn’t fare any better, and maybe it’s time for big companies to realize that this might not be the video game series to adapt to a big-budget action film. <em>Hitman </em>is doing well enough as a video game and not everything needs to aspire to a piece of every side of the entertainment business. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>While <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-review-chris-pratt-jack-black-1850309488&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-review-chris-pratt-jack-black-1850309488"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a></span><em> </em>has been a resounding success at the box office, the Chris Pratt-led animated film feels like the natural endpoint of a group of suits trying to stuff every focus-tested idea and banal reference into a 90-minute movie. It has its moments like Bowser’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-bowser-jack-black-peaches-song-1850344353&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-bowser-jack-black-peaches-song-1850344353">now-viral “Peaches” song</a></span> and the titular brothers’ early escapades in Brooklyn before they’re isekai’d into the Mushroom Kingdom, but most of it boils down to references some cynical suit believes will make long-time <em>Mario </em>fans clap. It’s beautifully animated and has some good jokes, but it stops short of including the heart and soul that makes <em>Mario </em>so beloved after all these years. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>The <em>Injustice </em>movie is both a DC comic and NetherRealm fighting game adaptation and manages to do poorly by both its source materials. The animated <em>Injustice </em>movie is too short to tell the story it’s adapting. Rather than making a series of films to more effectively tell the story of Superman’s descent into fascism, it takes a hard left turn in the final minutes to wrap up the story quickly. I’ll never forget the whiplash of watching this film and realizing that a lot of its strange decisions like killing off The Flash, who typically played an important role in the <em>Injustice </em>storyline, were all meant to make one film in what could have easily been several. If we’d gotten a series of <em>Injustice </em>films rather than one that hurriedly wrapped up a years-long comic and video game series in a brisk 78 minutes, we could look back on it much more fondly. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>I have only walked out of a movie twice in my life. Once was when I was nine years old and saw Jackie Chan’s <em>The Tuxedo</em> because my mother dragged me and my brother out of the theater because she was scared the characters were going to start having sex and she’d have to explain that a few years earlier. The second time was in 2021 when I saw <em>Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City</em>. And that’s all I have to say about that. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>Fighting game movies are some of the most hit-or-miss when it comes to adaptations. You have an easy setup for a lot of action, usually by staging a tournament that attracts a bunch of larger-than-life personalities, but stringing it together with a proper plot is the biggest obstacle for these movies. <em>DOA: Dead or Alive </em>is a prime example of what essentially amounts to actors cosplaying different fighters, beating each other up, and a loose plot barely holding it all together. The <em>Dead or Alive </em>cast gives performances that would barely pass for the worst amateur film you’ve seen, and when the source material was giving them nothing to work with, who can really blame them? — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>Depending on who you ask, <em>Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within </em>is either an abomination or an underappreciated gem. The animated film wore the <em>Final Fantasy </em>brand but is pretty removed from any RPGs that spawned it. <em>Spirits Within </em>was praised for its animation in 2001, but beyond that, it’s generally considered an incomprehensible mess. It bombed so hard at the box office that Square shut down its Square Pictures branch, though it still lives in the hearts of some who consider it a cult classic. Also, damn, looking at the cast list, it had a pretty stacked line-up. Ming-Na Wen? Alec Baldwin? Donald Sutherland? <em>The Spirits Within </em>is wild to look back on. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>If I will give the live-action <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> movie anything, it was that its depiction of the series’ virtual reality simulator the Animus was a pretty interesting way to make what could have been a mostly benign recreation of the source material into something more compelling on film. Instead of having actor Michael Fassbender lay on a bed and dream about his ancestor’s past, the film portrays the Animus as a claw-like machine that allows protagonist Cal to completely recreate the movements and actions of the memories he relives. When he jumps onto a target in his memories, he is able to fully reenact the scene in the real world. It lets the movie do some interesting things as it flashes between realities, rather than spending too long in the past you forget about the present day. But <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> falls into the same problems the games do in that its lack of commitment to one side means both the past and present can feel shortchanged by one another. That’s only more apparent in the movie, as it feels needlessly convoluted as it tries to bring in the series’ lore baggage into what could’ve been a much simpler, accessible film. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Mojang Studios and Hive Games recently launched the first-ever private Minecraft server for Seattle Children's Hospital.

The Minecraft hospital was designed by attending surgeon and pediatric otolaryngologist Henry Ou, MD, and the project's goal was to help children feel more comfortable in the hospital.</p><p dir="ltr">The server itself is supported in more than 10 languages. It includes survival elements and minigames to ensure children of all ages can enjoy it. One of the minigames includes a parkour mode in which players race to specific points before time runs out, all while being chased by other players known as hunters. The Survival mode will be on one server to allow all the children to work together, if they want.</p><p dir="ltr">The project took a few years to complete and was made possible by Mojang Studios and Hive Games, both of which donated their time to ensure it was built correctly. The server is meant to be a form of Therapeutic gaming intended to help improve the patients' time at the hospital and "provide opportunities for socialization, education, and rehabilitation."</p><p dir="ltr">Mojang Studios is always working on various projects. Just recently, it announced a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecrafts-latest-dlc-introduces-a-new-way-to-play-tetris/1100-6525418/"> collaboration with Tetris, which introduces a new way to play the iconic game</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Official Round Based Zombies Terminus Reveal Trailer | New Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Terminus is a nighttime map set on a remote prison island, which continues the Dark Aether storyline from Black Ops Cold War's Zombies. This map features the returning cast of Weaver, Carver, Strauss, Dr. Elizabeth Grey, and the pilot known as Raptor One. More story details and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-terminus-map-trailer-reveals-new-story-details/1100-6525572/">cinematic trailer for Terminus can be found here</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Liberty Falls map is set in a West Virginian town overrun with Zombies. The full map and more details will be revealed during the Call of Duty: Next event on August 28.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="New_ways_to_play__save__and_join_mid_match">New ways to play, save, and join mid-match</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347621-terminuscrew.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347621" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347621-terminuscrew.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347621"></a><figcaption>The Terminus playable crew</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347621-terminuscrew.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 Zombies will give the option to play in either first-person or third-person perspectives, with an in-game toggle to switch between views mid-match. Treyarch says third-person will let players see Black Ops 6's omni-movement in a different way.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can now join their friend's ongoing Zombies matches, if there is room in the party. This also means there is an option to rejoin a match if there is a disconnection issue.</p><p dir="ltr">There are also customizable HUD presets to give players more options, including a "Legacy" setting that removes the minimap and positions elements in the same place as the HUD in Black Ops 3.</p><p dir="ltr">Zombies also features the new Save and Quit feature for solo players. Solo players have the ability to save a match and quit so they can pick it up later on. Everyone will have one save slot for this feature.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="New_and_returning_features">New and returning features</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Easter_egg_quests">Easter-egg quests</h3><p dir="ltr">Secrets and Easter eggs are a staple of Zombies mode, and Terminus is confirmed to have a traditional Easter-egg quest for players to solve. Several side quests can be uncovered as well, and players are encouraged to explore the island and uncover hidden secrets.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch describes Terminus as "one of the largest round-based Zombies maps ever created," and says the map offers tactical rafts that players can use to fully explore the prison area, ocean, and smaller islands.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 will include traditional and guided versions of the Easter-egg quest. The game will launch without a guided approach for the main story Easter egg, allowing the community to work together to solve the quest.</p><p dir="ltr">Later in the season, players can expect an optional guided version of the main quest. This focused guidance through the main quest will cap the rounds to certain stages of their quest progression. All additional side quests and other Easter eggs will be disabled to prioritize the narrative experience.</p><p dir="ltr">This method of starting with traditional quests and later guided options will apply to the seasonal round-based maps coming with post-launch content.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Classic_Zombies_features">Classic Zombies features</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347624-wonderweapon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347624" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347624-wonderweapon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347624"></a><figcaption>BeamSmasher Wonder Weapon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347624-wonderweapon.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Players can also expect plenty of classic features for Black Ops 6 Zombies, including Pack-a-Punch, the Mystery Box, Wonder Weapons, Wall Buys, Power-Ups, and perk machines.</p><p dir="ltr">The Wonder weapon for Terminus is the BeamSmasher. This is described as being comparable in size and shape to a light machine gun, and it features a single barrel emitting a super-charged and incredibly damaging Aetheric beam with two firing modes.</p><p dir="ltr">At launch, Terminus will include the following classic perks with base effects:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Jugger-Nog: Increase maximum health by 100</li><li dir="ltr">Quick Revive: Reduce the health regen delay time by 50%. Reduce the time it takes to revive an ally by 50%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed Cola: Increase reload and armor replating speed bonus by 30%</li><li dir="ltr">Stamin-Up: Increase movement speed</li><li dir="ltr">PhD Flopper: Immunity to all self-inflicted damage and status effects.

Field upgrades are the elemental abilities that can be equipped, with Aether Shroud, Frenzied Guard, Healing Aura, and Energy Mine all returning. Dark Flare is a new field upgrade, which is described as a massive energy beam that deals lethal shadow damage and penetrates everything in its path.</p><p dir="ltr">Augments are the upgradable tiers that players can unlock to improve the power of their perks, ammo mods, and even the field upgrades.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Zombies_currencies">Zombies currencies</h3><p dir="ltr">Both Essence and salvage currencies return from Black Ops Cold War Zombies. Essence is essentially the points used to open doors and purchase items such as perks, weapons, and Pack-a-Punch upgrades.</p><p dir="ltr">The Salvage currency are the junk piles scavenged from fallen enemies, but unlike Black Ops Cold War's salvage rarities, Black Ops 6 only uses one rarity type. This will be used to upgrade weapons to a higher rarity, as well as crafting of lethal, tactical, and support equipment.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Exfils_and_loadouts">Exfils and loadouts</h3><p dir="ltr">Taking more features from Black Ops Cold War, players will once again have the option to exfil from the map safely, or they can choose to play until they die in a more traditional manner.</p><p dir="ltr">Customized loadouts also return, so players can choose to start their match with weapon builds of their choice. Zombies-specific challenges and camos will also be available.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="New_Mutant_Injection_turns_players_into_Manglers">New Mutant Injection turns players into Manglers</h3><p dir="ltr">Players will be able to craft the support items from Black Ops Cold War, which includes the self-revive, RC car killstreak, and sentry turret. The game also introduces the new Mutant Injection support item.</p><p dir="ltr">Mutant Injection turns players into the Mangler special enemy type. Players grow an additional three feet taller, become clad in plated armor, use the Mangler's heavy attacks, utilize their sprint speed, and some other ability that's listed as "redacted."</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="GobbleGums_return">GobbleGums return</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347623-gobblegummachines.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347623" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347623-gobblegummachines.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347623"></a><figcaption>Redesigned Mr. Peeks GobbleGum machine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4347623-gobblegummachines.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">GobbleGums return from Black Ops 3. These are single-use items that offer a brief limited-time ability. Players can create a loadout for up to three GobbleGums per match, and additional GobbleGums can be earned in-game.</p><p dir="ltr">GobbleGums come in a variety of rarities: Rare, Epic, Legendary, Ultra, and Whimsical, with the general rule that the higher the rarity, the more powerful the effect of the GobbleGum--the exception being the Whimsical gums that only give a unique visual effect.</p><p dir="ltr">GobbleGums cannot be dropped or shared, but players can swap to a different pack at any time during a match by using the in-game menu. Any unused GobbleGums are kept between matches, and so players won't lose them even if they happen to disconnect from a match.</p><p dir="ltr">Notable returning gums include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Perkaholic - Gives the player all Perk-a-Colas in the map</li><li dir="ltr">Wall-to-Wall Clearance - Wall Buys cost only 10 Essence</li><li dir="ltr">Free Fire - Firing weapons consumes no ammo for the next 60 seconds</li><li dir="ltr">Soda Fountain - The next perk purchased gives an additional random perk</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The Call of Duty: Next event will also include live gameplay and news for multiplayer. Several Black Ops 6 leaks have surfaced ahead of the big event, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-leaks-reveal-a-controversial-warzone-map-with-caldera-2-0-vibes/1100-6525560/">potential new Warzone map filled with water</a>, and a new game mechanic that lets <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-leaks-continue-this-time-with-a-graphic-new-ability/1100-6525547/">players use their enemies as meat shields</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 releases on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnaroks-pc-systems-requirements-are-here-and-youll-need-to-free-up-190gb<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
God of War Ragnarök is making the jump from PlayStation to PC on 19th September, and ahead of its arrival, Sony has shared PC system requirements - which, among other things, reveals players will need to free up 190GB of hard drive space to play.
</p>
<p>
As per the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/08/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-system-requirements-revealed/">PlayStation Blog</a>, the minimum hardware players will likely need to get Ragnarök running at 1080p with an average of 30fps at Low settings is a GTX 1060/RX 5500 XT, an Intel i5-4670K/Ryzen 3 1200, 8GB RAM, Windows 10, and the aforementioned 190GB SSD space.
</p>
<p>
Right at the other, considerably flashier end of the spectrum, it's recommended players hoping to hit an average of 60fps at 4K on Ultra settings have an RTX 4070 Ti/RX 7900 XT, an Intel i5-11600K/Ryzen 7 3700X, 16GB RAM, Windows 10, and, yes, a big ol' chunk of SSD space.

<p>
Sony also notes Ragnarök will support Nvidia DLSS 3.7, AMD FSR 3.1, and Intel XeSS 1.3, as well as "frame generation for all technologies utilising that feature", on PC. Additionally, a PlayStation Network account - which Sony has been determined to foist on PC players since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">failed attempt with Helldivers 2</a> back in May - is required to play.
</p>
<p>
But is God of War Ragnarök worth jettisoning 190GB of meticulously digitised 16th century erotica for? Chris Tapsell called it "gargantuan, excessive, and wonderfully absurd" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-glorious-excess-makes-a-triumphant-return">Recommended review</a>. "You will fight some big, ugly monsters," he wrote. "You'll stand silhouetted, jagged, cartoonishly angular in front of them. Finally, deep into this game, you will get a bit of the old Kratos back, a bit of PS2 excess will break free of its self-conscious cage."
</p>

And, finally, those God of War Ragnarök system requirements in full:
