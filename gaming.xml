<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is, very obviously, a game where you roleplay as space fascists. Like, the game explicitly treats you as fodder for a war against various supposedly evil species all in the name of colonising other planets. It's not subtle! But it's also silly as hell, so the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> more or less gets away with it. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead</a> just announced a new warbond though, and I'll be honest: the new outfits are probably the most fascist looking yet.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, the helmet of the RE-1861 Parade Commander outfit looks mightily similar to a Pickelhaube, those old German soldier helmets with the solo spike on top you've probably seen in war movies your parents always seem to have on. The RE-2310 Honorary Guard's cap looks like a cap a Nazi general might wear too, not to mention the rest of the outfit. Major fascist vibes! Borderline uncomfortable if I'm being real with you, but I'll trust Arrowhead on this one.

<p>
In terms of weapons, the thing you'll probably find most exciting is the CQC-2 Sabre, which is literally just a straight up sword. Nothing fancier than that! Quite simply a sword you can attempt to slice through some Terminids. There's also a new bayonet marksman rifle, the R-2 Amendment if you prefer your blades with a little bit of gun attached to them. You'll find a new throwable too, the G-142 Pyrotech, which spins rapidly while spitting out fire.
</p>
<p>
My favourite of all the additions though is the new stratagem, the One True Flag, which is literally just a Super Earth flagpole that you can use to stab enemies with. It's ridiculous, presumably useless, and I hope it is the only thing people use from now on.
</p>
<p>
This new warbond drops next week, May 15th, so you've not got long to wait until you get to dress up as a super fascist, if you're into that for some messed up reason.

Some find her incredible, myself included. Others think she’s weak, subpar, and squishy. To those doubters, I’d like to emphasize that I’m pushing endgame with a homemade build, playing almost entirely solo, and I find the Huntress to be stronger than any I’ve played previously. If you want to enjoy her the same, here are a few tips to help you get the most out of the Huntress!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

It’s movement incarnate, and if you’re wise enough to invest in additional attribute points for Dexterity on the Passive Skill Tree, you’ll find the Huntress becomes a highly mobile, hard-hitting, and accurate woman with a grudge and a spear. </p><p>That said, don’t be like me. Initially, I incorrectly assumed that dropping points into Strength would ensure a higher damage output with my melee-based attacks and Spear Throw. While helpful in some odd cases, Dexterity reigns supreme here. So hit those nodes!</p><h2 id="h313030"><a id="lightning"></a>Lightning Spear dominates all</h2><figure id="" data-id="48cd82bf16ef261d55c2c727b91968e8" data-recommend-id="image://48cd82bf16ef261d55c2c727b91968e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Huntress’ Lightning Spear ability in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Huntress’ Lightning Spear ability in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="48cd82bf16ef261d55c2c727b91968e8" data-recommend-id="image://48cd82bf16ef261d55c2c727b91968e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Huntress’ Lightning Spear ability in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are numerous viable builds for the Huntress, including a powerful Bleed build that will likely wind up the go-to for many. However, I’ve found that during my playtime, it’s Lightning Spear dominating enemies. It’s especially useful in clearing groups with the following combo:</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Whirling Slash x3</li><li>Disengage</li><li>Lightning Spear</li></ol><p>Whirling Slash is an excellent AOE (area-of-effect)attack that creates a whirlwind with your spear, dealing melee damage and causing knockback. Hit that two or three times, then pop Disengage to create a bit of breathing room, and immediately launch Lightning Spear into your Whirling Slash. It’ll combine with the whirlwind, enhancing your lightning damage significantly and wiping mobs with a satisfying pop!</p><h2 id="h313031"><a id="help"></a>Don’t be afraid to ask for a helping hand in chat</h2><figure id="" data-id="ccab9acab9b8331c113c998d2c2f519a" data-recommend-id="image://ccab9acab9b8331c113c998d2c2f519a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Whirling Slash and Lightning Spear combo in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Whirling Slash and Lightning Spear combo in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ccab9acab9b8331c113c998d2c2f519a" data-recommend-id="image://ccab9acab9b8331c113c998d2c2f519a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Whirling Slash and Lightning Spear combo in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As an active member of the <em>Path of Exile 2</em> community, I’ll be the first to tell you that those who hang around in global chat tend to be some of the sweatiest die-hard fans in the game. They’re looking to discuss the merits of specific builds or prophesize the end of <em>PoE 2</em> due to Grinding Gear Games’ decisions. Despite the loud-mouth players bogging down chat, if you take a moment to type out a quick message, a simple, “Hey, can anyone help me beat this boss?” you’ll find numerous players willing to drop everything to help.</p><p>That said, Huntress proves rather powerful. I managed to push through to endgame primarily solo, only asking for help for four or five of the big bosses, including Ketzuli and Viper Napuatzi, the former because my build didn’t have enough fire resistance. The latter because, well, it’s Viper. Everyone could use help with Viper.</p><p>The point is, don’t hesitate to ask for help, no matter your class!</p><hr><p><br><em>Path of Exile 2</em> “Dawn of the Hunt” is on now, and players are rushing to the endgame, so join the fun on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs!  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In worker placement tabletop games, they literally can be. In this form of gameplay, you take your team through different tasks of adventures as you build toward end goals.

The game is about building a vineyard, harvesting grapes, bottling nectar, and selling vino. To do so you’ll have to use your workers wisely during the available time in the season. Players play across multiple years, building their wineries and ageing wine to fulfil orders. Gather your friends and raise a glass to Viticulture, which is playable competitively in its original iteration or as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board game</a> in the Viticulture World edition (<a href="https://zdcs.link/z3RNLM?object_uuid=ba4899ce-31d7-4008-9ed2-a48d30df13a2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see at Amazon</a>).</p></div><p id="yokohama"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Yokohama">Yokohama</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218899"><div id="218899" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Yokohama</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yokohama is a board game about doing business in the titular real-life port city near Tokoyo in Japan. In it, players have a team of workers to help them build their business. Enlist a staff to help you strategically gain resources, build technologies, and complete orders to build your trading empire toward optimal success. The game is moderately complicated, but turns go by rather smoothly once you get the hang of it. It can be played with two to four players but <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/196340/yokohama" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Board Game Geek</a> says it’s best with three.</p></div><p id="unconscious-mind"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Unconscious Mind">Unconscious Mind</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218900"><div id="218900" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unconscious Mind</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unconscious Mind is a heavy Euro game about psychology and grief. It is also hands down one of the most gorgeous games I own. Gameplay is complex, providing options for layered strategies in movement and timing to best execute moves. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wX6EA?object_uuid=ba4899ce-31d7-4008-9ed2-a48d30df13a2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DWV7PGWK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Nightmares expansion</u></a> also further adds potential complexities to help make the game more challenging or, with some pieces like the fireworks and the gramophone lighter for folks who may want a softer experience. A heads up, however: this game takes a while to get going. You'll need time for setup, time to teach it to your fellow player, and time for the gameplay itself. It’s far more time than the box says, so be prepared for a longer haul time of gaming when you sit down with this.</p></div><p id="wayfarers-of-the-south-tigris"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Wayfarers of The South Tigris">Wayfarers of The South Tigris</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218901"><div id="218901" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wayfarers of The South Tigris</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Wayfarers is a complex but satisfying combination of dice and worker placement game that surprised me with how fun it was it was. The worker placement is connected to dice rolls, giving a bit of a chance to combine actions with workers and decisions, which, when they click, can be rewarding. The game has a lot of decision space to determine your moves. It can seem intimidating at first glance, especially if you're not versed in heavier Euro games. I was first intimidated by this game, and then pleasantly surprised when I finally sat down to play a three-player game of it. While resources are tight, with multiple decisions being key, it provides a lot of replayability. Don’t pass on this game – you’ll miss out on a lot of fun if you do. </p></div><p id="darwins-journey"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Darwin’s Journey">Darwin’s Journey</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218902"><div id="218902" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Darwin’s Journey</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve always wanted to be a scientific explorer like Darwin, you’ll enjoy playing Darwin’s Journey.

User warning, however: this game has several heavy themes and is not advisable for folks who are not prepared to encounter some very sad content that, while it does happen in the rock star life, is not always groovy to come across if you’re unprepared for it.</p></div><p id="age-of-comics-the-golden-years"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Age of Comics: The Golden Years">Age of Comics: The Golden Years</h2></p><div catalogid="9a9b853a-71c8-43d4-94ff-8d535650af42" id="218907"><div id="218907" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Age of Comics: The Golden Years</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Chances are that if you are here on IGN, you are like me and love <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/comics"><u>comics</u></a>. Age of Comics: The Golden Years gives you a chance to build a catalogue of comics during the Golden Age. Hire artists, writers, and inkers to help design your book. Race other players on their own publishing journeys to create ideas and publish comics to sell and reach fandom. While the art is full of pulpy goodness, you don’t have to be a comic book fan to enjoy the game. Heck, you don’t even have to have your own original ideas to produce books in the game, either. They sometimes say that you have to fake it until you can make it. In Age of Comics, you can do both if you want to. This one is playable for up to four players but is best with three. Like Septima and some others on the list, you can play it solo if you desire to pull it off the shelf alone. It’s also one of the easiest games on this list to learn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jennifer Stavros is a contributing freelancer for IGN, covering everything from comics, games, technology, and nerd culture.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Maelle’s weapon of choice is a fencing rapier; and you best believe she knows how to use it. Actually, so should you, since nearly all of her additional moves are, basically, fencing strategies disguised as stat changes. With only a couple of late game exceptions, and a couple of stray Fire abilities we’ll get into, <strong>the vast majority of her obtainable skills are about doing either heavy Physical damage, or applying some diabolical shit to enemies in order to do heavy Physical damage</strong>. Even if she’s not the one to do the damage, she’s got the skills to set someone else up for success. </p><p>“Oh ho ho ho,” you might say, “but those are all 1-3 hits and Fire skills. She still has her work cut out dealing with shields.” Au fucking contraire, mon ami, <strong>she’s got a skill called Breaking Rules that’s not even terribly far into her skill tree that literally nullifies shields, no matter how many the enemy’s got slapped on</strong>. You know that one Nevron with the floating orbs, and shooting one puts six shields on everybody else on the field? Light work. The game should literally come up with a prompt that asks “Are you sure you want to make the biggest mistake of your stupid life” if you ever try to remove Maelle from your party? </p><h2 id="h314182"><a id="stance"></a>Special mechanic: Stance</h2><figure id="" data-id="228e38644cd279be8acc8bd161b1665b" data-recommend-id="image://228e38644cd279be8acc8bd161b1665b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maelle prepares to strike her enemies in Virtuose stance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Maelle prepares to strike her enemies in Virtuose stance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="228e38644cd279be8acc8bd161b1665b" data-recommend-id="image://228e38644cd279be8acc8bd161b1665b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Maelle prepares to strike her enemies in Virtuose stance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But of course, there’s the real reason you’re here, which is to figure out how to effectively use the Stance system. And the key word is “effectively,” because it’s extremely easy to get caught out there in Offense Mode, wondering why Maelle just got merked by a leaf hitting her face in a stiff breeze. </p><div><p>To be fair, the game explains her mechanic way too quick, so let’s go over bascis again.. <strong>Every one of Maelle’s abilities puts her into one of four Stances each with their own perks/drawbacks</strong>:</p></div><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Stanceless</strong>: Where you start in every battle. No effects. </li><li><strong>Defensive Stance</strong>: Take less damage; gain 1 extra AP on every successful dodge or parry.</li><li><strong>Offensive Stance</strong>: Deal 50% more damage, but also take 50% more damage.</li><li><strong>Virtuose Stance</strong>: Deal 200% damage.</li></ul><div><p>Now, while Maelle’s skill set can absolutely slay a field of enemies, you still have to think of her in fencing terms. Overextension can get you stabbed, while being a turtle on constant defense doesn’t get things done. Meanwhile, <strong>the game actually incentivizes you to keep moving by giving you an additional AP every time you change stances</strong>. So, figuring out what to put on her to give you the least vulnerability while still being as effective as she needs to be is the trick of it, but there’s a lot of flexibility therein. </p><p>The dream, of course, is to get in Virtuose Mode, where Maelle is become death, destroyer of worlds. But even then, you only get two turns to do the most damage with that, and your team may have other needs, like with one of her skills that grants Shell, or if, say, they’re all dead, and you need to use Phoenix Flame to rez them all. </p></div><h2 id="h314183"><a id="builds"></a>Recommended builds/synergy</h2><p>For much of the game, the only elemental damage Maelle will have access to is all Fire-based. You get Void damage way down the line. You’ll figure out how that plays out on your own by then. And even then, Fire is going to be enough, especially since <strong>the easiest way to get Maelle into Virtuose Mode most of the time is Burning an enemy and hitting them with Swift Stride</strong>. Yes, that means go get that off your Skill Board ASAP; it’s gonna be a mainstay through much of the first half of the game. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Gustave In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>So, naturally, giving Maelle or her companions Fire abilities to back her up and take advantage of the constant Burn is gonna be an imperative. But, even if you decide otherwise, Maelle’s got plenty of her own. She’ll start with Spark which will get the job done, just know that you’ll have to blow a turn to cast it and it’s already gonna cost you another one to cast Swift Stride. Screw that, let somebody else get that ball rolling, least till you pick up the far more devastating Rain of Fire skill for her later. Both are effective, though worth noting that while <strong>Spark will put Maelle in Defensive Mode, Rain of Fire ends with her in Offensive</strong>. Be prepared for whatever’s coming next. </p><p>Once she’s Virtuosed out, though, you’ll need to capitalize as best you can, and in the early going, the Critical Burn Picto/Lumina (Critical Hit chance goes up 25% on Burning enemies) is a pretty easy place to start. It’d be nice if one of your companions can <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694">slap a Mark</a></span> or Defenseless on your prey, but the irony there is that if the enemy is Burning already, that first hit will remove the status. <strong>Be mindful of the play order on the left of the battle screen so you can line that up just right and have Maelle go right after an enemy’s been afflicted</strong>. </p><p>Percee and Fleuret Fury are usually a death sentence for enemies after that, and since she’s likely gonna be the last thing a lot of lesser enemies see, Maelle can get a lot of use out of the Dead Energy Picto (3 AP after killing an enemy). But in the event those two skills don’t put a Nevron out of its misery, Fleuret Fury will at least re-up on Virtuose. The main issue here is that Fleuret Fury’s expensive. Keeping Maelle topped off on AP is crucial but, especially for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">a character like Lune</a></span> who’s less useful in a fight where the elements aren’t as effective, it’s worthwhile having someone whose primary job it is to keep Maelle juiced up if her Pictos haven’t gotten to kick in.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Lune In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>Once she’s tapped out, though, your new job is making sure Maelle can build up to a full bar of AP again. And early on, that’s not as easy as it sounds. A Picto like Energising Pain (1 AP after taking damage) can help, but this is the exact situation Defensive Mode is good for, making sure she can take a hit and likely survive longer than her friends.</p><p>Nail these principles and our little fencer will be an absolute menace against anything that threatens the Expedition.</p><hr><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While Explosive Spear proves powerful and is a valuable skill to invest a gem in, that’s for later. Right now, let’s prioritize a movement ability that does damage and allows you to put some distance between you and your formidable foes.</p><p>Disengage, once activated, allows you to leap backward while rupturing the ground in front of you, sending spikes of dirt and stone toward your enemies.

Remove yourself from a fight, tap Lightning Spear, and watch as electrical currents charge through the mob ahead of you. It’s also a useful skill when you want to kickstart a fight!</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Tier</strong>: 3</li><li><strong>Cost</strong>: 10 Mana</li><li><strong>Attack Speed</strong>: 50% of Base</li><li><strong>Attack Damage</strong>: 127%</li><li><strong>Requires</strong>: Level 6, 16 Dexterity, Spear</li></ul><h2 id="h320389"><a id="barrage"></a>Barrage</h2><figure id="" data-id="b2710c982e4781e6a7ebd8d4bb3ea827" data-recommend-id="image://b2710c982e4781e6a7ebd8d4bb3ea827" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The tier three Barrage skill for Huntress in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The tier three Barrage skill for Huntress in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b2710c982e4781e6a7ebd8d4bb3ea827" data-recommend-id="image://b2710c982e4781e6a7ebd8d4bb3ea827" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The tier three Barrage skill for Huntress in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>For your third major skill, the tier five ability, I’d opt for Barrage</strong>. While Rapid Assault hits fast and hard, and Storm Lance continues the theme of electrical damage-dealing attacks, Barrage allows you to tackle groups relatively easily. Like with Lightning Spear, albeit less situational, you can pop Barrage first to start a fight, dealing damage across a wide area and softening all targets, or use it after Disengage to finish a fight.</p><p>The downside to an area-of-effect (AOE) ability is dealing with a boss fight, which is generally a one-on-one showdown.

the old country--that is, Sicily. Players take on the role of Enzo Favara, a mobster whose life began in forced labor in his childhood. Now, 2K says he's "ready to risk everything to become a man of honor in the Torrisi crime family."</p><p dir="ltr">The game will play like a "classic mob movie," 2K says, and this means players will encounter the criminal underworld and everything that entails. Players can expect to face off against "cutthroat enemies" as they live the life of a mobster battling in turf wars.</p><p>"Enzo's story unfolds in a time when skill with a stiletto blade was a deadly asset, a lupara sawed-off shotgun was a go-to firearm, murderous vendettas raged for decades, and mafiosi patrolled their protection rackets on foot, horseback, or behind the wheel of turn-of-the-century motorcars," 2K said.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Not_open_world"><strong>Not open world</strong></h2><p>Unlike previous entries in the series, Mafia: The Old Country is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-isnt-open-world-and-doesnt-require-a-massive-time-commitment/1100-6531408/" data-ref-id="1100-6531408">liner, narrative-driven game as opposed to an open-world title.</a> 2K has said it believes there is a "large audience for compelling stories that don't require massive time commitments."</p><p>2K is releasing The Old Country as a linear game, and priced at $50 instead of $70 or more, against the backdrop of the proliferation of games with ballooning budgets, higher price points, and bigger asks from players to spend more time in their worlds.</p><p>So far, players have responded positively to the news of The Old Country's lower price point and trimmed-down scale, but it's too soon to say if this will pay off both in terms of the game's critical reception or sales.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Mafia__The_Old_Country_game_engine"><strong>Mafia: The Old Country game engine</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Mafia: The Old Country is developed using Epic's Unreal Engine 5, as well as Epic's AI-powered MetaHuman technology for its character models. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVhXaoX25AE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this developer video</a>, the developers talk about using Epic's game engine to hone in on "tiny details" to make The Old Country look alive.

The studio also made 2024's TopSpin 2K25--very much not a mobster game. The Mafia franchise was created by Illusion Softworks, which rebranded to 2K Czech when 2K bought the studio in 2008 and put the team on Mafia II. 2K Czech later merged with Hangar 13.</p><p dir="ltr">Mafia's creator, Daniel Vavra, now heads up Kingdom Come studio Warhorse.</p>

It’s a non-franchise IP from a less-known studio, but backed by Square Enix and led by some of the biggest legends from <em>Final Fantasy</em>’s classic era. So if that caught your eye over <em>SaGa</em> or <em>Shiren the Wanderer</em>, it’s understandable. But don’t sleep on <em>SaGa</em>, you’re missing out.</p><p>Anyway, <em>Fantasian</em> is a distinct kind of RPG and it may feel like there isn’t much out there like it at first. I’ve made some connections to a list of games, some way less obscure than others, that can be reasonably compared to <em>Fantasian</em> for one reason or another. Check them out, if you haven’t yet!

We’re talking about Hironobu “Father of <em>Final Fantasy</em>” Sakaguchi here. But the first <em>Final Fantasy</em> specifically shares some ideas with <em>Fantasian</em>’s fantasy/sci-fi genre blend. It gets weirdly washed out in the remakes, but later parts of the original NES version gradually remove the bright, organic colors in exchange for darker, dirtier tiles meant to convey metal, rust, and an unspoken explanation for why you start fighting robots. It’s fine if you just take my word for it and stick with the <em>Pixel Remaster</em> instead, though.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d6a509b5c694ab86015ff6bb3d9b0f8e" data-recommend-id="image://d6a509b5c694ab86015ff6bb3d9b0f8e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A cast of characters stand in a royal hall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A cast of characters stand in a royal hall." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d6a509b5c694ab86015ff6bb3d9b0f8e" data-recommend-id="image://d6a509b5c694ab86015ff6bb3d9b0f8e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A cast of characters stand in a royal hall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sometimes you don’t have to leave Square Enix territory if you like <em>Final Fantasy</em> but want something new and different. <em>SaGa</em> is a series often flying way under the radar, but those who know it swear by its unusual style, unique systems, and disinterest in player comfort. The recent <em>Romancing SaGa 2</em> remake dials back on the friction, but makes up for that sicko-enticing aspect with dense, rewarding systems and super slick combat.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bbb100c822441e1ea2d11e959e16c785" data-recommend-id="image://bbb100c822441e1ea2d11e959e16c785" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player fights monsters in a dark castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player fights monsters in a dark castle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->59 Studio</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bbb100c822441e1ea2d11e959e16c785" data-recommend-id="image://bbb100c822441e1ea2d11e959e16c785" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player fights monsters in a dark castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This might seem out of place if you haven’t finished <em>Fantasian</em> yet, but there are multiple dungeons in the back half that have you navigating dark, unmapped corridors in first-person. Wanna guess where that came from? DRPGs are a whole world unto themselves, and perhaps there’s no better place to start than Digital Eclipse’s remake of the O.G., <em>Wizardry</em>.

            <p>
After a year of faintly enigmatic developer blogs, Paradox has finally unveiled its sort-of-but-not-exactly-mysterious Project Caesar, confirming it to be (just as everyone had expected) Europa Universalis 5 - a "new era for grand strategy".
</p>
<p>
Paradox says Europa Universalis 5 has been in developed for the last five years at Paradox Tinto, a Barcelona-based studio assmembled from 'modders, super fans, and the best developers around the world'. The has been to create "the grandest strategy game" ever, and the result is a "very ambitious" Europa Universalis where players can "do pretty much everything".
</p>
<p>
This time around, players can experience history across a span of five hundred years, formulating their nation's strategy of sustainment and expansion from 1337 to 1837, progressing through the Renaissance era, the age of Enlightenment, and beyond. Key to all this is a "living world" built around "pops". Similar to those seen in other Paradox grand strategy games, these population groups are bound by the likes of a shared culture or religion (300 religions are said to be represented in EU5), and can range from a single person to millions.

<figcaption>And here's the announcment trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKaGSIm9juI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Pops are the primary driving force of a nation's econony, working in buildings such as farms and factories to produce goods feeding into all other aspects of EU5. You'll produce food to sustain the population or keep armies moving, for instance, or goods to trade at markets as required. Pops are also split into social classes - from peasants to the clergy and nobility - and further grouped into estates, each with their own thoughts and agendas. And you'll need to keep these groups happy - perhaps granting them special privileges - to pass crucial policies in parliament.
</p>
<p>
How you spend your time is ultimately up to you - you might opt for growth through trade, diplomacy, or military might - but your strategies will eventually guide you through six ages (traditions, renaissance, discovery, information, absolutism, and revolution) and "thousands of historical events". Each age brings different institutions representing the core ideas of their eras and unlocking new technology trees. So players embracing the Quest for the New World institution will, for instance, find it easier to colonise lands during the age of discovery.
</p>
<p>
All this plays out across a "new and larger" world described as the "most accurate and granular map [Paradox has] ever made for a grand strategy game". The means a greater number of nations and "more varied topographical features" - all promising to make for a radically different experience depending on a nation's set-up, neighbours, and even terrain. Geographical features can dramatically impact battle, for instance, with rivers, mountains, and straits all potentially influencing the outcome of war - just be sure not to leave your production houses empty of workers as you swell your ranks on the battlefield.
</p>
<p>
There's a lot more granular detail to be found in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZcN-eVta8">Europa Universalis 5's 30-minute long announcement video</a>, but one thing Paradox isn't quite ready to talk about yet is a release date. Currently all it's saying is it's "coming soon".

That could mean a hike of up to  $428 on the most expensive machines like a PS5 Pro. “American consumers would pay $12 billion more for video game consoles,” the report claims. “As a result, U.S. consumers reduce overall [game console] purchases by 73 percent.”</p><p>That worst-case scenario <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">would come close to crippling console gaming</a></span> in its largest market in the world. Fewer consoles sales mean fewer new games being bought, with knock-on effects that quickly filter out to the rest of the ecosystem, especially as each dollar spent on tariffs takes away from money that might have otherwise been spent on a new indie release or battle pass. Trump’s original rollout of the reciprocal tariffs was enough to get Nintendo to halt pre-orders for the Switch 2. Once the freeze was announced, the Mario maker later declared that the upcoming console would remain priced at $450, though individual accessories including controllers and cameras would each go up by $5.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mafia: The Old Country - “Whatever it Takes” Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"We think there's a large audience for compelling stories that don't require massive time commitments," 2K President David Ismailer said in a press release. "We're excited to offer a game like Mafia: The Old Country in our portfolio, and to provide a linear highly-polished narrative experience that can easily complement the other more persistent games our players also love and engage with on a more consistent basis."</p><p>This is a notable development considering many games and publishers have leaned into bigger open-world designs that require significant time investments to play and enjoy. These might be referred to as "lifestyle" games. Players have so far generally responded positively to the news that Mafia: The Old Country is taking a different approach, but of course, it's still early days.</p><p>The $60 Deluxe edition includes a range of bonus items, including special guns, outfits, and accessories, along with the game's score and a digital artbook. Everyone who preorders The Old Country gets the Soldato Pack, which includes various cosmetics.</p><p>The Old Country takes place in 1900s Sicily, with players taking on the role of mobster Enzo Favara. 2K says the game will play out like a "classic mob movie," featuring a "cast of unpredictable allies and cutthroat enemies." In terms of combat, players will shoot and stab people with knives and shotguns, while players can traverse the Sicilian countryside on horseback or in cars.</p><p>The Old Country launches on August 8 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It'll be followed by another big 2K game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a>, in September.</p>

What do people that play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> call themselves, frostpunks? Feels too obvious, but I'm going to do it anyway. Breaking news frostpunks! There's a new big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> update that's just arrived in the game, adding some pretty big additions and changes,so let's jump into them. First up, The Pit! No, it's not just some hole to chuck things in, it's a large new map with a "distinctive 'proto-crater' pit counted as mountain terrain," to be found within.
</p>

<p>
The heating system has seen a big overhaul too. Described as the "biggest systemic change since launch", this one localises heat management to individual districts. Each district can apparently have "unique" effects, as well as consequences if you're failing to keep places warm. There's a new heatmap view too so you can see how each district is doing temperature.

<p>
Serenity mode from the first game is back with this update, a good one for frostpunks that don't like stress. There's gentler weather, way more resources, shorter whiteouts, and the fervour system is completely gone, meaning no conflict between factions and very few protests.
</p>
<p>
You'll find new challenges in-game too, all of which apparently introduce a "unique quest and storyline. Multiple Tales can be combined in a single playthrough. Complete a Tale to unlock a unique Monument Hub to “decorate” your city, but be careful: failure results in game over!"
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game has received a few other tweaks to smooth things over as well, like a rebalanced prologue, improved tutorials, city visuals showing a denser population, alongside other changes. Modding tools are out of beta now, adding in features like a search bar, improved loading times, and tutorials.

                <p>Paradox Interactive has finally confirmed that its Tinto studio's Project Caesar, which it had been teasing through a series of <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/forums/tinto-talks.1171/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dev diary posts</a> on its forum, is Europa Universalis V. As the first new entry in this series in nearly 12 years and one releasing in a very different landscape for strategy games, questions arise about what will, or should, change. Paradox's answer is to simply rework and tweak a formula that has proven to work well, rather than changing everything to court new players.</p><p>I attended a digital preview event for Europa Universalis V and went hands-on with an early build of the real-time strategy game ahead of the announcement. I found that its biggest changes didn't address approachability--which you might think would be the primary focus to attract newcomers to the franchise--but instead added strategic depth. Europa Universalis V feels distinct from what came before, but it doesn't lose any of the series' identity and focus on complexity. This might be the most hardcore grand strategy game in Paradox's catalog.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKaGSIm9juI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MKaGSIm9juI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>All of the government, military, and economic strategy systems that the series is known for return in this latest entry, working in tandem to create a complex political climate that grows from the in-game starting point of 1337. Players take control of any nation they want from around the world and micromanage nearly every aspect of it. Grand strategy games are overwhelming in the amount of information and strategic options they present players, but become outstanding sandboxes for emergent storytelling once you know where to look and what to do--Europa Universalis V is no different.</p><p>Declaring war on a small neighboring country as Naples, only to get massive swaths of my territory annexed by France's army because I didn't notice the country I was attacking was their ally, was a frustrating moment. But it’s also one I won’t soon forget because it reminded me to pay closer attention to every little political detail Europa Universalis V offers and informed the rest of my play time as Naples. It was the kind of strategic mistake I won’t soon forget, as its fallout informed a non-negligible part of my country’s history.</p><p>The biggest hurdle Paradox will encounter with Europa Universalis V is encouraging players to upgrade to it. Every time Paradox releases a new game in one of its grand strategy series, it's asking players to move away from games they've spent potentially thousands of hours and hundreds of dollars on.</p><p>Ultimately, Paradox believes that the appeal of an upgrade to Europa Universalis V comes from the new gameplay changes. When asked why players should upgrade, game director Johan Andersson said he believes Europa Universalis V has "more mechanics" and "more content" than its predecessor, making the upgrade worthwhile. That answer once again stresses that mechanical depth is this strategy game's biggest draw.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489856-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489856" data-ratio="0.5619295958279" data-width="3835" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489856-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489856"></a><figcaption>This screenshot from the start of The Age of Discovery shows just how much information Europa Universalis V makes players account for.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489856-3.jpg"></figure><p>Some of these gameplay evolutions are influenced by other Paradox grand strategy games, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/victoria-3/" data-ref-id="5000-532092">Victoria 3</a>. For example, the population of Europa Universalis V's provinces is now split into population units, each of which can have different cultural, religious, and economic demands and preferences. Keeping everyone as happy as possible is key to keeping a nation stable, but that's easier said than done. There are also now more minutiae in the goods each province can produce, so players have to be more aware of whether they have a surplus of goods or if they have enough proper trade routes.</p><p>Europa Universalis V also goes back to the series' roots in different ways. First, it removes mana as a mechanic, which restricted when and how players could perform actions. Secondly, it brings back the policy sliders from the first three games in the series, providing a clearer indication of where one's nation stands in relation to different political values. All of these new systems and returning gameplay features give Europa Universalis V a clear identity of its own, if you know where to look.</p><p>And that identity is as a hardcore strategy game. Andersson outright called it "the most grand game we've ever made." Those hardcore fans are the ones most likely to appreciate all of the tweaks Paradox has made to the core of the Europa Universalis formula. But if you're someone who was hoping the next Europa Universalis would strip back complexity to make it more approachable, that's certainly not the case.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489857-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489857" data-ratio="0.5619295958279" data-width="3835" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489857-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489857"></a><figcaption>A clearer look at the world map in Europa Universalis V. Keep in mind that you can also play as countries outside of Europe.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489857-1.jpg"></figure><p>The one addition that will make Europa Universalis V a little more approachable is its automation system. It allows players to automate tasks related to the conquerer, explorer, trader, and gardener play styles. By using this feature, players can focus on specific parts of the game, whether for educational or entertainment purposes.</p><p>This approach doesn't sacrifice depth for the sake of approachability, as your best option will still be to manage everything yourself. Still, new players may want to automate certain tasks at first while getting used to all the changes and mechanics that Europa Universalis V introduces. As has historically been the case with Paradox Interactive's grand strategy games, Europa Universalis V is overwhelming at first, but captivating once you get a handle on everything going on. In this way, it doesn't sacrifice the series' identity, but the culmination of all the Paradox grand strategy games that came before it ensures the experience doubles down on the strategic complexity. As a strategy game fan, I love it--I'll take all the mechanical depth and complexity I can get.</p><p>Europa Universalis V does not balk at the challenge of offering a comprehensive grand strategy for its players, simply offering tools like automation so players can ease themselves into everything bit by bit. Although it may be tough for some to move on from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/europa-universalis-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-149860">Europa Universalis IV</a>, a game with over 12 years of updates and DLC, those who make the jump will discover what's shaping up to be the next great grand strategy sandbox from Paradox.</p>

		<p>It’s almost always been the case that you have to wait a good long time between grand strategy and 4X sequels, but those gaps have stretched longer and longer for Paradox Interactive’s most notable series. After the 12 year gap before the much meme’d <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/victoria-3">Victoria 3</a>, it’s now almost 12 years from EU4 to the announcement and reveal of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/europa-universalis-v">Europa Universalis V</a> as well.</p>
<p>Of course, the tone of that wait is different, when EU4 has had a steady flow of expansions over the years, but with a numbered sequel comes the opportunity and the expectation of great changes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Europa Universalis V: Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MKaGSIm9juI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first thing to note is that EU5 shunts the starting date of the game even earlier than before, going back to 1337 and capturing more of that transition from the late Middle Ages and into the Renaissance. More importantly, it also brings a few truly seismic world events into the game’s opening few hours (depending on how much you pause the game, that is). The Hundred Years War kicks off between England and France literally months after you hit play, and then just a decade or so later the Black Death rolls through the world, adding an early game crisis point that you’ll feel the ramifications from for decades to come.</p>
<p>As the Black Death is first reported, you’re given a few choices for how to react. You can just keep going business as usual, keep up trade, allow migration and for people to just do their things, or you can enact various isolationist policies. Spending influence you can try to source cures, you can draw all the Nobles to a little retreat that tries to keep you away from the riff-raff, you can close down cities, exile the infected, make scapegoats of the healthy, and more. It’s difficult to know what the best path to take here is –&nbsp;obviously there’s no actual cure or vaccines at this time, so you will feel the pain, and it’s almost just about how long you want to drag this out for. Playing as Portugal, I got the plague fairly late on, but with my choices, I still had that wash of green within my borders much longer than Spain, Morocco or England did. I clearly bungled it…</p>


<p>And that flushed my economy right down the pan, to be honest. With trade massively impacted, production all starved of workers, and my coffers completely dry, I needed a slew of big loans from my nobles, which were then being traded back and forth to foreign banks, and my attempts to micromanage this were barely keeping my kingdom afloat.</p>
<p>Thankfully this is where I could lean on one of the major areas of improvement within EU5. There’s much more automation available to you which, in the long run, will give you more freedom to play this game in the fashion that you want. Initially I was micromanaging trade, putting in deals to meet the needs of the pops and production, quickly clicking through on individual deals, but then seeing them quickly become unprofitable as supply dried up –&nbsp;this can be applied to trade in general, as well as to specific markets. Similarly, I was somewhat fearful of raising taxes across nobles, burghers, and the common folk, lest they get all angry and rebel, but got into such financial straights after the pandemic that I told the AI to take over and rake in enough cash for me to start recovering. There’s further automation for other areas, with the Automation AI based on the same AI leading computer-controlled nations, so you likely will want to keep key areas under your control or supervise, otherwise you could end up in a pseudo spectator mode –&nbsp;albeit one where there’s regular events to make decisions on, where foreign policy and wars are in your control, and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, each of these areas has also been revisited by Paradox Tinto to reconsider how they work, whether you put them in the hands of AI or furiously click your way through menus yourself.</p>

<p>Let’s stick with trade for the moment, which is defined not by your cities, ports or nation as a whole, but rather by markets that can cross country divides and regions. For Portugal, my two markets were both based in Castile, both of them with their own tendrils of supply and demand. To a certain</p>
<p>At the heart of any nation is its people, and EU5 has population units more similar to Victoria 3 or Imperator: Rome. There’s some core demographics to pay attention to here, as they’re broken down by their class and working status – from Nobles down through Laborers to Slaves, if your nation’s laws allow them – while there’s also their religion and cultural background to consider for the harmony within your country. When looking at your government, these are broken down into Estates for Nobles, Clergy, Berghers, Commoners, which you’re trying keep their broad approval and happiness. Often times, you’re having to make concessions, especially if (as a monarchy) you hold a council and need their approval to push a new agenda. Approval gradually shifts in a given direction to a neutral position,</p>

<p>Those decisions that you’re making will tie in with the Societal Values system, reviving the policy sliders from older titles in the series and replacing the Ideas of EU4. This breaks particular issues down into polar opposites –&nbsp;Spiritualist vs. Humanist, Land vs. Navy, Aristocracy vs. Plutocracy –&nbsp;and measures along these scales. Naturally, you enact policy and make decisions that nudge things one way or another, but there’s tons of these elements to keep in mind.</p>
<p>One of the ways you can affect societal change is with your Cabinet, a small cadre of officers that you can send out to perform tasks for you. One key tenet is the notion of Control throughout your nation. While your ruler or government presides in the capital, the further away from the seat of power you get, the less it really matters to the people living there, the more like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtYU87QNjPw">Monty Python’s Repressed Citizens skit</a> it might feel like, and the more difficult it is to exert your influence (and gather taxes). Building roads improves Control as the time to travel and the kind of closeness to cities is improved. They can also be set to work restoring your country’s Stability after a period of upheaval or with a looming threat, work to develop a province, try to convert a region’s populace, and much more. They’re an extension of your will and gradually get things done.</p>

<p>In general, there’s a step away from having certain traits and skills be treated as resources. Instead of having to save up points before you can send your advisors on a new task, instead they have a particular skill rating that affects how well and how quickly that job will get done. This does mean that their impact feels much more gradual, but also gives you more flexibility to pivot as world events take place.</p>
<p>We’ve barely scratched the surface of many elements of Europa Universalis 5. For example, we didn’t get stuck into a war, so didn’t try out the revamped military systems, which borrow ideas from Imperator: Rome for having formations, while requiring you to have logistics and resources to keep an army marching. Meanwhile, there’s a new antagonism rating that could see alliances spring up against you if you’re too aggressively expanding through the world. Then there’s playing through the longer passage of time, as technology works through individual trees for the starting Age of Traditions, through the Age of Renaissance, Discovery, and beyond.</p>

<p>Europa Universalis 5 remains a deep and complex historical grand strategy game, and it certainly looks to build and integrate, not only idea that came from a decade of updates and expansions to EU4, but also to some of the more fundamental shifts and ideas that we saw in Victoria 3 and Imperator: Rome. Importantly, there is that on-ramp for newcomers, with the deeper automation set to lift some of the burdens of leaning the ropes, at the same time as lifting some of the micromanagement that can become a chore deeper into a campaign.</p>

		<p>Paradox Interactive has revealed Europa Universalis V, their latest grand strategy sequel that is in development at Paradox Tinto, having gone under the codename Project Caesar for the past year or so.</p>
<p>No release date or window has been set just yet, but the game is now available to wishlist, to keep tabs on announcements through Steam</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Caesar - Official Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YaZcN-eVta8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>EU5 has been announced almost 12 years after EU4 arrived in August 2013, but even with all of the expansions and updates for the last game, this sequel promises to be no less deep and complex for ardent fans of the series. Still, Paradox has gone through their game, reconsidered a number of areas and mechanics, and reset the foundations for the coming decade. They’ve done this in tandem with the community, even so far as to founding Paradox Tinto five years ago and the team that was built around it.</p>
<p>There’s some key differences between the two games, some of which can be seen as drawing from other Paradox games released in the last few years.</p>

<ul>
<li>EU5’s start date is 1337, just before the outbreak of the Hundred Years War between England and France, and not long before the other outbreak that defined the era, with the Bubonic Plague set to sweep across Europe in the 1340s. The game continues on through to 1837.</li>
<li>Time is broken down into ages, such as the Age of Discovery where you can colonise distant lands, giving you the opportunity to adopt Institutions that define the technology trees that you follow.</li>
<li>There’s hundreds of millions of people being simulated across the world of EU5. Each province is now broken up into population units (POPS), similar to Victoria 3 and Imperator: Rome, each of which can have a different culture, religion, class and so on. Your fundamental job is to keep the fed, loyal and happy.</li>
<li>Trade does away with merchants and trade nodes, but there is instead a system of regional markets that have their own borders and regions. Setup trade routes between nations, sell surplus goods, and be mindful of needs and desires from your buildings and pops.</li>
<li>Societal Values see the return of policy sliders from earlier games, which were absent in EU4’s Ideas system. These sliders give your nation’s position between two opposing political values, with new sliders emerging as you progress through the ages.</li>
<li>There’s no more “Mana” where you accumulate points for nebulous resources to spend on actions. Now your monarch and their advisors have skill ratings for Administrative, Diplomatic and Military and this will affect the eventual cost over time and speed of actions.</li>
<li>Automation is a bigger part of EU5, letting you offload managing the economy, trade, building, production and more to an AI that is based on the same logic the computer controlled nations use. This is optional, and means that you can focus on what you find fun. If you want to micromanage, then you can, but if you want to focus on foreign policy and war, or deal more with events and major decisions, then you can do that too.</li>
<li>Warfare now has the military formations of Imperator: Rome, adding a tactical layer to your army set ups. Armies can be given directives for how to act in times of war – make a beeline to set up castle sieges, for example – and resource control is a major factor in how long you can go to war for, taking the resources and production away from a nation you’re invading.</li>
</ul>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/survios-debuts-story-trailer-for-alien-rogue-incursion/">Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One</a> was one of the standout VR games in 2024, and for Alien fans with a VR headset to play it, it was the kind of Alien game those fans had been waiting for since Alien: Isolation.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Rogue Incursion developer Survios announced that Alien fans without VR headsets will soon be able to join the fun, with Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One: Evolved Edition, a flatscreen version of the original VR game, arriving on September 30, 2025, for PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>You can wishlist the game now, with the standard edition coming in at $29.99 USD and the deluxe edition which includes a digital art book and a weapon and armor skin costs $39.99 USD.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition | PS5 &amp; PC Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Ho3DAL11eA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Rogue Incursion is re-tooled from being a VR game since so much of the original experience was clearly designed for VR. The trailer Survios released today looks like it's showing footage captured in the game's engine, but it doesn't look like actual gameplay.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that this is still just part one of a two-part story, a fact that wasn't clear ahead of Rogue Incursion's original release. When Part One launched, Survios released a <a href="https://x.com/Survios/status/1870484344768172495">statement</a> to players saying that it understood why the last-minute addition of the 'Part One' subtitle to the game's full title was negatively interpreted by players, adding that it did not "<em>intend to mislead or cause confusion about what this game is</em>."</p>
<p>It also clarified that it didn't cut the game short or in half, and that this was always the plan, though for whatever reason, the words 'Part One' were not publicly added to the title until after the game launched.</p>
<p>Now that we know Survios has been working on a flatscreen version of Part One alongside the development of Part Two now brings up the question of whether Part Two will be available as a VR headset first, and a flatscreen game later, or if it'll be playable with or without a VR headset at launch.</p>

			<p>The action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-access-for-titan-quest-ii-set-for-winter-2024-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Titan Quest II</a> has had its early access launch shifted to Summer 2025, developer Grimlore Games <a href="https://x.com/TitanQuestGame/status/1920515492902551765" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today. A crowded release window and the desire to improve the game based on the community's feedback mixed to push the studio toward this choice.</p>
<p>Still, the developers said the recent demo playtest was very successful. Thousands of players participated, streamed, and completed surveys. Grimlore said that over 92% of these playtesters rated their experience as positive or very positive, with long-time franchise fans particularly enthusiastic about capturing the spirit of the original while moving forward with modernized systems.</p>
<p>The playtest featured the game's introductory chapter, where players could choose between two masteries and face the first boss, Appollonia the Terrible - a battle that proved a fan favourite. The visuals and audio received outstanding marks, with average scores of 5.25/6 and 5.16/6, respectively, while exploration and environmental storytelling were frequently highlighted as memorable features.</p>
<p>Not all was great, though, which is why Titan Quest II was delayed. Combat fluidity, skill targeting, and balance were all in need of improvements, which Grimlore said are being addressed, while performance optimization continues. Additionally, a customizable control scheme and revamped user interface indicators are underway based on the community's suggestions.</p>
<p>In the game, players will have to face against Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance, who is inexplicably out of control. She is corrupting the threads of fate and condemning all those who oppose her to eternal punishment - including the main character. Players must pick up their weapon, fight alongside the gods, and change fate itself to stop Nemesis, free those she's punished, and weave their own epic tale.</p>
<p>They'll get to create their own class by combining two of the masteries, forging a unique hybrid playstyle thanks to different combinations of skill modifiers, attributes, and items.</p>

Rockstar probably knew what it was doing when it led the latest trailer with a scene of Jason working hard while his jacked upper body glistened in the sunlight. Though choosing this scene probably had a double meaning, as Jason mentions that he’s “fixing some leaks” on a rooftop, which is likely a nod <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-aaron-garbut-son-tiktok-1851070189&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-aaron-garbut-son-tiktok-1851070189">to the giant leak <em>GTA 6 </em>suffered in 2023</a></span>. While Jason’s filthy, country trashbandit disposition may win over some ladies, too, it’s the kind of thing gays flock to. Sure, there’s probably something to unpack about gay guys gravitating towards men who look like they wouldn’t respect them, but that’s a psychologist’s job, and I am simply a gay man who is predictably drawn to men who look like they would call me a slur. But I’m not alone. Plenty of us are thirsting for the next <em>Grand Theft Auto </em>protagonist in the out-of-pocket ways they tend to.</p><p>This is a win for the girls and the gays. A mere 20 seconds of footage has piqued the interest of every gay gamer you’ve ever met. That’s exquisite targeted marketing on Rockstar’s part, and now the game will get even more free promotion through the inevitable bump in Rule 34 searches for Jason in the coming months. Not that the game really needs that much promotion. This is the kind of game that sells millions of copies on the first day, then stays near the top of the charts for several years. But it’s nice to see Rockstar is aware of every market it can possibly corner.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It is a “linear, narrative-driven” game, a “focused package” that offers a “cinematic experience.” You might find yourself driving around an authentic representation of 1900s Sicily in Mafia: The Old Country, or even riding around on horseback a bit like that other Rockstar game, but the similarities to Rockstar games stop there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

At $59.99... jeesh, maybe not.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Prismatic Evolution Stamped Surprise Box Cards</h3><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/08/umbreon-pokemon-tcg-ign-1746714881932.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Umbreon ex - 060/131 (Prismatic Evolutions Stamp)</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">But still, it's been a popular pick amongst <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-may-8-2025">IGN's Daily Deals readers</a>, so who am I to judge? Make your own decisions when buying, just don't say I didn't warn you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, you can also consider picking up the singles you might be chasing via trusted retailers like TCGPlayer. Let's explore the top Prismatic Evolutions cards available to pick up today as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're, like me, just interested in the Suprise Box for the promo cards, it might be worth just buying the cards standlone. The most expensive <a href="https://zdcs.link/z62qDZ?object_uuid=df5b0964-4c67-4039-928b-93414a5c727f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(of course it's Umbreon)</a> is going for the same price as one of these boxes, with the rest coming in at well under $20. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So for the price of two to three Suprise Boxes, you can get the complete collection. If you want to rip open packs and pull these promos yourself then go for it, but it'll cost you.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Prismatic Evolution Chase Cards</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Dropping over a grand on a Pokémon card sounds mental, but this Umbreon SIR has come down quite a bit after release. Sitting at <a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3q4N?object_uuid=df5b0964-4c67-4039-928b-93414a5c727f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$1100, that's a fall of around $500 and change</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All the other chase cards of Prismatic Evolutions have fallen to under the $500 mark, with my favorite <a href="https://zdcs.link/916nGn?object_uuid=df5b0964-4c67-4039-928b-93414a5c727f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Roaring Moon ex SIR dropping to $221 at the time of writing</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These prices may very well fall more as the year goes on and attention shifts, but these are pretty good prices considering what the bloated Pokémon card market would have you believe just a month ago.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Pokémon TCG: Best Deals Today</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're trying to keep up with Pokémon TCG without getting ripped off or left behind, here's where to start, including the latest update on what can be bought here and now from trusted retailers in the US.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Want to know more about the best single Pokémon cards out there right now?

Titan Quest 2 missing that timeframe came from Grimoire Games wanting to avoid a "crowded ARPG release window and a desire to give the game the spotlight it deserves," according to a press release. A specific early-access release date was not given.</p>

<p dir="ltr">For context, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4's</a> Vessel of Hatred expansion launched in October 2024 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-passes-over-1-million-early-access-players-dev-warns-of-server-struggles/1100-6528281/" data-ref-id="1100-6528281">Path of Exile 2 launched in early access</a> just a few months later in December. That would have definitely made it difficult for Titan Quest 2 to stand out among the two biggest names in the ARPG genre.</p><p dir="ltr">Grimoire Games, alongside the new release window, also outlined areas where players can expect changes and improvements ahead of early access based on feedback from recent playtests. That list of areas needing "refinement," according to a press release, are combat fluidity, ability aiming, game balance, and performance optimization. The team will additionally add new customizable control schemes and better UI indicators based on player feedback.</p><p dir="ltr">Like its 2006 predecessor, Titan Quest 2 will drop players into ancient Greece to battle against mythological foes like Gryphons, Harpies, and Centaurs, this time on a quest to stop the goddess Nemesis from corrupting the Threads of Fate and condemning all who oppose her. Players will be able to choose from different combat masteries and combine two of them to create unique builds, with Titan Quest 2 aiming to be a challenging ARPG experience that will require players to dodge and use every skill at their disposal to overcome foes. The game will also feature crafting, allowing players to turn what normally would not be a great item into a more powerful one by adding affixes.</p><p dir="ltr">In other ARPG news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-8-is-making-endgame-bosses-stronger-simpler-to-access-and-more-rewarding/1100-6530970/" data-ref-id="1100-6530970">Diablo 4 Season 8 just began</a>, revamping its endgame boss system and introducing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-everything-diablo-4-and-immortals-berserk-crossover-entails/1100-6530989/" data-ref-id="1100-6530989">Berserk crossover</a>, while developer Grinding Gear Games has been hard at work addressing complaints in regards to an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-devs-respond-to-unpopular-update-there-were-some-blatant-f-ups/1100-6530736/" data-ref-id="1100-6530736">unpopular major update to Path of Exile 2</a>.</p>
