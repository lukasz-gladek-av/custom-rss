            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shutting-down-playstation-stars<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that it's bringing an end to its PlayStation Stars loyalty program, but you'll be able to spend your points for quite a while after the program ends.</p>

<p>In a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/21/playstation-stars-coming-to-a-close-as-sie-evaluates-new-ways-to-evolve-future-loyalty-program-efforts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, loyalty VP Grace Chen says that as a result of "evaluating the types of activities [PlayStation] players respond best to" over the course of the Stars program, Sony will be "winding down" the program's current incarnation in July.</p>

<p>Chen says Sony intends to "continue to evaluate [its] key findings from this program", and that the company is "looking into ways to build upon these learnings", although she doesn't specify what those learnings are.</p>

Additionally, if you cancel your Stars membership, you won't be able to rejoin and you'll lose all your points.</p>

<p>If you are a current Stars member, you'll be able to continue earning points and rewards until July 23rd at 11am Eastern, at which point no new campaigns will be made available and no new rewards or benefits will be added.</p>

<p>The PlayStation Stars program will fully come to an end in November next year, and you'll be able to spend any points you still have lying around until then, so make sure to grab your store credit or other benefits while you can.</p>

<p>If you've managed to accrue any Digital Collectible items with PlayStation Stars, those will still remain accessible to you, even after the program comes to an end.</p>




<p>PlayStation Stars was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-stars-is-new-playstation-loyalty-program-launching-this-year" rel="nofollow">originally announced back in 2022</a>&nbsp;(then released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-stars-us-release-date-is-suddenly-today" rel="nofollow">later that year</a>)&nbsp;as a way for PlayStation users to earn loyalty points for playing games, earning trophies, or winning tournament-style events.</p>

<p>It sounds like Sony is considering implementing other loyalty-style programs, although we'll probably have to wait quite some time before the company reveals more about its ideas on this front. Stay tuned for more.</p>

It has been updated as part of Kotaku’s</em> <em>Mission: Impossible Week. </em></p><p>The <em>Mission: Impossible</em> franchise technically started as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_(1966_TV_series)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_(1966_TV_series)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a spy-themed television series from the 1960s</a></span>, which got a sequel series in the ‘80s. But when most people talk about the <em>Mission Impossible</em> franchise in 2025, they are likely referring to the long-running action film franchise starring Tom Cruise that has grown into something much larger and over-the-top than the old TV shows. These films, which began in 1996, typically showcase Cruise risking his life in at least three or four large stunts and also, bizarrely, have only gotten better with each release. A globe-trotting action-adventure franchise that makes tons of money, is loved by critics, and has a massive fanbase seems like ideal material for a video game adaptation. Oddly, that’s not been the case.<br></p><p>Since the beginning of the franchise, only <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mission:_Impossible_video_games&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mission:_Impossible_video_games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">five <em>Mission: Impossible</em> video games have been released</a></span>. (Confusingly, four of them are just named <em>Mission: Impossible</em>.) The first game launched in 1990 for the NES. The second game was released the following year for DOS. These two were based on the 1980s sequel series that aired on ABC.<br></p><p>Then in 1998, two years after the first Tom Cruise film, another <em>Mission: Impossible</em> game launched on the Nintendo 64. This one has some fans, and played a lot like a third-person spin on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/goldeneye-007-n64-xbox-switch-port-bugs-60-fps-patch-1850041167&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/goldeneye-007-n64-xbox-switch-port-bugs-60-fps-patch-1850041167">Rare’s popular<em> GoldenEye 007</em> game</a></span>. Two years after that, right before the second film hit theaters, a very short and not-good <em>Mission: Impossible</em> game landed on Game Boy Color. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/C9qqtcDVHw8?t=294&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/C9qqtcDVHw8?t=294" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this game did include a neat feature</a></span> that let players use the Game Boy as a remote control.</p><p>Finally, in 2003, <em>Mission: Impossible — Operation Surma</em> launched on PlayStation 2 and later GameCube. This third-person action-adventure spy-thriller takes place between the events of <em>Mission: Impossible II</em> and the third film, but is also never directly referenced in the films and doesn’t even feature the likeness of Tom Cruise. It was essentially a <em>Metal Gear Solid/Splinter Cell </em>clone and in 2025 has been mostly forgotten, like the rest of the<em> M:I</em> video games.<br></p><h2 id="h544726"><a id=""></a><strong>It’s time for a new <em>Mission: Impossible</em> video game</strong></h2><p>And…that’s it! After 2003, we stopped getting new<em> Mission: Impossible</em> games. I understand that the film series hit a six-year lull between the second and third, but after<em>&nbsp;</em>2011’s <em>Ghost Protocol</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/mission-impossible-movies-ranked-tom-cruise-mcquarrrie-1850610860?_gl=1*1vdevzg*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDc4NDY2NjIkbzg0JGcxJHQxNzQ3ODQ2NzEyJGoxMCRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/mission-impossible-movies-ranked-tom-cruise-mcquarrrie-1850610860?_gl=1*1vdevzg*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDc4NDY2NjIkbzg0JGcxJHQxNzQ3ODQ2NzEyJGoxMCRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw..">the franchise kept getting bigger and better</a></span> with each entry. 2018’s <em>Mission: Impossible Fallout</em> is probably the best film in the series. (<em>Dead Reckoning</em>, sadly, couldn’t keep the trend going.)</p><p>And yet, even as the franchise grows bigger and bigger, no new video games are on the horizon. What a shame! So many moments in recent <em>MI </em>films feel almost like setpieces from AAA video games of the last decade. It makes sense to me that this series would translate well into a modern video game.<br></p><p>I understand that over the last decade or so, we’ve stopped getting crappy games based on popular films. And I’ve been mostly fine with that, as the vast majority of games based on films were awful and not worth playing. Then again, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hitman-studio-s-project-007-will-feature-a-new-james-bo-1846137133&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-studio-s-project-007-will-feature-a-new-james-bo-1846137133">we <em>are</em> getting a new <em>007</em> game</a></span> from the <em>Hitman </em>devs, and a new <em>Avatar</em> one from Ubisoft, so it’s not like games based on movies are impossible to make these days.<br></p><p>And I think a <em>Mission: Impossible</em> game—if done right and given enough time and resources—could be amazing. Honestly, a game where you just recreate all the famous and dangerous stunts from the films would be great, like a new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuntman:_Ignition&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuntman:_Ignition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Stuntman</em></a></span> but based entirely on <em>Mission: Impossible</em> scenes. Actually, it’s been a long time since we got a good <em>Stuntman </em>game, too.<br></p><p>Okay, new plan: Someone convince the right people to fund the development of a new <em>Stuntman</em>-like game based on Tom Cruise’s wildest <em>Mission: Impossible</em> stunts. That’s the game I want. Thank you. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Today, we learned that Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, the harrowingly beautiful action game from Ninja Theory, will be joining their ranks, making its way onto Sony's platform sometime this summer. You can hear it announced by the team itself in a new trailer below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sh4QQyM1KP0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sh4QQyM1KP0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>On the same day it comes to PS5, Hellblade II will get some "exciting new features" across all platforms as a free update. This new iteration is known as the "Enhanced" version, though it's unclear how exactly the game will be improved. The newly published PlayStation Store page mentions "added features and immersive haptic feedback," so we can probably expect some new features to tie in with the Dualsense controller.</p><p>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II originally launched a year ago today on Xbox Series X/S and PC. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii/conquering-old-demons">Reviewer Marcus Stewart gave it a 9 out of 10</a>, writing that, "gripping storytelling, refined gameplay, and a jaw-dropping presentation make for a more wholly satisfying sophomore outing."

While technically different projects, this title is still fitting of <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s overall mood. As its protagonists set out from Lumière to try to prevent the godlike Paintress from wiping humanity from existence, the palpable fear among Expedition 33 is that their hard work will, like the voyages before them, simply be a suicidal stepping stone on the path of future generations’ success.</p><p><strong>(This piece contains spoilers for <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s journal entries, and some vague late-game spoilers for the end of Act II.)</strong></p><p>Not only is this sense of impending failure baked into the mission’s motto, “We lay the trail for those who come after,” but it’s also part of why expeditions keep a journal to leave behind for subsequent expeditions. The average player will stumble upon several of these journals while playing <em>Clair Obscur</em>, each one full of stories describing the actions taken by previous expeditions and, sometimes, the dangers that ultimately defeated them. Not every journal provides useful information: Expedition 36’s entry, for instance, is a beautiful albeit strategically useless poem, while Expedition 47’s merely describes the self-styled “Drunken Brigade’s” theories on maintaining inebriation during battle. But the majority drive home the fact that Expedition 33’s success is predicated not only on their own skills but also the progress made by their predecessors.</p><figure></figure><p><em>Clair Obscur</em> heightens this sense of asynchronous cooperation by plopping its heroes down in hostile, unfamiliar territory and giving them no other choice than to rely on what previous expeditions left behind. Many areas would be impossible to traverse without various handholds and grapple points; the player eventually learns these aren’t natural, but rather manmade features built into the environment by Expeditions 69 and 70. Similarly, a fleshy overpass in a late-game area is revealed as the grisly work of Expedition 35, who used their final moments after falling to a powerful monster to build the walkway over an otherwise unnavigable crevasse with their own corpses.</p><p>“So that’s what it means to lay the trail,” Expedition 35’s journal reads, its long-dead author combining gallows humor with numerous passages from the overall mission statement. “They used their bodies to create a bridge for those who come after. Expedition 35 is over but tomorrow comes.”</p><p>Even when previous expeditions haven’t left tangible help, their journals function like military intel for the challenges Expedition 33 faces. Expedition 59's journal cautions against eating defeated monsters, while a member of Expedition 66 left behind similar warnings for poisonous mushrooms they were given by Esquie, a lovable traveling companion you meet halfway into the game who functions like a <em>Final Fantasy</em> airship. The player might glean insight into how to allocate character stats from, say, Expedition 49, who focused entirely on healing and defensive skills, only to realize this turtle-like strategy only prolonged their suffering without offensive abilities to quickly dispatch enemies. This journal can remind the player that it's useful to spread points around rather than focus too heavily on a single aspect of a character's build.</p><p>Sometimes Expedition 33 must literally stand on the shoulders of their ancestors to forge ahead, but other journal entries aren’t quite as gruesome or on-the-nose. Expedition 40 discovered the forcefield surrounding the Paintress’ monolith after two explorers flew into it on hang gliders and were vaporized. Expedition 44 attempted to disguise themselves as monsters, but the real monsters weren’t fooled and cut them down. </p><figure></figure><p>None of these journal entries hold a candle to Expedition 60. While much of Expedition 33’s success comes from its use of the Lumina Converter, the in-universe tool that powers <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s Picto trait customization system, Expedition 60 was able to make it all the way to the Paintress without such frivolity. They even managed to break through the barrier surrounding her monolith through pure strength alone, and did it all while entirely naked to boot. I’ve included the entire text of the journal below because there’s no way a mere summary could do it justice.</p><blockquote><p>They mocked us when we said the human body is the strongest of them all. We trained relentlessly and now our bodies have achieved the pinnacle of human performance, with which we are able to crush our enemies!</p><p>We are SO much more agile and aerodynamic without the heavy uniforms constraining our glorious muscles. With Leslie’s unstoppable training regime, WE ARE IMPERVIOUS.</p><p>That’s how we were able to charge through that ghostly gommage barrier and reach the Paintress. But it seems we’ve been wrong about what she is. The Paintress is just as trapped as we. The real terror lies beneath the Monolith.</p><p>The rest of Expedition 60 marched on to confront him, while I was tasked to warn Lumière. But it seems I might have run out of time. One last swim separates me from Lumière, but even with my mighty muscles, I don’t know if I can outswim the Gommage.</p><p>So here I write my final message. Bare naked muscles will save the world! And don’t waste time on the Paintress, aim for the bottom of the Monolith!</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Despite a push for more diversity in games, they can often lean libertarian or even conservative in their worldviews. Some, in pursuit of gratifying player power fantasies, fall into subscribing to a version of Thomas Carlyle’s “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">great man</a>” theory, which argues history belongs to individuals born with superior traits. <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s treatment of its protagonists not as special heroes but as merely the next link in a chain of successes and failures makes for a far richer story than we often see from the medium.&nbsp;</p><p>Expedition 33, though perhaps better equipped than those who came before them, are only able to accomplish what they do thanks to the hundreds of reinforcements who paved the way before them. The ability to defeat a boss in seconds with an overpowered build means nothing if you can’t physically reach the enemy in the first place. Knowledge accrued over decades and shared between generations will always trump what one person can do on their own.</p><p>In his 1935 poem “Questions From a Worker Who Reads,” writer Bertolt Brecht <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/brecht/works/1935/questions.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asks</a>, “Caesar defeated the Gauls. / Did he not even have a cook with him? / Philip of Spain wept when his armada went down. / Was he the only one to weep?” <em>Clair Obscur</em> may not be as overtly political a text as Brecht's Marxist leanings, but it certainly interrogates the view of history – and video game narratives – that singular heroes succeed through their own strength. And much like "Questions," it comes to the same conclusion: None of us, from the wealthy entrepreneur to the struggling freelancer, accomplish anything on our own.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/suplex-wrestling-love-letter"><h3>A Love Letter To The Suplex, Wrestling’s Greatest Move</h3></a><p>If you ever get suplexed in real life, you probably deserved it and it was raw as fuck</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/web3-nft-crypto-game-fail-close-scam-snake-oil"><h3>Oh No, Anyway</h3></a><p>'What went wrong?'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-ai-darth-vader-star-wars-epic-games-sag-aftra"><h3>Fortnite’s AI Darth Vader Has, Predictably, Been A Comedy Of Errors</h3></a><p>Swears, slurs, and an unfair labor practice – all in just a few days</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/raidou-remastered-preview-%E2%80%93-hands-on-atlus%E2%80%99-oc-cult-classic-action-rpg-remake.1195446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/raidou-remastered-preview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Between your Shin Megami Tenseis and your Personas, Atlus has grown in renown over the last decade for its demon-summoning JRPGs. But while Persona is the biggest of the SMT spin-offs, it’s far from the only one, and now RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army&nbsp;is on the way to revive the Demon Summoner branch of this RPG franchise.</p>
<p>Atlus is no stranger to refurnishing its prior works for new systems, whether with a classic expanded release like Persona 4 Golden or with a more typical remake/remaster like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/30/persona-3-reload-review/">Persona 3 Reloaded</a>. Closing in on two decades since its original PS2 release as Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army, Raidou Remastered is very much in the latter camp, as a full overhaul of the game for modern systems. “Remastered” is really underselling it.</p>
<p><iframe title="RAIDOU Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army — Opening Movie" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PrurRsh64yQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We played Raidou Remastered on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but this game is coming to pretty much every platform that matters – PS4 and PS5, Switch and Switch 2, PC and Xbox Series X|S, with only Xbox One being left out in the cold.</p>
<p>Alas, we didn’t get to spend too much time playing at the preview event, being dropped in partway through Chapter 1 to just get a taste of the world, the characters and the action RPG battling.</p>

<p>The first thing that stands out about the presentation is that you don’t have control over the game camera, which moves and pans through set paths as you run around, and cutting to new angles as you move between different streets and side passages. It’s distinctly retro and in keeping with the original game in style, but the pre-rendered backgrounds make way for 3D environments, so that the camera can shift into a pseudo chase cam view at times and more actively follow you through the scene, instead of having that classic Resident Evil vibe.</p>

<p>The camera is much, much more dynamic in combat as well, actually following Raidou around, instead of being a fixed point view of the battle arena. That helps a huge amount to give the combat a more modern tone and feel.</p>
<p>Coming from Persona and Shin Megami Tensei, the expectation might be for turn-based battles with summoned demons, but these are much closer to the arena battles of the Final Fantasy 7 Remakes or (a bit more tangentially) Ni no Kuni. You fight as Raidou, dishing out melee attacks with his sword, taking aim to blast away from range with his pistol, and unleashing abilities that build up to your Spirit Slash. Your two summoned demon allies, meanwhile do a bit of their own thing, but can also be commanded to attack or heal and buff.</p>
<p>It’s quick and easy to figure out the basics, but I’m sure more depths will be revealed with a longer play session, and complexities revealed through bigger boss battles.</p>

<p>It’s not just in battle that your demons come out to play, as they also have a role when simply exploring the world and talking to people. It can be reading someone’s mind to reveal a new opening in conversation, using them to retrieve a dog from a roof, lighting a figurative fire under someone to get them to do what you want, and on and on. More demons will be added to Raidou’s collection of allies over time, giving you new abilities in the world, but also boosting combat options.</p>
<p>What’s sure to shine about Raidou Remastered is the setting. This is a fantastical take on 1930s Tokyo, infused with the Dark Realm and all the demons that spring forth from it. Raidou himself has a flash cape and a more Western police style outfit, and there’s a great juxtaposition between this and the more traditional elements of Japanese architecture, dress and culture from the time. There’s cats everywhere, as well, and while most of them will run away when you get close (probably cos of all the demons in your pocket), the black cat Gouto is your companion and guide.</p>
<p>For fans of Atlus’ work, Raidou Remastered is sure to be one of the most anticipated games of 2025, reviving a decades old game for a new audience and giving it myriad modern touches along the way.</p>

			<p>Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/21/playstation-stars-coming-to-a-close-as-sie-evaluates-new-ways-to-evolve-future-loyalty-program-efforts/">announced</a> that it will officially end its PlayStation Stars loyalty program. As of today, the program will not be accepting new members, and those already part of the program will see no new campaigns or rewards added and will no longer be able to earn points after July 23, 2025. Players who choose to leave at any point after today will not be able to rejoin the program and will lose all their points.</p>
<p>"<em>At Sony Interactive, we’re always experimenting with new and exciting ways to bring our community of players together to share the joys of gaming and create lasting memories,</em>" Grace Chen, vice president of network advertising, loyalty, and licensed merchandise at Sony, began on a PlayStation Blog post.</p>
<p>"<em>That’s why three years ago, we created PlayStation Stars, a loyalty program to celebrate our players. The unique program includes playing games to earn rewards – including our unique Digital Collectibles that pay homage to incredible games and our PlayStation legacy. The program has helped foster a deeper connection with fans around the world.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Since launching the program, we’ve learned a lot from evaluating the types of activities our players respond best to, and as a company, we are always evolving with player and industry trends. Through this evaluation, we have decided to refocus our efforts and will be winding down the current version of PlayStation Stars. We will continue to evaluate our key findings from this program, and are looking into ways to build upon these learnings.</em>"</p>
<p>The loyalty program was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-introduces-playstation-stars-loyalty-program-brings-digital-collectible-rewards-and-loyalty-points/">announced and launched in 2022</a>, and the first reaction from players was that PlayStation Stars potentially began its life as an NFT program, but was pivoted into what we ended up with when PlayStation caught wind of how incredibly unpopular NFTs had become.</p>
<p>What ended up being the best part of the program was the fact that, for a while, it was possible to earn enough points to collect $25 and $5 worth of credit on the PlayStation Store. Players did everything they could to 'game' the system, and Sony took steps to rebalance how points were dolled out to curb those efforts.</p>
<p>Players who still have points they'd like to redeem will be able to do so until November 2, 2026.</p>

The new app supports challenges, multiplayer, multiple saves, weekly tournaments, user profiles, and leaderboards. And yes, Retro Classics has achievements. Finally, you can get a nifty Xbox achievement for playing <em>River Raid. </em></p><p>“This initiative is a step in our commitment to game preservation and backwards compatibility, allowing players to experience many timeless games on modern devices,” said Xbox in a post on the company’s website. </p><p>So what games are currently available on the Retro <strike>Arcade</strike> Classics app?

It plans on adding more Acitivison and Blizzard games to the app in the future. While I’m not a huge fan of streaming old games like this, and would prefer actual downloads and offline play, this is still better than nothing. It’s nice to see Xbox finally digging into Activision’s deep library of classic games and doing something with them after buying the publisher back in 2023. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-game-pass-1850923561&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-game-pass-1850923561">If Microsoft wants to own the entire game industry</a></span>, the least it can do is make it easier to legally play the old stuff it gobbled up in the process.</p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"But when we were working on an early version of a course in this game set on a ranch that players can drive through, this sketch came up."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The sketch, which shows a smiling Cow driving a truck and looking like she does not have a care in the world, was immediately seized upon as inspiration for Cow to become Mario Kart's next playable character — and led to other background NPCs becoming playable, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Each new Mario Kart game features new characters to race with, but since we added so many to the previous game, we wondered where we could go from there," art director Masaaki Ishikawa continued. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And then one of the designers came up with that silly sketch of Cow cruising along, and I thought to myself, 'This is it!' (Laughs) So that's when we realized the course surroundings actually contained a lot of untapped resources."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/21/image-1747839986951.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mario Kart World's Cow concept art. Image credit: Nintendo.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cow's addition to the Mario Kart World roster was quickly followed by Cheep Cheep (the red fish Mario often has to dodge) and Pokey (the smiling, wiggling cactus character) also becoming playable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was like, 'They're NPCs, but they're playable? Which is it?'" Yabuki continued. "It's pretty funny to see a four-legged Cow holding onto motorcycle handlebars with her front hooves."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But when she jumps, she strikes a proper quadrupedal pose," Ishikawa added. "So I'm pretty sure Cow is still in touch with her animal nature. (Laughs)"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in the same interview, Yabuki confirmed that Nintendo had the name Mario Kart World in mind "from the early stages of development" when the game's open-world nature was already being worked on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If the idea had just been to add more courses, then I think we would've called it Mario Kart 9," Yabuki said. "But, that wasn't our approach this time. We wanted to take the series to the next level. So, we decided to drop the numbering this time and go with a completely new title."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Kart World Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the development team discussed Mario Kart World's addition of unlockable character costumes, found by snacking on food at Yoshi's drive-thru restaurants in different in-game regions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each region will unlock its own costumes, and offer its own food varieties. One example given is a Yoshi's drive-thru in a volcano region selling hot soup inspired by Bowser.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally, Nintendo says it hadn't linked its ideas for unlockable costumes and food together, with the former simply being planned to be purchasable from in-game shop locations. But stopping at these interrupted the game's open-world driving experience, developers said, and anyway — didn't Mario magically transform costumes already when he gobbled food up?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The question came up: 'Does Mario, in fact, eat mushrooms?'," Yabuki laughed. The query prompted Mario Kart World's development team to hunt down Nintendo legend Takashi Tezuka, and get his verdict.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Tezuka-san [answered], 'Yeah, he is'," Yabuki confirmed.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-overture-wears-its-bloodborne-inspiration-proudly-on-its-sleeve<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2021, Round 8 and NEOWIZ announced Lies of P, a moody soulslike that answered the question that no one had thought to ask: What if Bloodborne was actually a Victorian reimagining of Carlo Collodi’s Pinocchio? When it launched in 2023, it surprised skeptics and over-delivered in both how great its dark fantasy setting was and how incredibly fun its aggressive combat was. Two years later, I got to spend some quality time with Overture, the ironically-named encore of an expansion to the hit action game. And even though I didn’t get to see much more than around an hour of the first stage and the new Boss Memories mode, it was apparent very quickly that the South Korean team is poised to overachieve yet again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overture is a prequel to the events of Lies of P, right before the puppet frenzy starts and robotic thralls massacre everyone in the city of Krat. But as it turns out, many of its ideas for settings, weapons, etc. were actually meant for the base game, but got cut to keep the original release from being too bloated. Round 8 studio Game Director Jiwon Choi told IGN in an interview that he and his team weren’t content with letting these ideas go undeveloped and unrealized. Through a translator, he described Lies of P as finally “complete” with the addition of Overture.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Lies of P: Overture Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Lies of P has always been associated with Bloodborne, mostly because of how it looks but also because combat in both games adheres to soulslike traditions but forgo key behaviors like blocking. Even releasing a big DLC well after launch to put a bow on the original project has become a FromSoftware signature at this point. But Choi’s team embraces the comparison. “It is our honor [to be compared to FromSoftware].” He added that it motivates them to make something that can clear that high bar of expectation and they can only hope that they did with Lies of P, and will continue to do so in Overture.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Lies of P team embraces the Bloodborne comparison.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first steps you take back in the boots of the titular character, P, is into the snow-packed region around the Krat Zoo, a building your disembodied guide, Gemini, seems very confused to see standing and not a pile of embers. Story details are light, and the developers are staying tight lipped about anything we haven't seen so far. After some preamble from your lantern cricket, it was very difficult not to spend a couple of seconds swinging around one of the brand new weapons in Overture: a gunblade that looks exactly like the kind Squall Leonheart would get commissioned for himself. This was one of a few new weapon types I chopped my way through this frozen menagerie with, on top of new weapons from existing types, and a pair of new, very cool, legion arms that did very different, yet very effective kinds of asskicking.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Pale Knight, as the gunblade’s called, was my main weapon against the ergo-poisoned monsters both on the outskirts of the zoo and within its walls. It has the weight and attack pattern similar to a greatsword, but its heavy attack pulls the trigger and the double barrel firearm attached sends lead screaming at foes. The recoil of these shots push P around, so it can be useful when mixed into attack strings to remain evasive. A trick I learned far too late in my demo is that you can actually fire the weapon again to rocket yourself back towards the bad guys for a big follow-up attack. So basically, it's the coolest weapon ever made.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another new weapon type I dabbled with is the bow, the first completely ranged weapon in the series. It felt perfect for poking smaller enemies from afar but pretty incapable of making a reasonable mark on larger foes. I think with time there’s probably a way to exploit its perfect draw mechanic to menace all sorts of baddies from down range, but I couldn’t manage it in the hour I had. Another new weapon type I wish I spent more time with were a pair of long claws that shredded enemies with the kind of fury that is usually reserved for Best There Is At What He Does. This didn’t scratch the surface of weapons I glossed over that were clearly new additions to existing weapon types, but it was abundantly clear to me that people who really love the weapon customization aspect of the base game will have a lot of new toys to mash together in Overture.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The new legion arms I tried out also made great additions to P’s kit. My favorite was yet another gun: double-barrelled and chargeable to moderate the kind of force, spread, and impact on the bad guys. It’s a more close-ranged option, but even at half charge it made short work of the fodder that roamed around the snowy grounds or dilapidated halls of the zoo itself. At full charge, it was a reliable tool to stun bigger foes or at least interrupt their bevy of attacks for a second. I came to the second arm late in the demo, but it was certainly a strong offensive option in its own right. It launched blades that would swirl around enemies for a short time, similar to the throwable saw blade item, with two differences. One, it can fire multiple blades at once to do some significant damage over time on one target, and two, with a quick press of a button before releasing the flying blade, you can change the attack completely to a set of blades that dance around P instead, great for doing solid AOE damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of targets, the cast of enemies in this section was pretty unremarkable outside in the beginning of the level, but got very interesting as we got deeper into the zone. Some bitey wolves and grabby zombies were run of the mill, but standouts like some very angry kangaroos and an ergo-plagued elephant with a Resident Evil-style surprise really wowed me. I spent so much time against the latter that I only just made it to the end of the level to see the boss: an enormous crocodile twisted by ergo.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On that note, bosses will get a new focus in the patch for the base game that will accompany Overture with two new game modes: Battle Memories and Death March. Death March is a straight up boss rush, allowing you to make a playlist of at least 3 bosses and attempt to take them down all in one go. Battle Memories, meanwhile, allows you to return to old boss fights and attempt to beat them again, now in up to five different tiers of difficulty, with each tier increasing some unique stats that these bosses gain in this mode. Rewards for conquering these tiers have been hinted at, but not elaborated on. I went back to one of the old bosses, the Black Rabbit Brotherhood, to see how different it was on tier 3 than my memory of them in the base game. The way they beat me and my rusty fingers to death didn’t point out any real differences, but as with the rest of Lies of P, I'm sure teasing out the mystery comes with lots of experimentation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lies of P was one of the standout games of 2023, and among the best games in its action RPG subgenre not made by FromSoftware. Overture doesn’t play with the formula too much, but I found that the new ingredients it added, like the great new weapon types and fabulously freaky monsters, proved that there's never really too much of a good thing, even if it is largely the same thing.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Movie. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-goes-all-in-on-donkey-kong-redesign-seen-in-nintendo-switch-2-and-mario-kart-9-first-look">Donkey Kong redesign was here to stay</a>, per the character's appearances in Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and more. Love it or hate it, that's your business, but now Shigeru Miyamoto has finally told us why the great ape got a makeover in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Miyamoto spoke to IGN at the unveiling of Universal’s new Epic Universe theme park in Orlando, Florida, which brings the new Donkey Kong Country expansion to the U.S. for the first time. In our interview, which you can read in full here, we asked Miyamoto about the new design, and what it was like seeing Donkey Kong "grow up" alongside Miyamoto's career at Nintendo. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's his response in full:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So when it comes to character creation and working with characters, I still take an active role in that. And looking back to the first generation Donkey Kong Country, we worked with Rare to create Donkey Kong Country.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What can we do with the design to make it more expressive?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we were talking about trying to create new versions, evolving Donkey Kong, we created the game called Jungle Beat. We worked together with the team that made 3D Mario. With the technology that was available at the time, we were able to make Donkey Kong more expressive. And going back to the design that Rare came up with, we reevaluated; what can we do with the design to make it more expressive? And then when it comes to the movie, we decided to move forward with this new generation Donkey Kong design."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 - Donkey Kong Bananza</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More expressive, huh? It certainly seems like Nintendo has nailed that. Fans have pointed out across social media that the new Donkey Kong is relatively similar to the old one, but has a sillier, more over-the-top look and expressiveness to him that the old design didn't quite capture. And it looks like we may see more Kong redesigns in the future to accompany him, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-redesigning-donkey-kong-nintendo-has-tweaked-another-classic-character-and-heres-our-best-look-yet">Diddy Kong already got a very light redesign</a> (he has teeth now???) as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-shigeru-miyamoto-interview-i-see-nintendo-as-like-a-talent-agency-and-we-have-within-our-roster-a-lot-of-talented-characters">full interview with Miyamoto at Universal right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

As early as 2020, Mario Kart World's developers say they had a rough idea of Nintendo's Switch 2 tech specs — and so began discussing a delay for the project onto Nintendo's next-gen machine.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking as part of a revealing <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-1/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ask the Developer</a> interview, Nintendo's Mario Kart World team said they had approached the concept of incorporating open-world gameplay and 24-player multiplayer "from a calm and collected programming perspective" to see whether it would be possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the team soon decided it would not. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was difficult for us to incorporate everything we wanted, so we were always conscious of what we were giving up in return," said Mario Kart World programming director Kenta Sato. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We discussed things like toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and we even considered dropping the framerate to 30 fps in some cases.

It was truly a ray of hope."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was "around 2020," the interview reveals, when Nintendo developers had "an idea of the next system [Switch 2]'s expected specs" but before working development units were available. So, the Mario Kart World team continued on, using estimates of the Switch 2 power they'd be able to play with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If we had included everything we wanted to in this game's vast world, then it wouldn't have run at 60 fps and would have suffered from constant framerate drops," Sato said. "I think there were a lot of people on the team who were worried about whether we could really manage it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But once we decided to release this game on Switch 2, we expected our worries to evaporate all at once," he continued.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Overwatch 2 x Street Fighter 6 | Animated Collaboration Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In order to make the mercy rule more effective, Blizzard has lowered the cash disparity needed to trigger it down to a 10,000 cash difference. Blizzard said it will keep an eye on the change and will consider making additional mercy rule changes in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Other Stadium mode changes include an additional cash bonus when both teams have lower than intended amounts of cash, and an increase to the amount of competitive points earned from matches.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps the most significant changes to Stadium are updates to the cost and power of certain items. Blizzard said that stacking large amounts of Weapon Power or Ability Power is currently too prevalent and "crowding out" other item choices. To make other items a more viable option, Blizzard has lowered the cost efficiency of many of the offending items by increasing their cost or slightly lowering their overall stats, while also buffing some weaker items.</p><p dir="ltr">On the hero balance-side of Stadium, Freja is now playable in the mode, while Reinhardt and Soldier: 76 have received some changes. Soldier: 76 will find it harder to one shot enemies with Helix Rocket after a nerf to the Cratered power that sees the ability's explosion damage reduced to 15% from 25%. Reinhardt received the most adjustments, with nerfs to the Rocket Strike item in order to compensate for buffs to Reinhardt's Fire Strike ability in core Overwatch, as well as nerfs to the Smashing power in order to tune down the hero's popular Melee damage build that Blizzard said is "performing too consistently."</p><p dir="ltr">While most of the changes in the patch are for Stadium, there are a few adjustments to hero balance in Overwatch 2's standard modes as well. The aforementioned Reinhardt Fire Strike changes have made it so the ability's projectile speed is faster and its recovery time reduced, while Freja, the game's newest hero, has received a slight nerf to her Quick Dash ability. Other changes include nerfs to Sombra to make her invisibility easier to deal with, buffs for Hanzo's primary fire, nerfs to Pharah's popular Drift Thrusters and Concussive Implosion perks, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out the <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> below for the full list of changes. Overwatch 2's latest Season 16 update additionally added a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-overwatch-2-x-street-fighter-collaboration-is-a-match-made-in-heaven/1100-6531643/" data-ref-id="1100-6531643">Street Fighter 6 crossover</a> and a new Overwatch Classic playlist that returns the game to how it was in October 2020. Blizzard recently detailed its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-stadium-roadmap-reveals-future-heroes-maps-and-game-modes-coming-in-the-next-few-months/1100-6531278/" data-ref-id="1100-6531278">Overwatch 2 Stadium mode roadmap</a>, outlining the heroes, maps, and more that will come to the mode in future seasons.  </p><h2>Overwatch 20 May 20 Patch Notes</h2><h4>General Updates</h4><p dir="ltr">Player Report Tool</p><ul><li>Players can now receive an instant notification if a player is already actioned.</li><li>Prior to this feature, reporting a player that had already been banned or suspended would not result in any additional information. The Instant Reporting Feedback feature will immediately inform the player of the fact that banned or suspended players have been actioned when they are reported.</li></ul><h4>Hero Updates</h4><h4>Tank</h4><h5>Hazard</h5><p>Developer comments: Hazard's slower climbing fits his lumbering tank fantasy, but it was a point of friction when trying to chase down or escape from enemies, so we're speeding up how quickly he can vault over a ledge. Additionally, we're boosting Anarchic Zeal’s lifesteal as the current value wasn't effective enough.</p><p>Vault - Passive</p><ul><li>Ledge climb animation time reduced from 0.6 to 0.4 seconds.</li></ul><p>Anarchic Zeal - Major Perk</p><ul><li>Spike Guard’s Lifesteal is increased from 25% to 40%.</li></ul><h5>Reinhardt</h5><p>Developer comments: Reinhardt generally does well across the game but falls off in effectiveness at high ranks. We're increasing the speed and responsiveness of Fire Strike to make it more reliable from range.</p><p>Fire Strike - Ability 2</p><ul><li>Projectile speed increased from 25 to 30 meters per second.</li><li>Recovery time reduced from 0.63 to 0.45 seconds.</li></ul><h4>Damage</h4><h5>Freja</h5><p>Developer comments: Freja has continued to climb in win-rate now that players have become accustomed to her kit. We are partially reverting the Quick Dash cooldown to reduce her airtime and frequency of explosive bolts.</p><p>Quick Dash</p><ul><li>Cooldown increased from 3.5 to 4 seconds.</li></ul><h5>Genji</h5><p>Shuriken - Primary and Secondary Fire</p><ul><li>Ammo reduced from 30 to 24.</li><li>Projectile speed increased from 60 to 75.</li></ul><h5>Hanzo</h5><p>Developer comments: Hanzo's been underperforming recently so we're reverting his bow draw speed back to its original, faster value. The Sonic Disruption perk isn't picked very often but increasing its duration will make it more useful and require less upkeep to control a health pack.</p><p>Storm Bow - Primary Fire</p><ul><li>Draw time reduced from 0.8 to 0.72 seconds.</li></ul><p>Sonic Disruption - Minor Perk</p><ul><li>Health pack hack time increased from 12 to 30 seconds.</li></ul><h5>Pharah</h5><p>Developer comments: Drift Thrusters and Concussive Implosion have been too consistent at securing kills. These adjustments will give better opportunities for counterplay when fighting against these perks.</p><p>Drift Thrusters - Minor Perk</p><ul><li>Movement speed while using Barrage reduced by 20%.</li></ul><p>Concussive Implosion - Major Perk</p><ul><li>Distance pulled reduced by 50%.</li></ul><h5>Reaper</h5><p>Developer comments: We're aligning the recovery of Dire Triggers with Reaper’s primary fire to improve the flow when alternating between the two.</p><p>Dire Triggers - Major Perk</p><ul><li>Recovery reduced from 0.7 to 0.5 seconds.</li></ul><h5>Soldier: 76</h5><p>Developer comments: Stim Pack's button mapping made it difficult to activate, especially in combat. Binding it to Weapon Swap improves the control scheme and removing the anti-heal makes it less punishing to use.</p><p>Stim Pack - Major Perk</p><ul><li>Anti-heal removed. Now deals 75 self-damage on use.</li><li>Is now activated by using Weapon Swap.</li></ul><h5>Sombra</h5><p>Developer comments: Invisibility is a frustrating mechanic to play against for many, so we're increasing the windows for counterplay. Sombra will now take longer to exit stealth and to disappear after taking damage.</p><p>Translocator - Ability 2</p><ul><li>Fade in time increased from 0.15 to 0.3 seconds.</li><li>Stealth reveal duration on taking damage increased from 1 to 1.3 seconds.</li></ul><h5>Widowmaker</h5><p>Developer comments: Widowmaker is a more map-dependent hero than most and now with hero bans restricting her usefulness we're looking to make her viable in more situations.</p><p>Widow's Kiss - Primary Fire</p><ul><li>Maximum spread reduced from 3 to 2 degrees.</li><li>Damage increased from 13 to 14.</li></ul><p>Deadly Deux</p><ul><li>Venom Mine's bonus damage increased from 50% to 100%.</li></ul><h4>Support</h4><h5>Illari</h5><p>Developer comments: Illari often has to move into high-risk positions to heal effectively. Extending the range on her healing beam will give her more flexibility in how she positions and supports her team.</p><p>Solar Rifle - Secondary Fire</p><ul><li>Range increased from 15 to 20 meters.</li></ul><h5>Lifeweaver</h5><p>Developer comments: The opportunity cost to use Thorn Volley is still too high compared to constantly charging Healing Blossom. We are improving the auto-charge to make weaving damage between healing less punishing.</p><p>Healing Blossom - Primary Fire</p><ul><li>Auto-Charge rate increased by 25%.</li></ul><p>Superbloom - Major Perk</p><ul><li>The number of hits to trigger reduced from 20 to 16.</li></ul><h4>Stadium Updates</h4><p dir="ltr">Mercy Rule</p><ul><li>Now triggers when the cash disparity between the teams is at 10,000 or more (down from 15,000).</li></ul><p>Developer comments: We feel that not enough games that reach 3-0 are triggering the Mercy Rule when they probably should. We'll be keeping a close eye on this and will be considering other changes to the Mercy Rule system in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Round Completion Cash</p><p>We've added a system where players are granted an additional boost to their Round Completion Cash in rounds that end with players on both teams having lower than intended amounts of cash. This additional cash will be equivalent for every player.</p><p dir="ltr">Competitive Rewards</p><ul><li>Competitive points for winning a match has been increased to 20 per match.</li></ul><h4>Tank</h4><h5>Reinhardt</h5><p>Developer comments: To compensate for the buff to Reinhardt's Fire Strike in Core Overwatch, we're decreasing the burst potential of Reinhardt's Fire Strike build and normalizing the max projectile speed Fire Strike can reach. We're also tuning down Reinhardt's Melee build to be a bit more counterable, which is performing too consistently given the high payoff of the build.</p><p>Smashing - Power</p><ul><li>Reduced Move Speed per stack to 1% (down from 2%).</li><li>Reduced Life Steal per stack to 3% (down from 5%).</li><li>Increased maximum stacks to 10 (up from 5).</li><li>Reduced duration to 2s (down from 3s).</li></ul><p>To Me, My Friends! - Power</p><ul><li>Increased healing based on Max Life to 4% (up from 3%).</li></ul><p>Wilhelmwagen - Power</p><ul><li>Decreased healing from damage mitigated to 5% (down from 15%).</li></ul><p>Rocket Strike - Epic Hero Ability Item</p><ul><li>Decreased Fire Strike Projectile Speed to 25% (down from 50%).</li><li>Decreased Ability Power to 10% (down from 20%).</li></ul><p>Chimera's Maw - Rare Hero Ability Item</p><ul><li>Decreased Ability Power to 5% (down from 10%).</li></ul><h4>Damage</h4><h5>Freja</h5><ul><li>Added to the Stadium Hero Roster</li></ul><p>Cyclone - Power</p><ul><li>New Stadium Power.</li><li>When you use Updraft, fire a Take Aim bolt at your crosshair.</li></ul><p>Seekerpoint - Power</p><ul><li>New Stadium Power.</li><li>When Take Aim bolt sticks an enemy, automatically fire 3 additional crossbow shots at them that deal 66% reduced damage.</li></ul><p>Seismic Shot - Power</p><ul><li>New Stadium Power.</li><li>Take Aim explosion radius is increased by 33%.

We are lowering the cost efficiency of these items to promote greater item diversity and weaken builds that rely on high amounts of burst through stacking Weapon or Ability Power. We're also strengthening some weaker item options.</p><p>Champion's Kit - Epic Ability Item</p><ul><li>Increased cost to 14000 (up from 13500).</li><li>Decreased Ability Power to 35% (down from 40%).</li></ul><p>The Closer - Epic Weapon Item</p><ul><li>Increased cost to 14500 (up from 13000).</li></ul><p>Eye of the Spider - Epic Weapon Item</p><ul><li>Increased cost to 14000 (up from 13500).</li></ul><p>Nano Cola - Rare Ability Item</p><ul><li>Increased cost to 6000 (up from 5500).</li></ul><p>Talon Modification Module - Rare General Weapon Item</p><ul><li>Increased cost to 6000 (up from 5500).</li></ul><p>Gloomgauntlet - Epic Survival Item</p><ul><li>Increased cost to 10000 (up from 9500).</li></ul><p>Icy Coolant - Rare Weapon Item</p><ul><li>Increased cost to 5500 (up from 5000).</li></ul><p>Multi-Tool - Rare Ability Item</p><ul><li>Decreased cost to 4500 (down from 5000).</li><li>Decreased Cooldown Reduction to 5% (down from 10%).</li><li>Increased Ability Power to 10% (up from 5%).</li></ul><p>Bloodbound - Epic Survival Item</p><ul><li>Decreased cost to 9000 (down from 9500).</li></ul><p>Geneticist's Vial - Epic Survival Item</p><ul><li>Increased Life after reviving to 250 (up from 200).</li></ul><p>Electrolytes - Common Survival Item</p><ul><li>Now gives 100 Overhealth every time you respawn (instead of just at the start of the round).</li><li>Increased cost to 1500 (up from 1000).</li></ul><p>Adrenaline Shot – Common Survival Item</p><ul><li>Increased Health to 25 (up from 10).</li><li>Increased cost to 1500 (up from 1000).</li></ul><h4>Bug Fixes</h4><p dir="ltr">General</p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where challenges were not progressing when queued as a specific role.</li><li>Fixed a graphical error that caused flashing for certain heroes on consoles.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Heroes</p><p>Doomfist</p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Doomfist was able to continue charging his punch through Sigma's Accretion stun.</li></ul><p>Illari</p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Illari's Captive Sun Ultimate would not explode after a deflect.</li></ul><p>Mercy</p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Mercy's resurrect could complete in spawn if spawn timer was reached.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Stadium</p><ul><li>Fixed a visual issue causing the Rank Progress bar to show incorrect Stadium Points after a match.</li><li>Fixed an issue with Competitive title rewards displaying the wrong role in stadium.</li><li>Fixed an issue with Zarya not working with Codebreaker item.</li><li>Fixed and issue where the mercy rule would activate inconsistently.</li><li>Fixed an issue with Mercy's First Responder power.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the armory could load in an incomplete state.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Better Together challenge was not tracking for D.VA players under certain conditions.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Better Together challenge was not counting towards MVP or Star of the Show challenges.</li><li>Fixed an issue that occurs when Soldier uses the On Me power with both Vishkar Condenser and Vital-E-Tee mods together.</li><li>Fixed an issue that occurs when Junker Queen uses both the Reckoner's Roar power and Cybervenom mod.</li><li>Fixed an issue that occurs when Ana uses both Comfy Cloud and Dreamy powers.</li><li>Fixed an issue that occurs when Mei uses both the Coulder power and Cybervenom mod.</li><li>Fixed an issue with Freja's animation while holding down her secondary fire.</li><li>Fixed an issue with Mercy's Equivalent Exchange mod and this has now been re-enabled.</li><li>Fixed an issue with Genji's Deflect-O-Bot power and this has now been re-enabled.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Moira's Empowering You power would not play hit markers when the buffed ally dealt damage.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Zarya's Hybrid Battery item wouldn't reset energy to 0 when sold.</li></ul>

			<p>Today, Funcom confirmed that there will be an official Dune: Awakening live stream on Wednesday, May 28, at 6 PM CEST via <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/funcom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Funcom/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> to discuss the game's mid-to-endgame. The Norwegian developer has promised that there will be plenty to do for PvE and PvP players alike, but the specifics will be unveiled next week.</p>
<p>For now, we know that players will form clans and then affiliate themselves with either the Atreides or the Harkonnen Great Houses. They will compete against one another mainly in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-shows-off-its-ever-shifting-deep-desert-map/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep Desert PvP map</a>, which is said to be absolutely gigantic in size (around 500 square kilometers, according to Funcom Game Director Joel Bylos) and capable of hosting hundreds of players simultaneously. The map will be refreshed each week (the lore explanation for it being the Coriolis sandstorms) to provide continuously interesting points of interest to explore. The ultimate goal is, of course, to harvest Spice, but there's also the mostly hazy Landsraad politics system where players will be able to vote on things that could impact the whole world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening — Thank You for Playing the Beta Weekend" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m_TgFDrLM7o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Many thousands of players recently tried the early game during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-beta-impressions-desert-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Closed Beta Test weekend</a>. This part of Dune: Awakening consisted of 20-25 hours, or 25% of the Hagga Basin map, so it only scratched the surface of what players will find in the massive survival multiplayer game. Even in this brief time and limited content, players amassed some impressive numbers in the beta. There were 107K deaths by Shai-Hulud (the sandworm), while 214K vehicles were crafted to aid players in moving throughout the desert. Nearly 10 million scavenger enemies were killed; 151K liters of water were consumed; 8.7 million liters of blood were extracted from defeated foes; 10K vehicles were lost in sandstorms, and more than 65K players withered away in the sun, dying from exposure to the deadly elements of Arrakis.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening launches on June 10 for PC <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-other-rtx-updates-shown-off-for-upcoming-and-existing-pc-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support</a>. Pre-order customers who purchase the Deluxe or Ultimate Edition can start playing on June 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remastered-ring-of-destruction-swim-water-1851781735<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re playing a Mage-type class in <em>Oblivion Remastered</em>—who doesn’t want to toss fireballs and smack people with a lightning-infused backhand?—then you’ll need to prioritize improving the Destruction skill. It’s a key skill that turns the average magic-wielding wannabe into Merlin. With the right magical artifact, you could give the most powerful spell-slingers a run for their money, and it all starts with the lady in the lake. In this case, the lady is a ring. It’s just…a ring.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195579" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="178" data-playlist="195579,196411,195891" data-current="195579"><div><p>This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21074.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h112992"><a id="1"></a>How to get the Ring of Destruction</h2><p>Upon leaving the Imperial City via the western gate, you’ll note the ruins of Fanacasecul along the shore, just to the south of the small town of Weye.

It was a neat idea implemented in the worst way possible, and now Sony is killing it. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197567" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="104" data-playlist="197567,196181,196230" data-current="197567"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23091.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As of May 21, 2025, PlayStation Stars won’t accept any new members and anyone who leaves the program won’t be able to rejoin. Then on July 23, 2025, all PlayStation Stars Campaigns, additional rewards, and existing benefits will cease. The program will formally end on  November 2, 2026, at which point any remaining points fans may have will be wiped out.</p><p>“Since launching the program, we’ve learned a lot from evaluating the types of activities our players respond best to, and as a company, we are always evolving with player and industry trends,” Sony’s Grace Chen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/21/playstation-stars-coming-to-a-close-as-sie-evaluates-new-ways-to-evolve-future-loyalty-program-efforts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/21/playstation-stars-coming-to-a-close-as-sie-evaluates-new-ways-to-evolve-future-loyalty-program-efforts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on the PlayStation Blog</a></span>. “Through this evaluation, we have decided to refocus our efforts and will be winding down the current version of PlayStation Stars. We will continue to evaluate our key findings from this program, and are looking into ways to build upon these learnings.”</p><p>Don’t worry, though; any collectibles PlayStation Stars members have earned will remain on their virtual shelves, at least until the app, which will presumably no longer be updated, eventually stops working on modern smartphones. People who spent actual money on the collectibles which launched amid the NFT craze <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/playstationstars/comments/1ks01o5/playstation_stars_ending/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstationstars/comments/1ks01o5/playstation_stars_ending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are understandably pissed</a></span>. What a waste. </p><p>It’s not a shock that Sony is pulling the plug. Almost no PlayStation 4 or PS5 players really seemed to use PlayStation Stars, despite being able to get 4 percent back on purchases on the PlayStation Store. The biggest issue was that no aspect of the program was integrated directly into the console experience. You couldn’t access your quests for earning more points or show off your collectibles on PS4 or PS5. </p><p>When the entire program when down for a month last year <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-stars-outage-broken-down-fixed-1851570048&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-stars-outage-broken-down-fixed-1851570048">no one batted an eye</a></span>, which is a shame really. The PlayStation ecosystem used to be one of the more robust on console but has been lagging behind both Xbox and Switch in some ways in recent years (Game Pass has quests and Switch now has game sharing). For the amount of time (and money) players spend on PS5, they deserve a version of PlayStation Stars that’s actually good.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Donkey Kong Bananza – 21 Minutes Of Official Gameplay | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"When we were talking about trying to create new versions, evolving Donkey Kong, we created the game called Jungle Beat," Miyamoto said. "We worked together with the team that made 3D Mario. With the technology that was available at the time, we were able to make Donkey Kong more expressive. And going back to the design that Rare came up with, we reevaluated; what can we do with the design to make it more expressive? And then when it comes to the movie, we decided to move forward with this new generation Donkey Kong design."</p><p dir="ltr">Fans first noticed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-super-mario-movie-features-a-redesigned-donkey-kong-shigeru-miyamoto-says/1100-6509563/" data-ref-id="1100-6509563">Donkey Kong's new look in the Super Mario Bros. movie</a>, and later spotted his updated design in footage of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> and various Nintendo merchandise. Donkey Kong's new look is most notable in the Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-release-date-trailer-gameplay-details-and-everything-we-know/1100-6530797/" data-ref-id="1100-6530797">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, where he has a more expressive face, more detailed fur, and wears overalls.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the changes, his design is still fairly close to the one cooked up by Rare artist Kevin Bayliss, who recently told fans upset about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-donkey-kong-artist-insists-fans-need-to-embrace-change-for-new-design/1100-6530592/" data-ref-id="1100-6530592">new design to "embrace change more"</a> and "give a big warm welcome for the new DK."</p><p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong's new design will first be playable in Mario Kart World, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">Nintendo Switch 2 launch title</a> releasing June 5. The character's solo adventure, Donkey Kong Bananza, will be available July 17 for Switch 2.

			<p>April 2025 was another Xbox-focused month on the sales charts and the active player numbers charts, with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered ranking as the best-selling game on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, and Call of Duty leading monthly active users on PlayStation and Xbox.</p>
<p>The latest monthly data comes from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lpoo3w2xuc2e">Circana</a> executive director and video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella, who posts some of the charting information Circana collects each month.</p>
<p>Five of the top 10 best-selling games for April 2025 were Xbox games, and three of those five were all in the top-five best-selling games for the month, with Oblivion Remastered at the top, followed by Forza Horizon 5 in the number two spot, and Minecraft at the number four spot. The other Xbox games in the top-10 were Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>
<p>Oblivion Remastered has also already become the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-dominate-ps5s-download-charts-for-april-2025-oblivion-remastered-already-the-uss-third-best-selling-game-of-2025/">third-best-selling game of 2025</a>, trailing only Monster Hunter Wilds and Assassin's Creed Shadows. On PlayStation specifically, four of the top five best-selling games for April 2025 in the US were all Xbox games.</p>
<p>In terms of monthly active users, Microsoft-owned Call of Duty led both Xbox and PlayStation platforms. Oblivion Remastered was the fifth most-played game on Steam, with the number one spot held by Schedule I.</p>
<p>So Xbox and Microsoft are very clearly dominating software sales, though on the hardware side, PlayStation has stayed in the lead, even with hardware spending falling overall compared to the sales in the US for April 2024.</p>

Through this evaluation, we have decided to refocus our efforts and will be winding down the current version of PlayStation Stars.”</p><p>As of today, “PlayStation Stars will no longer accept new members for this version of the program,” according to Chen. If you’re in the program now, users can “still earn Digital Collectibles, Points and level up their status” until July 23rd at 10:59AM ET, and after that date, there will be no new PlayStation Stars campaigns.</p><p>“This version” of PlayStation Stars will fully end on November 2nd, 2026.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s why, this time, we wanted the gameplay to involve players driving around a large world, and we began creating a world map like this.”</p><p>At the time, the devs were developing this bigger, more open <em>Mario Kart</em> game for the OG Switch console. As the Nintendo devs explained, their process is to first design a game and what they want it to do, and <em>then</em> make it work on the hardware. However, to get 24-player races and the open world working on Switch was challenging, and involved a lot of compromises. </p><p>“When we were developing for the Nintendo Switch system, it was difficult for us to incorporate everything we wanted, so we were always conscious of what we were giving up in return,” said programming director Kenta Sato. “We discussed things like toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and we even considered dropping the frame rate to 30 FPS in some cases. It was a tough situation.”</p><p>According to Sato, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/3ds/mario-kart-7/1/3/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/3ds/mario-kart-7/1/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo considers it very important that <em>Mario Kart </em>games run at 60 FPS</a></span>, likely because this provides players with a solid sense of speed and makes the game feel more fluid and responsive. So instead of halving the framerate, they just...waited for a new console.</p><p>“We worked on [<em>Mario Kart World</em>] while kicking the can down the road in terms of deciding what to give up on, so at some point, we knew it was going to get messy,” said Yabuki. “But as we’d decided to release <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe — Booster Course Pass</em>, we thought that would give us a bit more time to continue development. That’s when the conversation of moving it to the Nintendo Switch 2 system came up, and this suddenly opened up a bunch of possibilities on what we could do. It was truly a ray of hope.”</p><p>It’s very interesting to see Nintendo so openly discuss framerates and how important they can be in high-speed games like <em>Mario Kart</em>. And yeah, they made the right call. <em>Mario Kart</em> at 30 FPS sounds depressing. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502"><em>Mario Kart World </em>and the Switch 2 are set to launch in United States on June 5.</a></span> GameStop says it will have some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-in-stock-target-best-buy-gamestop-preorder-1851781532&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-in-stock-target-best-buy-gamestop-preorder-1851781532">Switch 2 consoles available in stock</a></span> for fans who weren’t able to get a pre-order.
