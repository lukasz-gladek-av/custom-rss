            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Embark Studio has pushed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">ARC Raiders </a>update 1.4.0 live, this smaller update focussed on content and bug fixes after the last two updates.</p>
<p>There’s some fixed lighting, a gun exploit that allowed it to be fixed more quickly by swapping to and fro, and they’ve ended an exploit that allowed all locked rooms to be opened.</p>


<p>Here’s the full ARC Raiders update 1.4.0 patch notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exploit mitigation mechanisms have been added for all locked rooms across all maps.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed the gun exploit that allowed you to shoot quicker than intended by swapping to a quick use item and back.<wbr></li>
<li>The exterior access to Spaceport’s Control Tower locked room has been blocked off.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed the issue that sometimes caused low resolution textures in the Main Menu.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed players being able to push each other by jumping on each other’s backs.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed lighting artifacts that would sometimes occur upon entering maps.<wbr></li>
<li>Raider Voice now correctly respects the selected voice option after restarting the game.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>Again, that’s much smaller than the last couple of updates, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/13/arc-raiders-update-1-2-0-is-called-north-line-adds-the-stella-montis-map/">1.2.0 adding the Stella Montis map</a> and a community challenge, while <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/20/arc-raiders-update-1-3-0-patch-notes-are-here-with-bug-fixes-and-balance-changes/">1.3.0 brought some balance tweaks</a> and had a more extensive set of bug fixes.</p>

<p>After a couple weeks as the hottest extraction shooter in town, we delivered our review of ARC Raiders a few days ago. Tuffcub said, “Arc Raiders reminds me of Destiny at launch; the core gameplay is excellent, and there’s a heartwarming sense of community, but there are many aspects that need refining and expanding. Managing your stash on consoles is a chore and there are not enough in-game events to spice up each run.”</p>

			<p>Toss a coin to your Witcher and have patience, because The Witcher 4 will not be appearing at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">The Game Awards 2025</a> next month. The highly anticipated RPG from CD Projekt RED will be skipping this year's awards and will presumably only show up on stage during the call-outs for the Most Anticipated Game award.</p>



<p>The news comes directly from the joint chief executive officer at CD Projekt RED, Michał Nowakowski, who posted a message on X (formerly Twitter) expressing his gratitude that The Witcher 4 was nominated for the category, while also making sure to keep players' expectations in check.</p>



<p>"<em>I’m very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards</em>," Nowakowski wrote. "<em>Thanks to everyone who has already voted - your support means a lot of to us. We won’t be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we’re, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry’s great night alongside all of you.</em>"</p>

</div></figure>



<p>It's perhaps disappointing news for players who can't wait to get their hands on the next installment in CD Projekt RED's popular franchise, but it can't be too surprising. If you've been following The Witcher 4's production, then you'll have heard that CDPR confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">back in March 2025 that the game will not be released until 2027</a>.</p>



<p>We all still have a whole year of waiting before we can expect to start seeing new trailers and eventually, a release date. Nowakowski even reaffirmed this during the Q&amp;A portion of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-eclipses-35-million-copies-sold-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-scales-up/">CDPR's recent third-quarter financial report</a>. When asked about The Witcher 4, Nowakowski would not comment on the game's production, saying, "<em>The only thing we're commenting is that we're not launching in 2026</em>."</p>



<p>So, with this year's show off the table for The Witcher 4, anyone waiting to return to the world of The Witcher will have to turn their attention to The Game Awards 2026, since that's a strong candidate for when we'd see a significant trailer reveal.</p>



<p>As far as what will be at The Game Awards, we're starting to see select developers confirm their attendance and that they'll be bringing a new trailer. <a href="https://x.com/EXODUSGame/status/1993365313962889525">Exodus, for example, will be at the show with a new trailer reveal</a>.</p>

            <p>You! Stop trying to break in! Also, while you're at it, stop using quick use item swapping to shoot me faster than you'd otherwise be able to! All of that is yelled by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-latest-update-nerfs-an-overperforming-pistol-rebalances-boom-damage-and-also-has-ducks">patch</a>, which sees devs Embark go after a number of pesky exploits and also make piggybacks much less effective.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-4-0">Update 1.4.0</a>'s notes, a gun exploit which allows shotgunners to rapid fire faster than intended by swapping to a quick use item and back again to skip a reload animation is no more. Dubbed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GFw3n2StWfA">double pumping</a>, the exploit was typically used when wielding Il Toro, which is of course a pump-action lead-slinger. Anyway, it's gone now. You can almost hear that one Call of Duty character who used to yell that switching guns is always faster than reloading shedding a single tear of joy, as the impetus to carry around 20 shotguns returns to Arc Raiders.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Embark are sick of folks getting into places they shouldn't be. Hence some burglar-proofing "exploit mitigation mechanisms" being added to every locked room on every map. All of 'em. Exterior access to the locked room in the Spaceport's Control Tower locked room has also been blocked off, so good luck getting in there now.</p>
<p>Rounding out the patch, embark have nixed some lighting glitches, rectified some low-res main menu textures, and made sure restarting the game won't mess up any voices. Oh, and you now can't push other players around by jumping on their backs. Given how key backpacks are to raider fashion, this probably isn't the game to be try to get a surprise ride on your mate in. Even if you're only trying to shift them out of the way of a door. They might have a bad back, and that's probably making their life in robo-ruled future Italy tough enough without your antics.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-offloads-ps5-disc-edition-bundle-with-nba-2k26-now-cheaper-than-digital-model-alone-2000648079</link>
            <guid>1366468</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony has gone all-in on PlayStation 5 deals this year and it offers consoles in various configurations – standalone units with or without disc drives, plus curated bundles- all hitting record-low prices on Amazon. Rather than picking up a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5992/">PS5 Slim with disc drive for $449 (already down from à549), the smarter move is grabbing this bundle with NBA 2K26 at the identical price point</a>: You’re getting the PS5 Slim <em>Standard Edition</em> for well under its typical $549 tag with a brand-new AAA title thrown in at no additional cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5992/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Bundle Makes More Sense Than Buying Separately</h2>
<p>The value of this PlayStation 5 deal is clear when you look at the details. <strong>NBA 2K26 usually sells for $69.99 on its own</strong> and you’re also getting a $100 discount on the PS5 console with the free game. Sony rarely discounts its products this much and bundling a current sports title at no extra cost shows that the company wants to sell a lot during Black Friday. The <strong>bundle comes with the disc drive model</strong> which is important because you can buy used physical games, trade titles with friends, and watch 4K Blu-ray movies without being stuck with digital-only purchases.</p>
<p>The PS5 Slim in this bundle offers the same performance as the original PlayStation 5 but in a smaller size that fits better in entertainment centers: <strong>Sony reduced the volume and weight by about 30% compared to the launch model</strong> which makes it less noticeable next to your TV. The cooling system works well in the smaller design, keeping fan noise low during intense gaming.</p>



<p>The disc drive gives you more options than digital consoles do: Prices for physical games drop faster than for digital ones, especially during sales at stores like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy that compete on price. <strong>You can also borrow games from friends, rent games from libraries&nbsp;or sell games</strong> you’ve completed to recover some costs. The disc drive also plays <strong>4K Ultra HD Blu-ray discs,</strong> which makes your PS5 a functional media player for your physical movie collection.</p>
<p><strong>NBA 2K26 is the latest version in the basketball simulation</strong> <strong>series</strong> that consistently ranks among the best-selling sports games. The game has updated rosters, improved gameplay mechanics, and better visuals that leverage the PlayStation 5’s hardware. <em>MyCareer</em> mode allows you to create a custom player and guide them through an NBA career. MyTeam features card-collecting gameplay where you build your dream roster. The <strong>game also includes WNBA teams</strong> and street basketball modes with active online multiplayer that gets regular updates and seasonal content.</p>



<p>Performance on the PlayStation 5 elevates gaming experiences beyond last-generation consoles: <strong>Games load in seconds instead of minutes thanks to the custom SSD</strong> that reads data much faster than older consoles. <strong>Ray tracing provides realistic lighting</strong> and reflections in supported games and makes environments feel more lifelike. <strong>Frame rates can reach up to 120fps</strong> in compatible games if you have a display that supports those rates and allows smoother motion than standard 60fps gameplay.</p>
<p>The <strong>DualSense controller that comes with every PS5 adds haptic feedback and adaptive triggers</strong> that change how games feel. The haptic motors produce detailed vibrations, simulating different surfaces and textures, such as the feeling of raindrops or snow underfoot. Adaptive triggers offer different resistance levels, making drawing a bow feel different from pulling a gun trigger.</p>
<p>At $449 for the PlayStation 5 Slim with a disc drive and NBA 2K26, this bundle costs less than buying each part separately while offering full current-generation gaming features. Sony usually keeps PS5 prices solid outside major sales which makes this Black Friday offer a rare chance to get the console with a premium game at a price that won’t return until next year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fire TV Stick HD Gets a 49% Black Friday Cut as Amazon Stops Caring About the Price on This Streaming Device]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-takes-almost-half-off-its-fire-tv-stick-hd-selling-it-for-pennies-2000647772</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday officially kicks off tomorrow, but you don’t have to wait till then to start shopping and bagging discounts. There’s a ton going for less right now; we’re talking plenty of tech gadgets, kitchen appliances, smart home devices, plus entertainment options. Amazon is being the most generous of all retailers, as it’s offering up to 50% off its own devices!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5986/">Those looking to give their entertainment setup an upgrade should consider grabbing the latest Amazon Fire TV Stick HD, which is slashed by 49% right now.</a> It typically retails for $35, but the current discount drops the price to just $18. The offer is open to all shoppers (Prime and non-Prime members), but the discount and the stock won’t be around for long. Lock the drop in before the Black Friday rush hits.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5986/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tons of Free and Paid Content, In a Single Place</h2>
<p>The stick is tiny, but don’t let that fool you. It’s made for HD TVs, and lets you stream all your favorite content, whether it’s TV shows from the 90s or the latest crime thrillers in lifelike, detailed visuals that make every color pop in both dim and bright settings. Entertainment comes built right in. There’s support for all the popular streaming platforms (Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock, and more), so you’ll never be out of content to watch. Binge the season 5 of Stranger Things on Netflix, and end the night with an episode of The Paper on Peacock to cool things down; all from a single place.</p>
<p>These platforms require subscriptions, though. Trying to cut back on those? No sweat. The stick also lets you access over 1 million free movies and TV episodes from ad-supported streaming apps like Prime Video, Tubi, Pluto TV, and more. Those who prefer live TV for a more cable-like feel can consider subscribing to platforms like Sling TV and YouTube TV. This way, you’ll also be able to keep an eye on what’s happening around the world, check the weather, and even watch live sports. Maybe get the day started with some worldly updates, and end it with an episode of your favorite series; the possibilities are endless. Support for music platforms like Amazon Music, Spotify, and Pandora makes it just as easy to listen to your favorite songs throughout the day without pulling your phone out, making it a true all-in-one entertainment device.</p>



<p>The stick comes with a remote for easy navigation, but for times you’re not in the mood to control it manually, you can just use your voice to command, and Alexa will answer. Ask it to launch shows, lower the volume, skip through a scene, and pause; without getting up from your couch. Fire TV Search also lets you find movies by actor, plot, and quotes, so you can also say something like “Alexa, show me the best horror shows of all time” or “Alexa, show me the latest Ryan Gosling movies” instead of getting lost scrolling through a huge library on your own.</p>
<p>To get started, all that you need to do is plug the Fire TV Stick HD directly into your HDTV or use the included HDMI extender. Plug it into a wall outlet, and connect to the internet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5986/">Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the setup. The latest Fire TV Stick HD was already quite affordable at $35, but you can now grab it for just $18 with Amazon’s Black Friday sale.</a> It’s the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while, and at under $20, it’s practically a steal considering all the features you’re getting.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Creatures Of Sonaria monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash, new signature looks, and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ever dreamt of soaring through the skies like one of the massive dragons from Game Of Thrones? If so, then Creatures Of Sonaria is a game that you need to check out immediately. Creatures Of Sonaria is a popular survival RPG experience on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-letter-codes-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> where players take on the roles of various mythical beings. Although many Roblox games tend to be quite basic and generic in their gameplay, Creatures Of Sonaria is a welcome change to that frustrating trend. With a highly immersive world full of secrets to explore, this game has something for every kind of player.&nbsp;</p>







<p>To start, the Creatures Of Sonaria map is absolutely massive, featuring various terrains and atmospheres. Simply exploring every nook and cranny of the map will take players plenty of time. Another element of the game that makes it highly immersive is the fact that there are over 300 playable creatures. Not only that, but each of these beings also has its own individual abilities and unique traits, making the gameplay experience highly customizable. There’s also a solid Gacha system in the game, which players can use to get new and powerful beasts.&nbsp;</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Making developers disclose whether or not generative AI has been used during the making of a game, and how, "makes no sense", according to Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney.</p>
<p>Sweeney made the remarks while responding to a post on X by former Unreal Engine developer Matt Workman (who, incidentally, <a href="https://x.com/cinedatabase/status/1993757796723306612">uses generative AI in his motion capture work</a>) who said: "Steam and all digital marketplaces need to drop the 'Made with AI' label. It doesn't matter any more."</p>
<p>"Agreed," agreed Sweeney. "The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production."</p>

<p>Sweeney then followed his comment a few hours' later with another post that read, "Why stop at AI use? We could have mandatory disclosures for what shampoo brand the developer uses. Customers deserve to know lol."</p>
<p>The 'made with AI' labels Sweeney and Workman are referring to are mandatory disclosures developers must make on Steam if their game contains traces of AI use. Take <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Arc Raiders' Steam page</a>, for example: its "AI Generated Content Disclosure" explains that, "During the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team." <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders' Epic Games Store page</a> does not carry such a disclosure.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / Valve</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sweeney's comments have understandably provoked reaction across the gaming industry, with decorated indie developer Mike Bithell, of Bithell Games, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3m6lzdewov22r">posting on Bluesky</a>: "I just find this really sad. Imagine being so certain that you need slop machines to do your work, that you convince yourself that EVERYBODY must need them," he wrote.</p><p>Sweeney's declaration that "AI will be involved in nearly all future production" suggests Epic might be looking at using it across its colossal business - a business that includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, the ubiquitous Unreal Engine, and the Steam-like Epic Games Store. And if it does, that decision will likely reverberate across the industry.</p>
<p>Generative AI use in game development remains a contentious issue, as studios figure out how to potentially embrace this powerful technology without risking people's jobs - assuming that is even possible. South Korean company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation">Krafton, which makes PUBG and Inzoi, has taken considerable flak for announcing it is now an "AI-first" company</a> and offering voluntary redundancy to staff who don't want to be a part of that.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-been-really-heartened-to-see-the-community-revolt-against-ai-stuff-pubg-creator-brendan-greene-distances-himself-from-investor-kraftons-controversial-ai-first-mandate">PUBG creator Brendan Greene has distanced himself</a> and his Krafton-backed studio PlayerUnknown Productions from that approach, saying "I've been really heartened to see the community revolt against AI stuff". Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-feel-that-games-created-with-only-ai-will-have-soul-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-director-doesnt-think-ai-can-replace-human-creativity-but-the-studio-is-using-it-in-reasonable-ways">Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, the game director of The Witcher 3 and co-director of Cyberpunk 2077, believes games made with AI will have no soul</a>, but also that there can be good uses of AI during development.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-relaunch-late-december-1047-games/</link>
            <guid>1366441</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, Splitgate 2 launched with a pretty middling start. Players who enjoyed the first game were certainly enjoying 1047 Games' attempt at a sequel, but it wasn't the big new shooter on the block, the way the first Splitgate was in its early days. Unfortunately, an overly confident co-founder promising to "<em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">make FPS great again</a>,</em>" a poor show of bravado at Summer Game Fest, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-slashes-145-cosmetic-bundle-price-following-fan-backlash">an insanely expensive $145 cosmetic bundle</a> meant that 1047 Games really took one on the chin when it put Splitgate 2 back into beta and <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-back-to-beta-re-launch-2026-og-splitgate-servers-shutdown-1047-games-layoffs/">admitted it had been released "<em>too early</em>."</a></p>



<p>Now, five months after the fact, 1047 Games is ready to try again. The servers will be taken offline on December 4 to prepare for a proper relaunch later in the month, which technically means that it's actually relaunching sooner than 1047 Games had originally planned, since in its <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/building-the-splitgate-you-deserve">July statement</a>, it projected a return for the game in 2026.</p>



<p>"<em>Thank you to everyone who participated in the Splitgate 2 Beta! On December 4th, the Beta Season &amp; active Battle Passes will be ending, alongside your seasonal “rank” progress</em>," the studio writes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2918300/view/590662508143970096?l=english">on the game's Steam page.</a> "<em>We will also be taking the Beta servers offline on the 4th to prepare for relaunch later in December</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Thank you to everyone who participated in the Splitgate 2 Beta! On December 4th, the Beta Season &amp; active Battle Passes will be ending, alongside your seasonal “rank” progress.</p><p>We will also be taking the Beta servers offline on the 4th to prepare for relaunch later in December.…</p></div>— Splitgate 2 - Beta (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/1993028502925541517?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>When 1047 Games took Splitgate 2 back into beta, it not only 'unlaunched' the game, but took the servers offline for the original Splitgate, and laid off developers for the second time within a month, since its first layoff happened between the span of time that Splitgate 2 first launched on June 6 and when it was put back into beta on July 22.</p>



<p>It has been hosting beta tests in the months since, with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/">a few hundred players logging into Steam, helping 1047 Games further its testing</a>. But a few hundred players are not going to sustain a multiplayer studio in today's age. If Splitgate 2 has any hope of sticking around, you wouldn't be wrong to imagine that its relaunch needs to be the biggest event in Splitgate history. </p>



<p>Will it be able to pull that off? We'll see. One thing to note is that with the servers going offline on December 4, and its relaunch coming "<em>later in December</em>," it just might be the case that 1047 Games co-founder and game director Ian Proulx makes a return to a Geoff Keighley stage (sans headwear) and announces the relaunch <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">at The Game Awards</a>. It wouldn't be the strangest thing to happen at a Kieghley show.</p>

			<p><span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is definitely not lacking in content, but if you have already played through the game once and want to experience it again, but with a twist that can make</span> the game's&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-continues-to-show-incredible-combat-depth-over-one-year-after-its-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep combat</a>&nbsp;even more interesting, this mod, released earlier this month, is the one you are looking for.</p>



<p>Created by D3DNieR, the Playable Rufus Shinra mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/1598?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available on Nexus Mods</a>, introduces a playable version of the boss character, complete with all of his iconic techniques. From the gameplay videos provided by the modder, the character appears to work quite well.</p>



<p>However, one specific ability, <em>"Thread Softly,"</em> may cause certain enemies without specific animations to stop moving for the remainder of the fight. Such minor technical issues are expected with mods that radically alter gameplay, and in no way diminish the incredible work that went into making a boss character playable.</p>

<p>Rufus Shinra isn't the only boss that has been made playable in the PC version of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, released earlier this year. Back in April, D3DNier released a mod which made the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mods-new-playable-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turks Rude and Reno playable</a>, with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/976?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subsequent updates</a> not only improving the two characters' behavior in combat, but also adding playable Elena and Tseng.</p>



<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth combat experience is also set to be further expanded in the future by <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-zack-gameplay-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Zack gameplay overhaul </a>that will massively expand the character's moveset to better represent the power a 1st Class SOLDIER is supposed to have, as seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crisis-core-final-fantasy-vii-reunion-the-price-of-freedom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII - Reunion.</a></p>



<p>As development of the third entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy is well underway, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which is on sale on Black Friday 2025 on both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-friday-2025-playstation-5-deals-save-on-consoles-bundles-accessories-and-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, is not getting expanded with new content, so mods such as these are the perfect way to experience the game with some new twists.</p>



<p>The mods that are sure to be developed for the third and final entry in the series, however, may not be the only way the yet-to-be formally announced game will be expanded. Director Naoki Hamaguchi confirmed to us during this year's Tokyo Game Show that there's<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-tgs-2025-qa-no-dlc-rebirth-but-theres-a-chance-for-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a concrete possibility of having a DLC for the final game, or even a full title.</a></p>

              <p>Gaming laptops usually cost over $1,000 for basic performance and high-end models can easily reach $2,000 to $3,000 for complete gaming capabilities. However, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/">Asus TUF gaming F16 laptop (RTX 4050, 512GB SSD, 16GB DDR5 RAM, Intel Core 5 chip) breaks this trend with a price of $749, down from $1,099</a>. This deal on Amazon for Black Friday <strong>offers real gaming hardware at an all-time low</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best in Class GPU</h2>
<p>The <strong>Nvidia RTX 4050 laptop GPU with a maximum TGP of 115W delivers true 1080p gaming performance</strong> in modern games: It uses DLSS 3 technology to upscale images and keeps high frame rates while keeping visual quality intact. The ray tracing support creates realistic lighting effects in games like Cyberpunk 2077, Forza Motorsport and Control without slowing down frame rates, thanks to AI-assisted rendering.</p>
<p>The GPU can run esports titles such as Valorant, League of Legends and Counter-Strike <strong>at competitive frame rates over 144fps</strong>, matching the display’s refresh rate. Creative tasks like video editing, 3D modeling and AI image generation also benefit from GPU acceleration and greatly speed up rendering times compared to integrated graphics.</p>



<p>The I<strong>ntel Core 5 210H processor provides balanced power through an efficient hybrid design</strong> that includes performance and efficiency cores. This setup manages demanding tasks while conserving battery life and gaming sessions experience steady frame rates as the performance cores focus on game logic and physics, while efficiency cores handle background tasks without detracting from gameplay.</p>
<p>The <strong>16-inch FHD+ display has a 144Hz refresh rate and a 16:10 aspect ratio</strong>, and offers an immersive gaming experience through smooth motion that avoids the stuttering of standard 60Hz displays during fast actions. The taller ratio adds vertical space, which is useful for productivity tasks like coding, document editing, and web browsing, where having more vertical pixels reduces the need to scroll. The <strong>display achieves 100% sRGB color accuracy</strong> and ensures correct color representation for photo editing and other creative work beyond gaming.</p>



<p>The cooling system is equipped with <strong>Arc Flow Fans, four exhaust vents, five dedicated heat pipes, and anti-dust filters</strong> and keeps temperatures steady during long gaming sessions without too much noise. This thermal design prevents performance drops caused by overheating to ensure consistent frame rates during extended play. The <strong>anti-dust filter</strong> keeps internal dust build-up in check, which helps maintain cooling efficiency over time, extending the laptop’s lifespan compared to systems that quickly degrade in dusty conditions.</p>
<p>At $749, this Asus TUF laptop offers a great mix of true gaming performance and sturdy build, and at this price point, it offers outstanding value in the gaming laptop market.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-enters-chaos-mode-now-selling-galaxy-z-fold7-at-record-low-and-cheaper-than-old-fold6-2000648076</link>
            <guid>1366420</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung stands out with their folding smartphones and faces almost no direct competition from major manufacturers. After seven generations of improvements, the Galaxy Z Fold series has matured into a product category that Apple has yet to enter, despite ongoing rumors.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/">Currently priced at $1,657, down from $2,119, the 512GB Galaxy Z Fold7</a> is available at a record low on Amazon for Black Friday which makes this powerful productivity device more accessible than ever. The <strong>Z Flip7 also sees major discounts on Amazon</strong>&nbsp;but the Fold’s tablet-sized unfolded screen offers different use cases for users who want a pocketable alternative to laptops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Expanded Design That Balances Size and Portability</h2>
<p>The <strong>wider cover display makes the Fold7 feel more like a traditional smartphone</strong> when closed and addresses past complaints that earlier models were too narrow for one-handed use. This increased width is closer to standard flagship phone dimensions and makes typing, browsing and using apps more comfortable without needing to unfold the device for simple tasks. The improved design encourages users to rely on the cover display for quick tasks instead of treating it as a backup when unfolding is inconvenient.</p>
<p>When unfolded, <strong>the 8-inch internal display creates a tablet-sized screen</strong> that allows for real multitasking with three apps visible at once. You can run email, a web browser, and messaging apps side-by-side, watch YouTube while browsing Twitter and responding to texts or follow recipe videos while taking notes and setting timers. This multitasking ability changes how tasks are completed by reducing the constant app switching that can disrupt workflow on traditional phones.</p>



<p>The <strong>200MP main camera is Samsung’s most ambitious camera</strong> technology to date on a folding phone, competing with flagship models that don’t have to deal with the challenges of hinges. The large sensor captures incredible detail, allowing for significant cropping while keeping clarity, so you can capture far-off subjects as clear close-ups without the limitations of optical zoom. The <em>Pro-Visual Engine</em> processes images using advanced computational photography techniques to analyze scenes, optimize exposure for different lighting conditions and apply smart enhancements that keep the natural look while increasing quality.</p>
<p>The customized <strong>Snapdragon 8 Elite processor</strong> (from Qualcomm) is designed specifically for Galaxy devices and delivers top performance with improved speeds and optimizations that enhance efficiency. This powerful processor can handle demanding games, 4K video editing, and heavy multitasking without overheating or draining the battery like lesser models. What’s more, with 512GB of storage, you can manage a large library of apps and professional content creation tasks without constant worry about storage space.</p>



<p>Durability is boosted with advanced <strong>armor aluminum framing and Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 protection</strong>&nbsp;which help ease concerns about the fragility of folding phones that once discouraged early adopters. The reinforced hinge can handle hundreds of thousands of folds thanks to precise engineering that ensures smooth operation over years of daily use. The <strong>displays are more resistant to scratches than earlier models</strong> and still maintains the flexibility needed for folding, achieving durability that rivals traditional slab phones. <strong>Water resistance</strong> allows you to use the device in light rain or near water without worry.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life lasts through full days</strong> of mixed use despite the demands of dual displays and powerful processors, achieving longevity that matches or exceeds single-screen flagship devices. Samsung’s smart power management adjusts display refresh rates, processor speeds, and background activities based on how you use the device, maximizing battery life without requiring manual adjustments.</p>
<p>At $1,657, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 with 512GB offers an 8-inch folding display, a 200MP camera and Snapdragon 8 Elite processing at 22% less than its retail price this Black Friday. Samsung’s seven generations of refining folding phones have created technology that Apple has yet to match, despite its resources and engineering expertise.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/keep-all-your-crap-fully-charged-with-the-anker-prime-usb-c-charger-at-its-lowest-price-ever-2000647672</link>
            <guid>1366417</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="627">With Black Friday weekend just around the corner, we’re only a couple of days away from one of the biggest shopping events of the year. While the official start of Black Friday may still be a little ways off, many popular items on Amazon are already seeing some substantial discounts. If you’re getting a head start on holiday shopping, or maybe treating yourself to something special, now is a fantastic time to snag a deal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/">Right now, Amazon is offering the Anker Prime Charger at 33% off.</a> Normally priced at $150, this high-tech USB-C compatible charging block is available for just $100—a savings of $50—for a limited time.</p>
<p data-start="629" data-end="1269">Nowadays, we carry a lot of devices with us that need to stay charged. It’s not just our smartphones that need to be plugged in at the end of the day anymore. If you’re someone who likes to listen to music or podcasts while on the go, your earbuds or wireless headphones also need to be juiced up. If you’re using a smartwatch to track your fitness or health, keeping that battery full is essential for getting the most out of its capabilities. And that barely scratches the surface. Tablets, laptops, even portable gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch 2, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, or the Steam Deck all need to be regularly charged to stay powered throughout the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="629" data-end="1269">Support for Multiple Devices</h2>
<p data-start="1271" data-end="1839">The Anker Prime Charger is designed to make charging all of these devices easier. Equipped with three USB-C ports, this compact charging block can handle any device that uses USB-C for charging. Each of the three ports can deliver up to 140W of power, which means you can quickly charge even larger devices like a 16-inch MacBook Pro. In fact, the Anker Prime Charger can take your MacBook Pro from zero to 50% battery in just 25 minutes. All three of its USB-C ports can charge at that max speed simultaneously, so it doesn’t matter which port you use.</p>
<p data-start="1841" data-end="2380">When all three ports are in use, the charger adjusts to distribute power efficiently. One port can charge at the full 140W, while the other two can each provide 35W of power. This makes it easy to charge multiple devices at once, whether you’re on a trip or just need to power up your devices at home. For example, if you’re traveling with a MacBook Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, and an iPad Pro, the Anker Prime Charger can deliver the same amount of power to each device as their individual chargers would.</p>


<p data-start="2382" data-end="2791">The Anker Prime Charger has a smart touch display, located on top of the device. This LED display offers helpful information about your connected devices, allowing you to check the power status of each port when a device is plugged in. You can also customize charging modes via the app.</p>
<p data-start="2793" data-end="3256">Measuring only 2.56 inches by 2.05 inches by 1.38 inches, it’s small enough to easily fit into your bag or pocket. The prongs even fold into the block, preventing them from catching on anything while you carry it around. For folks on the go, whether you’re working remotely or just want to reduce the number of chargers you carry, the Anker Prime Charger is a travel-friendly solution to your charging needs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Steam continues to be one of the best places to play games in 2025, and there’s an almost endless list of titles to enjoy, making it hard to find the best games.</p>



<p>Whether you’re on the hunt for your next source of multiplayer mayhem, an expansive single-player adventure, or a little bit of everything, Insider Gaming has listed the best games to buy on Steam, or gift to loved ones, in 2025.</p>



<p>Don’t forget to check out our other <a href="http://also, there should always be a link near before getting into the lists to the Holiday 2025&quot; tag hub: https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Holiday 2025</a> gift guides here!</p>







<h2 id="h-best-pc-games-to-buy-on-steam-2025">Best PC Games to Buy on Steam 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-dispatch">Dispatch</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The episode superhero adventure is arguably one of the best titles to release in a generation, putting you right in the mix of an Invincible-like story. Taking control of Robert Robertson, leading a pack of wannabe supervillain-turned-heroes seeking to be reformed, Dispatch’s eight-episode arc initially released weekly, but is perfect for playing in bulk, just like a binge watch of your favorite series.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re yet to join the fight to defend democracy, where have you been? Helldivers 2 continues to shine as one of the best titles available on Steam, and the fact Xbox players joined the fight earlier this year means there’s even more crossplay fun to be had. While the game has regular updates like other live-service titles, the huge benefit is there’s no expiration to the Battle Passes, and plenty of ways to earn free credits.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The extraction shooter has made a quick impression since its release last month, standing as one of the best-reviewed games this week. Playable solo, or in teams up to three, one of ARC Raiders’ biggest strengths is the unpredictability every time you jump into the game, as you never know who you will come across. With ongoing support, ARC Raiders is here for the long haul.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>After the much-maligned Battlefield 2042, EA has come back swinging with Battlefield 6, arguably the most successful title to release this year. While the solo campaign is entertaining, nothing beats the huge multiplayer battles on the ground and in the air, with naval combat expected in the future. If there’s any year to skip Call of Duty for something else, it’s this one.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s been seven years since Red Dead Redemption 2 was released on consoles and while it took a while longer to get to Steam, it still stands as one of the best games money can buy, and the current price has been slashed. Winner of over 175 Game of the Year awards, Red Dead Redemption 2 is the perfect game to tide you over until the release of Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-baldur-s-gate-3">Baldur’s Gate 3</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 set the gaming world alight when it initially launched in 2023, clinching a well-deserved Game of the Year award, and the Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure is rated five stars on Steam to this day. Your choices along the way shape your adventure, meaning you’ll have a different experience on every run.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-palworld">Palworld</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Initially released in January 2024, Palworld caught the eye. and the ire of Nintendo, with its release, and has received several updates since, including some big collabs. With an array of Pals to capture, expansive base-building mechanics, and the ability to permanently trap humans in a small sphere for eternity, what’s not to love?</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Despite turning four this year, Forza Horizon 5 still stands as the best racing game on the market, a title likely to be held onto until the release of Forza Horizon 6 next year. While racing is the name of the game, there’s plenty of other things to do, including exploration, stunt jumps, and listening to one of the best soundtracks available on any game on the market.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Black Ops 7 undoubtedly has its issues, but there are some major perks to the game. The biggest among them is Zombies, which is just as good, if not better, than Black Ops 6, with an expansive easter egg to complete on the initial map, along with more content on the way. There’s also intense multiplayer action and a frankly bizarre campaign to complete, which can be done solo with up to three other players.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Celebrating its tenth birthday next year, Stardew Valley continues to be one of the most-played titles on Steam and retains a five-star rating on the platform after a decade. Put in control of a run-down farm, players are tasked with bringing it back to life, growing crops and rearing animals. There’s also a mine to farm resources, a host of romance options, and plenty more secrets hidden away.</p>

And more generally, Bandai Namco overall has enjoyed a close relationship with Nintendo in recent years, with other teams within the company working on Super Smash Bros.

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Is Practically Dumping the 15.6″ Portable Monitor After Selling Thousands Last Month, Black Friday Makes the Price Even Wilder]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/innoview-portable-monitor-15-6-inch-2000647776</link>
            <guid>1366375</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you need extra screen space on the go, adding a portable monitor to your setup makes sense. These screens are bigger than tablets, connect to laptops, phones, and other devices using a cable, plus offer multiple viewing options for different needs.</p>
<p>Most solid options with basic functionality out there sit around $100, but you can treat yourself to one for less today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4950/">Right now, Amazon is offering the 15.6-inch InnoView portable monitor for just $57, after taking 42% off its retail price.</a> It’s an early Black Friday deal, but there’s a catch. At the time of writing, the deal is only available to Prime members. Non-Prime members can grab it at a modest 5% drop, for $94. Prime members will also enjoy free delivery with their purchase.</p>
<p>That said, now is a good time to grab a Prime subscription if you’ve been wanting to try it out. Black Friday is tomorrow, and just like this early deal, you can expect plenty of member-exclusive discounts. These are usually much steeper than the regular ones. Prime subscription costs $10 per month or $100 a year, and new users can enjoy a 30-day free trial before committing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4950/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Portable, But Powerful</h2>
<p>For a little over $50, you’re getting a 15.6-inch portable screen. The size matches that of most standard laptops out there, so you’re getting the same experience, just without the bulk.</p>
<p>This screen pushes a 1920×1080 resolution for clear, bright visuals, plus features an IPL panel for superior color accuracy. The 178-degree viewing angle makes it easy to enjoy consistent visuals from all angles, meaning you won’t always have to sit right in front of the monitor to see what’s being displayed. It’s great for when you’re sharing the screen with multiple users, as everyone can see clearly without trying to squeeze in. Additionally, low blue light support keeps it easier on the eyes by reducing the blue light radiation damage. You’ll be able to keep using the screen for longer hours without the usual eye strain.</p>



<p>Exceptional compatibility comes from 2 fully functional Type-C ports and 1 HDMI port that let you connect the monitor to a range of devices. Your device should just support Thunderbolt 3.0/4.0 or USB 3.1 Type-C DP ALT-mode. The setup is plug-and-play, meaning you only need a single USB-C cable to get started. If your device does not support a USB-C connection, you can still connect it through HDMI, but you’ll need both an HDMI cable and a separate power cable to proceed. There’s no single way to use it; you can expand your laptop’s display to work on the go, pair the monitor with your smartphone to stream on a bigger screen, and even use it with a console to play better. There are multiple display modes to choose from. We’re talking an Extend mode for a large desktop that spans across both screens, a Second screen mode to use both the screens for different tasks, and a Duplicate mode that mirrors your primary display.</p>
<p>The monitor comes with a scratch-resistant smart protective. Beyond protection, it can be used to prop the screen up. Two grooves let you find the right angle, so you can set it up literally anywhere you want, from a desk to even your couch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4950/">The InnoView portable monitor is now down to just $57, all thanks to Black Friday.</a> It not only offers you a large screen, but also delivers stunning visuals, plus lets you choose between multiple viewing modes and even comes with a durable case. It’s great for freelancers, work professionals, students and even gamers.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Chapter 7 Will be Released Earlier Than Thought, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-will-be-released-earlier-than-thought-its-claimed/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite is gearing up for this weekend’s huge end-of-chapter event, bringing an end to The Simpsons mini-season with a huge battle featuring collabs from throughout Chapter 6, and it seems downtime could end sooner than expected.</p>



<p>The Zero Point event in Fortnite takes place on Saturday at 2 PM PT, with Chapter 7 expected to kick off the following day, November 30. However, it’s claimed that the start date will be earlier.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-7-reportedly-releasing-november-29">Fortnite Chapter 7 Reportedly Releasing November 29</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big deal. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>While the standard practice for major Fortnite updates is downtime beginning at 2 AM ET, which was expected to be the case with Chapter 7’s launch on November 30, players could be back in significantly earlier than that date.</p>



<p>Reliable leaker <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1993774545241858172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a> states Chapter 7 will be released on November 29, “just a few hours after the live event.” While there’s no specific time mentioned, that could mean as much as 12 hours before downtime was expected to begin.</p>



<p>There are, however, some caveats to this, and even if the information is accurate, it would all depend on everything running smoothly in the deployment of Chapter 7.</p>



<p>Downtime for a new Chapter is often longer than the usual turnover for seasonal updates in Fortnite, and there’s a larger amount to deploy—including an entirely new map and POIs, NPCs, weapons, vehicles, and more.</p>



<p>That means there are even more things that could go wrong and extend downtime, and even if Epic Games were to publicly announce a release time, it would still be subject to change.</p>



<p>What is known, however, is that content creators have already gotten their hands on Chapter 7 during an early access event, with full details set to be shared ahead of the launch—which could become a standard approach for Epic Games, with a similar early access event ahead of The Simpsons mini-season.</p>

<p>Very few headlines have sent a shiver down our spines quite like this one, but yes, you read that correctly. Over 20 years after the release of <strong>Kill Bill Vol. 2</strong>, Quentin Tarantino has returned to write and direct one final chapter in the film's chronology... and it's premiering in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>"Quentin Tarantino had a dream of a Kill Bill chapter that never made it to the silver screen, a chapter known as 'Yuki’s Revenge'," the caption to the newly-released teaser trailer above reads. "Over 20 years later, Tarantino and Epic have come together to bring the story to life in Fortnite".</p>
<p>You'll be able to watch the short film, fully animated in the Fortnite engine and starring Uma Thurman (yes, <em>the</em> Uma Thurman), in Fortnite on <strong>30th November</strong> at <strong>7pm GMT / 8pm CET / 2pm, ET / 11am PT</strong>. Alternatively, you can catch it in cinemas during the upcoming screenings of <strong>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</strong> from 5th December.</p>
<p>Those who purchase a ticket to the film's opening weekend will receive a code for Yuki's Gogo Yubari outfit, which can also be unlocked in-game from 27th Nov - 1st Dec.</p>

<p>Fortnite has played host to all kinds of big music events over the years, but the premiere of a new Quentin Tarantino joint (albeit an animated short)? That's <em>wild</em>.</p>
<p>Those who have watched <strong>Kill Bill</strong> will know that it's no family-friendly affair, and while the teaser for the Fortnite short looks like things will be toned down a little (there's only so much peril and gore you can show with an anthropomorphised banana in the background), there's something about the combination of <em>this</em> film and <em>this</em> game that just feels... <em>eeeehh</em>.</p>
<p>Either way, for the Tarantino completionists who want to get in on his latest project early, we'll see you on the Battle Bus. Gosh, what a world we live in.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Paradox Announces $37 Million Write-Down After Bloodlines 2 Fails to Meet Sales Estimates, But the DLCs Are Still Happening]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/paradox-announces-37-million-writedown-bloodlines-2-fails-meet-sales-estimates/</link>
            <guid>1366345</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In a press release shared late yesterday evening, Swedish publisher Paradox Interactive announced that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 failed to meet its sales estimates. Due to the game's underperformance, the publisher has been forced to make a non-cash write-down of around $37 million in 'capitalized development costs'.</p>



<p>Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester said that the company is proud of the work done by The Chinese Room (which replaced the original developer, Hardsuit Labs), but also admitted that the sales will not match the projections. In a refreshing move, the executive took the blame on the publisher's side instead of blaming the developers as so often happens nowadays, adding that Paradox's lack of expertise in the action RPG genre made it challenging to gauge the game's sales properly.</p>



<p>In the future, Wester vowed to return to the publisher's core market, which has always been in the grand strategy genre. Paradox's most accomplished games are, after all, Imperator: Rome, the Crusader Kings series, the Europa Universalis series (which has just received <a href="https://wccftech.com/europa-universalis-v-announced-by-paradox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its fifth main installment</a>), the Victoria series, the Hearts of Iron series, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellaris-out-of-this-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellaris</a>. This isn't surprising, as Deputy CEO Mattias Lilja already <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-tentatively-slated-for-first-half-of-2025-but-paradox-intends-to-license-out-a-potential-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> last year that another Bloodlines title would be licensed out instead of developed internally.</p>



<p>Indeed, Fredrik Wester said:</p>



<p><em>We’ll evaluate how we best develop World of Darkness’ strong brand catalogue in the future.</em></p>



<p>That said, Paradox confirmed that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is still getting its two DLCs as planned, as well as other free post-launch updates. In the DLCs, players will find themselves in the shoes of different characters: Loose Cannon is focused on the former Sheriff of the Seattle Court, Benny Muldoon, whereas The Flower &amp; the Flame lets you play as the Toreador vampire Ysabella. The first DLC will be available in Q2 2026, with the second DLC following in Q3.</p>



<p>Recently, former The Chinese Room Creative Director Dan Pinchbeck <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-bloodlines-2-creative-director-wanted-to-call-the-game-differently/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that he attempted to persuade Paradox to change the game's name because the studio lacked the time and resources to create a proper Bloodlines game. Alas, the publisher did not relent, and the result is abysmal sales and mixed reviews.</p>



<p>I somewhat enjoyed my time with Bloodlines 2, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-greatly-uneven-but-still-worth-a-look/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted in the review</a> that its several flaws only warranted purchase at a much lower price, and even then, only for fans of Vampire: The Masquerade. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2</a>'s dev team is set to grow substantially over the next couple of years, as CD Projekt ramp up development. While most of their ranks right now are on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, a game that's at least made some public cameos even if it's still sans release date, once 2027 rolls around, Cyberpunk 2 looks like it won't be too far behind.</p>
<p>This info comes from the company's latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2025.pdf">financial report</a>, covering the time running from July 1st to September 30th this year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In their presentation, CD Projekt interrupted some shouting about the original Cyberpunk continuing to sell well by showing off a developer headcount graph forecasting how they plan to continue "laying the foundations for Cyberpunk 2" across 2026 and 2027. These efforts follow lessons CD Projekt have said they learned from the first Cyberpunk's infamous launch, with <a href="https://www.gamepressure.com/newsroom/cyberpunk-2077-was-a-valuable-lesson-adam-kicinski-on-work-organi/zb3a43">understaffing around the pandemic</a> contributing to in the run up to crunch and more game-centric foibles like the RPG's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cdpr-says-its-new-boston-studio-means-cyberpunk-2-will-be-more-authentically-american/">European-style manhole covers</a> being a symptom of some struggles for a Europe-based dev team to really nail the nuances of an American dystopian city.</p>
<p>As of October 31st this year, the studio says 135 devs are working on Cyberpunk 2. The graph shows Cyberpunk 2's development is split across teams in Warsaw and Vancouver, as well as a bigger group at the newer Boston studio CD Projekt set up specially to work on the sequel. As of these financials, the 135 cited look to mainly be in Boston, with CD Projekt joint-CEO Michał Nowakowski <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">noting</a> that team's around 80 people strong and mostly senior level staff.</p><p>"Having accomplished our goal of building a strong leadership team at its core, we are now shifting to hiring more mid-entry level roles to carry on with pre-production works," he explained. "We plan to expand the Boston-based Cyberpunk team as the project progresses, and double it in the next two years." So, that'd bring the team to about 160-ish people by 2027. Meanwhile, the Canada and Poland-based teams are set to grow, too, so the entire ensemble will swell to just over 300 staff in the same timespan.</p>
<p>The graph doesn't give exact numbers for these planned future headcounts and Nowakowski alluded to wanting to "shift the split" between the two sets of devs to "around 50%" in the same time, making it a bit harder to compare these numbers to the 447 devs currently working on The Witcher 4. As of writing, it looks like the 2027 headcount will fall short of that Witchery number by about 100 devs. One thing Nowakowski added is that the company still strongly believe all the investment they have made and plan to make in adding the Boston studio will "pay off in the future, bringing the next Cyberpunk experience to a new level."</p>
<p>We'll have to see if that means the teams working on it will eventually come to surpass the number of people CD Projekt chucked at the original, which a <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2021/04/fy-2020-presentation.pdf">presentation</a> about the company's 2020 financial results I've gone back and dug up cites as having been the work of 530 developers. Cyberpunk 2077 was famously plagued with bugs at launch, so hopefully all this investment will see its sequel avoid the same fate. That might not mean lobbing more devs at it, though, especially given a lot of CD Projekt's spending has been with the goal of just being able to work on Cyberpunk and The Witcher simultaneously, rather than switching back and forth.</p>
<p>Either way, with a more deliberate build-up over these next two years, one would hope the result in a smoother road once the game really starts to gather speed. For now, Nowakowski's "happy with the progress the CP2 team has made so far", but warned "it’s for sure too early to talk about entering any next stage or phase of this project".</p><p>Numbers, eh? For now, The Witcher 4's the thing to keep an eye on release-wise as it's far further along in the pipeline, though Nowakowski has <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1993732049044128043">tweeted</a> that it won't be popping up at this year's Game Awards following its reveal at least year's iteration.</p>
