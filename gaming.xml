		<p>Devolver Digital has confirmed that Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven, the new DLC content for the sheep based strategy game, will be launching on January 22nd. As part of the announcement, a new trailer has been released with a majority showing an animation that seems to set up events, while the latter part gives a look at some of the gameplay in small snippets.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cult of the Lamb | Woolhaven Release Date Trailer | Launching on January 22" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9YH21SghaUU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven players are tasked with finding the souls of dead Lambs for Yngya, the God of Winter. With each soul, Yngya gets stronger and the challenges for the Cult can get more difficult. As well as appeasing Yngya, you need to survive the cold winter that has descended on the land. You will need to keep cult members fed and warm so they do not freeze, there are new traits and quests to discover, and you will be able to expand your base. There are also new structures such as the Exorcism Altar, and you can expand the base with new shops and a ranch.</p>
<p>Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven will also have two new dungeons, and those are Ewefall and The Rot. Ewefall is the exterior snowy part of the mountain which is the domain of Marchosias, the leader of the Free Pack. The Free Pack are not welcoming to the Gods and will not let them have the mountain, so they have to be defeated. The Rot is the interior of the mountain where anything living inside is corrupted. In The Rot, some of the quests include helping a dragon hatch her eggs and making a garden bloom.</p>

<p>Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven will be available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, Xbox One, and Switch.</p>

		<p>The Chinese Room and Paradox Interactive have released the Winter Update for Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2, with one of the main features being custom difficulty. With this, players can change things like starting health, the amount of damage Phyre can inflict, and allows passive ability recharging. However, this is not a setting that is accessible for new players but those who have the An Elder Unchained achievement or trophy. Custom difficulty cannot be changed after a playthrough has started either.</p>
<p>In addition to the custom difficulty option, Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 is getting some suitably festive and Christmassy items including a Santa hat and beard, with The Chinese Room also confirming beards will be added in a later update. An FOV Slider and a Motion Blur Toggle have also been added, and you can read the full patch notes below.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Acquires MOBA March of Giants from Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-acquires-march-of-giants-moba-from-amazon/</link>
            <guid>1383823</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft announced it has acquired the MOBA game March of Giants from Amazon, with the Montreal-based team becoming a part of Ubisoft when the deal closes on its expected date of December 16, 2025. Though the MOBA will be officially owned by Ubisoft, as part of the deal, Amazon will still provide marketing support for the game on Twitch.</p>



<p>The news was announced in a press release, where Ubisoft says it "<em>sees March of Giants as an innovative and differentiated project with the potential to offer something new to current MOBA fans, attract new audiences, and grow into a successful live competitive game</em>."</p>



<p>The March of Giants team is led by creative director Xavier Marquis and senior production leader Alexandre Parizeau, two developers who have previously worked at Ubisoft in their careers. Marquis was the original creative director of Rainbow Six Siege, and Parizeau was the former managing director of the Ubisoft Toronto studio.</p>

<iframe title="March of Giants: Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zn2aJ3UmVnk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle</em>," Marquis said in a press release. "<em>We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we’re excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level</em>."</p>



<p>Parizeau added, "<em>My thanks go to Amazon for their commitment during the first chapters of March of Giants. Our closed alpha was an important milestone and showed a glimpse of the game’s real promise. Now, by joining Ubisoft, we’re uniting behind a shared vision to build March of Giants into one of the next great, enduring MOBAs</em>."</p>



<p>For Amazon's part, Steve Boom, vice president of audio, Twitch, and games at Amazon, added, "<em>We're proud of what our team in Montreal has built with March of Giants. We're confident that under Ubisoft's leadership, the talented developers in Montreal will continue to thrive and create amazing game experiences</em>."</p>



<p>This acquisition comes shortly after Amazon <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/">laid off 14,000+ workers this past October</a>, with a significant portion of those cuts impacting the teams at Amazon Game Studios. As a result of the cuts, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/">New World: Aeternum's development was shuttered</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/">an MMO Lord of the Rings game was cancelled for a second time</a>. </p>



<p>Though Amazon recently revealed two upcoming Tomb Raider games at The Game Awards, this sale to Ubisoft is the latest sign of the company narrowing its focus in the video game industry and seemingly prioritizing game development only with established IPs and adaptations of video games, since the company doesn't seem inclined to slow down production on adaptations like<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/"> Fallout</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">Wolfenstein</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mass-effect-tv-show-same-production-team-behind-fallout-tv-show/">Mass Effect</a>.</p>



<p>That said, Amazon's loss seems like a win for Ubisoft. Regarding the acquisition, chief executive officer Yves Guillemot said, "<em>March of Giants has a real opportunity to bring something fresh and dynamic to players, and to help Ubisoft compete in one of gaming’s biggest arenas</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We’re looking forward to welcoming back Alexandre, Xavier, and many of the seasoned March of Giants team who have previously worked at Ubisoft, and the entire team’s ambition, creativity and talent align perfectly with our desire to build bold new experiences for players. We look forward to supporting them as they shape the future of this promising new IP</em>."</p>

            <p>
If this is a single flavour of genre that, if you put a gun to my head and forced me to pick a favourite, I would say is my favourite, it's probably body <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>. There are a seemingly infinite amount of ways to project images of devolving flesh and altered bodies into your eyeballs, many of which I find strangely relatable, occasionally comforting. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/graft">Graft</a>, the next game from the studio behind Battletech and the Shadowrun series, does none of that for me, but its first gameplay trailer successfully twisted my guts into a collection of pretzels, so it's doing something right (though perhaps avoid the trailer if you're quite squeamish).
</p>
<p>
So, that trailer. It opens us up with a man seemingly grafting the torso of a woman onto his body, bloody tendrils tenderly protruding from each person involved, beams of light like live wires helping the fusion along. It's certainly mesmerising, and I question every disquieting second of it considering the gender politics that might be at play - the woman appears to be almost hugging the man in the gameplay portion of the trailer itself, so I'm curious which way the story may lean.

<p>
The gameplay shown in the trailer itself doesn't suggest much different from the usual survival horror affair, though Graft is also an RPG. Details on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3141390/GRAFT/">Steam page</a> open things up a bit more, as it sounds like there are relationships to be forged and choices to be made that can "shape your journey and decide the fates of those you meet." 
</p><p>
The titular grafting is a gameplay mechanic too, as you're able to change your body by picking up parts from fallen enemies or hidden locales (hence the Ship of Theseus angle). These graftings also bring forth "strange cravings and half-glimpsed memories" like the impulse to be cruel and sadistic, or "the hot breath of a lover you never touched." Curious, and yet more that ropes me into this almost Blame! esque world.
</p>
<p>
No release date attached to Graft as of writing, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3141390/GRAFT/">wishlist it on Steam</a>, if ya like!

            <title><![CDATA[Bungie’s Marathon Resurfaces With $40 Price Tag And A March 2026 Release Date]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-price-battle-pass-proximity-chat-2000653472</link>
            <guid>1383808</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Marathon</em> was supposed to be out months ago. Instead, its coming in March 2026. <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-bungie-marathon-destiny-2-acquisition-fiscal-2000642935">Bungie revealed the new launch timing</a> in a surprise video documentary that went live on Monday in which the game’s developers promise a sci-fi survival extraction shooter that’s full of mysteries and hidden dangers.</p> <p>The fresh 22-minute deep-dive goes over all of the elements of the project the studio’s been rehabbing since it was indefinitely delayed earlier this year following <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-alpha-review-impressions-bungie-extraction-fps-1851777775">harsh fan feedback</a> form its initial public alpha test. During that quiet period, Bungie held multiple closed beta tests to re-examine gameplay and introduced completely new features, including proximity chat. After becoming a corner stone of this fall’s hit rival extraction shooter, <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a>, the feature will now be a staple of <em>Marathon</em> as well.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjzmhROTv28">documentary also details</a> the development team’s evolving approach to everything from audio and visuals to zone design and loot mechanics. The goal is clear: make <em>Marathon</em>‘s maps and the experiences that take place there have more of an identity beyond repetitive beats within a grindy, quick-match PVP shooter. “We’ve brought a little bit of grounded-ness, a little bit of grit, a little bit of darkness, a little bit of that mood, that kind of is necessary for an extraction shooter to feel dangerous,” said producer Emanuel Rosu. ”</p>

 <p>The video went on to addressed a bunch of other complaints players had from the original public alpha test as well. That includes prioritizing solo play options, improving the visuals, and even making it so that opponent runners leave corpuses behind and decay instead of just appear as static back packs. There will be four maps at launch including an end-game area onboard UESC Marathon.</p>

 <p>In addition to upgrade trees, faction ranks, and unlocking rewards, Bungie is also promising some level of gun customization to change how weapons play, letting players invent iconic gear from the studio’s past like changing an SMG into Halo’s Needler.</p>

 <h2><em>Marathon</em> won’t be free-to-play</h2> <p><a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc">In a blog post</a>, Bungie outlined what the game’s approach to monetization will be, including battle passes that don’t expire and no pay-to-win mechanics:</p> <blockquote><p>Purchasing Marathon will give you full access to the game, including a roadmap of free gameplay updates as the year progresses. This will include new maps, new Runner shells, events, and more, starting with the exploration of UESC Marathon’s Cryo Archive in Season 1.</p> <p>We also want to ensure you are logging in because you love the game, not from fear of missing out—so Marathon’s Rewards Passes will not expire, and you’ll be able purchase and unlock prior Passes.</p> <p>Finally, and most importantly, we believe in preserving competitive integrity in Marathon, so survival will never come down to how much money you spend.</p></blockquote> <p>This is essentially the <em>Helldivers 2</em> playbook, which served that smash-hit live service game well. As a PVEVP game, however <em>Marathon</em> will have additional challenges of balancing other hostile players with its bespoke world-building. We’ll see how that works in practice in just a few months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's that time again to hang some Poké Balls on your Trevenant or Exeggutor and get festive, but it's not Christmas without spending some Pokédollars on some good old Pokémon merch, right? I'm a massive Pokémon trainer (both in circumference and fandom), and I know a thing or two about the video games, TCG, plushies, and Funko.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I thought this is the best time of year for a Pokémon Gift Guide, with the back end of 2025 focusing on the return of Mega Evolution. First introduced in the Pokémon X and Y video games and TCG, it's the most favored Pokémon gimmick, and it's back for the mainline games’ return to Kalos in Pokémon Legends: Z-A. So let's get into it, because there's a gift here for every budget and Pokéfan:</p><p id="tcg-gifts"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TCG Gifts">Best Pokémon TCG Gifts</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon Trading Card Game</a> has seen the end of the Scarlet and Violet era this year, ending with the Black Bolt and White Flare expansions. We're now a base set and expansion into the Mega Evolution era, with the most recent set being the Mega Charizard X-fronted Phantasmal Flames. Speaking of:</p><p id="mega-charizard-x-ex-ultra-premium-co"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Co">Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h3></p><div catalogid="8c2b65e5-eb62-4ba4-9042-a68913f09135" id="210682"><div id="210682" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>At market value on Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a pain in the Mudbray trying to get hold of the Mega Charizard X ex Ultra Premium Collection, but it looks like stock is freeing up just in time for the Christmas rush. Plus, Amazon is currently selling it near MSRP and at market value when compared to TCGplayer. It contains the following booster packs alongside Mega Charizard X-themed card sleeves, deck box, damage counter dice, playmat, and a metal coin:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>4 x Phantasmal Flames</li><li>4 x Mega Evolution</li><li>4 x Destined Rivals</li><li>4 x Journey Together</li><li>2 x Surging Sparks</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The main pull of this UPC is the Mega Charizard X ex Mega Attack Rare and Oricorio ex SIR promo cards, which, frankly, are the best couple of promo cards we've had in a big box collection for a while.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Best Pokémon Chase Cards You Can Pull in Packs Right Now</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you follow my Crashers and Climbers weekly column, you'll know by now that Pokémon TCG is starting to find a new floor with individual card values thanks to better stock levels nationwide. That means it's going to save trainers even more money buying single chase cards over ripping hundreds of booster packs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The carousel above contains the top 5 Pokémon TCG chase cards from each expansion from the current Mega Evolution and previous Scarlet and Violet eras. Any of these cards would make a great gift this Christmas; it just depends on your budget!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Pokémon TCG</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Prefer to gift sealed products? No problem, I've gone through the regularly stocked products by big box retailers like Amazon and price-checked them against TCGplayer to make sure you're getting the best bang for your Pokébucks. TCGplayer is an online marketplace where vendors sell single cards and sealed products for multiple different trading card games, including Pokémon TCG. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's owned by eBay, and sellers have their own review ratings on there, so you can check over a seller before you buy. It's also a great price-tracking tool for Pokémon trainers and collectors in the US, so you can see what the value of any particular card or sealed product was up to 12 months ago. It's always worth a check to make sure you're getting the best deal before you buy from pretty much anywhere.</p></div><p id="video-games"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Video Games">Pokémon Video Games</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'd be shocked if you haven't at least tried a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-games-in-order">mainline Pokémon gam</a>e, seeing as they've been around since 1999, but there's a first time for everything. I've focused on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-pokemon-games-on-nintendo-switch">Nintendo Switch 1 and 2 Pokémon games</a> here, and there's currently some great discounts going. I've even managed to work out the cheapest way to get the Switch 2 version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Cheapest Pokémon Legends: Z-A Deal</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously, this is while stocks last, but if you pick up the Nintendo Switch 1 version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A for $44.99 on Woot, then upgrade it to the Switch 2 version for $9.99 via the Amazon digital code service, you're saving $15 over buying the usual Switch 2 copy of Legends: Z-A. If you're going to dive into the Mega Dimension DLC too, you're paying a total of $84.97 vs. the full-fat price of $98.99.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Pokémon Video Games</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Legends: Z-A isn't the only Pokémon game getting a nice discount right now, either. One of the top games for Nintendo Switch is Pokémon Legends: Arceus, a pseudo-prequel to Z-A that showcases similar mechanics and carries on the trend of turning the traditional gameplay of Pokémon games on its head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're rocking a Switch 2 this Christmas, I'd highly recommend getting Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. They're the latest traditional Pokémon games that get a much-needed and free upgrade for Nintendo Switch 2. That means it now runs at a full 60 frames per second in handheld and docked mode, with 4K resolution when playing through the TV. There's more Pokémon hanging around in the wild now, too, and some other quality-of-life improvements that fix most of the issues it had at launch.</p><p id="funko-pop"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Funko Pop!">Pokémon Gifts: Funko Pop!</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, I won't collect Funko Pops, as I'd end up not feeding my kids, and you have to do that every now and again, apparently. But they're awesome nonetheless; I just have zero self-control with collectibles. There's some bargains to be had right now, such as 2 for $24 on select Pokémon Funkos on Amazon, to some cheeky discounts on others.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Funko Pop Moments Deluxe: Pokémon Starters</h3><div catalogid="8c2b65e5-eb62-4ba4-9042-a68913f09135" id="233657"><div id="233657" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Funko Pop Moments Deluxe: Pokemon - Starters - Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle </h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Some bigger Funko sets are just worth every penny, such as one of the most nostalgic moments for ’90s kids. This represents a simpler time for me, and an iconic one for many that's been copied in some way, shape, or form in every Pokémon game since. Choosing your first-ever starter Pokémon is a big deal, and looking at this display piece just makes me smile. I picked Bulbasaur, and I will die on that hill.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Pokémon Funko Pops</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">From giant Funko Pops to double packs and single Pops, there's something here for every Funko and Pokémon fan. Just be careful: if you're buying someone their first Funko and you're financially responsible for them, you're on a slippery but extremely fun hobby.</p></div><p id="squishmallows"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Squishmallows">Pokémon Squishmallows</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Squishmallows are the softest and most cuddly Pokémon plushies you can get, and they come in various shapes and sizes. They're super high quality and hardwearing, too, so they're perfect for little trainers as well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">20-Inch Sprigatito Pokémon Squishmallow</h3><div catalogid="8c2b65e5-eb62-4ba4-9042-a68913f09135" id="233668"><div id="233668" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Squishmallows Original 20in Sprigatito Pokémon Plush</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sprigatito is one of the Paldean starters from the Scarlet and Violet games I mentioned above, and it's an awesome Grass-type. This is a 20-inch one that's normally $69.99, but it's down to $37.99 for the holidays and a great deal.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Pokémon Squishmallows</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not into the Squishmallow versions of Pokémon, you can get the cuddly 10-inch full-body Pokémon, too, that are also currently on offer. There's Pikachu and Piplup available right now, but I can guarantee any Pokémon fan is going to love a Squishmallow to cuddle, even if they're too cool or grown up for one (I have five).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>For more </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/best-gift-ideas"><strong>gift ideas</strong></a><strong>, you may also enjoy our holiday shopping lists below:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-magic-the-gathering-gifts">Best MTG Gifts I'd Recommend for Any Fan</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-gifts-2024">Best Star Wars Gifts</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-gifts-2025">Best Nintendo Gifts</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gifts-for-gamers-2025">Best Gifts for Gamers</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-harry-potter-gift-ideas">Best Harry Potter Gifts</a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <guid>1383793</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's tough to really wrap your head around 2025 for Xbox. There were some real hits from Xbox Game Studios, fantastic day-one, third-party launches on Game Pass… and then a whole lot of baffling moves from Xbox as a platform, with multiple rounds of price increases, project cancellations, and layoffs. It was a year that constantly had our collective heads spinning. But hey, if you've been subscribed to Game Pass and playing on your Xbox Series X/S (or PC, or anything deemed an Xbox) this year, there was no shortage of great games to celebrate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here at IGN, we’ve voted across several categories for our end of the year awards, including our shortlist of the five best games that landed on Xbox in 2025. Those votes have determined the one winner that represents our pick for the best Xbox game of the year. With exclusives largely a thing of the past now, especially for Xbox – which published some high-profile games on PS5 this year – our contenders are simply what's been available on Xbox consoles this year, regardless of exclusivity or publishing status. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, let's get to it by first recognizing the honorable mentions that made Xbox's year one banger after another, and then revealing the Best Xbox Game of 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Xbox Game of 2025</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian had an all-time year with three launches in 2025, all of which hit in different ways. It gave a jolt to start the year with a tightly packed fantasy RPG in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> to stave off the appetite for a new Elder Scrolls, then brought its co-op survival sequel into early access with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a>, which got off to a great start. Compulsion Games weaved a unique artistic vision into a love letter to the American South with the action-adventure game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, while id Software brought us back to Hell with a bit of a melee twist on its shooter roots in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>. If Avowed wasn't enough, we kicked it like it was 2006 in Cyrodiil with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a>, which remindeding us that Bethesda’s long-running fantasy series had the sauce well before Skyrim. We busted out the notepads and corkboards for the roguelike puzzler <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">Blue Prince</a> that hit Game Pass on day one, but we also champed at the bit for more stylish action after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ninja-gaiden-2-black">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> whet our appetite for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, which Xbox published for Team Ninja. Oh yeah, and there's an Xbox handheld now with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/rog-xbox-ally">Asus ROG Xbox Ally</a> – well, sort of; rather it's an Xbox-branded PC handheld, that is arguably one of the best ones yet. And since everything is an Xbox now, it doesn't really matter where you play these hits. The sheer variety of games that launched under the Xbox banner this year was indicative of how vast and great the medium can be – and none represent that quite as well as our five best Xbox games of 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/best-xbox-hollow-knight-silksong-1765365891628.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems that every year has an indie darling that folks rally around loudly, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was certainly that game in 2025. The jokes about Silksong never coming out have finally been laid to rest, and Team Cherry's long development journey resulted in a dense, daunting, and satisfying action-adventure – or "metroidvania", if you will. While it hit Game Pass on launch, its impressive sales figures and $20 price tag made it the talk of the town... aside from it being the wildly anticipated follow up to Hollow Knight, of course. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On its own merits, Silksong's dark and foreboding atmosphere matches the gruesome platforming challenges that make its exploration more involved than many of its contemporaries. Hornet's traversal mechanics are smooth and will have you flowing through Silksong's sprawling, web-like map, leading you towards some of the hardest-fought battles we've experienced this year. Being smart, nimble, and aggressive against these tough and unpredictable bosses is the key to victory, but you must stay committed and locked in, try after try, even if the runback can be grueling. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But for as punishing as Silksong may be, it's also frequently adorable, blessed with cute, memorable bug friends like Sherma, who sings his song and is generally a precious little guy!  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Split Fiction</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/best-xbox-split-fiction-1765365921513.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming off of It Takes Two, which swooped in to secure Game of the Year back at The Game Awards 2021, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> continues developer Hazelight's catalogue of great split-screen co-op adventure games. Its premise – two novel writers trapped in their respective fictional worlds made manifest – paves the way for imaginative worlds and a mashup of gameplay mechanics and genres that are consistently exciting to play alongside a friend. Coordinating with your partner in puzzles, platforming, and high-speed action is a ton of fun as you phase in and out of fantasy and sci-fi worlds. Oftentimes it blends the two remarkably well, and packs in references that reflect where its two protagonists, Mio and Zoe, are as creatives (and, as any writer knows, that sometimes means they’re not very creative themselves.) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that's the thing about Split Fiction – art doesn't always have to be good, but it's the process through which art is created that should be respected, and that can't be treated as a commodity to be manufactured. And just when you think you had Split Fiction figured out, its finale delivers some of the most memorable sequences in recent memory, elevating the experience to one of the best games of this year. If you haven't played it yet, find a friend, give them the free co-op pass, and see what it's all about.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Keeper</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/best-xbox-keeper-1765365865292.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We hadn't heard from the team at Double Fine in quite some time after Psychonauts 2 headlined many best of lists back in 2021, but this year we got a pleasant surprise in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/keeper">Keeper</a>. Playing as a walking lighthouse may not seem too appealing on paper, but the Double Fine charm and distinct art style brings to life a world that's about showing rather than telling. Its puzzles have you looking at the environments with intent, and the little interactions you have with characters living in a seemingly abandoned world create tiny stories without having to say a word. Our review described Keeper as "a psychedelic exploration of life packed into a brief runtime" and it's a prime example of what a studio can do when left to its own creative devices – it's easygoing and impactful, and one of the standouts for 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - The Outer Worlds 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/the-best-xbox-game-the-outer-worlds-2-1765365942245.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Back when we saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> in action for the first time earlier this year, we could tell it had the makings of a top-tier Obsidian RPG. We liked the original entry well enough, but it was just as much an attempt to create a foundation for a new universe as it was the team trying to separate itself from Fallout and build atop the reputation it earned from New Vegas years ago. With this year’s sequel, it seems as if Obsidian recognized the shortcomings of The Outer Worlds and has addressed almost all of them, creating a sequel that delivers what the studio is known for: dense, story-driven RPGs with a whole load of interconnected systems that let you play exactly how you want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a concerted effort to improving gunplay and melee combat, which goes a long way in making its violent encounters a lot more fun. But it’s the deeper progression systems, along with intricate level design reminiscent of immersive sims like Deus Ex, that makes the overall RPG experience feel so much more dynamic. The game itself observes how you play, and offers tangible perks at the expense of some unusually creative debuffs as part of its Flaws system, with each one offered based on your actions. Such as system demonstrates in microcosm how The Outer Worlds 2 better accounts for your playstyle and shows you the consequences of how you interact with its world. And with a universe still rooted in dystopian satire, but with a good crew of companions and a tighter story told across much bigger worlds, The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian firing on all cylinders.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/best-xbox-clair-obscur-expedition-33-1765365967609.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps to the surprise of absolutely no one, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is IGN’s choice for the best game to hit Xbox this year. And if you're a Game Pass subscriber, you were treated to one of the best RPGs in recent memory on day one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its debut as a development team, Sandfall Interactive has drawn inspiration from classic Japanese RPGs (looking at Final Fantasy 10 and Persona 5 directly) to tell its own harrowing story about grief and the sometimes ugly ways it changes us. But while JRPGs are a clear influence, the studio’s French roots are significantly responsible for making Clair Obscur what it is, from its artistic vision to its storytelling style, right down to the unqiue music that both captures the hype of big boss fights and the atmosphere of its magical, painterly world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like any great RPG, Clair Obscur strives to give you an intimate understanding of its characters, drawing you in and making you feel for them in their moments of triumph and despair. It’s a credit to the studio's strong writing team, and performances from an incredible cast, that Expedition 33 is able to effortlessly pull you in through all the wild twists and turns of its story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a top-tier turn-based combat system, bolstered by timing-based inputs for attacking and defending. That active element keeps you locked in during each and every battle with an intensity you wouldn’t feel otherwise. The intricate progression and customization systems for each character make you feel like a genius tactician, creating the best builds for their unique moveset and mechanics. And damn does it look good when it all comes together. Clair Obscur is a wonderful example of executing on a clear creative vision while simultaneously recognizing what made its inspirations so great. And it very easily won the hearts and minds of us here at IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What was your favourite Xbox game of 2025?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Congrats on the new Divinity.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Did you see that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yup-that-weird-statue-was-teasing-a-new-divinity-game-the-game-awards-2025">Divinity reveal at The Game Awards</a> and think, hey, I really should get around to playing Divinity: Original Sin 2? Great news, Larian just made it a much nicer experience on modern consoles with a free upgrade for PS5, Xbox Series, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This was announced in a new trailer, which highlights the differences in the new versions. It's nothing too crazy - just better resolution and framerate. But it's free if you own the game already on any of the previous platforms (PS4, Nintendo Switch, or Xbox One) and it will hopefully bring the eight-year-old game up to par with current technology on consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't own the game already anywhere, now's probably a good time to grab it. At the time of this writing, it's on sale in a few places. It's 50% off if you buy the regular NIntendo Switch edition down to $25, and then you get the free upgrade on Switch 2. On Xbox, it's down to $17.49. If you own the game on PC, don't worry, as you don't need an upgrade. You're already set with a great version of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Divinity: Original Sin 2 is fantastic and well-worth checking out if you haven't yet. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/01/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition-review">gave the most recent Definitive Edition in 2018 at 9.6/10</a>, saying it's "a new way to play one of the absolute best RPGs in years. And whether you’re diving back in on PC, or booting it up on the console for the first time, it’s flexibility, personality, and charm make for an amazing adventure."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also may be worth checking out before the new Divinity comes out, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yup-that-weird-statue-was-teasing-a-new-divinity-game-the-game-awards-2025">Larian has said</a> that players of Original Sin 1 and 2 might "be able to enjoy greater understanding and continuity."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <p>
Following Amazon's decision to 'gut' its video game division in October as part of 14,000 job cuts across the company, Ubisoft has announced the acquisition of one of its studios - Amazon Games Montreal - which is currently working on MOBA March of Giants.
</p>
<p>
As per <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/15/3205660/0/en/Ubisoft-accelerates-in-fast-growing-MOBA-market-by-acquiring-March-of-Giants-game-from-Amazon.html">Ubisoft's announcement</a>, the acquisition includes the rights to March of Giants, and will see the Amazon Games Montreal team join the company. That includes former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</a> creative director Xavier Marquis, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-recruits-former-rainbow-six-siege-devs-for-new-studio">joined Amazon in 2021</a> after leaving Ubisoft two years prior.
</p>
<p>
As to why Ubisoft wants March of Giants and its team, the company says the global MOBA games market is expected to "continue growing year over year for the rest of the decade, with total revenues roughly doubling by 2030" - and it believes its newly acquired title is "an innovative and differentiated project with the potential to offer something new to current MOBA fans, attract new audiences, and grow into a successful live competitive game."
</p>
<p>
"March of Giants has a real opportunity to bring something fresh and dynamic to players, and to help Ubisoft compete in one of gaming's biggest arenas," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot added in a statement. "We're looking forward to welcoming back Alexandre [Parizeau], Xavier, and many of the seasoned March of Giants team who have previously worked at Ubisoft, and the entire team's ambition, creativity and talent align perfectly with our desire to build bold new experiences for players. We look forward to supporting them as they shape the future of this promising new IP."
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft notes the terms of its acquisition deal "are not being disclosed", but it does reveal the agreement includes Amazon's commitment to providing marketing support for March of Giants on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>.
</p>
<p>
Amazon Games Montreal's sale follows radical changes to Amazon's video game strategy in October, when - according to Bloomberg - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-gutting-its-video-game-division-as-part-of-14000-company-wide-job-cuts">company 'gutted' its games division as part of sweeping layoffs</a>. At the time, Steven Boom (Amazon's vice president of Audio, Twitch, and Game) reportedly told employees the company had "made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs", resulting in "significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team."
</p>
<p>
In the aftermath of Amazon's announcement, it was confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-isnt-closing-mmo-new-world-right-away-but-it-wont-guarantee-the-life-of-the-game-past-2026">ongoing work on its New World MMO would cease</a>, and word emerged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-amazon-dev-suggests-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-following-recent-studio-gutting">suggesting its Lord of the Rings MMO had also been canned</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[STALKER 2 Gets New Free Content on December 16]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gets-new-free-content-on-december-16/</link>
            <guid>1383757</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>GSC Game World is expanding STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl with new free content tomorrow on all platforms, as revealed <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-drops-a-free-story-and-content-update-on-dec-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the PlayStation Blog</a> by the Ukrainian studio. Players can look forward to the following additions:</p>



<ul>
<li>8 quests that can take hours to complete</li>



<li>7 locations to explore</li>



<li>6 characters with their own backgrounds and stories</li>



<li>A unique weapon</li>



<li>A hub to create</li>
</ul>



<p>This new questline begins, as is often the case in STALKER 2 missions, with strange occurrences near the Malachite in the west of the map. Research groups sent by scientists reported a signal interfering with their usual PDA communications. Stalkers who listened to it suffered from headaches, nosebleeds, and even hallucinations.</p>



<p>Professor Medulin witnessed all of this first-hand. Although he was good at scientific research, he did not know enough about radio signals to figure out what was happening. This is where Banzai, a radio enthusiast who also joined the investigation, steps in. However, something must have gone wrong.</p>



<p>After logging into STALKER 2 once the patch has gone live, players will be able to hear their emergency transmission almost anywhere in the Zone. Should they choose to investigate, the developers recommend paying close attention to the Red Forest region on the map. Ultimately, it will be up to their intuition, rationality, and choices to reveal how deep the rabbit hole goes.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier in the bullet point list, those who have already finished the game will find that some familiar locations are now resettled by fellow Stalkers. The locations include Car Dump, Army Warehouses, City Boiler Room, Rail Depot near Malachite, and Volkhov SAM.</p>



<p>The new weapon is the GP37V2, a modified version of the GP37 rifle, crafted for the most tactically proficient players. It includes a pre-installed suppressor and a low-magnification scope, and its trigger group has been modified to support single and burst fire modes only.</p>



<p>Lastly, depending on the choices made in the new questline, STALKER 2 players can also unlock a new hub in the Burnt Forest region. Players can look forward to amenities such as the technician, trader, medic, and guide NPCs, a bed to rest, and access to their stash.</p>



<p>We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-anniversary-ps5-debut-qa-ps5-pro-leans-toward-pc-high-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed</a> GSC Game World about the PlayStation 5 launch that took place last month. Among other things, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-first-dlc-in-2026-no-news-multiplayer-cross-platform-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got confirmation</a> that the first official DLC will launch next year. On the other hand, there's no news yet on the multiplayer mode promised before the original release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is getting a free content update <strong>tomorrow</strong>, December 16. This update will introduce a brand-new storyline with eight quests that can apparently take ‘hours to complete’. It also includes seven new locations, six unique characters with ‘their own backgrounds and stories’, and a new weapon.</p>



<p>It also introduces a mysteriously-named ‘hub to create’. The update will be completely free for all owners of the game across Xbox, PC, and now, PlayStation.</p>







<h2 id="h-stalker-2-s-free-content-update-is-huge">STALKER 2’s Free Content Update is Huge</h2>



<p>On a recent <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-drops-a-free-story-and-content-update-on-dec-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog post</a>, the team at GSC Game World expanded on the new quests coming to STALKER 2 with tomorrow’s spontaneous update:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Strange things start happening near the Malachite on the western part of the map. The research groups sent by scientists were reporting a signal interfering with their usual PDA communications. After listening to it, stalkers were suffering from headaches, nose bleeds, and hallucinations.</p>



<p>Professor Medulin witnessed everything with his own eyes. While being good at scientific research, he didn’t know enough about the radio signal and what to do to figure out what was happening. That’s where Banzai steps in, a radio enthusiast, who also joined the investigation, but something went wrong.</p>



<p>You may hear their emergency transmission almost anywhere in the Zone. Pay close attention to the Red Forest Region on your map, and from here on, your intuition, rationality and choices will lead you down the rabbit hole to see how deep it is.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Alongside the new update comes the GP37V2 rifle, a modified version of the GP37 rifle that features a suppressor and a low-magnification scope for picking off enemies at range.</p>



<p>The blog post points out the ‘Fairy Tale Pioneer Camp’ and the ‘Old Mine in Red Forest’ being key locations to explore with the ‘Stories Untold’ update. In the Burnt Forest, players will be able to uncover a new hub location, fully stocked with traders, a stash, and a bed.</p>



<p>This permanent update has players excited, and the sentiments on social media are positive. Over time, GSC Game World continues to improve STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, which we reviewed at launch and gave high marks to.</p>

                <p>Epic Games loves collaborating with anime series for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>, and it's no mystery why to anybody who's been constantly battling Gokus, Narutos, Gojos and All Mights in Battle Royale for years. Anime skins are clearly popular, so it makes sense that more are coming. Next up is Bleach, the beloved show that began in the 2004, and which is currently running a revival series to finish telling the manga's story, called Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War.</p><p>This first collaboration with Bleach will, according to <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/2000419616485736876" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posters that have been spotted in the wild</a>, include four skins: Ichigo Kurosaki, Rukia Kuchiki, Orihime Inoue, and Uryu Ishida. And presumably at least one gigantic sword.</p><p>We have no further details about the collab, which has only been <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/2000189160892911930" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teased by Epic</a> rather than fully revealed. But since this collab will be released during the holidays and Fortnite's Winterfest event, there's a decent chance there will be some kind of Bleach component added to Battle Royale, Blitz Royale, or Reload, since Fortnite has included tons of mythic weapons and powers based on anime series in the past--particularly at the end of the year.</p><p>With Winterfest, which begins Thursday, annually offering two or more free skins to all players, it's possible one of the Bleach skins will be free. There haven't been any real rumors about what the free Winterfest skins will be, but with collabs with Harry Potter, Home Alone, and South Park also expected soon, plus leaks about new winter-themed versions of Hatsune Miku and Sabrina Carpenter, there are too many possibilities to make an educated guess.</p><p>Bleach will be Fortnite's fourth new anime collab for 2025, after Kaiju No. 9 in January, Cowboy Bebop in February, and One-Punch Man in August. We also got a wave of Jujutsu Kaisen villains in February.</p>

              <p>At the top of the attention-seeking tree at this year’s Game Awards was Larian—the massive independent studio behind 2023’s most fantastic game, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3—</em>with their <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-statue-elder-scrolls-6-geoff-keighley-2000651010">silly statue in the desert</a> and then the most <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-rpg-trailer-larian-bg4-game-awards-2000652714">astonishingly unpleasant trailer</a> for their next RPG project, <em>Divinity</em>. I couldn’t be more thrilled about the prospect of returning to Rivellon, but given there will be years left to wait for that, I’m instead delighted to notice that the previous game in that series, <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em>, is now officially updated for Switch 2.</p> <p>2017’s release of&nbsp;<em>DOS2</em> was the moment Larian really established itself as one of the all-time leading RPG developers. The&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em> series began with the decent enough action-RPG <em>Divine Divinity</em> in 2002, followed by the decidedly mediocre <em>Beyond Divinity</em> in 2004, which was slammed for its crappy story and lack of originality. Things didn’t improve enormously in 2009 when <em>Divinity II</em> came out riddled with bugs, dragged down further by a poor Xbox 360 version, but they started to look up a year later when an improved and much-fixed re-release appeared and won people over. Things went quiet for a fair while, with the peculiar but successful decision to release a real-time strategy game set in the same universe in 2013, but it was in 2014 that <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> appeared and blew everyone’s socks off.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:4bbrhyv7c6do5ppnm2x45erw/app.bsky.feed.post/3m7zy4hmc2s2f" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreibgjrqtfuedbh6x6aewtxnpfmqmd37vuihsdms747dglpcx6mfm4e"> <p lang="en">The plot thinnens.</p> <p>With a 93 Metacritic score, the award-winning Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now yours to play on Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5!</p> <p>Upgrade for free or begin your adventure today and prepare for what lies ahead.</p> <p>youtu.be/_K_vKMo7DEI?…</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4bbrhyv7c6do5ppnm2x45erw?ref_src=embed">Larian Studios (@larianstudios.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4bbrhyv7c6do5ppnm2x45erw/post/3m7zy4hmc2s2f?ref_src=embed">2025-12-15T15:46:30.537Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>Suddenly this studio known for somewhat generic action-RPGs appeared with an epic, old-school, party-based RPG that was delighting crowds. Its story was still its weaker area, but this was like a butterfly compared to Larian’s previous caterpillars. However, it would be three years later than every single element would come together into one glorious whole with the release of&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em>, one of the all-time best RPGs ever released.</p>

 <p>Funded by Kickstarter and released into Early Access in September 2016, a year’s development followed in communication with its community, and this seemed to be the magic ingredient Larian needed. That, and releasing a beefed-up, improved and lengthened Definitive Edition a year later.</p>

 <p>The game was so good that it allowed hundreds of thousands of people to feel extremely smug when <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> broke through to the wider mainstream in 2023 (following its own Early Access), knowing they were there before it was cool. But now, with the announcement of Larian’s next project&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em>, an awful lot of people are going to want to go back and fill in the gaps.</p>

 <p>If you’re one of those people, you really don’t need to worry about anything before <em>DOS.&nbsp;</em>You can pick that up on PC, Xbox and PlayStation. But honestly, if I were you, I’d just dive straight into the sequel. It’s a standalone story, and it’s a superior game. It’s one of <em>the</em> superior games! And now it’s been given a sprucing up to shine on modern consoles, including the Switch 2.</p>  <p>I’m absolutely psyched for an excuse to play it all over again. I’m going to pick this up for Switch 2, and I’m going to remember to get the trait for speaking to animals from the very start. (Seriously, if you don’t, you’ll miss out on&nbsp;<em>so</em> much.)</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tp-link-wi-fi-7-adapter-drops-to-an-all-time-low-making-the-upgrade-from-wi-fi-6-cheaper-than-ever-2000653345</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If your current laptop or PC lacks built-in wireless capabilities or only supports outdated Wi-Fi standards, adding a dedicated adapter to the setup can get you the speeds you’re looking for. TP-Link makes some of our favorite wireless connectivity solutions out there, and right now, you can grab a solid adapter by the brand without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6398/">The TP-Link BE6200 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 7 wireless USB 3.0 adapter archer is currently available for $80 at Amazon, after a nice 38% or $50 discount.</a> This is the lowest it’s dropped to in the last 90 days, which means it’s one of those leftover Black Friday deals that survived the chaotic event. Such deals, however, tend to wrap up fast, so it’s best to grab yourself a solid adapter while the discount is still live. Getting your orders in today should help them arrive before Christmas, which is great if you’re planning to stream or game with friends during the holidays and don’t want slow internet speeds ruining the experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6398/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Reliable Signals</h2>
<p>This USB 3.0 adapter comes with two bifurcated high-gain antennas and a detachable cradle with a 1.2-meter cable. The beamforming technology helps direct the Wi-Fi signal towards your router for incredible reception and more reliable signals, even from farther away. When it’s paired with a Wi-Fi 7 router, you can enjoy the 6 GHz band that further improves wireless performance with 160MHz, Multi-RUs, and 4K-QAM. The 6 GHz band offers speeds of up to 2,882 Mbps, while you’ll get 2,594 Mbps on the 5 GHz band, and 688 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band. These translate into ultra-fast downloads, smooth gaming, and better 4K/8K streaming.</p>
<p>The powerful combination of OFDMA and MU-MIMO technology lets you connect a bunch of devices to your router at the same time, without compromising on the speeds on any of those. Setting everything up couldn’t be any simpler. You can plug the adapter directly into the USB port of your device, or place it nearby using the cradle. The Archer TBE401UH is compatible with Windows 11/10, plus it comes with a preloaded driver, meaning you won’t have to worry about following any complicated installation processes to get started.</p>



<p>Those who take cybersecurity seriously (as everyone should) will appreciate how TP-Link is a signatory of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) Secure-by-Design pledge. The adapter is built and maintained with advanced security. On top of that, the latest WiFi security protocol improves encryption to protect your Wi-Fi passwords and defend against online attacks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6398/">This tiny but mighty device is now down to $80, and is sure to solve all your PC-related internet issues for good.</a> We’d recommend grabbing it at its retail price, too, but the current deal makes it a no-brainer. Be sure to grab it before the retailer decides to push the price back up for good.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Has Acquired The Developers Of March Of Giants]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-acquired-developers-march-of-giants/</link>
            <guid>1383706</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has acquired a new studio. In a press release on Monday, the France-based company announced that it was bringing in the developers of March of Giants. </p>



<p>Terms of the agreement weren’t made public, aside from the fact that Ubisoft will gain the rights to March of Giants and Amazon will provide marketing for the game on Twitch.</p>







<p>March of the Giants is an upcoming 4v4 tactical&nbsp;MOBA that has players fight in lanes and command groups of “comparatively pint-sized enemies”. According to Ubisoft, the gameplay <strong>“combines elements of real-time strategy and lane-based combat with large-scale coordination and mastery of the giant heroes that make up its roster.”</strong> When it launches, the game will be free to play. </p>



<p>With the deal for the Montral team, Ubisoft sees the <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6TYgLsRkVYP97hVH0Rhzn7/ubisoft-acquires-march-of-giants-from-amazon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">former creative director</a> of Rainbow Six Siege, Xavier Marquis, return to the company after seven years.</p>



<p><strong>“Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle,</strong>” Marquis said via release. “<strong>We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we’re excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level.</strong>“</p>







<p>Also returning to the company is Ubisoft Toronto’s former managing director Alex Parizeau. </p>



<p><strong>“My thanks go to Amazon for their commitment during the first chapters of March of Giants,”</strong> Parizeau said. <strong>“Our closed alpha was an important milestone and showed a glimpse of the game’s real promise. Now, by joining Ubisoft, we’re uniting behind a shared vision to build March of Giants into one of the next great, enduring MOBAs.”</strong></p>



<p>Aside from March of Giants, there’s no word on what the plans are for the former Amazon Games Montreal team with Ubisoft. As the weeks and months go by, those plans are likely to be made known.</p>

    <p><span>Deal expected to close by December 16.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Ubisoft [1,314 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> has acquired the <a title="Companies > Amazon Games Montreal [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/amazon-games/amazon-games-montreal">Amazon Games Montreal</a> development team from <a title="Companies > Amazon Games [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/amazon-games">Amazon Games</a>, as well as is in-development <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [663 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> online battle arena game <em><a title="Games > March of Giants [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/march-of-giants">March of Giants</a></em>, the companies <a href="https://www.amazongamestudios.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-march-of-giants" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>. As part of the agreement, which is expected to close by December 16, Amazon will also provide Ubisoft with marketing support for <em>March of Giants</em> on Twitch. <span id="more-1015371"></span></p><p>“<em>March of Giants</em> has a real opportunity to bring something fresh and dynamic to players, and to help Ubisoft compete in one of gaming’s biggest arenas,” said Ubisoft co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot in a press release. “We’re looking forward to welcoming back Alexandre, Xavier, and many of the seasoned March of Giants team who have previously worked at Ubisoft, and the entire team’s ambition, creativity and talent align perfectly with our desire to build bold new experiences for players. We look forward to supporting them as they shape the future of this promising new IP.”</p><p>The acquisition also marks the return of former <em>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege</em> creative director Xavier Marquis to Ubisoft. Marquis is currently the creative director of <em>March of Giants</em>.</p><p>“Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle,” said Marquis. “We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we’re excited to continue developing <em>March of Giants</em> from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level.”</p><p><em>March of Giants</em> senior production leader Alexandre Parizeau added, “My thanks go to Amazon for their commitment during the first chapters of <em>March of Giants</em>. Our closed alpha was an important milestone and showed a glimpse of the game’s real promise. Now, by joining Ubisoft, we’re uniting behind a shared vision to build <em>March of Giants</em> into one of the next great, enduring [multiplayer online battle arena games].”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game and team, via Amazon Games:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p><em>March of Giants</em> is an ambitious new entrant in the global multiplayer online battle arena landscape blending lane-based combat, battlefield mastery and hero coordination. Since its first reveal, the game has attracted strong enthusiasm from early players and creators, who have praised its fresh art direction, tactical depth, and focus on meaningful team play.</p><p>The worldwide multiplayer online battle arena category remains one of the largest and most engaged segments in gaming, representing hundreds of millions of active players and a significant opportunity for titles that can build loyal, competitive communities. Industry analysts expect the global multiplayer online battle arena games market to continue growing year over year for the rest of the decade, with total revenues roughly doubling by 2030. Ubisoft sees <em>March of Giants</em> as an innovative and differentiated project with the potential to offer something new to current multiplayer online battle arena fans, attract new audiences, and grow into a successful live competitive game. 98 percent of closed alpha participants surveyed said <em>March of Giants</em> brings something new to the genre.</p><p><em>March of Giants</em> is led by an experienced team, including Xavier Marquis, creative director, and Alexandre Parizeau, senior production leader. Both are veteran developers with past ties to Ubisoft. Xavier is best known as the original Creative Director of <em>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege</em>, while Alexandre previously served as managing director of <a title="Companies > Ubisoft Toronto [57 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ubisoft/ubisoft-toronto">Ubisoft Toronto</a>, where he oversaw major AAA productions. Their return and the addition of the <em>March of Giants</em> team bring proven expertise in building globally successful competitive and live games to Ubisoft.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/ubisoft-acquires-amazon-games-montreal-march-of-giants]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Last month, Matthew McConaughey became one of the most prominent actors to endorse artificial intelligence by signing a deal with AI company ElvenLabs that will allow it to utilize his voice. McConaughey is also lending his voice to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/exodus/" data-ref-id="5000-612193">Exodus</a>, an upcoming sci-fi title from BioWare veterans at Archetype Entertainment. But given the timing of McConaughey's new deal, Archetype co-founder Chad Robertson wants players to know that the actor really is lending his voice to the game.</p><p>"Everything that's in Exodus ... is bespoke VO recording just for us," Robertson told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matthew-mcconaughey-ai-voice-generation-but-sci-fi-rpg-exodus-authentically-him" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "He has a completely separate deal of his own design that he's worked out with Elevenlabs, which happens to be one of the most prominent, AI voice-generation tools, that is being used by other video game companies. Such that people could leverage his voice in non-bespoke VO sessions in a different way. He has a bunch of really strict rules around how it could be used."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> EXODUS Cinematic Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Robertson went on to note that Archetype is not using generative AI in the production of its game, but added that using it in the future is a possibility under the right circumstances.</p><p>"So if we ask what our long-term studio stance [on AI] is, we want to be smart technologists, and we want to make great games," said Robertson. "And if for cost reasons or quality reasons, that becomes something that becomes more acceptable and becomes more commonplace, I think we're gonna have to be smart and intelligent about how we adopt it ourselves. But currently we don't have plans."</p><p>Exodus was originally announced at he title at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exodus-announced-a-new-time-bending-sci-fi-rpg-from-bioware-veterans/1100-6519782/" data-ref-id="1100-6519782">2023's The Game Awards</a>, and it casts players as The Traveler, a character who is tasked with dangerous missions in space to steal technology and weapons from an alien race called the Celestials. McConaughey is lending his voice to a character called C.C. Orlev, but more information about his role is being held back for now.</p><p>A previous trailer for Exodus revealed some of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exodus-gets-a-new-trailer-featuring-cosmic-horrors-and-matthew-mcconaughey/1100-6527187/" data-ref-id="1100-6527187">the horrifying Celestials</a> that the Traveler will encounter. The game also plays with time dilation, as events in space or on an alien world can take place in days and hours while decades pass on Earth--a similar narrative thread used in the McConaughey-starring film Interstellar.</p><p>Exodus is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but it doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Coming off the reveal of a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/baldurs-gate-3-developer-larian-studios-announces-new-divinity-game">new Divinity title</a> at the Game Awards last week, Larian Studios has announced that its 2017 RPG Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch 2.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_K_vKMo7DEI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_K_vKMo7DEI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Before Larian Studios catapulted to superstardom with Baldur’s Gate 3, it released the arguably equally beloved Divinity: Original Sin 2 in September 2017. The RPG centers on a band of heroes, hailing from five playable races, to save the world of Rivellon from evil. The game can be played alone or alongside up to three other players in co-op.</p><p>Now, Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition, a 2018 enhanced version featuring an expanded storyline and improved gameplay, has arrived to current gen platforms for $49.99. &nbsp;The game is a free upgrade for existing owners of the last-gen releases across PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.</p><p>Additionally, the last-gen versions of the game are currently on sale at a significant discount for a limited time. On PlayStation, you can pick it up for $14.99 instead of its usual $59.99. On Switch, the game is on sale for $24.99. Xbox owners can pick it up for $17.49.</p><p>We scored Divinity: Original Sin 2 a 9.75 out of 10. In his <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2/a-godly-ascension">review</a>, former <em>Game Informer</em> editor Daniel Tack wrote, “Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of the greatest PC RPGs of all time, and Larian’s continued dedication to creating incredible freeform adventures inspired by tabletop lineage is inspiring and commendable.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/15/divinity-original-sin-2-surprise-launches-on-ps5-xbox-series-xs-and-switch-2-today]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The second season of Amazon's Fallout adaptation is due to air in just a couple of days time, but don't expect to see Bethesda studio head <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> popping up as a cameo.</p>
<p>Many creators and execs have enjoyed appearing in adaptations of their work, with the likes of Stan Lee often cameoing in Marvel films and shows during his time. Fans would look out for Lee cropping up, with his cameos becoming a rather charming addition to the Marvel cinematic universe and beyond.</p>

<p>But Howard isn't interested in doing something similar for Bethesda in Fallout, though he's been asked several times. "They've offered me a whole bunch, even in season one," Howard told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-explains-why-he-has-turned-down-all-the-offers-to-cameo-in-the-fallout-tv-show-so-far">IGN</a>, explaining he was "going to be in the sort of Dr. Strangelove Vault-Tec room, where they're talking [about] all the experiments, and some other things."</p>
<p>However, the studio head thinks he is best placed "behind the camera" rather than in front of it. "I said no to all of them so far," Howard furthered, when asked if would perhaps consider being a victim of The Ghoul's. "I don't want to distract," he said. "Everyone goes, 'Oh, there's Todd!'"</p>
<p>But, can he ever see himself being the Stan Lee of Bethesda, even one day? "Not at this time," Howard replied.</p>

<p>The second season of Fallout is heading to Amazon Prime this week, on 16th December (that's a day earlier than first announced). Along with returning faces like Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-goes-full-new-vegas-with-a-new-trailer-showing-a-deathclaw-the-kings-and-macaulay-culkin">Macaulay Culkin and Kumail Nanjiani have joined the show for season two</a>.</p>
<p>As for other Bethesda adaptations, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">Todd Howard recently told Eurogamer he "can't rule in or rule out an Elder Scrolls thing in the future"</a>.</p>

'Tis the season to be jolly, even if you happen to be ankle-deep in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Yup, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> 2 is getting into the seasonal spirit of giving with a completely free update promising "hours" of new quests and more - all arriving on Tuesday, 16th December.
</p>
<p>
It's been a busy 2025 for Stalker 2, with developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> having released numerous significant updates for the well-received open-world shooter - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-roadmap-for-2025-includes-a-life-updates-and-an-upgrade-to-a-new-version-of-unreal-engine-5">major fixes for its troublesome A-Life system</a> - alongside a version for PlayStation 5. And it's now wrapping up the year, with a massive new storyline featuring "hours" of gameplay.

<figcaption>Here's a look at Stalker 2's Stories Untold update.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KCLiw3e-b8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
"Strange things start happening near the Malachite on the western part of the map," GSC explains <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-drops-a-free-story-and-content-update-on-dec-16/">on the PlayStation Blog</a>. "The research groups sent by scientists were reporting a signal interfering with their usual PDA communications. After listening to it, stalkers were suffering from headaches, nose bleeds, and hallucinations... You may hear their emergency transmission almost anywhere in the Zone. Pay close attention to the Red Forest Region on your map, and from here on, your intuition, rationality and choices will lead you down the rabbit hole to see how deep it is."
</p><p>
And so begins a fresh mystery within the Zone spanning eight new quests and seven locations, including the Car Dump, Army Warehouses, City Boiler Room, Rail Depot, and Volkhov SAM. It also promises six new characters, each with their own backgrounds and stories, a unique weapon - specifically the GP37V2, a modified version of the GP37 rifle that only support single and burst fire modes - plus a new hub to create. The latter, assuming you make the right choices on your adventure, will appear in the Burnt Forest, giving you access to a technician, trader, medic, guide, and more.
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl's big free Stories Untold update arrives for all platforms on Tuesday, 16th December. And if you'd like to know more about its recent leap to PlayStation 5, GSC <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-something-that-should-be-happening-in-any-version-of-the-civilised-world-the-struggles-of-gsc-game-world-bringing-stalker-2-to-the-ps5">spoke to Eurogamer back in November</a>, discussing, among other things, the difficulties of continuing development amid the ongoing Russian invasion of the Ukraine.

            <title><![CDATA[Dogpile Knows The Best Dog Is A Big Dog]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/dogpile-steam-impressions-review/</link>
            <guid>1383685</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I’m in a fight with my landlord over getting a dog, if “fight” means I texted him about it a couple times and he never answered and now I just drive myself nuts wondering if he’s purposefully not answering so that he doesn’t have to say “no” or if he just regular isn’t answering and I should harangue him. I am a person who should have a dog, and in the absence of one, I get my fix wherever I can: friends’ dogs, convincing dogs on the street to notice me and then pretending to be surprised, and video games that have dogs in them, like <em>Dogpile</em>.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3839300/Dogpile/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Dogpile</u></em></a><em> </em>is a collaboration between two Australian studios, Studio Folly and Toot Games. You have a deck of dog cards, which you play to drop dogs into a yard. If two dogs of the same type touch, they merge to form a bigger dog. Those bigger dogs merge to form even <em>bigger</em> dogs, and you keep merging dogs until you either win by getting the <em>biggest</em> dog, or your dogs spill out of your yard and you have to start over. There’s also the smaller goal of earning an increasing amount of “bones” in a certain number of hands, with penalties coming into play if you don’t make the requirement.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0vX6nnTDwJo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Dogpile - Official Release Year Announcement Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>I appreciate a game that understands that the best dog is a big dog (a problem for my own desire to have a dog, since I have a very small apartment). The game’s dogs are very charming, from tiny angry chihuahuas to greyhounds that look like they’ve been up too late doomscrolling to golden retrievers that just look happy to be included.&nbsp;</p><p>Size isn’t the only quality of a dog you have to pay attention to. Dogs can have traits: friendly dogs will be drawn toward dogs of their type, while timid dogs will move away from other dogs. This can be really useful for space management, helping jostle dogs around to get them to touch. Some dogs can be unusually big or small, and dogs can also get fleas that make their traits not work. My least favorite trait is “crated,” which prevents a dog from merging for several turns. You can change dogs’ traits in an interface stylized like a dog wash, removing bad ones or adding good ones.</p><p>In the game’s pet shop, you can buy new dog cards or “tags” that modify your game, such as by making all the dogs super bouncy (I thought this would be great, but it backfired on me). The tags add a metagame over the whole thing that I’m sure will appeal to strategy nerds, but honestly I most like just dropping the dogs into the yard, watching them tumble and then pop into another kind of dog, and seeing all of them pile up in an awkward, jostling crush.&nbsp;</p><p>The whole thing is bright, cute, and chill, and it ate up most of my Friday night as I said things like “get over there, butt dog” and “aah, no more puffballs” at my computer. <em>Dogpile </em>is out now on Steam.</p>
