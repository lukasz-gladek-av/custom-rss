            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/god-of-war-ragnarok-psn-requirement-modded-out/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony’s latest PC game release, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a>, has been in the spotlight for its requirement that players have an attached PSN account, and the PlayStation overlay that is imposes on the game. Now a mod has been released to remove the PSN overlay and bypass linking Steam and PSN accounts.</p>
<p>The mod – simply called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/22?tab=description">NoPSSDK</a> – removes the PSN overlay and makes it so it cannot request account linking. While it works to remove it currently, it’s not clear if Sony can reengineer the overlay in future, and is probably some kind of EULA breach… though since nobody reads those, it’s impossible to know. This also won’t enable gamers from regions not supported by PSN to play, with Sony restricting sales of the game within those countries, just as is now the case with Helldivers 2.</p>


<p>The PSN requirement has been coming for Sony’s games since earlier this year, first featured in Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut, very briefly with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/03/concord-is-shutting-down-this-week-refunds-being-issued-while-they-explore-options/">Concord</a>, and was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/06/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-pc-psn-requirement-may-6th-update-cancelled/">announced for (and then pulled) from Helldivers 2</a>. All of these games have one thing in common: cross-platform multiplayer.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok does not have multiplayer in any form, and people have taken to airing their grievances over the imposition by Sony to the reviews section on Steam. The main addition that it brings in this case is the ability to earn PlayStation trophies while playing on PC.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are instances where the overlay has interfered with the game’s running, whether that’s blocking people from accessing the game because linking had a server error, or with other complaints including crashes and visual bugs, which could be unrelated. At the same time, the mod itself isn’t a guaranteed success, and some report that it doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Expect there to be some back and forth between Sony’s engineers and the modding community, not just for God of War, but also for future single-player PC releases when they arrive, such as Spider-Man 2.</p>
<p>In our experience, God of War Ragnarok is a fine port of a great PlayStation game. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-review/">our hands on report</a>, Miguel said, “I was impressed by how gorgeous it looked and sounded on my desktop, and blown away by how similar the experience was when I brought it over to my Steam Deck. In many ways, the PC releases that Sony puts out of their games feel like the optimal way to experience them. God of War Ragnarok continues that trend.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tekken-8-heihachi-mishima-dlc-release-date-revealed.990153/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-heihachi-mishima-dlc-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>Heihachi Mishima DLC release date, and the Resurrected King himself is arriving early next month (or late this month if you're on Pacific time).</p>
<p>Per a new trailer, Heihachi joins the&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>roster on October 1st for Year 1 Pass holders, and everyone else will be able to play as him on October 4th (again, that's September 30th and October 3rd for Pacific time players).</p>
<p>Heihachi is the third DLC character to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-dlc-heihachi">be announced</a> for&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>since it launched earlier this year. He joins a DLC roster that also includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-eddy-gordo-release-date">capoeira legend Eddy Gordo</a> and (fictional) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-lidia-release-date">Polish prime minister Lidia Sobieska</a>, with one more fighter yet to be announced as part of the game's first year of DLC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tekken-8-heihachi-dlc-release-date-pose.jpg?itok=iLAeINTR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tekken-8-heihachi-dlc-release-date-pose.jpg?itok=Pu7kk_mr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Heihachi joins&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s roster very soon.</figcaption></figure><p>As is customary for&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>DLC characters at this point, Bandai Namco has also released a gameplay trailer for Heihachi, showing off the Mishima patriarch's brutal fighting style.</p>
<p>He first goes up against none other than <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-tekken-8-gameplay-trailer-reveals-jin-kazama-in-action">Jin Kazama</a>, suggesting that the two "should try getting along" as "two men back from the dead". Sadly, that doesn't take, and it's not long before Heihachi is taking on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-kazuya-gameplay-trailer-shows-bone-crunching-combos">Kazuya Mishima</a>.</p>
<p>Kazuya demands to know how Heihachi is still alive, in response to which Heihachi expresses amusement that Kazuya "thought some measly lava could kill me". Him and the rest of the world, Heihachi.</p>
<p>As you'd probably expect, Heihachi's trailer concludes with his Rage Art, which consists of an almighty punch delivered to Kazuya while he's in Devil Form. That's got to smart.</p>

<p>Heihachi lands as part of&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s first season of DLC characters on October 4th (for most players). One more fighter is also set to arrive as part of this DLC pass, although we don't know who it is yet.</p>
<p><em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778820/TEKKEN_8/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/tekken-8/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tekken-8/9ppsm14vkclw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

<div><p>Today Titmouse, the animation studio behind productions such as <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8fba9665-9011-4fc8-bf7e-3873de998554" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-vox-machina-season-2-review">The Legend of Vox Machina</a> </em>and Netflix's<em> Big Mouth</em>, have announced that they're taking a step into Tabletop Gaming with the announcement of <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/d2f63040-d2c6-4d61-8703-a5e83c7c3d21/landing"><em>Drunkards, Druggies, &amp; Delinquents</em></a>. This game will begin crowdfunding on October 8th via Backerkit with an expectation to have the game in player's hands by Spring 2025. This delivery date is expected to be just in time for Titmouse's 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>Titmouse explains that <em>Drunkards, Druggies, &amp; Delinquents</em> will put players in the shoes of rebellions adventurers "fueled by their drink or substance of choice, and navigate a world where chaos reigns supreme." As you might expect from the shows that Titmouse works on there is an intension for the game to be absurd and to challenge player's creativity. While there isn't much about rules shared it is mentioned that as players take damage playing <em>Drunkards, Druggies, &amp; Delinquents</em> they're encouraged to drunk, smoke, or partake in their favorite vice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;We designed <em>Drunkards, Druggies, &amp; Delinquents</em> to bring people together in the best possible way, &nbsp;through shared chaos, a few drinks (or more), and laughter, we invite you to open your mind, imbibe, and let the dice be your guide to new realms of absurdity!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once revealed the campaign will include exclusive rewards for early backers including limited-edition content, bonus materials, and a look into what it took to create this game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dont-nod-pause-projects-fail/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-nod-puts-projects-on-hold-as-jusant-and-banishers-fail-to-sell.990144/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dont-nod-pause-projects-fail/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Don’t Nod has published a relatively shaky financial update for H1 2024, revealing some critical issues. It was stressed that Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden failed to hit the mark, underperforming against expectations by a considerable amount. With that in mind (and in the open), Don’t Nod has announced the ‘temporary pause’ of two projects that were being fleshed out at the studio.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-down">Going Down</h2>



<p>Don’t Nod’s financial update revealed an 11% decline in operating revenues year-on-year. In recent months, the studio has released two titles, neither of which failed to secure the sales that were projected, drawing disappointment from the firm’s leadership team.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-87839#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20half%20of,16.5%20million%20in%20H1%202023." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a statement</a>, Oskar Guilbert, the CEO, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>We are obviously disappointed by our recent performance in an extremely competitive and selective market. Despite an excellent critical reception, Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts of new Eden unfortunately did not achieve the commercial results we had hoped for, resulting in a deterioration in our 2024 half-year results and leading us to consider all possible options regarding our roadmap.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The ‘possible option’ that the studio has settled on is to temporarily suspend ‘two production lines’. It was noted in the financial report that even this has incurred a sizeable cost.</p>



<p>It was pointed out that most of the studio’s sales came from back catalogue titles such as Vampyr and Life is Strange. The latter franchise was likely boosted following the recent reveal of Life is Strange: Double Exposure and the imminent release of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, a similar game based on an emotional choice-and-consequence model.</p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that Life is Strange: Double Exposure isn’t being developed or published by Don’t Nod, but the earlier iterations of the franchise were.</p>



<p>Toward the end of the financial update, it was highlighted that two projects, designated as ‘P10 and P14’ are due to be released before the end of 2027. </p>

                <p dir="ltr">Zelda is off on her own adventure for the first time ever (there definitely weren't any games starring her on CDi) in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, and the princess has Link's sword and shield to thank. Nintendo has revealed that his weapon combo "got in the way" of the Switch game's defining feature: copying and pasting items to solve puzzles and fight enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">A new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-3/?utm_source=SW-AAA&amp;utm_medium=sotwnoa&amp;utm_campaign=N1141-01&amp;utm_id=N1141-01" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ask the Developer volume</a> touched on how Link's sword and shield just didn't gel with using echoes to fight foes. Series producer Eiji Aonuma stated the "the sword and shield got in the way." That's because they seemed more effective than copying and pasting other items. As such, this led to an opportunity for Zelda to get her first starring role in Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom.</p><p dir="ltr">"If that's the case, it must be someone who doesn't fight with a sword and shield, right? Who in the series would be a good fit for these powers and bring their insight to them? Well, that would have to be Princess Zelda," said Aonuma.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="43567299" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

			<p>The rumored Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered collection is real, and it is launching in just a few months, according to new <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain%E2%84%A2-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-leaked-via-psn-december-10-2024.989865/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information discovered on the PlayStation Store today.</a></p>
<p>The collection, which will be released to celebrate the Soul Reaver's 25th anniversary, is being developed by Aspyr Media and will allow players to experience the epic conflict between Raziel and Kain in its original form or with remastered graphics, which are showcased in a brand new set of screenshots. A trailer can also be watched <a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202409/1119/453cd3c1f95ee30050e6f6c3935f8c091da1337fe28aaed0.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>

<p>While the official announcement, which is likely to be made in a few hours during the PlayStation State of Play presentation, is rather welcome, it is hardly surprising, as Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered was revealed back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered/">July</a> by two statues depicting Raziel and Kain that were on display during San Diego Comic-con with the unannounced remasters branding. Hopefully, the remasters will prove to be successful enough to spur the development of a new entry in the series. Following the release of Legacy of Kain: Defiance, the series has been pretty much dead, not counting the multiplayer game Nosgoth which never saw the light of day after multiple rounds of testing.</p>
<p>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered launches on December 10th. Platforms beside PlayStation consoles have yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-kickstarter-fully-funded</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/my-time-at-evershine-kickstarter-fully-funded-in-under-an-hour.990105/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-kickstarter-fully-funded<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pathea Games has launched the Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, the third major game in the&nbsp;<em>My Time&nbsp;</em>series, and the response has been pretty remarkable.</p>
<p>The studio was asking for a total of £149,777 (forgive my use of British pounds, but I am a Brit) as part of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mtae/my-time-at-evershine-the-next-my-time-tale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">its campaign</a>, which is set to run for 30 days. That funding goal was met in less than an hour of the campaign going live.</p>
<p>At time of writing, the total amount raised by Pathea for&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>stands at £221,772, and it's rising rapidly; while writing this story, the campaign has jumped another £10,000 or so. Impressive, right?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-time-at-evershine-kickstarter-fully-funded-vista.jpg?itok=f6UCa-T9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-time-at-evershine-kickstarter-fully-funded-vista.jpg?itok=8faiMcq- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>is definitely going ahead, so never fear.</figcaption></figure><p>The campaign doesn't currently appear to include any stretch goals; Pathea says the funding will be used to augment&nbsp;<em>Evershine</em>'s budget, which the studio expects to reach around $12 million, which is about the same as&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em>cost.</p>
<p>Although there aren't any stretch goals right now, there are a number of rewards you can reap for donating different amounts, including a signed artbook, a figurine, and even the chance to become a recruitable NPC in&nbsp;<em>Evershine&nbsp;</em>(although that last one carries an eye-watering $10,000 price tag).</p>
<p>In any case, it looks as though&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>has the built-in audience it wants already, and with 29 days to go on the Kickstarter campaign, the game is likely to rake in a whole lot more money before crowdfunding is through. Hurrah!</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-pathea-games">the followup</a> to Pathea Games'&nbsp;<em>My Time at Portia&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock</em>. It takes place in the same world as those games, but features a more realistic art style and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-fully-revealed">new focus on city management</a>.</p>
<p>We don't have a release date or window for&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>yet, but when the game does arrive, it'll launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199500/My_Time_at_Evershine/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">whatever the Nintendo Switch 2 turns out to be called</a>. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

This means, moving about the world organically, you’ll likely miss a lot of the best quests! Some are cleverly hidden, others require special stat checks or certain prerequisites to be met before you can reap the rewards, and it’s all too easy to just walk past them, never even knowing they were there. To address this, I’ve highlighted some of my favorite hidden quests you may have missed on your first playthrough.<br></p><p>Several of these quests begin early in the game and have multiple sections which unfold as the game progresses, which means that missing the beginning in Act 1 locks you out of some good payoffs later on. Others are one-hits that require a bit of extra work. But keep in mind this is a small sample of hidden quests—there are too many of them to write about them all! So keep exploring every corner, speaking to every character, trying every dialogue option, and using every item to find your own surprises.</p><p>But now, click next and let me help you find some of the best secret and hidden quests in the game you might otherwise have completely missed.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5709ba12fba52c3051aaa3c04bb2f4e2" data-recommend-id="image://5709ba12fba52c3051aaa3c04bb2f4e2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thay 1" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Thay 1" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Larian Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5709ba12fba52c3051aaa3c04bb2f4e2" data-recommend-id="image://5709ba12fba52c3051aaa3c04bb2f4e2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thay 1" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h98478"><a id=""></a>Quest Start Location: Act 1 - Under the Blighted Village</h3><p> To find this hidden extra in the Search The Cellar quest, enter the door next to the Waypoint in Blighted Village and go behind the bar to find a door leading to the basement.

First up we have the heavily rumored Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered, assets for which were spotted on the PlayStation Store before being swiftly removed.</p><p>According to the store description (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain%E2%84%A2-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-leaked-via-psn-december-10-2024.989865/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resetera</a>), Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered is developed by Embracer-owned video game revival specialist Aspyr, and launches December 10, 2024 to coincide with Soul Reaver’s 25th anniversary. There’s even a trailer and a number of screenshots, all lifted from PSN before Sony reversed its mistake.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered screenshots <a href="https://t.co/1GqTzgPlxX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1GqTzgPlxX</a></p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1838561167641387152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>“Experience the epic conflict of Kain and Raziel in original form or with remastered graphics,” reads the description. The games included are remasters of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver and Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2, both cult classics developed by Crystal Dynamics and helmed by designer Amy Hennig for the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 respectively. Crystal Dynamics, the Legacy of Kain franchise, and Aspyr are all currently owned by Embracer Group.</p><p>Here’s the (leaked) official blurb:</p><blockquote>Experience the Legendary Narrative<br>Centuries after your former master, Kain, betrays and executes you, you rise again and embark on a relentless quest for revenge.<br>Wield the Powers of a Wraith. Slay your former vampire brethren with your claws, bolts of telekinetic energy, and the elemental Wraith Blade. Grow stronger by devouring the souls of your enemies.<br>Shift Between Realms. The Elder God has granted you the ability to shift between the Spectral and Material Realms. Traverse the realms to solve puzzles, reveal new paths, and defeat your foes.</blockquote><p>In July, eagle-eyed San Diego Comic-Con 2024 attendees spotted branding for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-sdcc-fans-think-theyve-spotted-a-legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-and-2-remaster-tease-sdcc-2024">an unannounced remaster of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 and 2</a>, so this latest development doesn't come as much of a surprise. Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver originally launched in 1999 for the PS1 and PC, while its direct sequel, Soul Reaver 2, was released in 2001 for PS2 and PC. Both games are part of the dark fantasy action RPG series, though the franchise has remained dormant for decades. The last entry, Legacy of Kain: Defiance, was released in 2003 for PS2, PC, and the original Xbox.</p><p>Though the series was neglected for years, hopes for the franchise's return surfaced in October 2022 when Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-asking-fans-new-legacy-of-kain-game">published a survey</a> asking fans if they would like to see a new game from the Legacy of Kain series. A few months after the survey was released, Crystal Dynamics owner Embracer Group revealed it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-legacy-of-kain-looks-likely-as-embracer-receives-strong-fan-response">received 100,000 responses</a>, hinting that a new game could be in development.</p><p>Sony's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-for-september-2024-officially-announced">State of Play broadcast</a> is set for today, September 24, at 3pm PT / 6pm ET, with news on more than 20 upcoming PS5 and PS VR2 games “from studios around the world.” Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered, it seems, is among them.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Animalities return to Mortal Kombat alongside the release of Khaos Reigns, having made their debut in Mortal Kombat 3 all the way back in 1995.</p><p>Now, NetherRealm has revealed Peacemaker’s Animality. Peacemaker, a DLC guest character lifted from the DC Universe featuring the likeness and voice of actor John Cena, transforms into an eagle for a patriotic team-up with Eagly that involves severed legs, machine guns, a grenade, and, finally, the flag of the United States itself.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">WTF is Peacemaker's Animality / Friendship 😂This is hilarious<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MK1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MK1</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MortalKombat1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MortalKombat1</a><a href="https://t.co/pQYi3T0qzD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/pQYi3T0qzD</a></p>— thethiny 🐰🍉 (@thethiny) <a href="https://twitter.com/thethiny/status/1838385298209718649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Fans are already comparing Peacemaker’s Animality to the 'WTF Is A Kilometer' meme, which refers to a satirically patriotic American catchphrase sprawled on picture of George Washington with a bald eagle and a minigun.</p><p>NetherRealm has form when it comes to references. Indeed, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghostfaces-fatality-in-mortal-kombat-1-is-a-great-scream-reference">Ghostface’s Fatality in Mortal Kombat 1 is a reference to the Scream movies</a> from which the guest character originates. Noob Saibot’s bone-crunching Animality is a direct reference to the character’s Fatality in Mortal Kombat 9. And fellow DLC character Sektor <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sektors-mortal-kombat-1-fatality-channels-marvels-iron-man-heads-out-of-this-world"><u>has a Fatality that references Marvel’s Iron Man</u></a>.</p><p>And sticking with the patriotic bird theme, Homelander's Animality sees The Boys supervillain turn into a griffin.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Homelander animality (Griffin) Eagle 🦅🦅<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MK1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MK1</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MortalKombat?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MortalKombat</a> <a href="https://t.co/LjZ5r9mNc5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/LjZ5r9mNc5</a></p>— iScream (@iScreamFGC) <a href="https://twitter.com/iScreamFGC/status/1838238152768520563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Khaos Reigns hits Mortal Kombat 1 after four million sales since launching in September 2023. The expansion adds new story mode chapters available from September 24, along with Kombat Pack 2, which itself includes six new DLC characters: Cyrax, Sektor, and Noob Saibot (available on September 24), and guest fighters Ghostface (Scream franchise), T-1000 (Terminator 2: Judgement Day), and Conan the Barbarian (post-launch release timing to be announced at a later date).</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Nintendo has provided fresh details on why Zelda was chosen as the protagonist for the series' latest game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>.</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-3/">Ask The Developer blog</a>, series producer Eiji Aonuma discussed the game's development with Nintendo director Tomomi Sano (the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-started-out-as-a-dungeon-creator-game">first female director of a Zelda game</a>) and Grezzo director Satoshi Terada.</p>
<p>Initially, Link was to be the protagonist in Echoes of Wisdom, Aonuma explained, but the developers realised that if he still had a sword and shield there would be no reason to use the copy and paste gameplay of the echoes, the game's new concept.</p>

<p>Added Terada: "Echoes plus a sword and shield... They just didn't work well together. There is a wide variety of echoes, so to get the most out of the gameplay, we decided to stick with echoes only."</p>
<p>Aonuma replied: "If that's the case, it must be someone who doesn't fight with a sword and shield, right? Who in the series would be a good fit for these powers and bring their insight to them? Well, that would have to be Princess Zelda."</p>
<p>Aonuma then discussed the courage required to make Zelda the protagonist, given the series' long history.</p>
<p>"Over the years we've been working on the Legend of Zelda series, many people have often asked us, 'Will Princess Zelda ever be the protagonist?' and said, 'I'd like to play as Princess Zelda'," said Aonuma.</p>
<p>"When asked this question, I've always thought, 'Of course, as long as it makes sense for the game and does justice to her as a character to be the protagonist,' and answered that way. I had been trying in vain to figure out what would really do justice to her. But when I saw the team struggling to identify the ideal protagonist for this game, I thought, this is exactly the game for her!"</p>
<p>However, the development team then struggled to come up with a suitable story to send Zelda on an adventure. She's a princess after all!</p>
<p>"Just having monsters roaming around Hyrule wouldn't be enough to motivate Princess Zelda to directly fight them," said Aonuma. "We tried brainstorming all sorts of ideas for what kind of situation would necessitate that the princess take matters into her own hands."</p>
<p>In fact, the game's story was only completed last summer during a nine day boot camp.</p>
<p>Lastly, Aonuma discussed the difficulty of developing a new story in the Zelda series while honouring its history and timeline.</p>
<p>"These days, even for us, it's not easy to touch on the lore of the Legend of Zelda series," he said. "When you address the history of the Legend of Zelda, you naturally have to be conscious of how things have been expressed previously in the series.</p>
<p>"But when we think about a new game, we need to think about new developments while being mindful of the past games in the series, so the scope of what you can do becomes increasingly narrow if you think in the same way every time. On top of that, because the series has been running for a long time, players are interested in its history and lore.</p>
<p>"So, when we've adopted a game plot that was not in line with the other games in the series because we prioritised the gameplay, we've been told by our fans that it didn't make sense. We realised that even if the developers didn't intend to make nonsensical changes, players could interpret otherwise."</p>
<p>He continued: "Even with this title, we had no intention of establishing any new theories in the series' lore. Link goes on an adventure every time and experiences many things. But Princess Zelda has always had to take a step back in the Legend of Zelda series. But this time, Princess Zelda is on her own adventure, so the story takes on a different perspective than before. I think that's why we were able to create something new in terms of the story as well."</p>
<p>It's perhaps this reasoning that led to Nintendo placing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-officially-places-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-tears-of-the-kingdom-outside-series-established-timeline">Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom outside of the Zelda series' established timeline</a>.</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will release later this week on Nintendo Switch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>In July remasters of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 and 2 were leaked by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/27/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered-leaked-by-merch/">a statue at Comicon of all things</a> and the games have now popped up in back end of the PlayStation Store, presumably ahead of a reveal in tonight’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/state-of-play-is-taking-place-tomorrow-september-24th-confirms-sony/">State of Play.&nbsp;</a>You can ever watch the trailer, which is nice.</p>
<p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video id="video-453250-1" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202409/1119/453cd3c1f95ee30050e6f6c3935f8c091da1337fe28aaed0.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202409/1119/453cd3c1f95ee30050e6f6c3935f8c091da1337fe28aaed0.mp4">https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202409/1119/453cd3c1f95ee30050e6f6c3935f8c091da1337fe28aaed0.mp4</a></video></p>
<p>Here’s the blurb from the website</p>


<div>
<p>Celebrate Soul Reaver’s 25th Anniversary.</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience the epic conflict of Kain and Raziel in original form or with remastered graphics. Included Game Titles: Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver and Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2</li>
<li>Experience the Legendary Narrative: Centuries after your former master, Kain, betrays and executes you, you rise again and embark on a relentless quest for revenge.</li>
<li>Wield the Powers of a Wraith: Slay your former vampire brethren with your claws, bolts of telekinetic energy, and the elemental Wraith Blade. Grow stronger by devouring the souls of your enemies.</li>
<li>Shift Between Realms: The Elder God has granted you the ability to shift between the Spectral and Material Realms. Traverse the realms to solve puzzles.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see the remastered graphics are, well, nicer than the original, but it doesn’t look the polygon count has been increased that much and the lighting, effects and animation still look very similar to original game.</p>


</div>

<p>The two games are sequels to The Legacy of Kain, both featuring the vampire wraith Raziel in a quest to kill Kain, the star of the first game.&nbsp; Both titles picked up excellent reviews when they were released between 1991 and 2001, not surprising when they were directed by Uncharted’s Amy Hennig.</p>
<p>Two of the games in the series were <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/15/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-return-but-probably-not-in-the-way-you-wanted/">recently announced for the Evercade console.&nbsp;</a> Soul Reaver and Blood Omen are direct ports of the original titles without any new features and were released this month for the princely sum of £24.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-psn<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A now-deleted PlayStation Store listing has apparently confirmed the existence of remastered versions of the first two&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>games.</p>
<p>According <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1838560114745172409" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to a PSN listing quoted by Wario64 on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the remastered package, which is being developed by Aspyr, will contain&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>and its direct sequel&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver 2</em>. The bundle will launch on December 10th as part of&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver</em>'s 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>The PSN listing says that you'll be able to play both games either with their original graphics intact or with "remastered graphics", presumably akin to those found in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered">this year's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>remasters</a>, which were also handled by Aspyr.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-cliff.jpg?itok=FTkys8QX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-cliff.jpg?itok=zZV4WNp3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like those&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>remasters are pretty much a certainty now.</figcaption></figure><p>From the sound of the leaked trailer, it seems as though the remasters will keep the superb voice work of Michael Bell, Simon Templeman, and Tony Jay (voicing Raziel, Kain, and the Elder God respectively) intact.</p>
<p>The PSN listing doesn't make any reference to Aspyr putting any content that was cut from the original games back in, but the trailer seems to show some things that weren't in the original games, so we'll have to wait and see if the developer's plans extend that far.</p>
<p>The existence of these&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>remasters was first leaked as part of merchandise that was available at this year's Comic-Con; cards bearing text referring to the remasters were spotted at the show.</p>
<p>Additionally, a&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>prequel graphic novel that tells the story of the events leading up to the original&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitbotmedia/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-prequel-graphic-novel" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was recently Kickstarted</a>, so these remasters are part of what appears to be a wider revival for the property.</p>

Stay tuned for more on that and all things&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24252951/steelseries-apex-pro-gen-3-keyboards-hall-effect<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SteelSeries is launching its latest lineup of Apex Pro Gen 3 gaming keyboards today, and there’s a noticeable focus on improving how the keyboards sound and feel. SteelSeries is upgrading its Hall effect switches, adding dampening foam, improving its switch stabilizers, and even factory lubricating each key in an effort to create a thockier sounding board.</p><p>SteelSeries is moving to new OmniPoint 3.0 switches on the Apex Pro Gen 3 lineup, which includes a full-size board and TKL (tenkeyless) wired and TKL wireless variants. SteelSeries says it’s the “most technically advanced switch on the market,” and it has improved sensors that are designed to reduce noise.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Apex Pro Gen 3 lineup also includes a full-size option.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div><p>Hall effect gaming keyboards are increasingly becoming popular because they allow gamers to adjust actuation points from 4mm down to just 0.1mm. Traditional Cherry MX-style switches use a copper mechanism to register a press with a board at a set actuation point of around 2mm, but Hall effect switches use a magnet instead to speed up keypresses.</p><p>These magnetic switches also enable features like Rapid Trigger, the ability to press the same key without waiting for it to return. SteelSeries is offering both Rapid Trigger and Rapid Tap, its own take on Razer’s controversial Snap Tap mode. It allows you to perfectly counter-strafe in games like <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224261/valve-counter-strike-2-razer-snap-tap-wooting-socd-ban-kick">Valve recently banned</a> similar features from Razer and Wooting.</p><div><figcaption><em>SteelSeries is using dampening foam to improve the sound and feel.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div><p>SteelSeries has also improved its stabilizers to eliminate keycap wobble, so both the switches and stabilizers should reduce the overall rattling sound you can often find on Hall effect boards.&nbsp;SteelSeries has also added three layers of sound dampening foam to improve the sound and feel, alongside per key lubrication. SteelSeries is using Poron and silicone rubber here, but we’ll have to try out the boards to see how much of a difference it all makes.</p><p>It wouldn’t be a SteelSeries keyboard without some interesting software features. The new OmniPoint 3.0 switches also allow for 2-in-1 action keypresses, allowing you to combine two actions into a single keystroke. You could walk and then run, pull a grenade out and then throw it, or execute combos. It’s essentially a macro mode for your keyboard.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Apex Pro Gen 3 lineup also includes the OLED smart display.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div><p>GG Quickset is also available on these boards, which lets you use presets for games much like SteelSeries does for the audio settings of its headsets. SteelSeries has also added a protection mode, so you can lock keys against accidental fat fingering. </p><p>The Apex Pro Gen 3 also continues the tradition of the OLED smart display at the top of the keyboard, which allows for the adjustment of settings and profile changes or just a handy way to see your CPU and GPU usage.</p><p>The $199.99 Apex Pro Gen 3, $189.99 Apex Pro TKL Gen 3, and $249.99 Apex Pro TKL Wireless Gen 3&nbsp;are all available today from retailers worldwide.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

These apparitions and portents, Crystal Dynamics - what game are you playing now? It turns out the game they are playing is: a remaster of amazeballs vampire odyssey Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver, together with its less amazing but sturdy sequel. Said remaster project was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remasters-on-horizon-if-a-comic-con-plaque-is-to-be-believed">rumoured earlier this year</a>, when Sarafan scouts caught sight of a telltale plaque at San Diego Comic-Con. Consider that rumour strongly trending towards the status of a Real Thing, because Sony are in the habit of publishing Real Things, and they've just (accidentally, I guess) popped a bunch of screens and a trailer with a release date - 10th December 2024 - on the PlayStation website. 
</p>

<p>
All this comes care of <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain%E2%84%A2-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-leaked-via-psn-december-10-2024.989865/">Resetera</a>. My initial reaction to the screens is a hot blend of enthusiasm - because the first Soul Reaver is one of the most treasured games of my childhood - and revulsion - because they've properly given this one the Vaseline treatment, and turned all those gloriously grotty PS1 textures and contours into slick Bluepointy figurines that look clean enough to eat off.</p>
<p>"Ghastly past, insufferable future - are they one and the same?" intones Ariel, wraithlike prisoner of the corrupted Pillars of Nosgoth, in an early scene. No, Ariel, they are not the same at all, because I can see my farkin' face reflected in nu-Raziel's grossly protruding ribcage, and what have they done to Dumah? He used to be a tragical hummock of biomechanical hinges and soupy pixellation, the lowest-born of Kain's children fallen even deeper into ruin. Now, he just looks like a midboss from Doom Eternal.

<p>
"What have you done with my clan, degenerate?" I cry out unto apparent co-developers Aspyr through the amber prisms of the internet. "You have no right!"</p>
<p>"Oh quit whining, you old goat," you interject. "I didn't play Soul Reaver back in the day and I don't understand any of the references you're dropping and I don't want to play this while feeling as though I'm eyeballing a plate of rotten porridge."</p>
<p>"Look what they've done to the plane-shifting effects," I beseech, ripping at my clothes in a frenzy. "They used to be miracles on PS1, twisting the geometry in such a way as to suggest two worlds without actually building them. Now it just looks like effing screen-tearing."</p>
<p>"What would you know about the ins and outs of remastering classic games?" you sneer. "Only when you have felt the full gravity of choice should you dare to question their judgment."</p>
<p>"That's a line from Soul Reaver!" I squeal, pointing a shaking finger. "This whole exchange is a rhetorical farce!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, it just came to me on the spur of the moment," you sniff. "And anyway, I'm not going to sit here and bandy words with some so-called 'journalist' who never even played the original Blood Omen games. I'm going to read this here set of leaked bulletpoints instead."
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Experience the Legendary Narrative
</p>
<p>
Centuries after your former master, Kain, betrays and executes you, you rise again and embark on a relentless quest for revenge.
</p>
<p>
Wield the Powers of a Wraith. 
</p>
<p>
Slay your former vampire brethren with your claws, bolts of telekinetic energy, and the elemental Wraith Blade. Grow stronger by devouring the souls of your enemies.
</p>
<p>
Shift Between Realms.
</p>
<p>
 The Elder God has granted you the ability to shift between the Spectral and Material Realms. Traverse the realms to solve puzzles, reveal new paths, and defeat your foes.</p> </blockquote>
<p>One thing they haven't (it seems) meddled with is the voice-acting, and I am sagging with relief, because come on, show me a modern-day game that can chew scenery like Soul Reaver can. I can only think of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battleblock-theater">Battleblock Theater</a> and that came out over a decade later.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Elder Gods at Sony will hopefully be along with a proper announcement at some point soon. In the meantime, here's <a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202409/1119/453cd3c1f95ee30050e6f6c3935f8c091da1337fe28aaed0.mp4">a link to the trailer</a> which may have been taken down by the time you read this. I think that, on the whole, the balance of enthusiasm and revulsion in my head tips in the direction of the former, because look, here I am writing about Soul Reaver again in the year 2024, and besides, it <em>might</em> lead to the creation of new Legacy Of Kain games. Perhaps they could plunder the crypt of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/legacy-kain-dead-sun">Dead Sun</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cancels-online-appearance-at-tokyo-game-show/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft has cancelled its scheduled appearance at Tokyo Game Show, just two days before the event is set to get underway.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1838504341289783532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement released</a> by Ubisoft Japan, the company says the decision was made due to “various circumstances”.</p>



<p>“We regret to inform you that due to various circumstances, we have decided to cancel our online participation in Tokyo Game Show 2024 which was scheduled to start at 3:00 PM on September 26th,” the statement reads.  </p>



<p>“We apologize for the short notice. We sincerely apologize to everyone who was looking forward to the broadcast.”</p>



<p>The company did say that the “currently ongoing giveaway campaign” will continue despite the broadcast no longer happening. </p>



<p>Ubisoft’s pulling out of the event comes during a time of turmoil for the company. While the highly anticipated Assassin’s Creed Shadows releases in November, the company has been feeling pressure from other areas. </p>



<p>First, there is the concern about the state of XDefiant where, despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-not-dying-ubisoft-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims to the contrary</a>, is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in real trouble due to</a> falling player numbers. Then there is the continuous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-price-falling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falling of stock prices</a> as well as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-being-pressured-to-go-private-as-share-prices-continue-to-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">push from at least one investor</a> to make executive changes and take the company private.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has made multiple attempts to contact Ubisoft for more clarification on the “various circumstances” claim. As of publishing, however, a response was not received.</p>



<p><strong>UPDATE 10am ET</strong>: Ubisoft has told Insider Gaming that they have “No Comment” on the cancellation.</p>

One of the new features in the game will be a base-building mode, allowing players to construct their very own headquarters and customize it to their needs.</p><p>In a video that was uploaded by <a href="https://www.ign.com.cn/assassins-creed-codename-red/51099/video/ci-ke-xin-tiao-ying-kai-fa-zhe-ri-zhi-di-er-ji" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN China</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-has-sim-like-base-building-where-you-manually-place-houses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) and has since been removed, Ubisoft described how players will have an acre of land to establish their base on. The mode doesn't look too complex, as you can easily place buildings and paths on it, rotating and customizing them for when the game's protagonists Yasuke and Naoe need a moment of respite.</p>

                <p>2025 is going to be a big year for Minecraft fans. Not only does the Minecraft movie finally premiere on April 4, 2025, but Dark Horse Comics just announced a new Minecraft graphic novel, Minecraft: Out of Order, which will also launch in early 2025. Minecraft: Out of Order is an original story written and illustrated by cartoonish Josh Hicks, whose previous works include other graphic novels like Glorious Wrestling Alliance and Hotelitor: Luxury-Class Defense, as well as the animated short Spectre of the Bear. While it's not directly tied to the Minecraft movie, the first volume of Minecraft: Out of Order launches a few weeks ahead of the film on March 18, 2025, and fans can preorder the graphic novel now.</p><div title="6526642 - Minecraft: Out of Order vol. 1 graphic novel preorder" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2684" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6526642 - Minecraft: Out of Order vol. 1 graphic novel preorder" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1506743056?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/ASIN\/1506743056?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1506743056?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Preorder Minecraft: Out of Order Volume 1</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1506743056?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/exec\/obidos\/ASIN\/1506743056?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1506743056?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$11</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Minecraft: Out of Order follows Riley, a farmer who lives a quiet life in the countryside until their town is demolished and turned into building materials by the Province of Perfect Sameness--an evil kingdom led by identical twins Paula and Prentice who seek to impose "perfect sameness" on the whole world.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-laden-holy-horror-mansion-announced-by-professor-layton-developer-level-5-coming-to-secret-platforms<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Level-5 has revealed its "heartwarming" Ghost Craft RPG called Holy Horror Mansion, which the company describes as the "next concept for Yo-kai Watch".</p>
<p>The release platforms for the game have been described as "secret". Considering Level-5's support for Nintendo consoles, it seems likely the game will eventually make its way onto Nintendo's next, yet-to-be revealed console, tentatively dubbed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Holy Horror Mansion was announced during Level-5's Vision broadcast, which it hosted earlier today. Along with updates on the likes of Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time (which now has an April 2025 release window), Level-5 also gave us a first look at what it calls its largest cross-media project to date.</p>

<p>Holy Horror Mansion looks to be a bombastic evolution on Yo-kai Watch. It features a young boy named Ten Lordland who lives in a large apartment building which happens to be a gate to the underworld. He finds a mysterious camera within the building, which does something strange to one of his nose hairs. Cue plenty of spectral beings and ghostly shenanigans (see above).</p>
<p>During the presentation, Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino said the theme for Holy Horror Mansion is "family", and the team hopes the whole family can and will enjoy it. He also said a showcase for the project will take place in the spring of next year, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>And, that is about all the information we have on the upcoming ghost game for now. Its release date is simply said to be "not sure" but maybe "soon", while its price will be "fair".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">Nintendo has said it will make an announcement about the successor to the Switch "within this fiscal year"</a>. We'll at least learn more official news of Switch 2 before 31st March, then.</p>
<p>Unofficially, a major leak earlier this month of what seemed to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-designs-posted-by-3d-model-enthusiast-setting-internets-tongues-wagging">prototype components for the upcoming console</a> gave us an idea of the form the machine may actually take.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
