              <p>If you want to enjoy your favorite titles on the go without compromising on performance, you need a solid gaming laptop. The best ones out there offer a balanced combination of power, sufficient RAM and storage, plus a high refresh rate display. Of course, as you’d expect, such options don’t come cheap. On a regular day, you can expect to pay over $2,000 for a machine this capable. Thankfully, that changes today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5414/">Amazon is now offering the latest 14-inch Razer Blade gaming laptop for $1,800, after a nice 14% off its regular price of $2,100</a>. We know it’s still an investment even at its discounted rate, but definitely one that’s worth it, considering all the features you’re getting here. It’s an early Black Friday deal, but we can’t say how long it’ll stick around. If it’s been on your radar, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5414/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Superior Performance for Both Work and Play</h2>
<p>This laptop packs the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 GPU, paired with 115W TGP and DLSS 4 support for higher quality frames and immersive visuals that can bring any scene to life. It’s powered by AMD’s new Ryzen AI 9&nbsp;365 processor, which offers up to 50 Tera Operations Per Second (TOPS) and delivers 200% more AI processing power than the previous Blade 14. This translates into much better overall performance, especially if you’re working with AI tools that usually demand a lot from your system. This also makes the laptop a great option for creatives who frequently use resource-intensive programs for their projects.</p>
<p>Then there’s 32GB of LPDDR5X RAM running at 8000MHz for faster multitasking, as well as a 1TB SSD to store everything you own.</p>



<p>As for the visuals, you’re getting a 14-inch 3K OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 0.2ms response time. It’s not the biggest screen out there, but it’s spacious enough to enjoy your games without feeling cramped. The display is also Calman Verified, which means it’s going to ensure accurate color reproduction consistently. You can expect visuals to look exactly how the creator intended, whether you’re gaming or streaming your favorite show.</p>
<p>Despite all this power, the laptop is quite lightweight and compact. The vapor chamber cooling system keeps it cool during long gaming sessions without sacrificing performance. And speaking of extended use, the 72Wh battery offers up to 11 hours of usage on a single charge. You can go an entire day without worrying about plugging it in!</p>

With <i>Arc</i>’s all-time concurrent player count hitting 462,488 at the time of this writing,&nbsp;the survival-based PvPvE shooter’s player peak outstrips&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Helldivers 2</i>‘s top count of 458,709 by just a few thousand players. And with the game holding at 208,000 concurrent Steam players at the time of writing, it doesn’t look like it’s going to stop for a breather.</p>

 <p><i>Helldivers 2</i> wasn’t the only shooter surpassed by <i>Arc Raiders</i> this weekend. <i>Battlefield 6</i> was also left behind as Embark Studios’ new shooter hit the cherished number-three spot in <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/">Steam’s most-played games</a>, behind <i>Dota 2</i> and <i>Counter-Strike 2</i> (like breaking the laws of thermodynamics, it would take an act of god to see those two games dethroned for any meaningful amount of time).</p>

 <h2>Bitter PvP skirmishes aren’t souring the fun of <i>Arc Raiders</i></h2> <p>Prior to its launch, it was natural to be skeptical of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ potential to appeal to a wider crowd than previous games in its genre have. Extraction shooters haven’t been the smash hit that, say, battle royales or even hero shooters have been, and for some players the PvP element of <i>Arc Raiders</i> can make for a disruptive, uncomfortable experience.</p>

   <p>But as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oncgsr/i_mean_this_in_the_most_respectful_way_possible/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a recent Reddit post</a> with over 9,000 (sorry) upvotes confirms, fans of the extraction shooter are eager to accept the brutal, sometimes unfair-feeling outcomes that spontaneous PvP can generate, especially when those encounters involve extraction camping, which is when folks intentionally wait for others to extract before jumping them when they least expect it.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-skills-mobility-survival-conditioning-solo-2000641789"><i>Arc Raiders</i>: The Best Skills For Solo And Team Play</a></p> <p>On said Reddit post, many are chiming in about alternative strategies for dealing with extraction campers, namely the use of escape hatches which you can either find or craft keys for. This, I’d wager, is a perfect example of why I think <i>Arc Raiders</i> is proving such a hit: The game is eager to help you find ways to get around uncomfortable situations. On top of its varied progression systems, <i>Arc Raiders</i> asks players to invest in strategic solutions to difficult problems and it seems to be working out well.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shuhei-yoshida-%E2%80%98absolutely-wanted%E2%80%99-stellar-blade-on-playstation-after-playing-it.1348765/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Stellar Blade has been stellar in every sense of the word. The hit action title has been universally well-received, and much more Stellar Blade content is on the way. Much of this was already known. However, what isn’t as evident is that the iconic PlayStation veteran had a huge say in the franchise coming to PlayStation 5 first.</p>



<p>Many consider <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shuehei-yoshida-thinks-dangerous-subscription-models-wont-advance-the-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shuhei Yoshida</a> a godfather of gaming and a bona fide PlayStation guru. Yoshida assumed various roles within PlayStation over the course of his 30-plus-year career there. We’ve since learned that one of his final contributions to the company was recommending and securing Stellar Blade.</p>



<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-on-ps5-helped-by-legendary-shuhei-yoshida">Stellar Blade On PS5 Helped By Legendary Shuhei Yoshida</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We heart you too. Credit to Shift Up</figcaption></figure>



<p>Through <a href="https://minimap.net/magazine/Shuhei-Yoshida-Interview-en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Minimap</a>, we’ve learned that Shuhei Yoshida visited Shift Up’s Korean studio during the game’s development. He’d gotten wind of an “outstanding console game” being worked on and decided to visit the team and try it out.</p>



<p>Yoshida was immediately impressed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“To my surprise, the new project had exceptional quality across the board-3D modeling, realism, graphics, and action. When I played it myself, it felt stylish, polished, and genuinely fun. What impressed me most was the way the team designed characters. Their process of creating digital figures from physical models was detailed and artistic.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Stellar Blade has made an indelible impression as Yoshida and one of his associates agreed on the title’s potential:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“‘We absolutely want this game on PlayStation [said Yoshida’s colleague],’ and I completely agreed. When I returned to the office, I told the team, “This is a truly remarkable game.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And that was it! With Yoshisa’s blessing, Sony Interactive Entertainment handled the game’s publishing. The seal of approval has worked out well for all parties. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-quietly-revealed-by-developer-shift-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade sequel was quietly revealed by Shift Up</a>.</p>



<p>The game went on to receive a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-pc-system-requirements-minimum-recommended-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC port</a>, and it’s also gotten <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-receives-3-new-epilogues-with-the-latest-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3 new epilogues with a new update</a>. It feels like Shift Up has a special franchise-in-the-making on its hands. Let us know if you’ve played Stellar Blade. How does it compare to other intense action games?

Howard told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview"><em>GQ</em></a><em> </em>this in a new interview, where he also teased that, when TES VI is ready for release, the company might shadow-drop it.&nbsp;</p><p><em>GQ </em>mentions <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/22/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-is-available-today">Bethesda shadow-dropping The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> back in April, and asks if the company could "actually do that with" TES VI.

            <p>Sony has whipped up its list of the most downloaded PlayStation Store titles for the month of October, and it turns out Japanese layers are really digging the adventures of Atsu in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>. Sucker Punch's epic samurai sequel is top of the PlayStation 5 download list in Japan, but it's relegated to second place in the west, where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> reigns supreme.</p>
<p>Not that Battlefield 6 is slouching in Japan. It manages to secure second place in October, ahead of a top 20 featuring some excellent games. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, for instance, is Japan's seventh most downloaded PS5 title on the PlayStation Store, but is completely missing from the US, Canada, and EU charts. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ball-x-pit-the-kenny-sun-story">BALL x PIT</a> is also absence in the west, but sits mightily in eighth position over in Japan.</p>

<p>And of course the west just can't get enough of its balls, with EA Sports FC 26 sitting in third place in the EU (fourth in the US and Canada), and NBA 2K26 taking the third spot outside of the EU. The indomitable <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> clings on tight at four in the EU, meanwhile, and Arc Raiders sweeps fifth place in the west (it's a little lower at nine in Japan). But enough chatter; here's the PS5 list in full.</p>

<p>So there you go! One other thing to note; Dispatch - the new superhero workplace comedy from the former Telltale developers at AdHoc Studio - absolutely smashing it. We knew it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about">managed to sell 1m copies in just 10 days</a>, but Sony's charts give an even better sense of how well it's doing on the PlayStation Store. It's sitting in 11th place in the EU, but really slugging it out with the big boys in fifth position in the US and Canada. Impressive stuff!</p><p>Over on PS4, Red Dead Redemption is leading the charge in the west (versus Code Vein in Japan), and Delta force has Japanese players all aquiver in the free-to-play rankings, compared to Battlefield REDSEC over here. And if you're curious to see the full PS4 and free-to-play rundown, you can check out the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/playstation-store-october-2025s-top-downloads/">western</a> and <a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2025/11/10/20251110-downloadranking/">Japanese</a> lists on the PlayStation Blog.</p>

<p>Johnny Silverhand and Jackie Welles have joined the <a href="https://tubbz.com/">Tubbz</a> range of collectable characters, each notable for their duck-like qualities.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-features-xbox-game-dev-kit-point-next-gen-xbox-pc-console-hybrid/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-features-in-the-xbox-game-dev-kit-further-point-to-next-gen-xbox-being-a-pc-console-hybrid.1348729/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Officially, we don't have a concrete idea of what the next generation of console hardware will look like from either PlayStation or Xbox. Unofficially, at least on the Xbox side of things, we're seeing plenty of hints that <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-will-reportedly-be-best-of-both-worlds-between-pc-and-console/">what's in store for the next-gen Xbox is a sort of PC/console hybrid</a>, a device that will try to take the flexibility of PC when it comes to having your <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rumored-to-be-testing-steam-integration-within-microsoft-store-potentially-for-next-gen-xbox-too/">gaming library from multiple launchers and digital stores available,</a> with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">ease-of-use that comes with a console</a>.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-preparing-for-next-gen-with-a-ton-of-new-xbox-gdk-dev-features-heres-whats-new">Windows Central</a>, the new features added to the Xbox Game Development Kit (Xbox GDK) point to Microsoft and Xbox preparing for that rumored future device, with a few standout features which, if you think about how developers and players would use them, you'd end up asking yourself, 'why add this feature if not to prepare for a future where the next Xbox is essentially a PC?'</p>



<p>A nearly 10-minute video from the Microsoft Game Dev YouTube channel goes into great detail on the key features in the October 2025 GDK update, which you can check out below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="What's new in the October 2025 GDK" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xD7xrh8DHjQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Some of the key features highlighted in the video include PlayFab Game Saves, which is a feature that lets players access their game save files between Xbox and Steam. Yes, individual games already support cross-progression between PC and consoles, but those all use their own individual systems. This is closer to an extension of Xbox's Cloud Save solution, but including game saves from Steam as well, with plans to add more platforms in the future.</p>



<p>Xbox Game Package Manager is another noteworthy feature, because it is intended to help developers streamline the process for supporting Microsoft's Xbox Play Anywhere initiative, which is a key element to Xbox expanding its reach to let players play their games where they want, whether through Cloud Gaming, PC, console, or PC handheld devices like the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>.</p>



<p>Another new feature, Cross-Platform Gaming Runtime, is specifically meant to make it easier for developers to let players send game invites through Xbox's social features while playing games on other platforms. Essentially, letting someone on Steam send you an invite through your Xbox invites. Lastly, GameInput is a feature intended to unify controller models from your controller, keyboard and mouse under one interface, and featuring full parity with PC. </p>



<p>Again, none of this necessarily confirms that the next-gen Xbox will be the PC/console hybrid that's been rumored, but features like PlayFab Game Saves and Cross-Platform Gaming Runtime lead you to wonder why they'd be implemented at all if not for this next-gen Xbox/PC. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/reported-warhammer-mmo-studio-becomes-yet-another-netease-casualty.1348726/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Jackalyptic Games, the studio purportedly responsible for developing an unannounced&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>MMO, has become yet another casualty of parent company NetEase.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jackalyptic-games_im-here-to-share-a-note-that-after-nearly-activity-7392684257858494464-6uB8/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on LinkedIn</a>, CEO Jack Emmert said that his studio's "partnership" with NetEase is "coming to an end", and that Jackalyptic's "talented team members will be exploring new opportunities", so it sounds like the studio is shutting down completely.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>MMO on which Jackalyptic Games (formerly Jackalope Games) was reportedly working was never officially revealed, but it was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/netease-s-billionaire-ceo-slashes-jobs-and-games-in-profit-push" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported back in February</a> that the studio was seeking funding for the project following a slew of NetEase studio closures and funding pulls.</p>

It sounds like the developer wasn't successful in securing alternative funding for the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>MMO.</p>

<p>Jackalyptic Games was founded as Jackalope Games by Jack Emmert in May 2022, at which point it was also revealed that the studio was teaming up with Games Workshop on its first project (thus virtually guaranteeing it was based on&nbsp;<em>Warhammer</em>).</p>

<p>The studio was NetEase's first US-based gaming studio, and it was part of a major expansion into studio acquisition, with major figures like ex-Ubisoft producer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-netease-studio-bad-brain" rel="nofollow">Sean Crooks</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netease-launches-new-studio-pincool-led-by-former-dragon-quest-producer-will-work-on" rel="nofollow">Ryutaro Ichimura</a>, and BioWare's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mac-walters-worlds-untold-netease" rel="nofollow">Mac Walters</a> teaming up with NetEase for their own ventures.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it would prove to be a short honeymoon. Both Crooks' and Walters' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bad-brain-game-studios-netease-shut-down" rel="nofollow">studios</a> have been&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">shut down</a>&nbsp;in the past twelve months, along with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rich-vogel-t-minus-zero-entertainment-netease-shut-down" rel="nofollow">T-Minus Zero Entertainment</a>, which was founded by another BioWare veteran, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">Seattle development team of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-exoskeleton</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/real-life-death-stranding-2-exoskeleton-aims-to-boost-your-movement-in-december.1348723/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kojima Productions and exoskeleton maker Dnsys have teamed up to create a&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>-themed exoskeleton, and you'll be able to buy one in early December, albeit in a "very limited run".</p>

<p>The exoskeleton is a special&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>-branded version of Dnsys' Z1 Pro model, and it'll be released on December 2nd, according to a Dnsys <a href="https://dnsys.ai/blogs/dnsys-and-kojima-productions-launch/death-stranding-2-x-dnsys-inspired-by-the-game-engineered-for-reality" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>.</p>

<p>The cost of the unit hasn't been revealed, but the company's X1 Lite exoskeleton costs around $700, and since that's on the bottom end of Dnsys' pricing range, you can probably expect to be paying quite a lot more for the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>Z1 Pro. Pricing will be revealed on release day, Dnsys says.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dnsys-death-stranding-2-exoskeleton.jpg?itok=bgUSURcq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dnsys-death-stranding-2-exoskeleton.jpg?itok=NItxKLj1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>is getting its own branded exoskeleton.</figcaption></figure><p>To create the new exoskeleton (which is launching ahead of the mass production of the Z1 model proper), Dnsys worked with&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>artist Yoji Shinkawa, who's also known for his work on Hideo Kojima's&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>Shinkawa says he and Dnsys "designed this exoskeleton with the same passion and precision as if it were built for the world of&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>", and that the device is "something Sam Porter Bridges himself might wear".</p>

<p>According to Dnsys, the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>Z1 Pro will offer "50% extra power to steps", as well as joint protection through "offload[ing] up to 200% of body weight from the knees". You can also expect extended hiking and vertical climbing ranges.</p>

<p>If you'd like to be in with a chance of winning yourself a&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>exoskeleton, you can take part in the new Share Your Journey campaign, which asks you to tell Dnsys how an exoskeleton would help you in your day-to-day life. You can find details <a href="https://dnsys.ai/pages/z1-exoskeleton-death-stranding2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>




<p>As for <i>Death Stranding 2</i>'s creator Hideo Kojima, he's currently hard at work on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kojima-productions-10th-od-physint" rel="nofollow">new projects&nbsp;<em>OD&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint</em></a>, although it's probably going to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kojima-physint-five-six-years" rel="nofollow">quite some time indeed</a> before the latter sees the light of day, at least.</p>

<p>Dnsys'&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>-themed Z1 Pro exoskeleton launches on December 2nd, and as a reminder, it'll be arriving in very limited quantities. Be sure to sign up to the mailing list via the official website to get the best chance of grabbing yours.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-japan-november-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-state-of-play-japan-revealed-for-later-this-week.1348720/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a brand new PlayStation State of Play show for this week, and it'll focus on games from Japan and the wider Asia region.</p>

<p>As outlined in a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/10/state-of-play-japan-airs-this-tuesday-november-11/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the State of Play show will air tomorrow at 2pm Pacific (that's 5pm Eastern and around 10pm GMT). It'll feature "great games, interviews, and new looks at anticipated titles", according to Sony.</p>

<p>The presentation will be aired in Japanese, but it'll feature full English subtitles, so you'll be able to watch it even if you don't speak the language. You will need to watch on the Western PlayStation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/PLAYSTATION" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, though, because the Japanese channel's show won't feature subtitles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-state-of-play-japan.jpg?itok=28YjJb5k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-state-of-play-japan.jpg?itok=FZOFXEtH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Expect to see Japan-centric Sony games featured during this week's show.</figcaption></figure><p>The new State of Play will last "more than 40 minutes", Sony says, and it'll be hosted by voice actor Yuki Kaji, who you might know as the Japanese voice of the&nbsp;<em>Ys&nbsp;</em>series' protagonist Adol Christin, as well as his work on anime like&nbsp;<em>My Hero Academia&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</em>.</p>

<p>Sony hasn't revealed what kind of games we can expect to see during the show, but since it's focusing on the studio's Asian development efforts, don't hold your breath for updates on titles like&nbsp;<em>Saros&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Wolverine</em>.</p>

<p>Instead, games like Arc System Works' upcoming&nbsp;<em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em>, as well as Hero Project efforts like&nbsp;<em>Exiledge&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-to-invest-in-china-hero-project-convallaria-to-shore-up-efforts-in-china" rel="nofollow"><em>Convallaria</em></a>, are more likely. I'd imagine we'll see a few new titles announced during the show as well.</p>

<p>News of the new State of Play comes after Sony reaffirmed its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-q1-2025" rel="nofollow">commitment to its live-service agenda</a> back in August, despite the high-profile failure of&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">delay to Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em></a>.</p>

<p>The State of Play Japan presentation for November 2025 airs tomorrow at 2pm Pacific/5pm Eastern/10pm GMT. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>Last week, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-funko-pops-astarion-shadowheart-karlach-1851676142">Funko Pop company</a> hit investors with a dramatic disclosure. “There is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months,” it revealed in its latest quarterly <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001704711/83187cc3-3ab8-4098-bc5f-cb16ca0775c6.pdf">earnings report</a>. This is the company warning that it’s at increasing risk of defaulting on its loans. How much is that? Roughly $241 million. I don’t think the banks will accept payment in the form of <em>One Piece</em> Funko Pops.</p>

 <p>The company revealed that it amended its credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank back in July in an effort to waive certain requirements and buy time in order to refinance its debt under more manageable terms. That sounds reasonable and the company is certainly spinning this situation as business as usual, but it’s also saying, in no uncertain terms, that there’s a decent chance it won’t be able to pay out everyone it owes by the end of the next 12 months unless something big changes.</p>

 <p>“I want to reiterate the sense of urgency and opportunity around our Make Culture Pop strategy, executing across the intersection of culture, creativity, and commerce,” Josh Simon, who just joined as CEO in September after five years at Netflix, said during <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-funko-beats-eps-forecast-stock-dips-in-q3-2025-93CH-4340543">the latest earnings call</a>. “In the short term, I’m looking to maintain the momentum [the chief financial officer] discussed.”</p>

  <p>He continued, “Over the long term, what’s most exciting to me, and I hope is equally exciting to our investors, are the multiple opportunities to transform the company for substantial growth. We have a strategic advantage from building this company over the last 27 years, and we intend to leverage that legacy and relationship with our community of fans to take advantage of the huge opportunity in the increasingly global world of entertainment and pop culture fandom.”</p>

 <p>Who doesn’t love “multiple opportunities to transform the company for substantial growth”?</p> <p>But the numbers are bad. Funko Pop lost $1 million last quarter, a harsh drop from the over $8 million in profit it made a year ago. Why is <a href="https://kotaku.com/rare-funko-pop-willy-wonka-golden-ticket-holy-grail-1850683490">the collectible company</a> tumbling off a cliff? You might think it has something to do with losing certain big licenses to competitors or flooding the market with way more junk than even the most die-hard fans are willing to absorb, but the biggest kiss of death came back in the spring in the form of President Trump’s trade war. Tariffs hit sales of cheap toys manufactured overseas hard.</p>

 <h2>Funko mystery boxes to the rescue</h2> <p>The company claims that’s all in the past, however, and the new CEO is touting a big anticipated boost from the upcoming releases of <em>Stranger Things</em>‘ final season&nbsp;and <em>Wicked: For Good</em>. He was also very proud of Funko’s recent Dodgers Championship Five Pack, which he attributed to the company’s new “quick strike” team that can essentially take any major pop culture event in the world and merchandize it at warp speed.</p>

 <p>By far my favorite secret Funko strategy to not go bankrupt is its new Bitty line of mini-figures. That’s right. The company’s brilliant maneuver in its time of distress is just making Funkos smaller and combining them with loot boxes. “We are also planning new innovative retail experiences, such as selling Bitty Pop products through vending machines with a surprise or mystery element to the purchase experience,” the executive team said during the call last week. Inspired!</p> <p>Will Funko still be around in five years? Will it be be acquired by another toy company or chopped up for parts in a private equity buyout? It’s hard to day. One thing’s for certain, though: the plastic faces it has littered across shelves <a href="https://kotaku.com/funko-pop-spider-man-harry-potter-post-malone-pokemon-1850178280">and landfills</a> will remain with us for decades if not centuries to come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>This weekend, it wasn’t just League of Legends that enjoyed a masterful tournament final. Honor of King’s biggest event, the King Pro League, enjoyed a grand final stage that broke records and made history. In China, an astonishing 62,196 esports fans descended upon the National Stadium, surpassing the esports spectator record set in 2016 by <strong>almost 20,000</strong> people.</p>



<p>The record of around 45,000 spectators was previously secured by PES 2016 UEFA Euro, an event held in Paris. Honor of Kings has decimated that record, and even ahead of the event taking place, there were signs that it would do just that.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-king-pro-league-smashes-records">The King Pro League Smashes Records</h2>



<p>Honor of Kings now holds the Guinness World Record for the largest live audience ever in attendance at an esports match. In the grand final of the recent King Pro League in China, 61,196 fans watched the action unfold, proving unequivocally that mobile esports is extremely powerful.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This triumph is important for a few reasons.</p>



<p>Firstly, it’s proving that the accessibility and diversity of mobile games are drawing in a stunning audience. Honor of Kings boasts 260 <strong>million </strong>monthly users, playing across a network that covers 200+ countries. It’s a massively popular game in China, which is where the majority of the game’s market resides.</p>



<p>That’s an indicator of how it was so successful at China’s National Stadium.</p>



<p>Further, mobile gaming is coming up and becoming a more international concept. It has done drastically well in Asian markets but is quickly expanding across LATAM and Africa. While Europe and North America are typically focused more on PC-based esports titles, it’s only a matter of time before the mobile boom hits those regions too.</p>



<p>This redefinition of esports spectatorship has set a new bar for mobile esports.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo fans are rejecting a new description found within <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> that describes Link and Princess Zelda as just friends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An in-game journal entry from Zelda's ally Lenalia claims that the princesses' sword training was inspired by "a knight — and friend — from her own time." But while this description seems clear-cut, fans have compared it to the text found in the game's original Japanese language version — which simply refers to Link as a "familiar knight," without the explicit "friend" label.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This latest snippet has reignited the debate over whether Link and Zelda are more than just pals — something that Nintendo itself has kept mysterious for decades. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Lenalia's journal entry is just that — one character's recording of what she has been told by Zelda, who may or may not have been speaking truthfully. In one social media post that has now gone viral, Zelda fan <a href="https://twitter.com/IvyfulWorld/status/1986495137711849817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1986495137711849817%7Ctwgr%5E313698543142c4c7282ba9eb9eebd09b2cea6a76%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FIvyfulWorld%2Fstatus%2F1986495137711849817" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IvyfulWorld</a> put it thus: "she is not fooling ANYBODY."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I guess one explanation could be she tried to downplay it out of shyness," replied <a href="https://twitter.com/big_asutaro/status/1986988454962409538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1986988454962409538%7Ctwgr%5E5884557b5d53e5338008f836720dbc15021f8e96%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda%2Fzelda-and-link-shippers-are-in-shambles-after-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-describes-them-as-just-friends-but-after-39-years-we-can-read-between-the-lines%2F" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">big_asutaro</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nintendo of America's localization team has this thing for wanting to portray Link and Zelda's relationship as purely platonic by adding things that aren't even present in the original text," claimed another fan, <a href="https://twitter.com/verieas/status/1986872165581324414?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1986988454962409538%7Ctwgr%5E5884557b5d53e5338008f836720dbc15021f8e96%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda%2Fzelda-and-link-shippers-are-in-shambles-after-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-describes-them-as-just-friends-but-after-39-years-we-can-read-between-the-lines%2F" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">verieas</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">“and friend” she is not fooling ANYBODY <a href="https://t.co/IwULR3vRhd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/IwULR3vRhd</a></p>— Ivy | Sacred Stones (@IvyfulWorld) <a href="https://twitter.com/IvyfulWorld/status/1986495137711849817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout its almost 40-year history, The Legend of Zelda series has frequently suggested that Link and the princess are romantically involved. The pair hold hands in the finale of Spirit Tracks, and are implied to be settling down as a couple to found Hyrule at the end of Skyward Sword. Zelda even kisses Link (on the cheek) during Oracle of Ages, sending hearts fluttering from the swordsman's eyes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most recently, both Zelda and Link appear to be sharing a house in Tears of the Kingdom — which features the incarnations of Link and Zelda referenced in Age of Imprisonment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelda voice actress Patricia Summersett, who has voiced the same incarnation of Zelda seen from Breath of the Wild onwards, raised eyebrows in 2023 when she stated that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tears-of-the-kingdom-hints-that-link-and-zelda-are-finally-in-a-relationship">she believed the pair were definitively "in a relationship</a>." However, Summersett swiftly walked back the comments just days later saying her words had been "misconstrued." (Nintendo did not comment on this kerfuffle at the time, though fans noted it had been unusual for anyone outside the company itself to discuss its characters in such a manner.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what has Nintendo itself said? Perhaps the clearest indicator of Link and Zelda's relationship status came from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-interview-nintendo-eiji-aonuma-hidemaro-fujibayashi">series' legendary producer Eiji Aonuma, who told IGN the following in December 2023</a> when asked for an official ruling on the subject:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I will leave it to everyone's imagination [whether Link and Zelda are in a relationship]. I don't think that Zelda is a type of game where the development team says, 'This is what Zelda is, this is what the story is, this is what the game is.' Everything that the development team wants to convey has already been placed into the game. And the rest is up to the player's imagination, and their reflection on how they feel… what they've experienced in the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering the most recent Zelda game features a house lived in by Link and Zelda (with Nintendo placing just a single bed into the bedroom), some fans took Aonuma's comment to be the clearest sign yet that Nintendo does indeed see the two as a couple — even if it doesn't want to explicitly apply that label in-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, it will be interesting to see how Nintendo handles the two characters in its upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-legend-of-zelda">The Legend of Zelda live-action movie</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendos-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-now-shooting-in-new-zealand">which recently began shooting in New Zealand</a> following the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-actors-set-to-play-link-and-zelda-in-live-action-the-legend-of-zelda-film">casting of its two key roles earlier this year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>Fortnite's latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/" data-ref-id="2900-7202">crossover event with The Simpsons</a>--which includes multiple Simpsons-themed skins and a new map inspired by Springfield--is one of the game's most successful events ever, with over three million concurrent players logging in over the weekend. A new short, uploaded today on the official Fortnite YouTube channel, shows how Epic Games will up the ante in tomorrow's update--if you plan to log in, keep <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awAmdYB6Xuc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watching the skis...er, skies</a>.</p><p>The short features Homer and Professor Frink speaking about the shard Homer has installed into his TV remote. Frink wants to analyze it, but Homer isn't through using it, as he immediately transforms a nearby round cloud into a massive donut, which falls from the sky. Homer then transforms Frink into a new version of Peely dressed as the professor.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaYY9ghy8EQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GaYY9ghy8EQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The video then shifts to gameplay footage, which showcases massive donuts falling from the sky all over the Springfield map. We also get new glimpses of some upcoming skins: Lisa Simpson, who is riding in a mech like her brother Bart; Moe Szyslak, the grumpy bartender; and Peely dressed as Professor Frink from the animated short, which seems to be the second skin available in the Springfielder Peely portion of the current battle pass.</p><p>Finally, the trailer shifts back to another animated scene, with the aftermath of Homer's antics in full view. The town is complaining to Mayor Quimby about the food raining from the sky, and the town agrees to put a stop to it. Meanwhile, Homer disposes of the shard by throwing it into nuclear waste, then falls into the waste himself--only for multiple Homers to appear, seemingly teasing the next major change coming to the Fortnite Simpsons event.</p><p>Fortnite is free to download and play on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PC, and mobile devices. The current Simpsons-themed season is scheduled to run until November 29.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>We may be about to see a whole new product line of Valve-made gaming hardware. Speculation suggests Valve has a new Steam Controller, virtual reality headset, and console-like device in development, and they may be revealed as soon as this week.</p>
<p>The speculation seems to originate from trusted leaker Brad Lynch (SadlyItsBradley), who stoked the fires overnight by sharing <a href="https://xcancel.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1987644108765380813">an AI-generated mock-up of what he says the new Steam Controller will look like</a>. Notably, the haptic thumbpads have moved towards the bottom of the controller whereas they used to be towards the top. Lynch claims there's full finger-tracking in the grips, and that the controller can detect how far away your hands are from the handles.</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The new Steam Controller will look like this when it launches</p><p>Im told that it can also detect how far your hands are from the handles using a simple capsense feature</p><p>Similar to the index controllers, but not full finger tracking in the grips <a href="https://t.co/loIqpJb0YZ">pic.twitter.com/loIqpJb0YZ</a></p></div>— Brad Lynch (@SadlyItsBradley) <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1987644108765380813?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2025</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>"Yes. It's an AI slop photo," wrote Lynch on X. "Trained on a real image of the new controller. It was just fast and easy to do it this way. I was not going to post the original one just in case it reveals any sensitive info from the source."</p><p>It's also Lynch who suggested a reveal date of 12th November, according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ValveDeckard/comments/1oqwwla/steam_framedeckard_everything_we_know_so_far/">a coherent round-up of Valve hardware rumours on Reddit</a>. As you can see from that post, the bulk of the other patent-related rumours revolve around a new VR headset, which is believed to be codenamed Deckard - although it's also sometimes referred to as Steam Frame. That name - Steam Frame - may also refer to a new operating system developed for the device. The information suggests we're about to see another high-end VR headset priced at around the $1200 mark, possibly more.</p>
<p>The console rumours, meanwhile, revolve around something codenamed Valve Fremont, a games-capable box that features custom AMD processors and a Radeon graphics card. Again, the rumours originate from <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1957931577444561350">Brad Lynch, who highlighted the device's appearance on cross-platform benchmarking site Geekbench</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Valve has made considerable in-roads into the enthusiast-level games hardware space with the HTC Vive, a VR headset, and the more recent handheld device, Steam Deck. The attraction of a console-like device built to take advantage of Steam's enormous gaming catalogue will be strong indeed. I wonder, if it's true, how much it will cost.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-q7-max-is-going-for-pennies-now-the-cheapest-vacuum-and-mop-from-the-prestigious-brand-2000642382</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-q7-max-is-going-for-pennies-now-the-cheapest-vacuum-and-mop-from-the-prestigious-brand.1348660/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Keeping the floors clean with pets constantly shedding or kids bringing in dirt is a never-ending chore that consumes precious free time. The <strong>Roborock Q7 Max+</strong> tackles this daily struggle head-on, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/">and it’s currently hitting an all-time low of just $219 on Amazon, slashed from its original $429 price</a>. This is the most affordable entry point into Roborock’s premium robot vacuum lineup and it <strong>still includes the self-emptying docking station</strong> that higher-end models boast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Premium Features at an Entry-Level Price</h2>
<p>The<strong> 10,000Pa HyperForce suction power</strong> puts this vacuum in serious performance territory, generating enough force to pull embedded pet hair from carpet fibers and lift stubborn debris from hard floors in a single pass. That suction strength matters greatly when you have to deal with the fine dust that settles into textured surfaces or the heavier particles that accumulate along baseboards and in corners. The<strong> edge-cleaning design</strong> ensures the vacuum captures debris right up to walls and furniture legs, eliminating those frustrating dust lines that cheaper robots leave behind.</p>



<p>The<strong> dual anti-tangle system</strong> solves one of the most frustrating problems with robot vacuums: the constant need to stop and cut hair wrapped around brushes. The main brush on the <em>JawScraper</em> features a design that actively resists hair entanglement, while the side brush boasts a 0% hair-tangling rate even with long-haired pets or family members who shed constantly. This engineering improvement translates into fewer maintenance interruptions and more consistent cleaning performance. You can go several weeks without having to flip the robot over and go through the annoying process of cutting hair free from brush rollers.</p>



<p>Th<strong>e RockDock Plus self-emptying station elevates this vacuum from a good deal to an exceptional one</strong>. With a 2.7-liter sealed dust bag that holds up to seven weeks of dirt, pet hair, and other debris, you empty the system roughly twice a quarter, not after every cleaning session. The sealed bag does not allow dust to escape when finally needing to replace the bag so allergy sufferers are protected from the collected allergens being reintroduced into the air.</p>
<p>The integrated vacuum and mopping function covers the complete floor cleaning equation in one device: After it vacuums up dry debris, <strong>the mop functionality follows through with the ability to take on stuck-on spills and paw prints</strong>. Three adjustable water flow settings let you adjust the amount of moisture based on your floor type and just how dirty they’ve gotten-from light dampening during daily maintenance to heavier flow for deeper cleaning sessions.</p>
<p>LiDAR navigation accurately maps your home which is a far cry from what can be achieved with budget robots relying on simple bump sensors. The laser-based mapping creates a detailed floor plan that the robot then uses to calculate the most efficient cleaning path, covering every accessible area without redundant passes or missed spots. Real-time mapping updates when the robot discovers new obstacles or you have rearranged furniture, thus adapting to the changes in your home layout automatically.</p>
<p>For $219, this Roborock Q7 Max+ brings flagship features to midrange pricing and opens premium automated cleaning to households that may otherwise find these systems too expensive.</p>

              <p><span>Sony has announced its next State of Play showcase, spotlighting upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pc-cross-buy-leak-sony-handheld-ps6-2000641324"><span>PlayStation 5 games</span></a><span>. However, this one will be a little bit different when it premieres tomorrow, as it will specifically highlight games from Japanese developers, and thus will only be streamed in Japanese with English subtitles.</span></p>

 <p><span>The State of Play Japan stream will take place tomorrow, November 11, at 2 p.m. PT /&nbsp; 5 p.m. ET /&nbsp; 11 p.m. CEST, and will be hosted by Japanese voice actor Yuki Kaji, known for his roles in the </span><i><span>Ys</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><span>series overseas. According to a post on the </span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/10/state-of-play-japan-airs-this-tuesday-november-11/"><span>PlayStation Blog</span></a><span>, the 40-minute show will focus on games from developers in Japan, as well as Asian studios more broadly, and will have a spread of both “beloved series” and independent projects. Sometimes, when companies put on streams like a State of Play or a Nintendo Direct, Japan will get a different version than the one we see in English-speaking territories, but it sounds like this show will be the same across Japanese and English streams. The show will be featured on PlayStation’s YouTube channel.</span></p>

 <p><span>The blog doesn’t get into any specifics about what games will be shown, but Kaji hosting does make me wonder if we might hear more about the next </span><i><span>Ys</span></i><span> game. </span><i><span>Ys X: Proud Nordics</span></i><span>, an enhanced port of the original </span><i><span>Ys X</span></i><span>, was released earlier this year on Switch 2, so perhaps it might come to the PS5 when it launches in English next year. Or maybe a new </span><i><span>Ys </span></i><span>could be on its way? But that’s just me speculating.</span></p> <p><span>Unfortunately, based on the show’s premise, we might not hear much from PlayStation’s internal studios because most of its first-party dev teams are based outside of Japan these days ever since Sony shuttered Japan Studio. Team Asobi operates out of Tokyo, but given that it just launched </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><i><span>Astro Bot</span></i></a><span> last year, it’s probably too early for that team to deliver anything.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-could-announce-its-new-vr-headset-this-week.1348651/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Steam could be getting ready to reveal the first details of its new VR headset. According to known Valve insider Brad Lynch, the company could be ready to announce its new device, expected to be called the Steam Frame, sometime this week.</p>



<p>He’s even been told a specific day to keep an eye on.</p>



<p><strong>“I’m just going to flat out say it,”</strong> Lynch said in his Discord. <strong>“I was told by a few sources, across a few weeks, to keep an eye out for this week. More specifically on Wednesday.”</strong></p>



<p>He added that it <strong>“doesn’t seem to be out of the question”</strong> for Valve to announce the device. Lynch says that he feels the company will <strong>“need a week or two to explain the device to people before opening orders anyway.”</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Valve for comment on these claims.</p>



<p>Rumors and reports about the new Steam VR headset have been out for months. Earlier this year, it was claimed that the plan was for Valve to release the headset <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-vr-headset-1200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the end of 2025</a> with a price of $1,200. In September, the likely name for the device was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steams-new-vr-headset-might-have-a-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered via a trademark filing</a> and datamining. Finally, in early October, it was reported that the Steam Frame had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valves-next-steamvr-headset-has-reportedly-entered-mass-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entered mass production</a> with initial production plans to call for 400,000-600,000 units. </p>



<p>Of the mass production claims, Lynch said that the SteamVR Beta included Deckard, the device’s codename, DV1 and DV2 models. He said that <strong>“DV units are the final stages before the model (PV) that consumers will buy.”</strong></p>



<p>The Steam Frame is expected to launch alongside the new “Roy” controllers for the device as well. But that’s not all. Steam is reportedly working on a new Steam Controller 2 and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-fremont-steam-console-appears-on-geekbench/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new SteamOS console</a> of some sort.</p>
