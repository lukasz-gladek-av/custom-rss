		<p>We all have our favourite genres, but I’m not sure how many people would put tower defence at the top of their tier list. Those people are, of course, wrong, as tower defence games are often the perfect, brain-massaging mix of action, puzzling and sitting back to watch the carnage play out. And, they make you feel smart. So, we were definitely excited to catch the announcement for Atlanta TD, a brand new tower defence game coming to Steam Early Access in 2026. It helps, that this is one of the most beautiful tower defence games we’ve ever seen. </p>
<p><iframe title="Atlanta TD is coming..." width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GfsGozFytTI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p>


<p>Atlanta TD has some serious 80s anime vibes going on, tying stunning pixel art to an art direction that pulls thematically from series like The Lost City of Gold and Ulysses 31. That immediately puts it straight to the top of my wishlist, but when you read into the storyline and setup, this is really a game that’s doing something a bit different.</p>
<p>Atlanta TD is a procedurally generated roguelite tower defence game set in Atlanta, where the Gods of Olympus must defend their home against the oncoming hordes of Ares’ armies. With Zeus fallen and the Four Spectacular Realms seemingly defenceless, you must call upon the remaining Gods to protect the city of Atlanta.</p>
<p>“While I was at university, I always had this idea to make a pixel art tower defence game – but outside of that idea, I could never really nail down the Unique Selling Point.” Shared lead developer Jake Meyer. “Shortly after graduating, I started a YouTube channel around game development which got a fair bit of attention – and while looking for a job, I thought I could start this project, release it within a year and document the entire process on YouTube – 3 years on, I think it’s safe to say how that turned out.</p>


<p>“I worked on this project in my spare time over a year and a half – building the idea, the design and the lore of Atlanta – before pitching it to Tin Man Games, who were in a transitional period from their previous project, and was extremely fortunate to have been able to work on it with them since then. We now have had an amazing team who have contributed to it to produce something bigger than I ever could have imagined – and seeing it get to this stage and feel so real is the most incredible feeling, and I am so excited for people to be able to play it!”</p>
<p>Atlanta TD is launching on Steam Early Access in 2026. For more information, you can follow Tin Man Games on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thetinminions.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> and Facebook, as well as joining the offical <a href="https://discord.com/invite/deTfTTmZna">Tin Man Games Discord server</a>.</p>

			<p>The <strong>depth of the combat system</strong> has always been the signature of the <em>Nioh</em> experience, and this is no different in Nioh 3. With the addition of a second fighting style, Ninja Style, <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/enter-the-dojo-mastering-nioh-3-combat-and-arts-proficiency-flow/"><strong>combat is now deeper than ever</strong></a>, featuring so many <strong>unique techniques</strong> that let players play the way they want without penalty.</p>



<p>While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">there's no real "correct" way to play the game</strong>, it's undeniable that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">some <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/enter-the-dojo-dont-waste-skill-points-in-nioh-3-the-essential-samurai-and-ninja-martial-arts/">Martial Arts</a> and Skills are more useful than others</strong>. Among the Skills you can equip, however, there is one called <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The More the Merrier</strong> that can take<strong> your gameplay to the next level</strong>, no matter which fighting style you prefer to use.</p>



<p><strong>Welcome to the Dojo</strong>: here's why<strong> The More the Merrier is a game-changing skill in <em>Nioh 3</em>.</strong></p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-what-does-the-more-the-merrier-do" data-level="2">What Does The More the Merrier Do?</a></li><li><a href="#h-where-to-find-the-more-the-merrier" data-level="2">Where to Find The More the Merrier?</a></li><li><a href="#h-why-is-the-more-the-merrier-an-essential-skill" data-level="2">Why is The More the Merrier An Essential Skill?</a></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-what-does-the-more-the-merrier-do">What Does The More the Merrier Do?</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-The-More-the-Merrier-Skill-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The More the Merrier has a lot of different uses that can take your gameplay to the next level</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The More the Merrier is a Common Skill</strong> costing 4 skill points to equip with a very straightforward function. It allows you to <strong>cancel your actions and allows you to use Summoning Seals, </strong>the special Talismans you get to summon Yokai by equipping any Soul Core to the Yang position in your Onmyo Box.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-the-more-the-merrier">Where to Find The More the Merrier?</h2>

<p><strong>The More the Merrier can be found</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">relatively soon</strong> during your first playthrough. Its skill manual can be found on a corpse in the <strong>Futama region</strong> in the <strong>Warring States map</strong>, to the north of the Master of the region.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-the-more-the-merrier-an-essential-skill">Why is The More the Merrier An Essential Skill?</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Combat-Summon-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The More the Merrier can make Summoning Seals a lot more useful</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the function of The More the Merrier skill may not look like much on paper, possibly only speeding up Summoning Seals execution, the skill opens up a lot of incredible combat options in <em>Nioh 3</em>.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Animation Canceling:</strong> Use Summoning Seals to cancel <strong>any</strong> attack animation in both Samurai and Ninja Style. This makes high-commitment Martial Arts with long recovery times, such as the Odachi’s <em>Thunderbolt</em> or the Cestus’ <em>Limitless</em>, much safer and more viable.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Stagger &amp; Pressure:</strong> If an enemy is out of Ki or blocking, the summon will keep them staggered in place. This allows you to safely continue your offense or recover your own Ki for a follow-up.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Defensive Repositioning:</strong> If you misread an enemy’s timing, you can cancel your attack into a summon. Because you can walk in any direction during the summoning animation, you can avoid incoming attacks or recover quickly enough to guard, deflect, or dodge.</li>
</ul>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Summoning-Seals-loadout-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The More the Merrier skill allows you to take advantage of all sorts of Summoning Seals in creative ways</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Strategic Loadouts:</strong> Since Summoning Seals are limited and replenish at Shrines, you can customize your approach via the Onmyo Box:</p>



<ul>
<li>Equip cores in the <strong>Yang position</strong> that grant more total seals to cancel animations more frequently.</li>



<li>Equip the most powerful seals to take advantage of any Soul Core Passive Skill as a last resort to unleash massive combos on enemies with depleted Ki.</li>
</ul>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Skeleton-Warriors-Summoning-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Using Summon Seals with The More the Merrier skill makes it easy to pin down enemies out of Ki for some devastating combos</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Personal Recommendation:</strong> Using the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Scampuss</strong> or <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Skeleton Warrior</strong> cores is highly effective. Their seals deal damage multiple times quickly, keeping the enemy locked in place while you recover Ki to restart your Martial Arts sequence.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New Black Myth: Zhong Kui is an in-engine video where the devs have literally and figuratively cooked. </p>



<p>The next title for the highly popular series by Game Science, Black Myth: Zhong Kui, was revealed during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-zhongkui-revealed-at-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025’s Opening Night Live</a>. The title is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-black-myth-zhong-kui-a-sequel-to-black-myth-wukong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not a direct sequel</a> to the series, but shares &nbsp;“the same foundation of ancient Chinese myth and folklore.” Now, a new in-engine video shows what the game could look like. </p>







<h2 id="h-black-myth-zhong-kui-video-goes-full-masterchef-with-monster-ingredients">Black Myth: Zhong Kui Video Goes Full MasterChef with Monster Ingredients</h2>



<p>The latest video for Black Myth: Zhong Kui is a 6-minute in-engine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2tW6ewI5ls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">special</a> created for the Chinese New Year, specifically celebrating the Year of the Horse. The video begins like a typical cooking show, showcasing the character chopping and preparing various ingredients. It starts with the featured character filleting a fish, setting the tone for the cooking theme.</p>



<p>Everything appears normal at first, but then we begin to notice monsters lurking in the background. These creatures are actually assisting the chef. Some scenes in the video may be unsettling for those with a weak stomach, as we see the chef chopping up meat with eyeballs and plucking chives from a creature that resembles a sleeping baby.</p>



<p>The soup is finally prepared and served to a mysterious figure wearing a hood towards the end of the video. What’s exciting is the level of detail and realism displayed by the engine, particularly in how the character interacts with each ingredient. We already knew that Game Science had raised the bar since “Wukong,” but “Zhong Kui” appears to be advancing the series even further in terms of visuals.</p>

Those appearances set a "precedent" for Anran, Fareeha said, leaving her to now "mourn" the final in-game design made available to play in early access at the weekend. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There was an unspoken promise that said 'we're going to challenge the beauty standards that are plaguing and ransacking media these days'," Fareeha stated.

            <p>Remedy Entertainment, best known for narrative-rich single player games like Control and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, has got itself a new CEO. His name is Jean-Charles Gaudechon, a former EA executive and senior vice president of fantasy sports betting platform Sleeper.</p>
<p>While at EA, Gaudechon spent 2012-2013 as studio head and executive producer at EA's free-to-play studio, helping to direct live service development at the industry giant. He'd later return to the company after a stint away, concluding his EA career as vice president and group GM of EA Asia Studios.</p>
<p>Fast forward to March 2024, and he'd help found the "sports super app" Sleeper, on which users can draft fantasy sports teams and make "sleeper picks" (bets) on athletes performances, team performances, etc. He is now the CEO of Remedy, quite the stark shift indeed.</p>

<p>This news, <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/?publicationId=c86bbf74-7d56-4b1e-bc4d-56f406fc8258">announced on the Remedy investors website</a>, came alongside a statement by Remedy Chairman of the Board of Directors Henri Österlund. He wrote: "I am delighted to announce the appointment of Jean-Charles (JC) Gaudechon to lead Remedy into a phase of profitable growth. His proven history in growing gaming franchises and successfully leading international studios is an excellent fit to the current stage of Remedy's business. Under JC's leadership, we are well-positioned to significantly accelerate growth, guide Remedy towards greater independence through self-publishing, and deliver sustained value to our players, partners, and shareholders"</p><p>Gaudechon also added his own statement to investors, the wider company, and world as the new CEO: "I'm excited and honored to join Remedy at a pivotal time," Gaudechon wrote. "The studio has a unique creative identity and a strong pipeline. My commitment is to protect what makes it special, deliver exceptional games, and scale Remedy in a way that builds lasting value. Remedy has the voice and the ambition to be a pillar of the industry's future. We will stay close to players, earn their time and trust, and strengthen our independence in how we build and publish our games, while continuing to work closely with the partners who have supported us along the way. I will be moving to Finland with my family and I'm incredibly excited about getting to work directly with the team at the studio."</p>
<p>Who knows, perhaps Gaudechon will be some sort of fiscal Ted Lasso, coming in and keeping what's beloved about Remedy intact while bringing in that ever-elusive growth. It is no secret that Remedy Entertainment is indeed in need of more money. Alan Wake 2, while adored and critically acclaimed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-is-finally-profitable-over-a-year-after-release-says-remedy">didn't make a profit until well after its release</a>. Recently, its cooperative shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreaks-weak-sales-persist-despite-improved-player-and-sales-metrics-says-remedy-ceo">FBC Firebreak missed the mark to such a degree</a> that Remedy had to issue a profit warning to investors. It is perhaps little mystery that investors would welcome a growth-focused CEO into their arms.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dark Auction Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/10/dark-auction-review/</link>
            <guid>1430821</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>How many stories have you experienced in your lifetime? From picture books as a kid, to films, TV shows, novels, audiobooks, and videogames, do you have a rough number? Are we talking thousands? More? Well, let me tell you right now, amongst all those thousands upon thousands of stories you’ve experienced, you’ve never encountered a yarn quite like the tale that Dark Auction is telling.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dark Auction - Story, Mystery &amp; Bidding Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9181j4NedQk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Essentially a visual novel with some – very – slight gameplay elements, Dark Auction follows protagonist Noah Crawford on a seemingly simple task of retrieving his father from an auction. Rather ominously though, Noah discovers that this auction is taking place in a spooky European-like castle in the middle of a mist-soaked woodland. The items being auctioned? Well, they belonged to ‘Dictator X’, who, to all intents and purposes, is Hitler. Noah is soon trapped in the castle with a bunch of other veritable inmates. &nbsp;</p>


<p>Each of them is a genuinely engaging character, with a lot of depth to uncover and fascinating motivations behind their actions and behaviours. They all feel like fully rounded personalities that you’ll want to get to know. Which is a very good thing, as most of your time in the game will be spent conversing with your fellow auctioneers. </p>


<p>Anyway, soon Noah is strong-armed by men wearing Parrot masks – yep, not making this up – to do their bidding. Literally their bidding, as much of Dark Auction takes place within an auction house. These scenes play out akin to the trials in the Phoenix Wright series. It is up to Noah to spot the errors in a character’s memories – it’s via memories, rather than money, that people place their bids and unlock the artefact they desire – and then attempt to fill in the blanks. </p>
<p>Noah gathers the information he’ll need by slowing strolling around a handful of rooms, talking to NPC’s in an attempt to learn more about them, whilst adding ideas to his mental ‘word cloud’ – a handy mechanic that enables him to spot the inaccuracies during an auction testimony and provide the contradictory evidence. He does this not to attack the participants, but to support them, usually guiding them through a traumatic moment of their lives in the process.</p>

<p>If this all sounds like a bewildering hodgepodge of ideas, then that’s because, well, it is. Yet somehow all these disparate elements of the plot – Hitler, therapeutic auction sessions, parrot men, post-war Europe, trauma, heck, even time travel – meld together rather neatly. Offering a fresh, compelling and often rather tense narrative that will keep you clicking through reams of dialogue from beginning to end. Though with a story from the mind of Rika Suzuki – the writing talent behind Nintendo DS classics like the Another Code series and the superb noir-thriller Hotel Dusk: Room 215 – the fact that the narrative is uniquely brilliant is no real surprise.</p>
<p>Where Dark Auction struggles, then, is in its presentation. Visually, during the exploration phases, Dark Auction feels ancient. There are both 3D third-person and first-person elements, and these look and handle like one of the early Resident Evil remakes. Despite the simplicity, the frame rate on Nintendo Switch is lousy; character models are blocky and lack sufficient animation to give them any personality. The environments themselves are devoid of atmosphere and detail, often robbing the game of the tension that the scripted elements have worked so hard to build. </p>

<p>Outside of dialogue, far too much time is spent wandering into a room and being forced to look at every clue until the game allows you to leave again. It’s repetitive and feels like unnecessary padding, keeping you from getting to the good bit, such as the next surprising twist or informing reveal during an auction. The auctions themselves and the talking heads dialogue moments also benefit from losing the lousy 3D and going full 2D, all gorgeous character art and smooth flowing movements.</p>

<p>We don't have any details on what, exactly, will be playable in the event demo just yet, though we have to imagine that it'll mainly focus on getting to grips with our humanoid Ditto protagonist and its strange transforming abilities — watering crops with Squirtle, harvesting them with Scyther, breaking rocks with Hitmonchan, you know the drill.</p>

<p>The event runs all weekend from 13th-15th February at the ExCel London. Alongside these demos (and the competitive matches themselves, of course), the championship also sees the return of the Pokémon Center pop-up store, the Pokémon Play Lab, signings, cosplay competitions and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds producer has revealed that a new large-scale expansion is in development, matching the likes of Iceborne and Sunbreak expansions for previous games. </p>



<p>Since the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-4-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">title update 4</a>, we haven’t received many new details about the game. Last we heard was information through a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-datamine-reveals-graphics-presets-for-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">datamine</a>, which gave us an idea of the graphic preset details for the Switch 2. Now, the developers have arrived with a brand-new update, along with confirmation that a huge expansion is in the works. </p>







<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-new-expansion-confirmed">Monster Hunter Wilds New Expansion Confirmed</h2>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds producer Ryozo Tsujimoto spoke about the “large-scale expansion” at the end of the update 1.041’s reveal <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/2021026692781965533" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video</a>. Tsujimoto wanted to assure players that they have something big planned next for MHW, a new expansion is in development, matching the likes of MH Worlds’ Iceborne and MH Rise’s Subreak expansion. More details about this update are scheduled to arrive “this summer.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MHWilds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MHWilds</a> Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto shares a look at the update arriving on Feb 18, and what's ahead in the future.</p><p>⛓ Arch-tempered Arkveld<br>⭐ 10-star Arch-tempered monsters<br>🐱 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MHStories3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MHStories3</a> Special Collaboration<br>🍖 Design Contest Weapon &amp; Pendant<br>🎉 Anniversary Event + Event… <a href="https://t.co/MrqhiS2iAg">pic.twitter.com/MrqhiS2iAg</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/2021026692781965533?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Iceborne and Sunbreak are some of the biggest expansions in the series. Iceborne almost doubled the content for Monster Hunter World, adding new monsters, story, locales, and so much more. Sunbreak was massive as well, adding a new adventure, enemies, gameplay improvements, and more. So the one for MHW definitely has some work cut out for it, as it has to surpass some huge benchmarks. </p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-update-1-041-goes-live-on-february-18">Monster Hunter Wilds Update 1.041 Goes Live on February 18</h2>



<p>Along with the announcement for the expansion, the Monster Hunter Wilds producer also took us through the upcoming update. The highlights include the arrival of 10-star Arch-tempered Arkveld, quests for grabbing weapon designs that won in a contest, a collab side mission with Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection, extra side missions, and more.

            <p>The next 2D fighter from Arc System Works is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>. Published by Sony, it's also set to launch on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3787240/MARVEL_Tkon_Fighting_Souls/">Steam</a>, so we're not counting it as a true PS5 exclusive. That said, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-preview">it no doubt could become one of PlayStation's surprise hits</a> when it finally drops, and the final details are promising an adequate offering of modes and characters.</p>
<p>Though Steam has since scrubbed the description which likely went up early, social media accounts like <a href="https://x.com/Wario64">Wario64</a> screen-capped it all when someone, somewhere, hit the button early:</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>The 4v4 tag team fighter will seemingly have 20 characters at launch, which is below what many hoped for, but well above <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2xko-review">2XKO</a>'s disappointing initial roster, for example. For a more traditional fighter, I'd say 20 heroes and villains are more than fine - but since Marvel Tokon's whole thing is its 4v4 battles, team builds might get repetitive soon (at least until more Marvel icons start arriving).</p>
<p>On a more positive note, 64-player lobbies sound great and follow the recent trend of amping up the social element of these games outside of old-school matchmaking. Ask around and it's evident this is the type of feature which can elevate a fighter from niche to enduring mainstream heavyweight. It remains to be seen how many player-versus-players will be there at launch, but we might be off to a great start there.</p><p>As for the single-player portion, an Episode Mode will elaborate on the game's "lore" and team dynamics so it's not just a meet-up of Marvel characters duking it out. Personally, I'm not expecting a meaty story mode from it, but if it can rise above the utterly forgettable solo modes found in games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-king-of-fighters-xv-review">The King of Fighters XV</a>, that will be more than enough. In any case, let's hope the offline options go beyond a thin campaign and local versus. Not every fighter can be as offline-friendly as the Mortal Kombat series, but it'd be nice if developers pushed harder on that front.</p>
<p>These leaked details on Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls' launch offerings arrives right after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026-announced">PlayStation setting a 12th February State of Play stream</a>, so there's almost no doubt the game will have a slot there, probably locking a release date, too. We'll find out on Thursday.</p>

This was business as usual, of course, but it turns out that the update accidentally included some adjustments that Nintendo was hoping to release further down the line. <em>Whoops</em>.</p>
<p>As revealed in a new post on the <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/switch/software_support/av5ja/1101.html">Japanese Nintendo support page</a>, the 11.0.1 update mistakenly tweaked the bullet splash ink coverage of the Rapid Blaster weapons, while the Rapid Blaster Pro had its ink consumption increased by approximately 14%. It's minor balancing, sure, but Nintendo was hoping to keep it up its sleeve for a while longer.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Z3qjATCE2dk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytZ3qjATCE2dk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f12epjwqts&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>The company confirmed that the changes will remain in place for now, though they may be subject to further tweaks in the future.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonJP/status/2021089749130412388">X</a>, Nintendo confirmed that it's currently considering the contents of the next Splatoon 3 balance update, and it will reveal more information at a later date.</p>
<p>While the mistakenly-added adjustments can't be found in the 11.0.1 patch notes, you'll find everything else included in the latest batch of updates in our coverage below.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-l">2XKO</a>, Riot's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting spin-off</a>, is having its development team significantly cut back not long after release. <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team">Game Developer</a> report a Riot spokesperson as stating the publishers have put plans in motion to lay off around 80 developers on the game, about half of the global team who've been working on it, with the potential for some of the affected workers to land in new posts at Riot.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Riot's <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">official blog post</a> acknowledging the layoffs, attributed to 2XKO executive producer Tom Cannon, doesn't offer any numbers.</p>
<p>"After a lot of discussion and reflection, we are reducing the size of the 2XKO team," the post reads. "I want you to know that decision wasn’t made lightly. As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with 2XKO. The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term."</p>
<p>Cue words about a "smaller, focused team" needing to "dig in and make key improvements to the game" in order to give it "a more sustainable path forward". The post also makes clear that staff affected by the layoffs who aren't slotted into new positions at Riot will receive "a minimum of 6 months of notice pay and severance". "The people who helped ship 2XKO poured years of creativity, care, and belief into this game," Cannon added. "Taking creative risks like this is hard, and the work they did is real and meaningful."</p>
<p>Riot's plans for 2XKO's 2026 competitive events remain unchanged, for what it's worth.</p>
<p>Following some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/league-of-legends-fighting-spin-off-2xko-dangles-vi-in-front-of-fans-alongside-a-closed-beta">pre-release testing</a>, the fighting game which went by the codename Project L up until being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riots-fighting-game-project-l-finally-gets-a-name-but-not-a-good-one">christened 2XKO in 2024</a> finally released in early access late last year. A full release followed on January 20th, 21 days ago as I write this.</p><p>These 2XKO layoffs following two significant rounds of job cuts at Riot within the past couple of years. Around 530 workers were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-to-fire-around-530-people-and-shut-down-riot-forge-label-in-push-for-sustainability">jettisoned in March 2024</a>, with Riot shuttering their Forge publishing label, and a further 32 staff being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-lay-off-more-workers-for-the-second-time-in-a-year-and-add-evolving-to-our-big-list-of-nonsense-words-companies-use-to-describe-job-cuts">let go in October the same year</a>.</p>

            <p>Despite some missteps along the way and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-have-plummeted-lagging-behind-even-the-last-games-dlc-and-a-two-year-old-street-fighter-game">performance woes</a>, we maintain <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is a pretty good game. Complaints about difficulty and end-game content were addressed by Capcom in due course, but for anyone still a bit underwhelmed by the final offering, you only need to wait until the summer to see what's next.</p>
<p>Now, as we near the game's first anniversary, we've finally learned when we should expect to hear the first details about the traditional jumbo-sized expansion. Via an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526493182068786774">official blog post</a> (plus a video you can watch below), producer Ryozo Tsujimoto unveiled what's coming next to the game in time for the birthday celebrations plus the expected announcement window for the "large-scale expansion" that should shake things up:</p> <figure>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_NjU8O6qSQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>As teased before the end of 2025, free content updates are ending (for now). Though we believed the December update would mark the end of pre-expansion support for Wilds beyond the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-january-2026-performance-update-released">promised performance improvements</a>, a new major patch coming on 18th February is adding a bunch of 10-star Arch-tempered monsters to slay in permanent event quests, new weapon and pendant designs from a design contest held a while back, and a <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> collaboration.</p>
<p>Starting 18th February, a month-long anniversary event celebration of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> will bring seasonal festivities, a "special item pack", new event quests, and of course, all-new armour sets and cosmetics. That should be the end of new free content (though rotations of past events could happen) until the expansion is ready. Will it be as substantial as Iceborne or Sunbreak? We sure hope so.</p><p>"We look forward to sharing the first reveal of the expansion this summer," the shared video message promises, potentially pointing at one of the big summer showcases we tune into every year. Will that reveal come alongside an official announcement of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dataminers-think-theyve-discovered-even-more-proof-that-monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">rumoured port for Switch 2</a>? That seems like a solid bet, but it's also the kind of thing that could happen in any Nintendo Direct stream, so anything's possible.</p>

            <guid>1430749</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>To celebrate the <strong>Chinese New Year</strong>, which lands in exactly one week, game developer <strong>Game Science</strong> has released six minutes of in-game footage from the upcoming game <strong>Black Myth: Zhong Kui</strong>, a follow-up to the massively successful <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a></strong>. The content doesn't actually include anything that will be in the game itself; it's been crafted just for the celebration. However, it provides an early look at the visual upgrades that we'll see in the upcoming title.</p>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong quickly became a sensation after its launch in August 2024, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-hits-2-3-million-concurrent-players-at-steam-surpassing-cyberpunk-2077-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jumping to the second spot of Steam's all-time concurrent player chart</a>, where it still sits today. In September, <strong>it had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-sold-18-million-copies-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed 18 million units sold</a></strong>, and an expansion was supposed to be underway. However, the studio eventually ditched that plan in favor of fast-tracking a new game, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-science-announces-black-myth-zhong-kui-next-game-black-myth-series-gamescom-onl-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> a few months ago to be titled Black Myth: Zhong Kui.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Black Myth: Zhong Kui — 6 Min In-Engine Chinese New Year Special" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQ51gFl7kzk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That said, in an FAQ published on the <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a>, Game Science <strong>clarified that this isn't a direct sequel to Wukong</strong>:</p>



<p><em>Upon completing the journey with the Destined One, we now aspire to take a tentative first step to build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features, and to bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design. Zhong Kui came as a natural choice born of that aspiration and other contributing factors. We are confident that, in this new project, we can make refreshing changes, create new things, while taking a hard look at our past flaws and regrets.</em></p>



<p><em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui shares the same foundation of ancient Chinese myth and folklore. In terms of genre, it will remain a standard single-player ARPG, following the same business model as before. However, you won't be playing a monkey role this time. That said, we're still exploring and experimenting with the concrete differences between Wukong and Zhong Kui.</em></p>



<p>Black Myth: Zhong Kui is currently in development for PC and consoles. Given that Wukong is still relatively new, <strong>we may have to wait 3 to 4 years before we can play this new title</strong>. Indeed, the FAQ still says the developer hasn't even finished the outline yet. Best get ready for a long wait.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Remedy Announces New CEO, Says CONTROL Resonant’s Reception Was Excellent: “It’s Our Most Ambitious Game, We Want to Make It a Must-Have”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/remedy-new-ceo-control-resonant-most-ambitious-game/</link>
            <guid>1430740</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Finnish developer <strong>Remedy Entertainment</strong> announced its new CEO. As you may remember, the previous Chief Executive Officer, <strong>Tero Virtala</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-ceo-steps-down-after-9-years-following-fbc-firebreak-disaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left in late October</a> after nine years in the studio following the <strong>financial disaster</strong> that was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a></strong>. The game, Remedy's first online multiplayer release, utterly failed to deliver a fun, replayable experience, a basic requirement for any successful online multiplayer game.</p>



<p>The newly appointed CEO is <strong>Jean-Charles Gaudechon</strong>. He has over twenty years of experience in the industry, including senior leadership roles at <strong>CCP Games</strong> and <strong>Electronic Arts</strong>, although recently he was a Senior Vice President and General/Group Manager for sports app OneFootball and fantasy sports platform Sleeper.</p>



<p>Gaudechon shared a brief comment to comment the news:</p>



<p><em>I’m excited and honored to join Remedy at a pivotal time. The studio has a unique creative identity and a strong pipeline. My commitment is to protect what makes it special, deliver exceptional games, and scale Remedy in a way that builds lasting value. Remedy has the voice and the ambition to be a pillar of the industry’s future. We will stay close to players, earn their time and trust, and strengthen our independence in how we build and publish our games, while continuing to work closely with the partners who have supported us along the way. I will be moving to Finland with my family and I’m incredibly excited about getting to work directly with the team at the studio.</em></p>



<p>This morning, the developer posted its final quarter and full-year financial results, and they're quite positive. In Q4 2025, revenue increased by 46.3% to <strong>€17.0 million</strong> (compared to <strong>€11.7 million</strong> in Q4 2024), driven primarily by <strong>Alan Wake 2</strong> royalties and <strong>Control</strong> game sales. For the full year, revenue increased by 17.5% to <strong>€59.5 million</strong> (up from 2024's <strong>€50.7 million</strong>); operating profit was actually negative at <strong>-14.9 million</strong>, but that's only because of the non-cash impairment caused by the aforementioned FBC: Firebreak. Operating cash flow remained positive at <strong>€4.5 million</strong>.</p>



<p>Current interim CEO <strong>Markus Mäki</strong> (who will stay in the role until March 1, when Gaudechon officially takes over) clarified that Control sales <strong>reached 1 million in 2025 alone</strong>, most of which came after the announcement of the sequel, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/control-resonant-switches-protagonist-brings-the-action-in-open-ended-manhattan-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CONTROL Resonant</a></strong>, whose early reception was reportedly excellent:</p>



<p><em>Player and community sentiment has been very positive, indicated by engaged fans and positive wishlist numbers. <strong>Our goal is to make the game a 'must-have day-one purchase' for the fans of&nbsp;Control&nbsp;and the action role-playing genre</strong>. The announcement at The Game Awards in December was a great kickstart to the ambitious global marketing campaign we have planned for&nbsp;CONTROL Resonant.</em></p>



<p>As a reminder, CONTROL Resonant is slated to launch this year, though it has no specific launch window yet. </p>

<p>Now, following a rating for a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/surprise-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-has-been-rated"><strong>Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition</strong></a> last month, the series creator Michel Ancel has made some comments about a new project to <a href="https://www.magazinesdirect.com/uk/retro-gamer-subscription/dp/fe2efd7d">Retro Gamer Magazine</a>, which would apparently see the return of the first Rayman game.</p>
<p>Here's what he had to say, as highlighted by GamesRadar+ and some Rayman fans on social media:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I think there's a kind of remake planned. I don't remember when specifically, but it will be in HD and I think Ubisoft is adding a few more checkpoints and things like that just to make it a bit less frustrating. I think it's a nice move, because that's the only point that could be a problem for non-skilled players. But yeah, I think it's still a very nice game."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytJEHFv10kUS0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6uhmtrj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>So, it really does look like this supposed revival is based on the first 2D Rayman game, which originally launched on the PlayStation in 1995. As our <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/rumoured-rayman-ps5-remaster-is-real-says-series-creator">colleagues at Push Square</a> further note, it <em>sounds</em> "like an enhanced remaster" timed with the original game's 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>This follows <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/">reports from last September</a> about a Rayman Remake being in development. Of course, we don't have an official confirmation just yet, but the evidence is mounting.</p>

<p>There have been a bunch of demos released following last week's Partner Showcase, and one of them was for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/monster_hunter_rise">Monster Hunter</a> spin-off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/yKHAcYtToz8">YouTube channel 'ElAnalistaDeBits'</a> has now shared a side-by-side of this demo to showcase how the Switch 2 performance and resolution compares to the Xbox Series S and PlayStation 5 versions. The resolution is the lowest on the hybrid platform, and the uncapped frame rate hovers around 30fps.</p>
<p>The same video notes how the Switch 2 version shows "greater stability than the Xbox Series S version in docked mode" but in "portable mode it can fall below 30fps more often".</p>

<p>Keep in mind, this demo may not necessarily be 100% reflective of the final release in terms of the game's graphics, performance and gameplay, and is subject to change.</p>
<p>Once again, the Switch 2 trial demo for Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is available to download right now from the eShop. Capcom has also confirmed you'll be able to transfer your save data to the full game when it arrives on <strong>13th March 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>We should also have our own preview of this title up on Nintendo Life soon, so be on the lookout for that!</p>

<p>But will it translate to sales?</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="77fee97d0cb5e"><a title="Pragmata" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/77fee97d0cb5e/pragmata.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last week, Capcom <em>finally</em> released the demo for its new IP <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> on the Switch 2, allowing users to shoot and hack "on-the-go" or on the big screen at home.</p>
<p>Now, following this particular version of the sci-fi action-adventure trial rolling out on the eShop, the "combined downloads" of the "Sketchbook demo" across all platforms have officially hit the one million mark. Capcom has issued a small "thank you" notice to players today via social media.</p>
<p>Whether the demo's success will translate to actual sales is obviously not clear just yet, as we're still a few months from launch, but if you want to show your support for this upcoming release, you can pre-order it now on the eShop.</p>
<p>We've also gone hands on with this title recently and are thinking it could end up being one of the biggest surprises of the year. Here's what Nintendo Life staff writer Ollie Reynolds had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All eyes are on Resident Evil Requiem for this year, but Pragmata definitely has the potential to be something really special come 24h April 2026. Unlike Kunitsu-Gami, it feels like Capcom is making a real solid attempt to create its next big IP here, and while it certainly still has much to prove – I didn’t get a whole lot of narrative context during the demo, for example – its gameplay has done more than enough to bump it up to the top tier of my ever-growing wish list."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's a new week, and it means Nintendo has updated its mobile music application with another video game soundtrack. This time, it's the album from the 2020 Switch release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_origami_king">Paper Mario: The Origami King</a>.</p>
<p>According to the app, <strong>263 tracks</strong> have been added and there's a runtime of more than 11 hours! Nintendo notes how the tracklist includes songs such as "Red Streamer Battle, Autumn Mountain, and more". It joins the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> GameCube album, which is already available on the app.</p>
<p>Origami King had a whole host of composers including Shoh Murakami, Yoshiaki Kimura, Hiroki Morishita and Fumihiro Isobe, and it was led by Yoshito Sekigawa (who helped compose the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Thousand-Year Door</a> GameCube title and has also worked on multiple other <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/paper_mario_color_splash">Paper Mario</a> games since then).</p>

<p>To access this album update on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app, you'll need to have an active (and paid) Switch Online membership. You can find out more about the weekly Nintendo Music updates and this particular Paper Mario game in our existing coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>If you haven't already played this entry, we gave it eight out of ten stars, calling it one of the funniest games in the series:</p>

      <p>Back in 2019 Riot announced a fighting game called <em>Project L</em>, which would later be renamed <em>2XKO</em>. Released into early access on PC in late 2025, it hit consoles in January 2026.</p><p>We should note the game was only <em>announced </em>in 2019; it had been in development much, much longer, as<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/what-s-the-real-reason-games-are-taking-longer-to-make-?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>a Game Developer story from September 2025 reports</u></a>. That piece, which interviews Riot Games senior game producer Patrick Miller, says the "nearly" ten years of work (by September 2025) put into <em>2XKO </em>"was vital to make sure the game isn't KO'd in round one", that "it takes a lot of time and effort to unpack the 30+ years of lessons that the veteran [fighting game] studios have learned", and that "I often remind my teammates that it took seven Tekken games (and two Tekken Tag games) to get to <em>Tekken 8</em>."&nbsp;</p><p>Today, just three weeks after the game was released on console,<a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Riot announced</u></a> that<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky"> <u>"roughly" <em>80 </em>members</u></a> of the development team are being let go because, in Riot's words, "the game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term."</p><p><strong>UPDATE 9:30pm ET</strong>: <em>Miller posted earlier today on social media that he was one of the affected.</em></p><p>While work on the game will continue, the layoffs and statement make clear that whatever "passionate core audience" the game has found, it's nowhere the size Riot leadership were hoping for or expecting, which is weird considering they supported development for a decade to make sure the game wasn't "KO'd in round one", only to throw in 80 towels before it has even been out (formally at least) for a <em>month</em>.</p><p>Riot says the affected developers can either find work elsewhere within Riot or, if that's not possible, will be given "a minimum of 6 months of notice pay and severance".</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-champions">Pokémon</a> banks an insane amount every year, so it can afford to splash some cash from time to time.

<p>As <a href="https://screenrant.com/pokemon-super-bowl-commercial-budget-compared-games/">noted by ScreenRant</a>, this likely doesn't even factor in the "price of the ad itself, filming, and animating the Pokémon".

<p>While this amount of coin might not seem like a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/30/super-bowl-ad-prediction-market-contracts.html">big deal in the context of the Super Bowl</a> (or modern marketing budgets), this estimate has led to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1qzur3b/it_just_hit_me_that_the_cost_to_air_the_super/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemons-super-bowl-commercial-was-probably-expensive-unsurprisingly">speculation and debate</a> about how much this single ad spot might cost compared to the development costs of the mainline video game entries. Although, as mentioned by the source, these same comparisons are based on "unconfirmed leaks for the budget" of the latest game.</p>
<p>But hey, keep in mind, Pokémon seemingly remains out in front as the <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/56337-the-world-s-highest-grossing-media-franchises-revealed">highest-grossing media franchise of all-time</a>, with the series transcending the video games. And this is the 30th anniversary we're talking about here, so it's not necessarily a surprise to see The Pokémon Company spending big on the brand.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company has already announced it will be celebrating this milestone anniversary in many different ways, including the release of a brand-new LEGO line later this month. Heck, TIME Magazine is even releasing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/time-magazine-reveals-special-edition-pokemon-30th-anniversary-covers">a special trio of Pokémon covers</a>, and we're sure we'll see some exciting announcements on Pokémon Day this year.</p>
