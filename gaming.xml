            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/painkiller-revival-fall-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and developer Anshar Studios have announced a revival of the classic FPS&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, and it's coming to PC and current-gen consoles sometime this fall.</p>

<p>The two studios describe&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>as "an intense new spin on the classic action-shooter" that you can experience either solo or in co-op play. According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>will support "online co-op for up to three players", which is a little odd given that it has four playable characters.</p>

<p>In any case, the game is promising "gruesomely detailed gothic environments" and the chance to "blast your way through hordes of demons and titanic terrors", so it sounds very much like Saber and Anshar are hoping to give Bethesda's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marty-stratton-dark-ages-like-nothing-players-have-had-their-hands-on-in-doom-game" rel="nofollow">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>&nbsp;</em>a run for its money.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/painkiller-revival-pistol.jpg?itok=VeV-bHOr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/painkiller-revival-pistol.jpg?itok=drZT-ZK2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>is back. Rejoice.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will boast an emphasis on traversal, promising the ability to "jump, dash and hook" across each stage while engaging in "bloody, fast-paced combat". You can also look forward to a host of new weapons, as well as the return of some of the original's classic arsenal.</p>

<p>Four playable characters will be available: Ink, Void, Sol, and Roch. They'll each have "unique perks" you can take advantage of, and your abilities are upgradeable via the use of signature&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>tarot cards as well.</p>

<p>It sounds as though those extra characters will be crucial to&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, too, since the game will replace your co-op buddies with bots if you're playing on your own.</p>

<p>All of this will, according to Saber and Anshar, be set to a "powerful metal soundtrack". There's no other genre suitable for this kind of thing, really, but if Judas Priest's "Painkiller" doesn't feature in this game, I will be very disappointed indeed.</p>




<p>Saber and Anshar's&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>reboot comes to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300120/Painkiller/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013491" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/p/9NMSW622HWNH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> in the fall. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-interview-with-producer-hisashi-fujii-setting-village-building-romance-and-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a title="Companies > Gematsu" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/gematsu">Gematsu</a> recently had the opportunity to sit down with <em><a title="Games > Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a></em> producer Hisashi Fujii ahead of the game’s launch in May to discuss what players can expect in the Eastern-inspired entry in the farming <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,537 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPG</a> franchise. <span id="more-950904"></span></p><p>Get the full interview below.</p><p><strong><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> has a noticeably different tone and setting compared to previous <em><a title="Series > Rune Factory [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/rune-factory">Rune Factory</a></em> games. What inspired the shift to a more Eastern-inspired world?</strong></p><p><strong>Hisashi Fujii, Producer:</strong> “As you know, up until now the <em>Rune Factory</em> series was set on a Western continent. And previously in the series there have been several references to the Eastern country, and several characters from the Eastern country who would make appearances in the games. One of the reasons we set <em>Guardians of Azuma</em> in this Eastern country is to have a new approach to the series outside of the numbered titles—basically to try a new approach and new gameplay elements that we wouldn’t necessarily do in the numbered titles. So that’s the main reason why we decided to set <em>Guardians of Azuma</em> in the Eastern country of Azuma.”</p><p><strong>With this game, you are introducing the concept of the Earth Dancer. How did the idea of using dance as a combat and purification mechanic come about?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “With the move to the Eastern country as the setting, we wanted to emphasize the Japanese-ness of the world—the ‘Wa.’ And part of that was introducing a traditional Japanese dance style into the gameplay, so that includes the <a title="Genres > Action [2,588 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> and other parts of the gameplay as you mentioned. That was the main impetus for the focus on dance in this title.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>The village rebuilding system is something entirely new for&nbsp;<em>Guardians of Azuma</em>. Can you talk a bit about that—how large it is, what types of building features players can expect?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “There are four villages in the game based around the four seasons, and in each village there’s an area that you can completely and freely edit using the village building system. And the areas actually differ depending on the village. So the Autumn Village has the largest area, and we think that players will actually have difficulty potentially even filling it in—it’s so massive. This gameplay feature itself is something that’s fairly new to the series—it’s really never been done before. And one of the ways it changes the gameplay is that, by revitalizing the villages over the course of the game, you’ll attract more villagers to come to the villages. And those villagers can be assigned tasks in the edit area, such as farming or collecting lumber. And so in some ways the player basically no longer has to do that kind of work if they don’t want to, which can change the gameplay cycle if that’s not where you’re focusing as a player.”</p><p><strong>Do different setups offer different benefits or change the way NPCs interact, or does customization mostly fall into the category of aesthetics?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “Basically, the choices that the player makes in the village building area, depending on what they place down—such as buildings or decorations—can impact their basic stats. So if you place a certain building, you may get a certain stat increase. There are still the typical stats that have been in the series up until now—things like HP, Rune Points, strength, and magic attack—and the choices that the player makes when customizing their village can be used to essentially level up these parameters.”</p><p><strong>Are the villages different in terms of gameplay? Do they have their own farming mechanics, enemies, and event types?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “As I mentioned, there are the four seasonal villages. Each village has plants that you can grow that are characteristic of that village. So if it’s the Spring Village, spring plants and spring flowers are more suited to growth in that village. And of course the enemies outside of each village are also themed around the villages, so they do differ depending on which village you’re in. In terms of gameplay differences, there are certain objects that you can place in the village building mode that will only have an effect on the player—like a positive effect—if they’re placed in a certain village. If you place something in the Winter Village, it will give you a specific effect that you wouldn’t get by placing it in the Spring Village. Finally, each village has its own seasonally themed special festivals that you can hold.”</p><p><strong>The Blight appears to be the main threat standing in the player’s way. Is it a persistent threat that players have to manage over time, or is it something tackled through progression?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “The Blight is something spread by the Black Dragon that appears in the game. And as it’s spread, it affects the earth, causing plants to wither and impacting the natural world. The player will receive what are known as Sacred <a title="Companies > Treasure [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/treasure">Treasure</a>s from the gods in the game, and those Sacred Treasures can be used to purify the Blight and remove it from the world. At the beginning of the game, they’ll only be able to get rid of certain kinds of Blight from the world. And then as they receive more Sacred Treasures, the kinds of Blight they can purify and how far they can progress in the game will expand.”</p><p><strong>Do Sacred Treasures only function as key items? Or do they work as traditional equipment that can be used during gameplay as well?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “Other than purifying the Blight, Sacred Treasures can be used in battle as well as in the farming gameplay as regular items. In battle, they replace what was previously the magic system. Basically, they can be used for very special attacks, depending on which one you’re using, as well as for very powerful attacks. When it comes to farming, they have different roles. For example, the Drum can be used to restore withered plants or encourage their growth. The Umbrella can be used to water plants, and to water a much wider range of space than would be normally possible. So they have a lot of benefits if you use them for farming.”</p><p><strong>Romance is always a core element of a <em>Rune Factory</em> game. Have there been any new mechanics or major changes to relationship building? </strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “Up until now, when you were trying to advance a romance with a character, pretty much all you could do was give them presents and say ‘Hi!’ to them every day. But in this game, we’ve added some new features to deepen those mechanics. You can choose conversation topics from a list of set topics, and different characters will respond differently to different topics. You can also invite them to do all sorts kinds of activities. And similarly, there are certain activities that will raise your affection level with some characters more than others. So there’s a lot more depth in the different kinds of interactions you can have with them this time.”</p><p><strong>Romance candidates can be recruited for battle. Can you talk a little bit about how that works? Does their combat effectiveness depend on how far into a relationship you are with them? And are you limited to just one romance candidate in battle?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “You have a bond level with each character in the game that’s developed as you talk to them more—typically as you grow closer to them. In battle, as the bond level increases, characters will learn new abilities and become more powerful as allies in battle, the closer you are with them. And being in battle with them also increases their bond level with you. So the more you battle with them, the higher their bond level will get, and the more skills they will learn. In total you can take up to six characters with you into battle, so you’re not limited if you’re dating one character, as that doesn’t mean you can’t bring the other romance candidates into battle. You can, again, recruit up to six—or seven if you’re including the player.”</p><p><strong>What does a post-marriage life look like? Does it unlock any special sorts of interactions or events?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “Once you marry, your spouse will come and live with you and there will be a rhythm to your life together. When you wake up each day, your spouse will have a bento ready for you and give it to you. And then, eventually, you will be able to have a child. So that’s pretty much the kind of main flow of the post-marriage life.”</p><p><strong>Before we go, which one aspect of the game are you most excited about players experiencing?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujii:</strong> “The main new feature of the game is village building, so I’m really excited to see what kinds of different villages players will make. Because they can make things that are totally different, so I’m just really looking forward to seeing what kinds of different villages are created in the game once it’s out!”</p><p><strong>Thank you so much for your time, Fujii-san!</strong></p><p><em>*Gematsu also asked for a status update on <em><a title="Games > Rune Factory 6 [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/rune-factory-6">Rune Factory 6</a></em>, which was <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2023/05/rune-factory-6-announced">announced</a> alongside <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> in 2023, as well as whether there are any plans to release <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> for PlayStation, Xbox, or <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,817 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> 2, but <a title="Companies > Marvelous [1,331 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/marvelous">Marvelous</a> was not able to provide any information beyond what has already been announced.</em></p><p><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> is due out for Switch and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,667 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2864560/Rune_Factory_Guardians_of_Azuma/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> on May 30. </p><p>View a new set of screenshots <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/gallery/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma/march-21-2025/">at the gallery</a>.</p><h2><span>Screenshots</span></h2><div id="carousel_951789"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In 1957 in North West England, the worst nuclear accident in UK history happened – the Windscale fire. If you’re not familiar, this was when a fire burned for three days in a nuclear military facility in the Lake District, spreading radioactive fallout across the UK and the rest of Europe. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/atomfall">Atomfall</a> is set in the wake of this disaster, inside a quarantine zone errected around the facility, where things are somehow even worse than they were in real life.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall - Pre-Launch Trailer | Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RL57lHE-xvI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game begins with you waking up in a bunker with no memory of who or where you are. Stepping out into the open you’re greeted by a view of the glorious Cumbrian countryside. Also the Atom Plant shrouded in a hazy purple glow and an out-of-place red telephone box that starts ringing as you come closer. Should you dare to pick it up, an unsettling and very mysterious voice comes down the line, telling you that “Oberon must die” and to go power up something called the Interchange.</p>


<p>A lot of Atomfall is like this; flummoxing, strange, and thoroughly endearing. It’s easy to draw comparisons to Fallout with the setting, and it’s remarkable how well that comparison can stick – it’s set in the early 60s after five years of quarantine, so any sci-fi robots are right out of the vision of futuristic tech from that era, and could fit right in with a Fallout or The Outer Worlds. Atomfall has its own identity, though, both with the setting and the gameplay.&nbsp;I’m actually from the North West of England and hearing accents local to me in this game was actually a little strange at first.</p>


<p>Being set in the Lake District also brings with it some stunning environments, as well. Sharing a game engine with Rebellion’s Sniper Elite series, the game can look great as you look out across the landscape, but it’s fair to say that character models, lighting and animation feel pretty dated – this game is also coming to last gen consoles. It’s nothing too egregious, but it is noticeable in comparison to the quality of the environments.</p>
<p>The main thing that sets Atomfall apart, though, is that the threat here isn’t just radiation and we’re not in a post-apocalyptic world. Sure, there’s radiation around, even some poison, and an occasional electric wire hanging from the ceiling that always manage to walk into, but the biggest threat here is actually an infection. Ominous blue-y purple clouds and growths have taken root in places around the quarantine zone, seemingly the cause of people hearing voices and of the blue-y purple zombies known as Ferals that you’ll find.</p>
<p>Atomfall leans in on this for a good part of the mystery running through the story, but there’s no getting away from the familiarity of the gameplay they present. Ferals are tough to kill, growths explode when you go near them, it hurts when you stand on infected floors, and an infection meter fills up when you’re in the gas. It’s all rather standard. The novelty of unwrapping the game’s mystery wears off a bit after fighting off the third wave of zombies. I’m still very much interested in getting there, I just wish there was a little less stuff in the way.</p>

<p>Even when facing against roving groups of bandits and druids, there’s a roughness to the combat that starts to wear on you. The survival game leanings mean that you’ll be crafting throwables, using your ammo supplies sparingly, and wanting to use stealth and melee as much as possible. When you do go toe-to-toe with someone, the lack of a block means you’ll almost inevitably take damage – that always feels like failure to me.</p>
<p>Enemies tend to be in groups when they’re patrolling the open world, some of which will have ranged weapons. Getting the drop on a group or using stealth is key, whether that’s trying to do a stealth takedown or going all in with thrown Molotovs and shotgun blasts. They’ll happily empty multiple magazines of ammo in your direction, given the chance, but in true survival game fashion, they will only ever have a few bullets on them when you loot their bodies.&nbsp;Ammunition is conspicuously scarce in this game and only through meticulously looting everything – sometimes whilst in the middle of combat – was I able to find enough to avoid melee combat. Thankfully the shooting itself feels good enough.</p>
<p>Another issue is that your inventory is very limited. Important items you need take up space in there, including quest items. A single bandage, which heals maybe a third of my health, takes up one of your twelve inventory slots and they don’t stack, so just healing supplies will always take up a big chunk of space. Atomic batteries, an essential item for powering up the Interchange, also take up slots, as do any pistols or small melee weapons, painkillers I’m saving for a tough fight, or anti-infection drugs. This is addition to carrying items to sell to traders as there is only a bartering system and no currency, means you’re constantly evaluating and dropping stuff, which feels like it really gets in the way. The most generous part of the inventory is having four slots for long guns and weapons, and you’ll need all of them for switching as you run through your ammo stocks. Crafting supplies are gathered separately, thankfully, though this is constrained in its own way to keep you from having too big a surplus.</p>

<p>The main driving force is really the desire to keep exploring the lore and background of the world and setting. The narrative is structured around finding and following leads, whether they come from talking to people or picking up scraps of paper and notes from around the environment. You’ve got maps of each area, but points of interest are only filled in as you find them, and you’ll often find clues that lead you to map coordinates, or have someone mark a spot for you to follow up on. You can also just merrily stumble your way into some discoveries, giving a freeform feel to some parts of how the game’s story unfolds, beyond picking dialogue options and deciding which faction you want to align with.</p>
<p>A lot of the game experience can be adjusted and tweaked in the granular difficulty settings. There’s a bunch of presets that can put the focus more on survival or narrative, when compared to the standard suggested difficulty, but within that there’s individual settings to tweak up and down if you want to really customise it to your tastes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s some bugs that give the game a few blemishes, though mostly of the amusing or slightly advantageous varity. I cleared out a whole station of soldiers by climbing into a cafeteria and shooting them as they took cover behind two pillars, only to clip through to the other side. I’ve also had other AI oddities with enemies that inexplicably lose interest in me, or struggle to get to me, and I once saw one of BARD robots just shooting at a wall for some reason. I wasn’t even behind that wall, so maybe it was a random swarm of rats that the AI could detect, but I couldn’t see? I also encountered a couple of frame rate drops in combat on PS5, one specifically when I shot a giant robot in its gas cylinders, with accompanying fire and explosions. A patch is coming for release to address some issues, but we’ve found some that weren’t noted in the patch notes we’ve seen.</p>

<p>There’s a few quirks and hang ups, but I’m enjoying Atomfall. The world, setting, and story have me very interested in seeing how it pans out, though there’s a little voice in the back of my mind that says I’ve seen these story themes many times before, so maybe the ending won’t be as novel or unique as it wants to be. I still don’t know just yet, but it’s been an enjoyable time so far. Keep an eye out for our finished review, once I’ve finished exploring the deepest, darkest parts of Cumbia.</p>

							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PlayStation 4 &amp; 5, Xbox One &amp; Series S/X</span>
						</p></div></div>			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/rebellions-atomfall-single-player-survival-action-game-is-out-on-march-27-2025/">Atomfall</a> is a game that came out of nowhere for me. I was browsing Steam a few weeks ago, having taken a little break after the gaming marathon of Civilization VII and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and there it was: a post-apocalyptic game set in Britain. Considering I'm from Britain and have been to where this is based—that being Windermere—and I love Metro, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Fallout, and other similar games, it was a no-brainer.</p>
<p>With people running around in masks, battering innocents to death with cricket bats, or using a shiv to watch the life bleed out of them as they mutter utter gibberish about returning to the soil before telling you to "fack off", Britain in 2025 is an interesting place. Then we get Atomfall, set in a fictional post-apocalyptic Britain following the Windscale disaster, not the current post-apocalyptic Britain hoping to recover from the incompetent Tory government only to have a new Tory Labour government, mercilessly taking from the poor and disabled while catering to their wealthy overlords.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Taking place inside a quarantine zone following a disaster at a nuclear power station, it's not an open world but a connection of multiple open areas, Metro: Exodus style. Rebellion has captured the feel of the North-West quite well, to the point where I have been on Google Maps to figure out the exact location it's set in; I blame the road sign to Kendal for doing this to me. In terms of the story, there is more than just the nuclear accident, including a government coverup surrounding the accident and how it links to Oberon - the code name for a government project, which I won't spoil more of - and the impact on the surrounding area the combination of these have had.</p>
<p>The direct impact you will see is the area's abandonment and how quickly it delved into chaos. There are five open zones in the core playable area; Wyndham Village is controlled by the Protocol (the army) and is generally friendly and accessible except in a few places. Three of the other zones are controlled by the Raiders, Druids and Protocol, respectively, but parts of the areas are completely off-limits, and if you are spotted, you will be attacked. The remaining area is The Interchange, where the secrets of Atomfall are primarily revealed.</p>
<p>You'll find yourself moving between these areas, following clues and tasks from NPCs in the area, aiming to escape. You don't know why you're there, but you know you don't want to be. The way you move between the different objectives you find is how Rebellion has tried to differentiate Atomfall from other games. Rather than a quest log, you have "leads". It's a distinction with at least a little difference, as you have a collection of the notes and conversations to do with a "lead", and you can read through these to figure out exactly where and what you should be doing next, and more often than not the clues are reasonably obvious. What is more interesting is that you can frequently find the objective of a quest - or lead - before you've even seen the start, depending on your proclivity to explore.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Through this and the interconnected maps, where shortcuts can be revealed to make your life easier, Atomfall rewards exploration in a way many larger games forget to do. I should clarify that even when doing a significant amount of exploration, as I have been, you'll find Atomfall may only take about twenty hours to complete. Now, there is replay value in the fact that you have various stories, many of which can collide and result in one being cut off early.</p>
<p>Two, for example, are scientists around at the start of everything. One is hiding in the village, infected, but working on a cure and weapon to stop the source. Another left has come back and has been imprisoned. If they work on both stories but tell the first where the second is, he kills her - spoiler warning. This cuts off one possible story on escaping the quarantine zone. I don't know exactly how many threads are in the game, but at least five lead towards an escape. Do they differ? I can't tell you; I am keen to find out.</p>
<p>If I have an issue with the leads system, there are a few where you can be left a little clueless about what you need to do. There are a few where you are more likely to stumble across the next step than intentionally find it. Also, as mentioned in the above example, a decision you make can result in a part of the story being completely cut off from you. I don't want to say "with no warning" because when you listen to the audio logs and read the notes surrounding the two characters, only a moron wouldn't be able to figure out the outcome. I said to myself "he's going to kill her", before I even gave him the location. Some people may argue you need it made a little too clear.</p>


<figure></figure>

<p>Outside of the exploration and story, Atomfall is still more than serviceable. Combat isn't too dissimilar to other titles. Melee and Ranged weapons will be found or picked up from the corpses of enemies, and you have a limited ammo capacity. When the respective skill is selected, I think the ammo capacity is expanded alongside the capacity of your materials used for crafting. Either way, it feels pretty balanced, mainly as you can only hold a limited number of items.</p>
<p>Often, I've found myself hoarding enough ammo to then go into one of the - I'll call them dungeons - when I get out of the other end, I'm low on ammo and even low on some crafting gear since I've been making Molotovs on the fly. I've rarely found myself in a position I can't get out of, one way or another, even if it's just trying to be stealthy to avoid people, then doing a runner. I want to say the options are limitless, but they never are. It's either fight, run, sneak, or a combination of two or more.</p>
<p>Combat feels quite responsive, though; I will certainly give it that. Aside from lobbing a Molotov Cocktail, the most valuable skill in your arsenal is the option to kick an enemy. If you unlock the ability that gives it a better stun and knockback, you become challenging to beat in close quarters. Some of the stronger enemies, the thralls, will eventually get to you, but it becomes instrumental in the areas you find them. Creating space to reload your shotgun, to pump some extra shells into their heads. Also, aim for the heads; it does the damage. Even better, though, get a good rifle, keep your distance, and go for the head.</p>
<p>Once you realise how useful it is, the crafting becomes quite essential. I didn't touch the crafting system for much of the game beyond creating random Molotovs or sticky bombs. However, since the materials don't use inventory space, strategic thinking becomes all the more critical. Why carry multiple bandages with you when you can craft some? Later, when you learn how to upgrade weapons, you need to. Improving their damage, range and aim is crucial to surviving the late-game events.</p>


<figure></figure>

<p>I won't argue that Atomfall will be the next Metro: Exodus or something like that. I don't think it is. Atomfall sits in the realms of the games that died out a while back but are in a resurgence. Your non-Triple-A games aren't budgeted to blow apart the biggest releases, but they can do well if they get it right. The original Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a similar title, and look at what happened with the sequel. Atomfall strikes me as a similar title, with a style designed to reach as broad an audience as possible.</p>
<p>That this is on last-gen systems is proof enough, though I have to say that when playing it on the PC, with settings to max, I have no issues with the visuals. I'd argue that the more colourful and less realistic style adds charm to Atomfall, and frankly, I would say it looks and plays better than any of Bethesda's post-apocalyptic output. Hell, even it's more space-faring production.</p>
<p>I've only encountered a small number of bugs while playing through Atomfall; a few characters have clipped into each other, and beating robot enemies is a chore once you realise you can break their paths by having them spot you, and then you disappear. Without fail, they never seem to be able to go back to their patrol. Also, the most glaring issue is that enemies cannot see you or shoot you through windows - I can't explain how or why, other than maybe Rebellion forgot windows are transparent and break when a bullet hits them.</p>
<p>If I have another criticism, the audio, specifically the voice acting, can also be off. I understand the army having a mixture of accents, but the residents and other locals of the area should sound like they're primarily from Cumbria. There's something just a little off, though the reality is that nobody outside of the North of England will ever notice. I can't say anything massive about the soundtrack, to be honest. It works as it doesn't stand out, but at the same time, it doesn't stand out. Other audio effects are generally strong; nothing stands out like it shouldn't be.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>As I've said, I can't honestly argue that Atomfall will be the next post-apocalyptic masterpiece. What I will say, though, is that it is a game I've had a fun and enjoyable time with. This is the sort of game you can pick up at a lower price-point (£45) than your traditional £60 "Triple-A" games, and you can have a good twenty-plus hours, or more, with it.</p>
<p>Atomfall looks good, plays well, and has a decent atmosphere. It has a reasonably interesting semi-open collection of maps to explore and the dungeons (for lack of a better word) that come with such a game. The combat doesn't feel janky, and the AI isn't terrible. It has an interesting story and tries something a little different with the quests system to enhance exploration. I hope this does well enough that we get the sequel treatment in the same vein as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a> because we could see the next leader of the post-apocalypse.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Atomfall is a thoroughly enjoyable game which looks and plays well, and offers a compelling narrative with surrounding exploration to keep you entertained. It's well-polished, offers good replay value, encourages you to do things a little different, and isn't bad on the eyes either, with a good design that allows it to both look good and support last-gen consoles. The score likely doesn't reflect the game as well as it should, as I would heartily recommend this to anybody, with the added advantage that it's coming to game pass.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-the-diver-like-dragon-dlc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mintrocket has announced the release date for its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>crossover, and the aptly-named&nbsp;<em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>is making its way to the cozy diving game-slash-restaurant sim next month.</p>

<p>As revealed by Mintrocket in a new Dev Dive video,&nbsp;<em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>is coming to&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>on April 10th. It'll be available across all platforms on which you can play the game, and it'll introduce everyone's favorite lovable goof Ichiban Kasuga to the Blue Hole.</p>

<p>This will be the latest in a long string of&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/big-dave-diver-collaboration-update-balatro" rel="nofollow">collaborations</a>; the game has also entertained the likes of fiendishly addictive roguelike&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, potion sim&nbsp;<em>Potion Craft</em>, and Shift Up's&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke</em>, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dave-the-diver-like-a-dragon-dlc-ichiban.jpg?itok=Cik3khLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dave-the-diver-like-a-dragon-dlc-ichiban.jpg?itok=_T-5qCxc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>brings Ichiban Kasuga to the world of&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>in April.</figcaption></figure><p>In the new video,&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>director Jaeho Hwang and community manager Zoe Shin discuss how the collaboration with&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>came about, as well as what you can expect from the upcoming DLC.</p>

<p>Rather sweetly, Hwang shows off some of the goodies he got when meeting longtime&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>producer Masayoshi Yokoyama at last year's Tokyo Games Show, including signed copies of&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth&nbsp;</em>and a Korean translation of the script for the first&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>As for the crossover DLC itself, it'll see Ichiban and the bartender of his hangout spot Survive visiting Dave and Bancho's restaurant. As you might expect, it's not peaceful for long, and soon, Ichiban finds himself drawn into yet another adventure.</p>

<p>You can look forward to a new side-scrolling beat-'em-up minigame, as well as&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon</em>'s signature karaoke and appearances from several other franchise favorites. Hwang says he "basically put everything [he likes] about&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>into this collaboration".</p>




<p>Unlike previous&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>crossovers,&nbsp;<em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>will be paid DLC, which Hwang acknowledges might be "disappointing" for some. He also announces that the DLC will only be available for a "limited time of six months".</p>

<p><em>Dave the Diver</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>DLC launches on April 10th. The game is available to buy right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dave-the-diver/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dave-the-diver-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

<p>Atomfall’s world has fallen into chaos and is a windswept wreck thanks to the Windscale disaster. You need to venture into the game to explore and exterminate threats if you hope to complete the Atomfall Trophy list and dust off all Trophies and Achievements along the way.</p>



<p>Rebellion’s 2025 is a hot one with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a>. Resistance is a one-man crusade through Nazi-occupied France, whereas Atomfall is an alternate-history England where the infamous Windscale nuclear disaster turned out to have more serious consequences than we all thought.</p>



<p>We’ve called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-played-again-most-anticipated-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall one of our most anticipated games of the year</a>. The setting, the subplots, and the scarily eerie nature of its world all play a factor. There’s a lot to uncover, and you need to undertake a heavy workload for the Atomfall Trophy List.</p>



<p><strong>Spoiler Warning: Atomfall’s list has hidden Trophies and Achievements. We will show you the known objectives first, and it’s up to you if you want to see the rest.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-every-atomfall-achievement-amp-trophy">How to Get Every Atomfall Achievement &amp; Trophy</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Alright, guv’nor? Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://atomfall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Atomfall</a> Trophy List is split in two—like an atom. You have Achievements and Trophies that appear the second you start up the RPG. But, closer inspection reveals that half of the accomplishments are hidden.</p>



<p>Here’s every Trophy and Achievement shown from the beginning.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Atomfall Trophy &amp; Achievement Name</th><th data-align="center">How to Earn</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pride of Britain</td><td data-align="center">Unlock all other trophies</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Detectorist</td><td data-align="center">Pick up the metal detector</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Where there’s muck there’s brass</td><td data-align="center">Find 10 metal detector caches</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Packed lunch</td><td data-align="center">Find 5 buried lunchboxes</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Avid Collector</td><td data-align="center">Find 10 comics</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Radiophonic</td><td data-align="center">Find 5 audio logs</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mate’s Rates</td><td data-align="center">Find 5 traders in the Quarantine Zone</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">We Want Information</td><td data-align="center">Read 50 notes in the Quarantine Zone</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Refer to Manual</td><td data-align="center">Learn 12 skills</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Orna mental</td><td data-align="center">Find and destroy 10 Garden Gnomes</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Homemade</td><td data-align="center">Find and learn 10 recipes</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Make do and mend</td><td data-align="center">Upgrade a firearm to pristine condition</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Fast Bowl</td><td data-align="center">Kill 10 enemies with a thrown weapon</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Hit for Six</td><td data-align="center">Redirect a thrown grenade with the cricket bat</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Burglar</td><td data-align="center">Use the Signal Redirector to unlock 5 doors</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Batteries Not Included</td><td data-align="center">Power up a deactivated robot</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Caught Red-handed</td><td data-align="center">Cause an enemy to drop their Molotov cocktail</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Target Practice</td><td data-align="center">Get 6 kills with the MK.VI Revolver without reloading</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Grand Slam</td><td data-align="center">Take out at least 5 enemies in one explosion</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">High Tea</td><td data-align="center">Consume a Cornish pasty, English tea, and a slice of cake in 30s</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p>As promised, these are the secret Trophies and Achievements. This is your <strong>final spoiler warning</strong> as I’m about to reveal each of the hidden tasks.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-many-trophies-amp-achievements-in-atomfall">How Many Trophies &amp; Achievements in Atomfall?</h2>



<p><strong>A grand total of 37 PlayStation Trophies and 36 Xbox Achievements await you in Atomfall.</strong></p>



<p>Veteran hunters know why there’s a notable difference between PlayStation and Xbox. But if you’re new to this game, PlayStation users are awarded a Platinum Trophy for earning all 36 other Trophies. Microsoft hasn’t implemented a similar system yet, but you still get a hefty amount of Gamerscore instead.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-might-have-set-a-record-with-endgame-credits.1141248/</guid>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is enormous in more ways than one. It has a gigantic open-world map, a staggering array of enemies to assassinate, and branching skill paths spread across two playable characters. It also has a stream of endgame credits that scroll up your screen for a whopping <strong>two hours</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s right – the credits that roll at the end of Assassin’s Creed Shadows will occupy two whole hours of your life if you intend on watching them through to the end, which is a painful thing for any developer wanting to wait around to catch their name in the mix.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-speed-it-up">Speed It Up</h2>



<p>Admittedly, Assassin’s Creed Shadows has a two-hour roll of credits because the text goes by so slowly – for no real reason.</p>



<p>Bizarrely, Video Game Credits captured the PC credits and uploaded the full segment to YouTube, with the video totalling <strong>three and a half hours</strong>. The soundtrack that plays behind the credits is pretty impressive, but nobody needs to wait around that long to catch their name.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows (Credits) (Windows)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k5VYcPXnuDA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>For reference, Video Game Credits has documented the following feature-length credits segments:</p>



<ul>
<li>GTA V Enhanced – 01h08m</li>



<li>Hearts of Iron IV – 01h06m</li>



<li>Gangstar New Orleans – 01h07m</li>



<li>Battlefield 2042 – 1h15m</li>



<li>The Sims 2: Ultimate Collection – 1hr19m</li>
</ul>



<p>Don’t worry, though. You can speed up the credits by tapping (and holding) fast-forward, just in case you want to scroll through to a team you perhaps worked on for a nice social media snapshot.</p>



<p>If anything, it’s indicative of the sheer scope of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, which is going down in reviews as one of the best games the series has seen in many years. It’s great, but it’s not perfect, and if I had to put a number on it, I’d say it’s an 8 out of 10.</p>



<p>The game has had a couple of issues since being released on March 20, though. For instance, a day one patch was released that stripped the ability to damage shrines, which was in response to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/japan-government-worried-attacks-assassins-shadows/">the Japanese government</a> expressing concerns about ‘imitation attacks’ at shrines across the country.</p>



<p>Do you plan on watching the entire Assassin’s Creed Shadows credits roll? Let me know in the comments why you would and what’s wrong with you.</p>

Valhalla adopted a different approach when it first launched on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and even Google Stadia in November 2020. While it was available on PC as well, it was an Epic Games Store exclusive until November 2022. When it reached Steam, <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/2208920" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">it peaked at 15,431 concurrent players</a> in December 2022.</p><p>On its first day, Shadows eclipsed that with a peak of 41,412 players and that number has already grown to 42,415. In comparison, <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/3035570" rel="nofollow ">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> has a peak player count of 7,837, and at the time of writing, Shadows hasn't beaten <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/582160" rel="nofollow ">Origins</a> (41,541 concurrent players) or <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/812140" rel="nofollow ">Odyssey</a> (61,984 concurrent players) numbers yet. Concurrent players typically increase on the first weekend after launch as well, so these numbers could still potentially increase further.</p><p>With Ubisoft undergoing financial struggles recently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-is-bit-of-an-existential-moment-for-ubisoft-analyst-says/1100-6530208/">analyst Joost Van Dreunen explained how Shadows</a> could be a "bit of an existential moment" for the company. In an interview, Van Dreunen explained how if Shadows can do "really well" in terms of sales, that could "go a long way toward repairing [Ubisoft's] financial position."</p><p>In related news, a new update for the game now prevents players from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-update-makes-key-changes-to-shrines-amid-cultural-sensitivity-discussion/1100-6530252/">destroying certain items in shrines</a>, possibly as a response to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's criticism of the game and the discussion around potential cultural insensitivity.</p><p>If you're planning to get started in the new Ubisoft game and you're looking for a few tips, you can check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-guides-hub/1100-6530214/">Assassin's Creed Shadows guides hub</a> for a selection of walkthroughs.

It's too soon to say, but game director Mike Kayatta hasn't ruled it out.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://kotaku.com/fbc-firebreak-remedy-co-op-fomo-live-service-preview-1851771133" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, Kayatta said, "We are very busy in developing the game for the launch. So we haven't given the Switch 2 any thought at this point, but things can always change in the future."</p><p>This question came up after Remedy stated that it wanted to make FBC run well on lower-end PCs and become <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-steam-deck-games-to-play-right-now/2900-4083/" data-ref-id="2900-4083">Steam Deck</a> Verified. The Switch 2's specs remain unknown, but the console is expected to continue the tradition for Nintendo platforms of being relatively underpowered compared to PlayStation and Xbox consoles, along with high-end PCs.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1595327992" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

			<p>The Xbox UI is set to change significantly in the future, and it may soon show Steam games that are installed on the system, judging from an image shared online that was promptly removed shortly after.</p>
<p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a>, an image was shared in a new blog post titled&nbsp;<em><a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-opening-a-billion-doors-with-xbox/">"Opening a Billion Doors With Xbox</a>," </em>which highlighted changes in the game industry and users now tending to engage with games across multiple devices, showing how the Xbox UI could change in the future to account for this tendency. What makes this new interface interesting is a clearly visible Steam label in all variants of the interface: TV, tablet and handheld. According to unspecified sources, Microsoft is working on an Xbox app update that will show every game installed on a PC, including games purchased on other digital storefronts like Steam and the Epic Games Store. As this Xbox app update is still in the early stages of development, however, the inclusion of all installed PC games in the interface may be scrapped as work continues.</p>
<p>Besides working on a new Xbox UI and app update, Microsoft is also hard at work on the hardware side of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/">next-generation plans</a>, which include a premium successor to the Xbox Series X and a handheld console. In addition, the company is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-kennan-is-reportedly-being-made-by-asus/">reportedly working with ASUS</a> on a handheld known as Project Keenan that will launch later this year. This handheld system, which will look markedly Xbox, will run full Windows with a focus on the Microsoft Store and PC Game Pass. As such, it will definitely be able to run games purchased on Steam and other digital storefronts, so it wouldn't be surprising for the new UI featuring the Steam label to launch alongside the system.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-release-date-set-for-june.1141221/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nightdive has announced the&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>release date, with the reworked version of the classic FPS coming to PC and consoles in summer.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>'s remaster will be launching across PC and consoles (that's current-gen and last-gen consoles, happily) on June 26th.</p>

<p>Just in case you're wondering what happened to Nightdive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-2-enhanced-edition-is-being-ported-to-kex-engine" rel="nofollow">previously-revealed</a>&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition</em>, this is, in fact, that very thing; the project was renamed to&nbsp;<em>25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>earlier this year, but it's still the same, ahem, enhanced edition Nightdive has been working on for the past few years.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-remaster-release-date-robot.jpg?itok=u9-8m4kP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-remaster-release-date-robot.jpg?itok=J5FgeGFv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>System Shock 2</em>'s remaster is coming in June.</figcaption></figure><p>As you've probably come to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-the-thing-remaster-tease" rel="nofollow">expect</a> from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poed-definitive-edition-nightdive" rel="nofollow">previous</a> Nightdive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-studios-remastering-shadow-man-restoring-cut-content" rel="nofollow">remaster projects</a>,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>will bring a number of new features to the iconic 2000 FPS-RPG.</p>

<p>You can expect a visual revamp that will touch up some of the game's rougher edges and models without deviating from Irrational and Looking Glass' artistic vision, as well as some minor quality-of-life improvements, controller support, and more.</p>

<p>The game will also support Steam achievements, as well as achievements and trophies on the relevant consoles, and it'll boast 144fps and ultrawide support too, so this'll likely be the best-looking version of&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>you can play (without mods, of course).</p>

<p>On the subject of mods, Nightdive is also promising expanded mod support for&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>, so if you want to turn all the enemies into Mr. Blobby and work out some very specific trauma, you should find it pretty easy to do so.</p>




<p>It's worth remembering that although Nightdive is the studio responsible for 2023's excellent&nbsp;<em>System Shock&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-goes-gold-release-date-for-pc-announced" rel="nofollow">remake</a>, this project isn't on the same scale; it's not a full reimagining, but a remaster, so bear that in mind if you pick it up.</p>

<p><em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>launches for PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/866570/System_Shock_2_25th_Anniversary_Remaster/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shockr_2_25th_anniversary_remaster" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013043" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/System-Shock-2-25th-Anniversary-Remaster/9P4FK543SMZF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch on June 26th. Make sure you pick this one up if you're interested in a revamped slice of FPS history.</p>

<p>It’s time for a new expansion with Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s Shining Revelry content. We’re already putting Triumphant Light behind us as we’re being blinded by the long-awaited arrival of Shiny Pokémon&nbsp;in Shining Revelry.</p>



<p>The next main-set Expansion is here, and it’s called Shining Revelry. A fitting name as it welcomes Shiny Pokémon&nbsp;variations into Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket. Shinies have become part and parcel of the Pokémon&nbsp;experience in the mainline games and Pokémon&nbsp;GO.</p>



<p>It’s Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s turn to have Shinies, and they are the centerpiece attraction of Shining Revelry.</p>



<h2 id="h-shiny-pokemon-finally-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-shining-revelry">Shiny Pokémon Finally Coming to Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket in Shining Revelry</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I’ve looked at this for hours. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket Shining Revelry expansion comes to us on <strong>March 27</strong>—giving you only a few days to fill in the gaps of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-triumphant-light-secret-missions-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a> and other sets.</p>



<p>The headline-makers we’ve seen—so far—in <a href="https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Pocket</a>‘s Shining Revelry set are a <strong>Shiny Charizard ex</strong> and a <strong>Shiny Lucario ex</strong>. They look absolutely stunning, and it introduces a new form of rarity to the grading system.</p>



<div><article><p><span>It’s time to shine ✨ in the latest </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonTCGPocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#PokemonTCGPocket</a><span> expansion!

Shiny Pokémon arrive alongside Pokémon from the Paldea region in the upcoming expansion, Shining Revelry! Available on Thursday, March 27.</span></p></article></div>



<p>Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket Shining Revelry’s debut likely coincides with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-ranked-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-period-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Battles</a>. The PvP mode was announced a while back after being a rumor. So it’s a double-whammy for Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket players as the mobile app continues to Rock Smash it.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Entertainment Software Association has unveiled the Accessible Games Initiative, which aims to help people understand accessibility features available in video games. The US-based effort came about from some of the biggest companies in the industry: Nintendo of America, Sony, Microsoft, Google, EA, and Ubisoft.</p><p dir="ltr">The Accessible Games Initiative is kicking off <a href="https://accessiblegames.com/accessibility-tags/" rel="nofollow ">with 24 tags</a>. So far, they're categorized under four different features--auditory, gameplay, input, and visual--and then specified from there. For example, there is a Full Input Remapping tag, meaning the game offers the ability to swap button actions, joystick functionality, and other controls. This differs from the Basic Input Remapping tag, advertising only buttons can be reconfigured. Other official tags include Narrated Menus, Playable With Mouse Only, Color Alternatives, and Large Text. These should start appearing on digital storefronts and product pages in the near future.</p><p dir="ltr">"Tens of millions of Americans have a disability and often face barriers to experiencing the joy and connection that comes with playing video games," ESA president and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis said in a press release. Specifically, <a href="https://accessiblegames.com/" rel="nofollow ">the Accessible Games Initiative website</a> points out that 44.1 million US residents have a disability, with reportedly almost half of them playing video games.</p><p dir="ltr">The ESA states that Amazon Games, Riot, Square Enix, and WB Games have joined the Accessible Games Initiative. This is just one of the latest pushes for better accessibility in the gaming industry. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-adaptive-joystick-is-available-now/1100-6530210/">Microsoft revealed the Xbox Adaptive Joystick</a> that looks similar to a Wii nunchuk.

		<p>There seems to be a major movement towards bigger, bolder indie RPGs right now, that push the boundaries of what we should expect in the indie space. We’ve just had the excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/eternal-strands-review/">Eternal Strands</a>, and now Empyreal is heading towards launch on the 8th of May. The development team at Silent Games is keen to give players an early glimpse of the game, and to help them understand the world and some of the systems that they’ll encounter so they’ve dropped an all-new overview trailer with a heap of detail to dispense.</p>
<p><iframe title="Empyreal - Official Game Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_gRQlppV4vM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>In the seven-minute Game Overview video, creative director Joseph Rogers delves into the game’s key mechanics and narrative. You can learn more about the stories waiting to be told, the myriad ways to build your character, and how the mysterious Cartograms will affect every journey into the belly of the Monolith.</p>
<p>Empyreal is described as a feature-rich action RPG where players explore an imposing Monolith and fight to survive against the guardians that lie within. Uncover a complex narrative combining mythology, philosophy, and transcendental revelations as you lead an Expedition further into the structure to discover the truth that lies at its core. There’s already a demo available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1377700/Empyreal/">PC players via Steam</a>, so if you fancy checking it out early, you can!</p>

<p>The main features of the game are a unique and complex combat system, a memorable cast of characters, with personal questlines and multiple endings for each one. A beautiful but shattered ancient world, where you can explore breathtaking environments filled with hidden details. You can also customise your character with a vast array of equipment and collect armour sets that confer powerful bonuses, while upgrading and modifying the loot you find. Besides that you’ll ablso unlock new abilities to personalise your playstyle.</p>

<p>It definitely looks fantastic, and we can’t wait to show you more. Empyreal will release on 8 May for PC via Steam, PlayStation®5, and Xbox Series X|S. Empyreal is priced at £24.99/$29.99/€29.99, with a 10% launch discount on Steam.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-refill-scouts/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> features some brand new gameplay mechanics that set it apart from past entries in the series. After accepting the vast majority of main and side quests, the game won't tell you outright where to go and will only provide some general hints regarding where you have to go, leaving you on your own to search for your next quest objective. If you want to speed up this process, you will have to use <strong>scouts</strong>, but every season, you will only be able to use them for a limited number of times, and you will have to wait for the season to change if you want to use them again.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250321131024_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Thankfully,<strong> you are not forced to wait for a season to change if you want to use scouts again</strong> after depleting their use and if you are willing to spend some resources. Besides forcing a partial season change via the main menu when the compass in the top right of the map hits south, which still requires time to pass, in any <strong>Kakuraga safehouse</strong> that you have unlocked, you can <strong>refill scouts</strong>&nbsp;by interacting with the sacks hanging on one of the walls and paying 200 mon. Constantly refilling scouts can be a costly endeavor, so you should still avoid abusing the system, but in case of emergency, this option is extremely handy to have, especially if you prefer to use scouts to salvage Stockpiles from enemy strongholds or use them to clear the Wanted status instead of using them to find quest objectives faster. To expand and improve the capabilities of scouts, you will need to upgrade the Kakurega in your Hideout to level 2 and the Stables.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250321132000_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you like using the scout system in Assassin's Creed Shadows a lot, you will also want to recruit as many scouts as possible. To do so, you will need to upgrade your <strong>Study</strong> in the Hideout, as each upgrade will increase the number of available scouts up to 9. You will need a lot of resources to do so, and the best way to gather enough of them relatively quickly is to complete the seasonal contracts available for each region, besides clearing enemy camps and strongholds. Much like refilling scouts, seasonal contracts can be accepted in any Kakurega.</p>

<p>The dust has finally started to settle on Monster Hunter Wilds’ incredible launch. But if you thought Capcom would leave it there, you’re deadly wrong. We’re just getting started, and the newly announced Monster Hunter Wilds First Title Showcase coming in April is the next phase.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-2025s-best-selling-game-in-the-united-states-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game in the United States</a> in 2025. Monster Hunter Wilds is also the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-become-the-fastest-selling-game-in-capcoms-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fastest-selling game in Capcom’s long and illustrious history</a>. They’re some impressive accolades to shout from the mountains. Although I wouldn’t recommend it as you’re likely to disturb <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/creature-coin-monster-hunter-wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ancient Wyverns</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-catch-whoppers-in-monster-hunter-wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whoppers</a>, and other other-worldly creatures.</p>



<p>The first major content injection is on the way courtesy of the Monster Hunter Wilds First Title update. A Showcase has been set in stone which will unveil new footage and features.</p>

<p>Capcom has announced a Showcase for the first Free Title Update in Monster Hunter Wilds. The presentation is set for <strong>March 25</strong>, with the update launching in “<strong>Early April</strong>.”</p>

You can watch the show on the <a href="http://twitch.tv/monsterhunter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds Twitch channel</a>, and it will show “Mizutsune and a host of other new additions.”</p>

This will be our first real look at the creature, how it fights, and how you can prepare yourself for the titanic battle.</p>



<p>Capcom is making sure fans are eating good. If this announcement isn’t a testament to that, you only need to look at the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-promotion-is-rewarding-players-with-lots-of-free-goodies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds promotion offering free goodies and bonuses</a>.</p>
