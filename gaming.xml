</section></header><section>

<p>Cygames has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/granblue-fantasy-relink-endless-ragnarok">Granblue Fantasy: Relink</a> is making its way to Switch 2 in a new 'Endless Ragnarok' package.</p>
<p>Set to come out way on <strong>9th July</strong>, this is the same Relink experience that so many know and love from back in 2024, with a couple of new bells and whistles to mark the Switch 2 release.</p>
<p>Chief among the additions is a playable Eustace and Beatrix, who join the 20-character roster with their unique fighting styles — Beatrix up close and personal with her swords, and Eustace from further afield with his guns.</p>
<p>Both local and online co-op are enabled, too, so you'll be able to team up with pals and take on enemies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Embark on an epic journey in the Sky Realm. In this visually stunning action RPG, players will journey alongside a diverse cast of allies, exploring breathtaking floating islands and battling powerful foes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a> had a great time with Relink when it launched on PS5 back in 2024, stating, "whether you're playing alone or in co-op, there's a real thrill to Relink's combat system, which combines precise hacking and slashing with underlying RPG stats and mechanics," in their <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/granblue-fantasy-relink">8/10 review</a>. Let's hope things look just as bright on Switch 2, eh?</p>

</figure>
<p>As noted by Mechanistry in the aforementioned post, <em>Timberborn </em>has come a long way since launching in Early Access back in 2021, having received a number of major updates adding new features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/folktails-vs-iron-teeth-in-timberborn-guide" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bb42b48a-a7ed-45d4-ac0d-3e0e65fc6fce" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">distinct factions</a>, 3D <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-update-6" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d6f3a308-53b5-4b6b-98c6-0d19b287537f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">physics</a>, and new maps, plus lots more.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Timberborn</em>, it's a colony-building sim that takes place on an Earth ravaged by the worst excesses of mankind. Humans have disappeared, but it's okay; beavers are here to pick up the slack.</p><p>You'll guide your colony of beavers through the early stages of building their city, and you'll tend to important management aspects like food production, protection from the elements, and environmental engineering.</p><p>You can check out the new <em>Timberborn </em>lore trailer, which should give you a good sense of what kind of world the game takes place in, right here. Take it away, Shaun.</p>
<p>Upon launching into Early Access, <em>Timberborn </em>proved a pretty major success for Mechanistry, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-sales-surpass-100k-copies-in-first-week" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="66101916-f924-4827-b377-416c6d46fbb6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">attracting over 100,000 sales</a> within the game's first week of release. Here's hoping it can replicate that early interest for the 1.0 release.</p><p><em>Timberborn </em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062090/Timberborn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and it's getting its 1.0 release on March 5th.

            <p>Get in cover and 10/4 your sit reps, soldier! Battalion developers Bulkhead have revealed a new military sandbox shooter set to arrive in early access at some point this year. It's called Wardogs and it'll see matches featuring up to 100 mercenaries mercilessly murder each other in teams, with the reward being a stack of money to spend on upping the ante with their next loadout.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCnEi5npoTE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>Our first thought upon seeing the player count per session was that the thing seems quite Battlefieldy, but Bulkhead say that - at least in terms of the game's main mode - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arma-3">Arma 3</a> mod <a href="https://armakoth.com/">King of the Hill</a> was the main inspiration. For clarity that's a mod with three team sector control missions featuring lots of walkie-talkie enthusiasts rogering each other, not the TV show about a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA6EdFZD8s8">man with a very small bottom</a> and his son who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy3qk4ohwFA">doesn't know you, but knows that's his purse</a>.</p>
<p>So, each match'll see you flown out to Eastern Europe's famous derelict industrial mountains, assigned to one of three teams fighting for control of a randomised 2x2KM central control zone within a 256KM² map, and told to keep your bottom in the control zone until your squad rack up the 100 points needed to win.</p><p>Destructible environments designed to be shaped in fortified defence points, makeshift bases, or vicious deathtraps feed into the territorial struggles, and Bulkhead say tactical nous will be rewarded. In line with that, throughout each battle you earn cash through actions like "reviving squadmates, transporting friendlies to the zone, or controlling the objective", encouraging folks to work together.</p>
<p>The contents of your cute camo wallet persist between matches, and are what you use to buy different bits of the loadout you take into each fight. Which weapons, gear, utility bobbins and vehicles you pick will influence how the action plays out, with stuff like whipping out your big tank or chopper at the exact right time having the potential to turn the tide drastically.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks like something the bit of my brain that quietly loves a bit of multiplayer shootering could dig, even if I'll spend 90% of the time being told off by teammates for being too much of a coward to poke my head out of cover and heal them.</p>
<p>Wardogs is set to release in early access at some point in 2026, with Bulkhead planning to have this last "around 12 to 18 months" while they work on "expanding content, improving systems, refining balance, and responding to player feedback". Until then, you can wishlist the shooter on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1867240/WARDOGS/">Steam</a> if you're so inclined.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-8-in-1-usb-c-docking-station-crashes-to-an-all-time-low-barely-any-margin-left-at-this-price-2000665542</link>
            <guid>1427119</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re looking to expand your workstation with more devices, or just want to manage the gadgets you currently use, a docking station can help. Anker makes some of the top options around, and right now you can snap up its 8-in-1 option without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7057/">Amazon just knocked the Anker 8-in-1 docking station by 26%, bringing its price down to $40, from $54</a>. There are no shipping charges to worry about, either, so $40 is all you’ve got to pay today. The only thing to keep in mind is that the offer – as you’d expect – is selling out fast. That means you don’t have a lot of time left to bag the savings. It’s best to grab it as soon as you can to avoid paying the full price later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7057/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bigger, Productive Setup</h2>
<p>It’s a compact docking station that packs a mighty punch. It’s equipped with a USB-C PD-IN charging port, two USB-A data ports, two HDMI ports, an Ethernet port, and a microSD/SD card reader. That’s all you need to create a productive workstation for all your office and entertainment needs. The station is also compatible with USB-C Power Delivery to provide high-speed pass-through charging up to 85W, so you can juice your essentials up while catching up on work deadlines.</p>
<p>There’s support for a dual display setup via HDMI ports. You can stream or mirror content to a single device in sharp 4K at 60Hz, or connect to two external screens to both HDMI ports in 4K@30Hz. For instance, if you’re planning to game with friends, add a high-quality external monitor to enjoy breathtaking visuals and smooth performance. Working on an office project with colleagues? Having two external screens lets you take quick meetings on one, while viewing reference materials on the second and working on your primary screen. Note that Windows users can use each screen for different content, but macOS mirrors the same content across both external monitors.</p>



<p>As for compatibility, the docking station supports USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt connections. It plays nicely with a range of devices, including MacBook (macOS 12 and newer), Windows 10 and 11, ChromeOS, and laptops equipped with DP Alt Mode and Power Delivery. Included in the box are the 8-in-1 USB-C PD hub, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty for added peace of mind. A charging cable isn’t included, so you’d either have to buy one separately or use what’s already available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7057/">There’s a lot more to appreciate here, especially now that the hub is going for just $40 at Amazon.</a> Again, the deal is selling out fast, so it’s best to place your orders without wasting much time. That said, we’re spotting plenty of other discounts across the tech section at Amazon. Everything from smartphones to laptops, gaming monitors, and tech accessories is going for less. We’re covering the top deals, so be sure to check back to discover the latest drops worth your money.</p>

              <p>Astonishingly, we are already eight months into the life of Nintendo’s Switch 2 console. And three-quarters of a year in, it’s perhaps fair to say there’s not exactly been a rollercoaster of must-have games released. Given the disappointment of&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, and the sheer paucity of other first-part originals, it’s becoming tricky not to think of it as a $400 <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> machine that has a side-hustle in ports. With a desperate need for the console to be given any sense of vitality in 2026, today’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-february-switch-2-oblivion-fallout-2000665999">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> not only did very little to take away from the impression of stagnation, but if anything seemed to go out of its way to endorse it.</p> <p>It was a very peculiarly put-together showcase. Any who try to fathom the decisions made by Nintendo are doomed to spiraling madness, but after the very pretty but previously announced <em>Orbitals</em>, we saw a visual novel sequel, a soccer anime oddity, and then what looked like a 2002 PC shovelware knock-off of a generic Capcom game, <em>Tokyo Scramble</em>. It was a deeply inauspicious start, suggesting that these desultory offerings were the games Nintendo thought we should be most excited about in 2026.</p>

 <p>This was then further cemented by longer looks at two years-old ports. First up was&nbsp;<em>Valheim</em>, the 2021 PC survival game, arriving on Switch 2 without a new addition or significant update, presented looking choppy and blocky (which I suppose are at least thematic) for the brand-new console. This five-year-old game still has a loyal following on Steam, with 30,000 people playing every day, so it’s not exactly forgotten, but it’s a weird pick to make such a fuss of. Then came the two-month-old news that the original 2017 <em>Hollow Knight</em> is receiving a free upgrade for the Switch 2. Very welcome, of course, and a great move by Team Cherry, but you know, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-sea-of-sorrows-switch-2-2000653816">something that was announced back in December of last year</a>.</p> <p>Somehow this was followed by&nbsp;<em>another</em> soccer game, a previously announced cross-platform Square RPG, another previously announced and previously released cross-platform Square RPG (OK, I’m being slightly facetious, people are excited to play <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> on Switch 2), and then two more long-ago-revealed but still potentially interesting cross-platform titles, <em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>and <em>Turok: Origins</em>. At this point the Direct seemed completely lost, just stringing together games we already knew were coming to Switch 2, but also coming to Xbox, PlayStation and PC, and all with little new information nor even release dates. The whole thing felt more and more like a proof-of-life for the console, rather than a showcase of reasons to be excited.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666069" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666069"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666069">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Perhaps you’re delighted by the reveal of a sequel to 2015’s PS Vita game&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Xanadu</em>, a long-awaited revival of Nihon Falcon’s classic ’80s/’90s <em>Xanadu </em>series, and all power to you if so, but this alongside <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> also felt like pretty weak offerings. But wait, hold on to your socks and hats, because up next was&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink – Endless Ragnarok</em>! You know&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy</em>, right? The 2014 mobile game? Or perhaps you’re more of a fan of the&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus</em> games that came to, er, PS4 and Xbox One? Even&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em> didn’t come to Switch in 2024, instead arriving only on PlayStation and PC.</p>

 <p>Finally, way too late into the stream, some previously unreleased games with broader name recognition appeared. We got the already very well-known <em>Monster Hunter Stories 3</em> as well as <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, which would have been a massive deal if they hadn’t already been announced for the system last year, and in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories</em>‘ case, via a previous Nintendo Direct. Between these, we also had the welcome news of a collection of literally 40-year-old classics, and a rapid-fire montage of yet more previously announced games. But why <em>Star Trek Voyager – Across the Unknown</em> and&nbsp;<em>Reanimal</em> were confined to this purgatory, and the rest of this dismal half hour was not, is anyone’s guess.</p> <p>And then the big finish! An 11-year-old, two-year-old, and 20-year-old game, each from Bethesda. <em>Fallout 4</em> and <em>Oblivion</em> are last year’s versions, but still games that have been re-released a comical number of times across the decades. And honestly, the fact that it felt borderline exciting that 2024’s <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> was revealed as a Switch 2 game really underlined just what a dreadful Direct this had been. “Oh my goodness, a big-name game that was released in this decade!”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666070"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666070">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This was a Partner Showcase, which is to say a Direct which features no first-party Nintendo announcements at all. But given just how little of those first-party efforts we know about at this point, it needed to do some damned heavy lifting to offer hope to Switch 2 owners who might be wondering exactly why they upgraded over the holidays. Next week’s <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em> from Camelot will likely be a lovely 8/10 sports game, and there’s reason to hope that next month’s&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>will offer us a fresh face for an&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>-like, but neither feels like a console-selling blockbuster. A repolished&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> at the end of March is…sure, great. Then we have&nbsp;<em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em> set for spring, and that’s it for games with even that vague of a release date. At some point in 2026 we should get <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Wave</em> and it’ll be gratefully received, but seriously, fucking hell, that’s it. Apparently there’s another&nbsp;<em>Splatoon</em> at some point in the distant future, too.</p> <p>It is surely impossible that Nintendo doesn’t have something up its sleeves for&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>‘s 40th anniversary, right? But then it also feels impossible that Nintendo launched a brand new console without a 3D&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> title even announced, let alone released, and that’s somehow still true.</p> <p>Given all of this, today’s showcase needed to have some massive third-party announcement, some huge reveal that everyone would be buzzing about. And we didn’t even get close. It was abysmal.</p>

<p id="block-cde2c274-bfd9-4d27-a0d9-3ebe6f1ff7f2">Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Guerrilla Games has revealed its long-simmering multiplayer title set within the world of Horizon Zero Dawn/Forbidden West. The game is called Horizon Hunters Gathering, and it’s coming to PlayStation 5 and PC.</p><p>Horizon Hunters Gathering is a co-op action game set in the American West, where up to three players assume the roles of Hunters who must protect the world from deadly machines. This involves going out on hunts to track and dismantle machines in combat that Guerrilla describes as “tactical, reactive, and deeply skill-based.” The game also sports a more stylized art direction, more akin to an animated film.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JubgL46Xkmk"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JubgL46Xkmk?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The roster consists of three Hunters (though this roster will grow over time) with distinct playstyles and weapons, both melee and ranged. One character wields a giant rocket-powered hammer, another Hunter slays foes with a spear, while the third uses a bow. Combat still involves targeting a machine’s specific body parts to dismantle it, and players can combine abilities to strategically coordinate their assaults. Think Horizon mixed with the cooperative dynamic of Monster Hunter, though the combat is much faster-paced and over-the-top than in a traditional Horizon title.</p><p>Hunters can be assigned classes such as healer or damage dealer, which changes their playstyles to favor either support, tank, or tactician. A roguelite build system allows players to assign one of several randomly earned perks while playing. Surviving a run will mean finding the best combination of perks and upgrades.</p>

<p>Players will get to know these personalities in a narrative campaign. This story mode can be played solo with NPCs or alongside friends, and it is fully canon to the universe. Expect to meet new characters and unravel new mysteries, and Guerrilla promises this story will be expanded over time with new adventures and narrative beats.</p><p>Four large maps will be available at launch. At the center is a social hub called Hunters Gathering. Here, you can connect with friends, customize characters, visit shops, and upgrade gear.</p><p>In addition to the campaign, two multiplayer modes have been revealed: Machine Incursion and Cauldron Descent. Machine Incursion sees players battle waves of machines led by a powerful boss as a ring slowly closes in to tighten the playfield. Cauldron Descent is a multi-stage challenge set within the series’ dungeon-like Cauldrons. Players choose which paths to take to explore deeper underground, which can pit them against enemies, take them on a platforming-focused obstacle course, or lead them to hidden doors with secret rewards.</p>

<p>Horizon Hunters Gathering supports cross-play between PS5 and PC as well as cross-progression, provided you’re playing using the same PlayStation account.&nbsp;Players can get their first sample of the game in an upcoming closed playtest. This small-scale test will be available on PS5 and PC and begins at the end of this month. You can sign up via the PlayStation Beta Program.</p><p>For fans wondering about how this new game affects the status of a presumably in-development third mainline Horizon game, Guerrilla studio director Jan-Bart Van Beek made it clear at the start of the announcement video that Horizon Hunters Gathering does not signal a shift away from creating single-player experiences:</p><p>“...I want to be clear about one thing. We absolutely love making single-player games, and we’re going to keep making them. They’re a huge part of who we are as a studio. But next to that, we have this long-standing dream to try to do something different: our own take on how to explore the world of Horizon together as a team of machine hunters.”</p>

It will be interesting to see if Guerrilla can successfully translate its single-player open-world series into a successful multiplayer title, the way that Elden Ring Nightreign managed to last year.

            <guid>1427083</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>This week, an Xfinity superbowl ad featuring the de-aged faces of the cast of <em>Jurassic Park</em> went viral for looking kind of strange. This is generally not surprising as digitally de-aging people almost never looks right, existing largely as a weirdly uncanny death mask over existing actors. When done to living actors it is embarrassing and a little silly, and when done to the dead it’s just kind of disrespectful. I kind of understand the utility in doing this narratively—but I do not think they should have done <em>this</em>.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KKwxWPp2dhw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Jurassic Park... Works (Extended) | Big Game Commercial 2026 | Xfinity"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>All your Jurassic Park classic characters are here including Xfinity guy. </span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Digital de-aging has been around for ages and it always looks weird. I have become weirdly obsessed with the process over the years, from Ang Lee’s bizarre 120fps movie <em>Gemini Man</em> where Will Smith must fight his own disturbing looking clone, to John Lee’s oft-forgotten straight to Netflix <em>Pee-wee's Big Holiday </em>where they de-aged Pee Wee because Old Pee Wee is a bit of a contradiction in terms<em>. </em>They actually did this in the most recent season of <em>Fallout </em>to make Kyle MacLachlan young, and it looks kinda weird there too. The result is often a way too smooth image coupled with a jarringly old sounding voice. For a second I thought they did it in <em>Wicked 2: For Good</em> but it turns out they just got a younger guy who looked kinda like a badly de-aged Jeff Goldblum.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Gemini Man is one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen for several reasons but you can only get the 60fps cut not the full 120 fps cut. Credit: Paramount Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p>The ad itself is directed by the powerful comedy mind behind <em>JoJo Rabbit</em>, Taika Waititi, which makes sense because it’s also a poorly considered use of culturally loaded imagery. It cloyingly pitches a scenario where all of the problems of <em>Jurassic Park</em> are solved by the one Xfinity guy plugging in the shitty router that the company rents to you. You get to see all your friends having a super awesome time together and going to the spa and Dr. Alan Grant fully endorses the park. The entire tone of the commercial is very Reddit 8 years ago, so it is unsurprising that the reaction has been almost universal scorn.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Too smooth! Credit: xfinity.</span></figcaption></figure><p>“I think anybody who loved the movie <em>Jurassic Park</em> growing up always wondered what would have happened if everything could have gone right?” Diana Hicks the executive director of Xfinity brand marketing said in a behind the scenes promotional video.&nbsp;</p><p>Not really, Diana. Like I’ve played<em> DinoPark Tycoon </em>I guess but that sorta defeats the whole point of the movie. I get that it’s a superbowl ad, but I was raised in the ad industry and this feels like a prompt more than a pitch.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RcbFClqbJOc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Behind the Scenes of ‘Jurassic Park … Works’ | Big Game Commercial 2026 | Xfinity"></iframe></figure><p>I don’t really begrudge anyone involved for getting a paycheck for this. Laura Dern and Sam Neill both seem very nice and they deserve to get that money. Whatever Sam needs to do to finance his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/samneilltheprop/?hl=en&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>delightful parasocial farm</u></a> is fine. Goldblum doing smarmy, hammy shit is unsurprising, that’s kind of his entire career and generally he’s good at it. To the extent that you can trust a behind the scenes video for a superbowl ad, they all seem like they are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcbFClqbJOc&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>having a fun time</u></a>! Kind of a missed opportunity to get Wayne Knight involved if you ask me but he lost a lot of weight in the last few years and maybe that would present technical issues.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1CDAGQPc2bk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="McDonald's Jurassic Park Meal Commercial - June 1993"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>Hamburger.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>While it is tempting to lambast a commercial for being soulless and crass, it’s important to remember that this is <em>Jurassic Park</em> and despite being a masterpiece it was built in a lab to sell cheeseburgers and cheap extruded plastic by way of lucrative cross promotion. We’re at like, what, seven movies now? This is in many ways the logical conclusion to much of what Spielberg has set in motion, from the weaponized use of nostalgia and timed brand synergy to digital de-aging. He used this technology with extremely weird results in <em>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.</em> It is also very funny that Industrial Light and Magic clarified to IGN that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-cgi-embalming-xfinitys-jurassic-park-super-bowl-ad-features-digitally-de-aged-sam-neil-laura-dern-and-jeff-goldblum?ref=aftermath.site"><u>while they worked on the dinosaurs they did not handle the deaging.</u></a></p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4P8FuQJIdM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Behind the Magic | The Visual Effects of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>This entire process takes so much work and always looks strange.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Despite all that, you cannot pull this crap with the first <em>Jurassic Park</em> movie specifically because it is one of the most tasteful uses of special effects in history. The story behind that movie’s production is a masterclass in prudence. They had Stan Winston and Phil Tippet on set, two of the greatest to ever do it when it comes to practicals and stop motion respectively, and through much of the production they were originally going to use Tippet’s stop motion before they eventually settled on then-revolutionary CG for half the shots, infamously leading Phil Tippet to remark “I think I’m extinct,” a comment that made it into the final script.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8r01mk6F_Pk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Making The Dinosaurs | Jurassic Park Documentary (1993) | Screen Bites"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>The part where all the animators take an acting class to pretend to move like dinosaurs is so cool.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>The whole reason <em>Jurassic Park</em> still looks great decades later is because everyone knew when best to utilize an effect. It’s not that the somewhat smeary, low resolution dinosaurs look good, it’s that everyone involved in the production worked with each other and knew when an effect was believable. To quote Stan Winston, “If they didn’t look real, if you didn’t believe their skin, their flesh, their reality, their details, their eyes, their teeth, their mouth, everything about them, no matter how good the performances were, it wouldn’t be real. Cause you’d have something acting real but it didn’t look real.”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tvwPKBXEOKE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Why Movies Just Don't Feel &quot;Real&quot; Anymore"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>I don't agree with every part of this essay but they're cookin' through big parts of it.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>If Xfinity had gotten the entire cast of <em>Jurassic Park </em>together and done a big silly ad where they were all older, the reaction would have been neutral to slightly positive. All three of them were in that last movie a few years ago! But who cares, this is not really about the ad, but something larger, which is that nothing “feels real” anymore.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Sometimes you just gotta make a real dinosaur.

		<p>We’re decades removed from the Capcom Five era, in which Capcom and Nintendo cosied up to bring five original third party exclusives to the GameCube. That bold plan didn’t quite pan out as the GameCube faltered, but the Nintendo-Capcom relationship feels stronger than ever in 2026. Not only are Capcom bringing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-stories-3">Monster Hunter Stories 3 to its natural home</a> on a Nintendo handheld, nor are they limiting themselves to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/resident-evil-requiem-coming-to-switch-2-along-with-resident-evil-biohazard-and-village/">ports of Resident Evil 7 and Village</a>, they’re also bringing premier cross-platform games to Switch 2, day and date with other platforms. How can <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> keep up with the full fat home consoles?</p>
<p>We went hands on with both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pragmata">Pragmata</a> at a recent Nintendo Switch 2 preview event, and it’s once again very impressive what developer are able to get out of this cut-down portable system.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem – Coming February 27th (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PJiJhGX6BxE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Starting with Resident Evil Requiem, and we got to play through a sequence on Switch 2 that we first played on PS5 in the middle of last year. Grace finds herself strapped upside down on a gurney being drained of blood, sweat streaming down her reddening face, but manages to break free and start exploring the moodily lit rooms of this once opulent building. It’s a great little demo that once again reframes what to we can expect from this ninth mainline Resident Evil game, though we’ve obviously now discovered that Leon will appear as a second playable character to provide a lot more action to the gameplay.</p>
<p>It performs excellently well on Switch 2, running at 60fps and feeling very smooth while tentatively exploring the halls. It’s fair to say that this is a rather contained environment, so perhaps not the greatest challenge for the Switch 2, and it will be interesting to see how the game holds up on this machine whenever there’s more ambitious spaces and more enemies.</p>


<p>So, how has Capcom managed this? Well, the RE Engine already has a long track record of getting excellent visuals and performance with this style of game through the last generation, so it’s not too surprising to find that it scales well. You can definitely make out that there’s been cuts made to character models, that there’s lower resolution lighting effects (light streaming through a window, for example), more dithering on finer details and other reductions, but I think it’s still an impressive effort that captures a lot of what is achieved on PS5.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="PRAGMATA – A sci-fi action adventure with a hacking twist! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iFaFSx_Uzsg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pragmata, by contrast, doesn’t feel quite as impressive at this time. Darkness helps to hide a lot of necessary graphics setting evils in Resident Evil Requiem, but playing through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/05/pragmata-and-monster-hunter-stories-3-demos-drop-onto-switch-2-today/">the Sketchbook demo on Switch 2</a> places Hugh and Diana in often brightly lit, pristine environment, and that doesn’t help matters. There were some more noticeable upscaling artefacts, there’s 3D model detail that’s reduced far enough to be reminiscent of the moulded look that PS3 era normal mapping, reflection detail that drops off rather close to the camera, and more.&nbsp;The visual cuts were pretty clear to me when playing on TV, but hopping into the game in handheld mode helped to mask them a bit more. The game was still nice and smooth to play in both settings.</p>
<p>The gameplay still shines through for me. This is easily one of the more interesting games coming from a major publisher this year for me, with its unusual blend of characters and setting – Hugh and the girl-sized android Diana are trapped on an abandoned lunar base and being hounded by an AI gone wrong – and puzzle-infused combat.</p>

<p>In order to take down any enemy, you first need to open them up to damage, with Diana reaching out to hack them remotely and open various vents and holes in their otherwise impervious shells. Locking onto an enemy doesn’t just aim Hugh’s weapon, but also brings up a grid of squares for the hacking minigame. It’s exceptionally simple to navigate, using the face buttons on the right side of the gamepad to input directions, creating a chain from beginning to end that you need to try to pass through damage boosters and avoid problem spaces. All the while, you can still move Hugh, dodge and shoot, but the hacking game will draw your main focus. Having experience this area in various ways through different demos in the past year, I’m definitely keen to see other parts of this game.</p>
<p>The takeaway for both games is that, no the Switch 2 definitely isn’t matching the graphical finesse that PS5 or a high-end PC is capable of, but if you can accept the compromises, the games are still thoroughly enjoyable. If you want to play on a big screen, you’ll be better served by another platform, but for gamers that prefer handhelds (or who can handle scary games better when they’re smaller), this is a great option to have.</p>
<p><em>This demo for Pragmata out now on the Nintendo eShop, so you can download it to see both how it holds up for you on Switch 2 technically, and if the gameplay gels for you. You’ll simply have to have some faith that Resident Evil Requiem will also be a delightful terror when that launches later this month.</em></p>

<p>They look... okay?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem has received a new trailer as part of Nintendo's Partner Direct showcase, and while most of the gameplay has already been revealed elsewhere, we got our first proper look at the game's amiibo figures. As an aside, it was really funny to see just how careful Capcom has been to avoid showing any blood in the trailer – no way would Leon be so inaccurate with his gun!</p>
<p>In addition to Grace Ashcroft, an amiibo for Leon has also been revealed, with both unlocking cosmetic skins for your in-game weapons. Only one was showcased here: a neon skin for the Requiem handgun for Leon. It looks wild and wacky, and perhaps not the kind of thing you want to see in a horror title in your first playthrough.</p>
<p>For subsequent playthroughs though? Yeah, we'll be activating all sorts of different costumes and skins - can't wait.</p>
<p>The amiibo don't have a firm release date yet, but we can expect to see them at some point in <strong>Summer 2026</strong>. Unfortunately, by then, we suspect most will have completed the game already. Maybe multiple times!</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem will launch for the Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

<p>Skål!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well, here's a port that we weren't expecting! Coffee Stain Studios has announced that the popular Viking survival game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/valheim">Valheim</a> will be coming to Switch 2 in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Having launched into Early Access back in 2021 before expanding to other platforms two years later, Valheim might feel like a bit of a known quantity at this point. But hey, it's always good to get in on the fun, and we can imagine this being a good fit for Switch 2.</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Valheim is an exploration and survival game, set in a wonderful world of Norse mythology. You'll go full Viking, taming the wilderness as you explore the lands and build a civilisation along the way — combat, smithing, hunting, crafting, you know the open world drill.</p>
<p>Much like on PC, this version will let you play either solo or with up to nine pals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s time to set sail on your very own Viking adventure! Discover the monster-infested world of Valheim on your own or with up to nine friends as you fight and craft your way to greatness. Survive, and you’ll prove yourself to Odin and earn a place in his halls. Skål!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now sure, things look rather blurry in the Switch footage above, but let's hope that it's all a little cleaner when it eventually arrives later this year.</p>
<p><em>Will you be checking out Valheim on Switch 2? Adventure down to the comments and let us know.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Guerrilla and publisher Sony have revealed <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering</em>, a rather curiously-named entry in the <em>Horizon </em>franchise, and it combines three-player tactical action with a new, more cartoony art style.</p><p>In an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/05/announcing-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">announcement post</a> on the PlayStation Blog, game director Arjan Bak says <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering </em>draws on Guerrilla's "experience from the <em>Killzone </em>multiplayer titles and the momentum of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>" to create a game in which you'll team up with others "to protect a world under threat from deadly machines".</p><p>Bak says combat in <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering </em>will be "tactical, reactive, and deeply skill-based". It looks like there will be a number of game modes, each of which will task you and your squad with taking on "challenging and replayable hunts".</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>In the announcement post, Guerrilla reveals two modes: Machine Incursion, which Bak describes as a wave-based mode in which you'll take on hordes of machines and "a formidable boss", and Cauldron Descent, a "longer, multi-stage trial" featuring "ever-changing rooms".</p><p>It looks as though <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering </em>will feature set characters with specific skills and loadouts, rather than customizable avatars, although there will be a "roguelite perk system" to help you craft different builds.</p><p>The titular Hunters Gathering will serve as a central hub between missions, and it'll also be where you customize Hunters, upgrade your gear, and buy things from different vendors.</p><p>In essence, <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering </em>looks rather like Guerrilla's take on an <em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em>or a <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-nightreign-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="69736224-ca37-469c-8a4b-6afcb8284048" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">sales numbers</a> those games have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-q3-financials-monster-hunter-wilds" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="192024ce-eb17-4c01-b8c8-8f76b5512117" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">managed to accrue</a>, I can't say I'm particularly surprised by this move.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ring-floodlight-security-camera-newest-model-drops-to-its-lowest-price-of-the-year-with-motion-activated-1080p-hd-video-2000665554</link>
            <guid>1427020</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus is a security camera and twin floodlight system designed to monitor your driveway, yard, or front entrance area from a single location. It is mounted using a single screw to an exterior electrical box, where it will receive continuous power, eliminating the need for battery replacements and the potential for dead batteries during the winter months. Motion detection triggers both recording and bright light when something moves within the camera’s field of view. The weather-resistant design and a wider angle of view than other cameras allow it to capture large areas of your home throughout the year.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5638/">You can purchase the Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus today on Amazon for $120, down from the normal retail price of $180</a>. This is a savings of $60 and 33% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5638/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A simple way to secure your home while seeing all that goes on</h2>
<p>The Ring Floodlight Cam provides 1080p high-definition video, a live video feed, and color night vision, enabling you to identify people, cars, and packages in your yard at any time of day. Additionally, the camera has a 140-degree horizontal and 80-degree vertical field of view, enabling you to easily see driveways, patios, and side yards without leaving noticeable gaps in your coverage. Once motion is detected, you can open the application, view the event in real time, zoom in on any detail you wish, and use two-way audio with noise cancellation to engage in conversation with whoever is at your door.</p>
<p>The floodlights provide 2000 lumens from two integrated LED lamps, keeping the areas around your home lit and safe after sunset. The floodlights turn on and off automatically when motion is detected within the zones you set. You can also manually activate the lights remotely from your mobile device before you step outside, and deactivate them when your guest leaves.</p>



<p>Advanced detection determines whether motion is detected within the zones you selected. These zones can be customized so you receive alerts only when motion is detected in the specific areas of the image that are important to you. You can also ignore adjacent properties, busy streets, etc., that may generate numerous false alarms. You can also disable the camera or limit access to your recordings via the application. The Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus also includes a remote siren feature, which you can use to scare off unwanted visitors.</p>
<p>Installation requires a standard 4-inch-diameter round weatherproof electrical enclosure, with your current AC wiring used to ensure the camera remains continuously powered. Once installed, the camera connects to your 2.4 GHz WiFi network so that live video feed and motion alerts are sent directly to your mobile device. If you desire additional video storage and more sophisticated alert options, you can purchase a Ring Protect subscription separately. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5638/">The unit comes complete with the camera, mounting bracket, basic tool kit, and user manual, and can now be purchased on Amazon for $120, which is $60 less than the regular price of $180.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/starfield-2-0-update-ps5-release-date-expansion-switch-2-2000666046</link>
            <guid>1427017</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>A leaker by the name of Graczdari, who previously correctly leaked release date information about the PS5 port of </span><i><span>Microsoft Flight Simulator</span></i><span> and the physical release of </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</span></i><span>, has reportedly revealed the exact release date of the long-rumored PlayStation 5 port for </span><i><span>Starfield</span></i><span>: April 7, 2026.</span></p>

 <p><span>This information comes via a report from the Polish website </span><a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/398522/potwierdzamy-starfield-na-ps5-premiera-za-rowne-dwa-miesiace.html"><i><span>PPE</span></i></a><span>, which also features an image from Graczdari that lists the alleged Product Numbers and European Article Numbers (EAN) for both the standard and Premium Edition PS5 ports of </span><i><span>Starfield</span></i><span>. Said information does vaguely line up with </span><i><span>Starfield</span></i><span>’s </span><span>upcoming Terran Armada DLC, which Bethesda has been teasing </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-ps5-version-of-starfield-could-be-announced-soon-as-insider-shares-potential-release-date/"><span>since September 2025</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>While the listed EAN for the PS5 Premium Edition of </span><i><span>Starfield </span></i><span>is exactly the same as the EAN for the Xbox Series Premium Edition for </span><i><span>Starfield</span></i><span>, the EAN Graczdari shared for the reported standard edition PS5 port does seem to be unique. That being said, every reputable EAN and GTIN lookup site I used to verify this information stated that no such product exists.</span></p> <p><span>However, GS1, the global authority on barcode identification and the largest supply chain identification organization, </span><a href="https://www.gs1.org/services/verified-by-gs1/results?gtin=196388613724"><span>has verified the EAN</span></a><span> in Graczdari’s leak. While they don’t hold any specific product information regarding the EAN, they do hold information about which company licensed it: Microsoft Corporation.</span></p>

 <h2><em>Starfield</em>‘s rumored 2.0 overhaul</h2> <p>Though it received a big expansion in 2024, no notable updates came to<em> Starfield</em> in 2025. That’s left some fans wondering about Bethesda’s ongoing plans for the sci-fi RPG and others buzzing about a <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-2-0-expansion-bethesda-ps5-2000654580">potential big 2.0 overhaul</a> coming to the game later this year. Several prominent YouTubers, including MrMattyPlays, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXqlxb0a6xk&amp;t=8136s">said they were shown a 2.0 update</a> for <em>Starfield</em> behind closed doors, but weren’t actually allowed to mention what was in it and had no idea when it might actually be ready to ship.</p>

 <p><span>While that may add some legitimacy to the leak, it’s important to keep in mind that the EAN could be for any as-of-yet unpublished Microsoft product. Plus, while Graczdari’s previous leaks may have been correct, one of their recent viral claims, that the physical release of </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto VI </span></i><span>would be launching later than its digital edition, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/no-gta-6-isnt-skipping-physical-discs-at-launch-2000665471"><span>was debunked earlier this week</span></a><span> by Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, rumors regarding a PS5 port of </span><i><span>Starfield </span></i><span>have been floating around since early 2024. Given Microsoft’s recent track record of porting all of its first-party titles to PlayStation, a port for Bethesda’s 2023 spacefaring RPG is now a matter of when more than if. We’ll see if that ends up being in the next few months. Rumors of a Switch 2 port of the game, on the other hand, are now <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ppe-pl-starfield-is-coming-to-ps5-on-april-7th.1426351/#post-150924481">looking less likely</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

It's called Paranormasight: The Mermaid's Curse, and it's coming out in just two weeks, on February 19.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mermaid's Curse follows a young pearl diver named Yuza who one day, while working, sees a ghostly version of himself. This sets off a chain of other strange incidents: corpses washing up, a girl with no memories, and townsfolks with ulterior motives. As Yuza, you'll question people around the island to try and find out what's going on, while also diving into the waters of the bay for clues. All of it has ties somehow to a centuries-old legend of a mermaid, and true to form, it all seems kind of creepy!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-2-5-2026-4-23-screenshot-1770304325031.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Paranormasight debuted in 2023 on Switch, PC, and mobile. While thematically similar, it told a different mystery story with different characters, and it's unclear if there will be narrative times between The Seven Mysteries of Honjo and The Mermaid's Curse. The first Paranormasight was well-received, and currently stands at an 85 critic score and 8.9 user score on Metacritic. We're still waiting to hear if the new game will come to other platforms, but given the mobile and PC releases of The Seven Mysteries of Honjo, it seems like a reasonable expectation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at today's Nintendo Direct <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-everything-announced-updating-live">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-second-take-preview</link>
            <guid>1427005</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Listen, I’m always going to have a Leon-sized hole that needs filling and from playing his portions in the latest Resident Evil 9 Requiem demo, I’m pretty sure I’ll be taken care of (for the year, at least). The roundhouse kicks, the corny one liners, and the brutal blood-splattering finishers – things I loved from the recent Resident Evil 4 remake round out what’s otherwise a terrifying survival horror experience. And the crux of that survival horror is stealth and having the proper mechanics in place to make that tension tangible. So, not only does Grace’s side of Requiem evoke a petrifying sense of dread atop the classic puzzle-solving of the series, it’s also a fantastic expression of the kind of stealth-action gameplay I’ve been wanting for a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-the-final-preview">Our previous Resident Evil 9 Requiem preview</a> by my colleague Dale Driver touched on plenty of sentiments I share; most notable for me being the refreshing balance between the drastically different playstyles of Grace and Leon as dual protagonists. Grace being timid and having to rely on moving slowly and carefully, contrasting with Leon being the action hero who blasts through every zombie. But it’s the Grace sections where Capcom is doing something really special with stealth gameplay that feels natural and forward-thinking.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom has made a big deal out of zombie behavior where their presumed personalities as humans feed into how they move and react in the game world as zombies. One example being the zombie fixated on light switches in a dark hallway you have to pass through as Grace – instead of taking him head-on with your limited resources, you can slip by and hit a light switch down the hall to distract him to clear the path to the other end. While this isn’t a complicated situation on its own, it’s a microcosm of how Requiem is challenging you as Grace, where observation and environment are just as important as staying out of sight. The game doesn’t outright tell you this, so thinking outside the box can lead to more elegant solutions.</p><p>What’s more frightening is the butcher who roams the kitchen...<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This notion of watching out for zombie behavior is flipped around at times, too. Like when walking through the dining room where zombies are just feasting on the dead bodies on the table, not giving a damn about your presence and leaving you alone. I wasn’t sure if they’d react to me poking around picking up items, yet I still treaded carefully and let them do their thing. Naturally figuring out how these enemies respond to you and their surroundings is a fascinating way to give variety to navigating the labyrinthine halls, and a touch of detail that isn’t often seen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s more frightening is the butcher who roams the kitchen. Early in the preview, you have to slip through by pushing a cart to clear the path across the kitchen, and you have to do this undetected, which requires you to pay attention to his patrol pattern. It’s simple enough, and making a mistake means he’ll chase you down and show you how terrifying he is; one hit and you’re dead. But later in the playthrough where you have to revisit that general area, he begins patrolling the hallways around the kitchen, and here, his presence is truly felt. Hearing his footsteps set off alarms in my brain that he began lurking, and the tension that created changed how I navigated an area I already mapped out.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">I would duck and peek out from adjacent rooms to see if he was coming, and make a mad dash to where I needed to go hoping for the best and not looking back. One time, I was peeking from the parlor room thinking I was out of sight, but the butcher caught me peeking just a little too confidently and pulled up on me – I now had this cat-and-mouse chase, luring him in one direction before juking him to get out of the room.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Probably the biggest comedy of errors during my playtime came from dashing to the cold storage room where my next objective was. I had a straight shot from, like, three hallways down and I risked it all by booking it and letting fate take the wheel. Just as I got to the last stretch, there was the butcher turning the corner and ending up right in front of me along his new patrol pattern. I backpedaled in a panic, pumped my one remaining shot from the superpowered Requiem pistol and the rest of my 9mm rounds, but it wasn’t enough; so I just took the L and reloaded my save. </p><span data-cy="faceoff-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The first time I got hit with a jump scare was when Chunk burst out into a hallway after I picked up a quest item. It began chasing me and it was easy enough to run to a room for safety since it couldn’t get through normal-sized door frames. But the rest of the surrounding hallways were fair game. And like many Resident Evils with puzzles, backtracking to this area later on filled me with dread. Thankfully, Chunk wasn’t as overbearing, but it’d more frequently completely block certain paths, forcing me to either take the long way around or wait things out until the coast was clear. But on my first attempt, I wasn’t exactly sure what its behavior pattern would be. And that’s a key part of making stealth gameplay interesting and horror work well – it’s that unpredictable nature of hostility.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These stalker-type enemies aren’t meant to be killed (as Grace, at least), and they’re also not quite like the persistent threats of Mr. X from Resident Evil 2 or Nemesis in Resident Evil 3. Each one seems to play different roles and present a different kind of dread throughout Requiem, which I suspect will lead to more variation. Even thinking back to the very first Requiem preview I played last year with the monstrous patient roaming the halls of the patient wing in Grace’s opening section, that was closer to a specifically scripted sequence. But it was a much more close-quarters stealth challenge where the windows of opportunity to escape were tighter. So, already, that’s three unique enemies playing into a horror experience in their own ways.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Requiem being primarily a survival horror game means it’s going to be a bit outside of what I traditionally expect from stealth-action games; or rather the stealth mechanics you see in so many action games. Hiding in tall grass, waiting for enemies to turn their backs, and getting a one-hit kill undetected is a tired trope at this point. Grace does get craftable single-use items for stealth kills, and I hope we’re challenged by limiting quantities so we have to really consider when to use them. But even then, Requiem doesn’t just deal in patrol patterns or throwing an object to cause a distraction, it also deals in vulnerability and the fear of unpredictability for Grace’s chapters. It’s not just the fear of getting detected, but the consequences that come with it. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Grace's portion of Requiem was about an hour-and-a-half to two hours of playtime. And after that, I was pretty exhausted from the tension. Don’t get me wrong, I was exhausted in a good way. However, that’s what makes the interstitial Leon sections so important. They’re a reprieve and an outlet to get all that stress out, a palette cleanser to balance things out and look at some of the same environments from a different perspective. This also offers a sort of best-of-both-worlds for the series, the slow and deliberate pacing of Resident Evil 7 alongside the top-tier action from Resident Evil 4, as examples.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After getting hands-on with a total of about four hours of Resident Evil 9 Requiem at this point, and sharing that experience with colleagues, I’m more excited for the series than I have been in recent memory. It’s the old mixed with the new, but all in a modern package with two protagonists I already like a lot. No shade to RE7 and RE Village, but Ethan Winters doesn’t compare to Grace, and definitely not my guy Leon. And with a thoughtful mix of action and stealth gameplay, February 27 can’t come soon enough when Resident Evil 9 Requiem hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-second-take-preview]]></content:encoded>

Developed from the ground-up for asymmetrical <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [683 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a>, <em>Orbitals</em> invites players to grab a friend and blast off into an experience unlike any other.</p><p>In <em>Orbitals</em>, players will team up and take on the roles of Maki and Omura, two inseparable explorers with a whole lot more determination than on-the-job experience. Working together, they will brave the perils of space to save their crumbling space station home from the dangers of a supernatural cosmic storm. Whether it’s by using unique tools to open the path forward, piloting their spaceship through dangerous asteroid fields or taking a break and soaking up the lavish anime-inspired atmosphere, players will embark on an intergalactic adventure and forge new bonds as friends together.</p><p>Developed in Unreal Engine 5, <em>Orbitals</em> takes full advantage of the <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [937 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> hardware to deliver an unforgettable cooperative experience regardless of your preferred way of connecting together. Either by teaming up with two pairs of Joy-Con 2 controllers on a single Nintendo Switch 2 device for split-screen local cooperative play, using the system’s GameShare feature to share <em>Orbitals</em> with another local player on a compatible Nintendo Switch 2 or <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [23,533 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> Switch device, or by matchmaking online with their friends and taking advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2’s built-in microphone and GameChat for crystal-clear communications, players around the world can team up and save the day together as one inseparable team.</p><p><em>Orbitals</em> captures the warmth and style of classic Japanese anime, brought to life with authentic detail and clear reverence by the Tokyo-based development team at Shapefarm. The artists and developers at the studio have lovingly created a brand-new original world inspired by retro anime from the early ’90s and brought the artform to life in a way never before seen. Additionally, the developers have partnered with Studio Massket, the animation house behind hundreds of some of the most beloved and popular Japanese anime, to create hand-crafted cutscenes for the game for that extra layer of authenticity for fans of the anime medium. Combined with both full Japanese and English audio dubs, Shapefarm intends to honor the anime artform with a cooperative playable adventure that fans can fall in love with.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
