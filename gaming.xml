<p>Sports Interactive has announced that Football Manager 25 has officially been cancelled. The decision comes after multiple delays of the game for various development reasons.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>, the studio says they will now shift focus to the next release of the game.</p>



<p>“We know this will come as a huge disappointment, especially given that the release date has already moved twice, and you have been eagerly anticipating the first gameplay reveal,” Sports Interactive said. “We can only apologise for the time it has taken to communicate this decision. Due to stakeholder compliance, including legal and financial regulations, today was the earliest date that we could issue this statement.”</p>



<p>Originally<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-again-features-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> scheduled to release last fall</a>, Football Manager 25 was then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-to-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed again</a> into March 2025. The delays come, in part, due to the game’s transition from the proprietary Sports Interactive Operating System (SIOS)&nbsp;to the Unity engine. Despite the delays, the team says it didn’t achieve what it was hoping for in multiple areas of the game “despite the phenomenal efforts of our team”.</p>



<p>“Whilst many areas of the game have hit our targets, the overarching player experience and interface is not where we need it to be,” they said. “As extensive evaluation has demonstrated, including consumer playtesting, we have clear validation for the new direction of the game and are getting close – however, we’re too far away from the standards you deserve.”</p>



<p>They continued by saying the game could’ve still been released “in its current state” while fixing things post launch. However, they didn’t believe it to be the right thing to do for the players who have been supporting the franchise for years. They were also “unwilling” to push the release date any further than March due to it being so late in the current season.  Instead, everything will be put towards Football Manager 26.</p>



<p>As far as why they didn’t cancel the game earlier, the team says that there was a “strong belief” that they could reach their targets for the game despite the delays. However, more challenges that came up meant that they could no longer achieve their goals.</p>



<p>“Through the cancellation, every effort is now focused on ensuring that our next release achieves our goal and hits the quality level we all expect,” they said. “We will update you on how we are progressing with that as soon as we are able to do so.”</p>



<p>Players who pre-ordered the game will receive a full refund either through their retailer.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/football-manager-25-an-annual-sports-game-has-been-scrapped-and-won%E2%80%99t-be-out-this-season.1102863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/football-manager-25-cancelled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hey, remember how back in October <a href="https://aftermath.site/football-manager-25-sports-game-delay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I had so many nice things to say about Sports Interactive, and the <em>Football Manager</em> studio's brave decision</a> to buck the sports gaming trend and go to the trouble of rebuilding their entire game on a new engine? Yeah, about that. </p><p>Turns out it's been an absolute disaster. First, in September 2024, <em>Football Manager 25's </em>international mode--where players could manage national sides like England and Brazil--<a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was binned</a>. Then in October (the games are normally released in November) it was delayed until March 2025. Then promises were made that the first gameplay footage for the game would be shown in January 2025.</p><p>As you can probably tell by looking at a calendar, January 2025 came and went without said footage, leading many fans to fear the worst. Fears that have proved entirely founded, as Sports Interactive today announced that they're scrapping the whole damn thing. <em>Football Manager 25</em> is being canned and there simply won't be a game in the long-running annual series released this season.</p><p>The team's statement reads:</p><blockquote><p>Sports Interactive regret to inform that, following extensive internal discussion and careful consideration with SEGA, we have made the difficult decision to cancel Football Manager 25 and shift our focus to the next release.</p><p>For the large numbers of you who pre-ordered FM25, we thank you enormously for your trust and support - we're very sorry to have let you down.</p><p>We know this will come as a huge disappointment, especially given that the release date has already moved twice, and you have been eagerly anticipating the first gameplay reveal. We can only apologise for the time it has taken to communicate this decision. Due to stakeholder compliance, including legal and financial regulations, today was the earliest date that we could issue this statement.</p><p>We have always prided ourselves on delivering the best value for money games that bring you countless hours of enjoyment, that feel worth every moment and every penny you spend. With the launch of FM25 we set out to create the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation, laying the building blocks for a new era.</p><p>Due to a variety of challenges that we've been open about to date, and many more unforeseen, we currently haven't achieved what we set out to do in enough areas of the game, despite the phenomenal efforts of our team. Each decision to delay the release was made with the aim of getting the game closer to the desired level but, as we approached critical milestones at the turn of the year, it became unmistakably clear that we would not achieve the standard required, even with the adjusted timeline.</p><p>Whilst many areas of the game have hit our targets, the overarching player experience and interface is not where we need it to be. As extensive evaluation has demonstrated, including consumer playtesting, we have clear validation for the new direction of the game and are getting close - however, we're too far away from the standards you deserve.</p><p>We could have pressed on, released FM25 in its current state, and fixed things down the line - but that's not the right thing to do. We were also unwilling to go beyond a March release as it would be too late in the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the year.</p><div><p>Through the cancellation, every effort is now focused on ensuring that our next release achieves our goal and hits the quality level we all expect. We will update you on how we are progressing with that as soon as we are able to do so.</p><p>Thank you for reading, your patience and your continued support. Our full focus now returns to creating a new era for Football Manager.</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>There'll be sadness and frustration from Football Manager obsessives in the days and weeks to come, sure! This long-running series has a lot of equally long-running fans, who are extremely passionate about the game. But hopefully, after they've all taken a deep breath, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-fc-madden-nba-2k-recycled-dogshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">looked at the situation and the wider sports gaming malaise in general</a>, they'll be somewhat happy with this.</p><p>Sports Interactive didn't have to do this! They could have ploughed on through the years, like EA Sports have done, and release an increasingly tired sports game that slowly bled its fanbase away, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ea-shares-slump-after-annual-forecast-cut-fans-fears-over-soccer-franchise-2025-01-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wondering all the while why sales were in decline</a>. It was a brave decision for SI to tear down their annual sports game and start over, and while it was a risk that has blown up in their faces <em>this season</em>, I'll repeat now what I said when the first delay was announced: "Whatever happens to <em>Football Manager 25</em>, I'm a lot more optimistic about <em>Football Manager 26</em> and <em>27</em> than I am about any other big sports game."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/esa-iicon-e3"><h3>Vowels Are Back As ESA Announces New Conference</h3></a><p>The Interactive Innovation Conference will focus on where games connect to other industries</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Sega and Sports Interactive have scrapped Football Manager 25, and will now refocus on getting ready for the series' next release.
</p>
<p>
The announcement this morning, made as part of Sega's latest financial results, is a surprise move for the annual sporting franchise. But it follows repeated delays for FM25 - which had been billed as the biggest leap forward for the series in a generation.
</p>
<p>
Previous setbacks saw FM25 delayed twice, with its most recent postponement meaning it was set to arrive at an awkward moment, mid-football season. It would also have meant Sports Interactive needing to sell two entries in the series - FM25 and the expected FM26 - within the same calendar year. 
</p>
<p>
Now, FM25 is no more - something Sports Interactive has today issued an apology for, and said that anyone who had pre-ordered the game would now be automatically refunded. 
</p>
<p>
"For the large numbers of you who pre-ordered FM25, we thank you enormously for your trust and support – we're very sorry to have let you down," a <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-1">statement</a> from Sports Interactive reads. 
</p>
<p>
"We know this will come as a huge disappointment, especially given that the release date has already moved twice, and you have been eagerly anticipating the first gameplay reveal."
</p>
<p>
As previously announced, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-24-cannot-be-updated-with-new-season-assets-says-sports-interactive">there will be no update to the series' most recent entry, FM24, with fresh player data</a>. This would be a "substantial undertaking" that would "divert critical resources away from the development of the next release which requires our full focus", Sports Interactive said today, and the cancellation of FM25 has not changed this.
</p>
<p>
Sports Interactive had previously said it would update fans in January 2025 - a deadline it says it was forced to miss by a week due to compliance with Sega being a publicly traded company.
</p>
<p>
"We can only apologise for the time it has taken to communicate this decision. Due to stakeholder compliance, including legal and financial regulations, today was the earliest date that we could issue this statement."
</p>
<p>
Sports Interactive blamed the decision on "a variety of challenges that we've been open about to date, and many more unforeseen".
</p>
<p>
"As we approached critical milestones at the turn of the year, it became unmistakably clear that we would not achieve the standard required, even with the adjusted timeline," the statement continues.
</p>
<p>
"Whilst many areas of the game have hit our targets, the overarching player experience and interface is not where we need it to be. As extensive evaluation has demonstrated, including consumer playtesting, we have clear validation for the new direction of the game and are getting close – however, we're too far away from the standards you deserve.
</p>
<p>
"We could have pressed on, released FM25 in its current state, and fixed things down the line - but that's not the right thing to do. We were also unwilling to go beyond a March release as it would be too late in the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the year.
</p>
<p>
"Through the cancellation, every effort is now focused on ensuring that our next release achieves our goal and hits the quality level we all expect. We will update you on how we are progressing with that as soon as we are able to do so.
</p>
<p>
"Thank you for reading, your patience and your continued support. Our full focus now returns to creating a new era for Football Manager."
</p>
<p>
Last year, Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell sat down with Sports Interactive boss Miles Jacobson for an in-depth chat on the studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fm25-is-not-a-continuation-of-fm24-the-big-football-manager-interview">plans for the future of the Football Manager franchise</a>, and to hear why "FM25 is not a continuation of FM24". The chat covers discussion on the state of Game Pass, AI and the Premier League - plus detail on why some past Football Manager features had to go.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-patents-show-the-switch-2-joy-con-may-indeed-work-like-a-mouse-%E2%80%94-and-so-might-a-new-controller.1102779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/608018/nintendo-switch-2-patents-joy-con-pro-controller-mouse-magnets<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Newly-published Nintendo patents show that the company has been exploring a version of its Joy-Con controllers that can work like a computer mouse, a feature Nintendo has hinted will be coming to the Switch 2. In its Switch 2 teaser video last month, Nintendo showed two Joy-Con controllers sliding along the ground, much like you’d move a mouse.</p><p>But mouse-like functionality may not just be limited to Joy-Cons: the patents also show that Nintendo has explored adding mouse-like functionality to a split controller with a larger, more traditionally-sized grip.</p><p>Images <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027803">in one patent</a> show a Joy-Con being held horizontally, with the SR and SL buttons facing downward, and a person’s thumbs on the control sticks. This seems to indicate that the optical sensor would be facing downward so that you can hold and move the controller on a surface like a mouse. </p><p>Another image shows the left Joy-Con being used upright while the right Joy-Con is used in this mouse mode — imagine WASD, but with your Switch controllers. In a machine translation of the patent, which is in Japanese, the term “mouse operation sensor” appears 28 times, which suggests that there will be technology inside the controllers that makes them work like a mouse.</p><p>Mouse-like Joy-Con have been rumored for a while, but I’ve been wondering if or how that functionality would translate to a more standard controller. Based on the patent drawings, Nintendo has designed a split controller with more traditional console grips, and it appears that at least the right side of the controller could be placed on a surface and operated like a mouse.</p><p><a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027804">Another patent</a> shows that these Joy-Con will be able to slot into a wrist strap attachment that looks similar to the ones for the original Switch. A machine translation of that patent includes the word “magnet” 355 times, which seems to indicate that the wrist strap could attach magnetically to the Joy-Con. I’m guessing that means that the Joy-Con themselves could attach to the Switch 2 console magnetically as well, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">which has been rumored</a>.</p><p>That second patent also shows what looks to be a controller dock of some kind where the Joy-Con can be laid down and presumably charged.</p><p>Patents don’t always translate directly into actual, shipping products, so it’s possible that these are designs Nintendo explored but never pursued. But given the rumors around this tech, and Nintendo’s own hints in the same direction, there’s a good chance these offer an early look at how some of the Switch 2’s new features might work.</p><div><p>Nintendo is set to release the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">Switch 2</a> sometime in 2025. The company plans to reveal more about the console in a Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">on April 2nd</a> and is making preparations to try to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606817/nintendo-switch-2-production-demand-q-a">meet demand</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sid-meier%E2%80%99s-colonization-is-the-american-video-game.1102773/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been dying to play a 4X game lately, but having yet to really dig into <em>Civilization VII</em> (which has landed to<a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17742/sid-meiers-civilization-vii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> some pretty middling reviews</a>!), and which follows in the wake of some pretty disappointing 4X games (<a href="https://aftermath.site/humankind-re-review-amplitude-impressions-pc-sega-4x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Humankind</em></a>,<a href="https://aftermath.site/millennia-4x-paradox-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Millennia</em></a>, <em>Ara</em>) over the past few years, last week I reached back for one of my favourite--albeit contentious--games of all time: <em>Sid Meier's Colonization</em>.</p><p>I started playing it mostly because it is, to this day, the most laser-focused 4X game available, and as a result the least meandering. <em>Colonization </em>is everything the genre does best--exploration, combat, building little towns and putting little guys to work--and almost none of what it has struggled most with, like convincing diplomacy and dead turns.</p><figure></figure><p>For those who have never played (or heard!) of it: <em>Colonization </em>was released in 1994 on the PC, starts in 1492 and tasks you with choosing to represent one of four imperial European nations--England, Spain, France or the Netherlands--then setting forth to found new colonies in the new world. It is, superficially, a game very much like Sid Meier's more famous series, <em>Civilization</em>, in that you drop guys on a map, build settlements and dig roads and fields between them, but with one notable difference: in <em>Colonization</em> you are controlling a nation of individual guys.</p><p>Some are carpenters, others scouts. There are soldiers, blacksmiths, weavers, priests and teachers. The key to <em>Colonization </em>is recruiting and assigning these guys--and they're all guys--to the parts of the colonies they're best suited to, in order to maximise the amount of resources you can extract, maximise the amount of stuff you make out of those resources and maximise the amount of money you can make selling that stuff back to eager European markets.</p><figure><figcaption>This screen is where you interact with your home port in Europe, buying and selling goods and recruiting immigrants to the colonies.</figcaption></figure><p>Got a colony near a forest? Get a lumberjack and carpenter in there. Next to some mountains? Ship an ore miner over from the old country, dig that metal out of the ground and get a blacksmith to turn it into tools, which you can then turn into muskets. The degree of specialisation available to your population and settlements in this game goes <em>way </em>past <em>Civ</em>, and makes the act of choosing, growing and tending to your settlements the best in the genre.</p><p>Making <em>Colonization </em>even more interesting is that events don't meander towards a finish line, but rather towards a sharp point. The aim is to build up your colonies to a sufficient strength that you can, ala 1776, break free from your mother country. This involves a war of independence where, just like 1776, a seemingly overpowering opponent can be cut down in the woods by some plucky upstarts who know the land, which they've been building on and working for over 200 years.</p><p>Between managing your colonies, tweaking your trade market, dealing with other European nations and preparing for your own [town name] Tea Party, there's never a dull moment in <em>Colonization</em>, and the way the 4X structure works so perfectly for the setting and time period makes it feel like the entire genre was made just for this. For a game from 1994 to loom so large over the genre even&nbsp; in 2025, even after all the <em>Civilization </em>games and their competitors, is testament to the strength and clarity of its design.</p><figure><figcaption>Nearly every American tribe and nation you encounter greets you warmly and offers to share the land with you, hoping for 'everlasting peace'...</figcaption></figure><p>Only, uh. There's a reason we don't really talk about it as much these days. This is also a game with substantial problems. That land you're colonising and developing isn't empty; when you first step off your ships in 1492 you discover that the new world is home to a myriad of nations and tribes, already living in settlements and cities of their own.</p><p><em>Colonization </em>may be the perfect 4X game, but it's also the perfect expression of imperialist thought in strategy video game design, of the idea that progression is everything, that the land you're invading is there to be exploited. <em>Civilization </em>has long had this issue--it's a game that too frequently equates technological progress with dominance--but while there's little introspection to be had in that game when your musketmen roll over some tribal warriors, in <em>Colonization</em> its multiple layers of history and context are unavoidable.</p><p>To its slight credit, and I'm being extremely generous relative to the time it was released here (2009's <em>Empire Total War </em>can only wish it was this nuanced), this game isn't an overt genocide simulator. It certainly <em>allows </em>for the extermination of historical Native American tribes, ranging from the Aztecs to the Sioux, and will even reward the player for doing so by freeing up more land for colonies and offering cash prizes for the destruction of larger settlements. But you are not <em>forced </em>into that route.</p><p>Players are also given the choice--an ahistorical video game fantasy--of living peacefully alongside these nations, sharing resources and knowledge and respecting traditional boundaries. You're rewarded for this too: Tribes will send people to live with you as bonus colonists, trade with you and even teach your colonists expert and much-needed skills like fishing.</p><p>These reward pathways are lopsided though, reflecting the way so much strategy gaming has been trapped within Western history's framework. Sure, there's a peaceful option on the table, but the amount of gold and resources you get for killing the indigenous people off makes it by far the most advantageous pursuit from a gameplay perspective. <em>Colonization </em>isn't <em>making </em>you commit genocide, but in recreating a specific point in history (1492) and asking you to get to <em>another </em>point in history (1776), it's basically telling you the best way to get there is to...follow that history.</p><figure><figcaption>Your conflict with the Old World is made almost inevitable by an escalating series of taxes, which eventually cripples your trade income and forces you into revolutionary action (you can't hold "parties" forever). </figcaption></figure><p>The ultimate goal of the game, regardless of which European nation you start out as, it to build your own United States of America, and the game's story as it is, told through cutscenes and your increasingly hostile diplomacy with your ruling monarch, is full of familiar-sounding ideals when it comes to the American foundational ethos. You're embarking on a brave mission. You build a colony by enduring hardships. You end up fighting a War of Independence to protect your people, to serve freedom in its opposition against tyranny. The same touchstones you see echoing throughout American history books and popular media can be found in <em>Colonization</em>.</p><p>The thing is, the narrative arc of <em>Colonization </em>is as wafer-thin as America's; you're really just building your little video game America exactly the same way the real one was built. From the mass importation of religious fanatics, ruthless opportunists and murderous imperialists, to the seizure of vast tracts of land to the genocide of entire nations.</p><p>(It's very notable the game doesn't allow for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster_1931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a more gradual, Canadian or Australian-style pathway to nationhood</a>, let alone one like New Zealand's, which featured<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Waitangi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a formal and lasting treaty signed with the Māori people</a>).</p><figure></figure><p>The conflict between what the United States <em>thinks </em>it is and what it <em>actually </em>is has been perhaps the most dominant force in the study of American history, not to mention popular culture's depiction of it, which can range everywhere from fairy tales like <em>The Patriot</em> to <em>American History X</em>. Rarely has that played out so literally as <em>Colonization,</em> a spin-off strategy title by some guys toying with the 4X genre that has, by design or not, ended up being perhaps the most American video game ever made.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/esa-iicon-e3"><h3>Vowels Are Back As ESA Announces New Conference</h3></a><p>The Interactive Innovation Conference will focus on where games connect to other industries</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The S90C uses Samsung's proprietary quantum dot (QD) OLED panel. QD OLED panels are brighter than traditional OLED panels without losing the color accuracy, range, and wide-viewing angles that OLEDs are known for.

The S90F will also feature the Gen 3 processor, 144Hz refresh rate with VRR, and a QD OLED panel with up to 1,300 nits of brightness (for TV models 55" and up).

            <p>
Switch 2 might have been officially revealed, but there's still a whole lot we don't know about it. And while Nintendo is staying stubbornly tightlipped until April, a newly surfaced patent appears to confirm at least a few previously reported details the company has so far only teased.
</p>
<p>
Mostly, we're talking Joy-Cons here, with early reports having claimed Switch 2's detachable controllers would include a few new tricks not seen in those of the original console. That starts with magnets, with Switch 2's Joy-Cons have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-report-details-magnetic-joy-con">long been rumoured to use magnets</a> to attach to the console instead of the finicky rails system used previously.
</p>
<p>
Which brings us to Nintendo's <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027801&amp;_cid=P22-M6TRNW-94344-1">newly unearthed game controller patent</a>, initially filed in August 2023 and published today. "This game controller is detachably mounted to a body device that has a recess," it reads, "that comprises a first magnet and a second magnet at the bottom of the recess, and that can execute game processing."
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the patent gives some additional insight into how the magnets have been implemented to avoid randomly dropping off at inconvenient intervals. "The first button and the second button are provided in the longitudinal direction in the top surface of the protrusion," Nintendo writes. "The first button and the second button are to be pressed by a user. The first button is attracted to the first magnet by a magnetic force. The second button is attracted to the second magnet by a magnetic force."
</p>
<p>
Admittedly, the inclusion of magnets isn't much of a revelation - Switch 2's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">reveal trailer</a> already suggested as much - but Nintendo hasn't actually made it official. And it's a similar story for built-in Joy-Con mouse functionality, another rumoured feature for Switch 2. January's reveal trailer certainly lent credence to those earlier reports, what with it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">including a controller sliding suspiciously around on its side</a>, but, again, it's a feature not yet made official.
</p>
<p>
Back over in the patent, however, and Nintendo has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lhjtpx27ja2b">included a diagram</a> of a right Joy-Con being used just like a mouse. Its detachable edge is face down on a surface while the user grips it mouse-style, one finger on the bumper - presumably for clicking input - and a thumb on the control stick. Other illustrations show a user dual-wielding two Joy-Cons mouse-style, like some sort of mouse-using ninja, while another shows a Joy-Con being deployed mouse-like in one hand and in standard formation in the other. Flexibility is apparently key.
</p>
<p>
It is, if nothing else, an interesting reminder that's there's still so much to learn about Nintendo's new console following a reveal that was light on just about everything. Beyond, that is, a general glimpse of Switch 2's Switch-but-more-so aesthetic, and a new Mario Kart that's managed to illicit chatter as wide ranging as 'Could this possibly be open world?!' right through to 'What on earth have they done to Donkey Kong?!'.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, no solid answers to the many questions we have about Switch 2 will likely come until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">April's Nintendo Direct</a> - which will hopefully finally include the Captain Rainbow revival we've all been waiting for. Until then, feel free to direct your gaze elsewhere on Eurogamer for a refresher of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">everything we currently know about Switch 2</a>. You can probably add 'almost definitely magnets' and 'mouse, eh?' to that list now too.

                <p>Earlier this year, Nintendo debuted a brief first look at the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=switch+2+gamespot&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switch 2</a> which didn't offer many details about the new console. However, there was a moment in the teaser video where the next generation of Joy-Cons appeared to move over a flat surface like a mouse. Now, <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027803" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Japanese patent application filed in August 2023</a> appears to confirm that the Joy-Cons will have mouse capabilities.</p><p>The application was publicly revealed on February 6, and it includes an early schematic for the new Joy-Con, which it describes as the "input device." The patent also states that it has "a sensor for mouse operation," which functions in a similar way that normal mice work with computers. </p><p>Adding the mouse capabilities open up some intriguing possibilities for gameplay on Switch 2. Will shooter fans have the option to use the mouse instead of the conventional controller? This could potentially work very well with PC games that were designed to be played with mouse. It's also possible that Nintendo is working on some new titles that can take advantage of these mouse functions in ways we haven't thought of yet.</p><p>What we know for sure is that more details about Switch 2 will be revealed during the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/nintendo-direct/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct on April 2</a>. Thus far, Nintendo has only teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-mario-kart-may-have-been-revealed-in-switch-2-trailer/1100-6528850/">a new Mario Kart game</a>, but there are<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128"> plenty of titles rumored to be heading to Switch 2</a>. EA recently hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-may-return-to-nintendo-with-switch-2-ea-ceo-hints/1100-6529253/">the Madden NFL and EA Sports FC franchises could appear on Switch 2</a>. As for the previous console generation, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/">Switch 2 will be backward compatible with Switch games</a>, but it isn't clear how many titles will be playable on both systems. Regardless, fans will be able to test out the new system for themselves at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-to-try-the-switch-2-before-its-released/1100-6528849/">Switch 2 experience events</a> around the world.</p>

After the world found out how much of a genocidal maniac his father Omni-Man (J.K. Simmons) is, the young superhero had to deal with civilians being afraid of him when he was trying to help, Cecil Stedman (Walton Goggins) being wary of Invincible fighting for the Global Defense Agency (GDA), and his own self-doubt over whether he might one day become his father. After the first three episodes of <em>Invincible </em>season 3, it’s clear that those closest to the titular hero might need contingency plans in the event he goes rogue. And that includes the woman he loves.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-recommend-id="image://f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="145" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kotaku Spoiler Warning" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kotaku Spoiler Warning" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Graphic<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-recommend-id="image://f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="145" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kotaku Spoiler Warning" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The show has previously hinted at Mark’s struggles with doing what’s right without doing what’s lethal. Let’s not forget he ended season 2 in a more brutal way than his father ended Season 1, pummeling multidimensional terrorist Angstrom Levy (Sterling K. Brown) to his death because he threatened to hurt Mark’s family. He rationalizes the murder even while criticizing Cecil in the Season 3 premiere for allowing Darkwing (Lennie James) and D.A. Sinclair (Ezra Miller) to work for the GDA after killing people themselves, demonstrating the kind of moral double standard that could sprout into bloody vigilante justice.</p><p> Let’s also not forget that Levy showed us an alternate reality future in which Invincible teams up with his father to enslave Earth, a future that isn’t totally ruled out as one that may come to pass. Add in the fact his younger brother <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/invincible-season-3-jk-simmons-omni-man-oliver-1851756268&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/invincible-season-3-jk-simmons-omni-man-oliver-1851756268">Oliver channelled</a></span> his father’s genetic predisposition for duty-bound murder when he slaughtered the Mauler Twins in Season 3's third episode, and it’s no wonder Cecil implanted a device in Mark’s brain to subdue him at a moment’s notice and has an army of robots ready to take him down.</p><p>All that taken into consideration, Earth’s best chance at stopping an evil Invincible could be the overpowered Atom Eve, who Mark falls in love with in Season 3, and who also fights against him in his tyrannical alternate-reality future. Invincible may be able to destroy almost anything he comes in contact with, but Gillian Jacobs, who voices Atom Eve, says her character is more powerful than what we see in the show. </p><p>“My character and her powers are so immense that [<em>Invincible </em>series creator] Robert [Kirkman] says they struggle to find ways to not make her just instantly win,” Jacobs told <em>Kotaku</em>. “So, in one version of it, I think she could take down anyone, but they always come up with really interesting things that happen in fights so that can’t happen.”</p><figure id="" data-id="91be1c10e311e4ee2ef228ff7ac42ec0" data-recommend-id="image://91be1c10e311e4ee2ef228ff7ac42ec0" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="1688" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Atom Eve flying away" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Atom Eve flying away" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Courtesy of Prime</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="91be1c10e311e4ee2ef228ff7ac42ec0" data-recommend-id="image://91be1c10e311e4ee2ef228ff7ac42ec0" data-format="jpg" data-width="3000" data-height="1688" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Atom Eve flying away" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Nerfing Atom Eve’s powers makes total sense. Eve can materialize anything she thinks of. She created a treehouse from thin air in minutes, rearranges someone’s body on a molecular level, and creates a force field against intergalactic weapons she’s never seen before. The writers do give her limitations for fixing large-scale calamities and healing people by restructuring their molecules, but those are built into the limits of her imagination. She couldn’t build structurally sound homes for the homeless because she didn’t have that architectural expertise in her mind, something she opted to rectify. If she’s willing to take college architecture courses to learn how to build, she could also go to medical school and become truly unstoppable, learning how to shut down someone’s vital organs or rearranging their brain chemistry to make them go insane. But perhaps, when it comes to reaching Mark, there’s a more straightforward approach.</p><p>“She might be able to just get [Invincible] through talking. Maybe she could destroy his mind from the inside,” Jacobs says.</p><p>That is a hell of a contingency plan for a superhero who, we’ve already seen, finds certain sonic frequencies nothing short of debilitating. As of now, she has nothing to worry about with Mark/Invincible other than scheduling dates and taking down bad guys together. But the time could come when she needs to be more than invincible. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It means that for now at least, GTA 6 is still on track for its previously announced release window and has not been delayed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN ahead of the release of its financial report, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said that while "there's always a risk of slippage," the company "feel really good about it [fall 2025]."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look, there's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things," Zelnick responded when IGN asked how confident he was that Rockstar will hit fall 2025 for GTA 6. "So we feel really good about it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked for an update on how development on GTA 6 is going, Zelnick kept his cards close to his chest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look, I think the game is eagerly anticipated both internally and externally," he said. "We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs. I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success, so we're all running scared and looking over our shoulders and we know that the competition is not asleep. Our whole organization is super excited."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The GTA 6 release date is one of the hottest topics in all of entertainment, with rival publishers waiting with bated breath for Rockstar to make its announcement. Earlier this week, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-boss-willing-to-move-battlefield-release-date-to-account-for-nuanced-year-relative-to-competition-cough-gta-6-cough">he was willing to delay the new Battlefield</a> out of the next fiscal year depending on the release timing of its competitors’ games, a thinly veiled nod to the behemoth that is GTA 6.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While its release window remains firm, GTA 6's much-wanted Trailer 2 has yet to materialize. We're now over a year since Trailer 1's release, a gap that has caused plenty of feverish fan speculation. While you wait to find out, IGN has much more on GTA 6 to check out, including an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025"><u>the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</u></a>, Zelnick's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response"><u>coy response on whether GTA 6 is coming to PC</u></a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts"><u>whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking generally about Rockstar, Take-Two said Grand Theft Auto 5 has now sold-in an incredible 210 million units worldwide. GTA Online had a “strong” quarter, led by the Agents of Sabotage update. GTA+ memberships increased 10% year-over-year in the quarter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Dead Redemption 2, meanwhile, has sold-in more than 70 million copies. Take-Two noted it is currently seeing its highest level of concurrent players on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two has a busy 2025, with the just-released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> from Firaxis, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pga-tour-2k25">PGA Tour 2K25</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a> in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> in the summer, GTA 6 in the fall, and Gearbox’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> before year-end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are exceedingly optimistic about the commercial potential of our titles and believe that they will have a transformative effect on our business – and our industry – over the long term,” Take-Two said, before adding it remains “highly confident” it will achieve “sequential increases in, and record levels of, net bookings in fiscal 2026 and 2027.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> has now sold a staggering 210m copies, publisher Take-Two announced this evening in its latest financial results. 
</p>
<p>
The new total means Rockstar's wildly-successful game has shifted another 5m copies over the last three months of 2024, up until 31st December. 
</p>
<p>
There's a fresh lifetime total for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, also. It now stands at 70m copies sold, up three million units on last quarter - which would be jaw-droppingly impressive in comparison to pretty much any other game out there, other than GTA 5.
</p>
<p>
New content is still being pumped out for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>, such as December 2024's Agents of Sabotage update, and the multiplayer portion of Rockstar's aging game continues to be one of Take-Two's biggest earners. 
</p>
<p>
This year will see GTA 5 mark its 12th anniversary on sale (it originally launched in September 2013 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360). Red Dead Redemption 2, meanwhile, will turn seven in October.
</p>
<p>
It's around then that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">Take-Two has said GTA 6 will finally arrive</a> - during its launch window which has now been re-confirmed for sometime this autumn. 
</p>
<p>
"There's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things," Take-Two boss <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">Strauss Zelnick told IGN</a> this evening, when asked about the likelihood of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> not making its current launch window. "We feel really good about it."
</p>
<p>
It's a busy year for Take-Two in general, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 on 11th February, Mafia: The Old Country in the summer, GTA 6 in autumn and Borderlands 4 before the year's end.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> has had a bit of a bumpy start on PC, but with a couple of emergency hot fixes now under its belt, developer Insomniac, alongside porting partner Nixxes, has released its first major patch - targeting reports of crashing, among other things.
</p>
<p>
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 made its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-2-recommended-specs-and-pc-features-detailed">long-awaited PC debut</a> last Thursday, but reports from frustrated players soon surfaced, highlighting significant crashing issues, bugs, and poor optimisation. It didn't take long for the game to amass a "mixed" rating on Steam as complaints continued piling in, and Insomniac <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-2-steam-hotfix-hopes-to-address-pc-ports-stability-woes">responded quickly with a series of hot fixes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, the studio has released its first full patch for Spider-Man 2, primarily targeting "several crash fixes based on feedback from [players] and our crash reporting system." There's more beyond that, however, with update v1.205.0.0 also implementing a backup system for autosaves, fixing a number of visual bugs related to DLSS Ray Reconstruction and raytracing, and addressing a range of UI related bugs.

<p>
Menu toggles have also been introduced for Film Style Animation and Comic SFX, and there are interface improvements intended to simplify starting New Game+. 
</p>
<p>
Insomniac acknowledges not all reported issues have been addressed in its first patch, but says it's "committed to improving your experience and [will] continue to work on regular updates with more bug fixes, improvements and performance optimisations."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell had good things to say about Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PlayStation 5, calling it "simple, familiar, and occasionally cluttered [but] still brilliant fun" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-review-1">his four star review</a>. Hopefully, Insomniac and Nixxes can resolve the PC version's current issues and give the game the port it deserves. For now, though, you'll find full patch notes below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Various crash fixes based on player feedback and data from our crash reporting system.</li>
<li>Improvements to crash reporting with screenshot support.</li>
<li>Film Style Animation and Comic SFX can now be toggled via Settings &gt; Game &gt; Camera.*</li>
<li>User interface improvements to simplify starting a New Game+</li>
<li>Implemented autosave backups. At key points in the story the game will create a backup of the autosave slot.</li>
<li>Added mouse scrolling to the manual load/save menu.</li>
<li>Various improvements and bug fixes to the user interface.</li>
<li>Reduced noise in character hair when using DLSS Ray Reconstruction.</li>
<li>Enemies webbed to surfaces no longer have a black background when using ray-traced shadows and ray-traced ambient occlusion.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug related to ray-traced reflections that could cause pixelation artefacts along water edges.</li>
<li>Settings for Subtitle Text Size, Closed Caption Text Size, Icon and Prompt Size and Audio Listening Mode are no longer synchronized between different devices.**</li>
</ul>
<p><em>*These options become available after obtaining the Across the Spider-Verse Suit. ** As a result of this change, these settings will be reset to their defaults after you install this update.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Looking to add a bunch of PC games to your Steam collection for cheap? Check out this month’s <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fplatinum-collection-build-your-own-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffanaticals-new-platinum-collection-includes-the-gunk-afterimage-pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-and-more%2F1100-6529299%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Platinum Collection</a> at Fanatical. You’ll get to pick from a catalog of 21 games--and the more you buy, the cheaper they become. Best of all, every single game in the collection is offered as a Steam key, so you can easily add them to your library. As a bonus, you’ll also get a 5% off voucher for your next purchase. This edition of the Platinum bundle will be available until March 5.</p><p>Like other Build Your Own Bundle deals, the Platinum Collection offers multiple pricing tiers. Purchase <strong>three or more games to get each one for $3.33, five or more games for $3.00 each, and seven or more games for $2.86 each</strong>. In other words, you can pick up seven games for less than $21--and if you add all available games to your bundle, you'll pay just $60--making this an excellent time to pick up indie hits you may have missed over the past few years. </p><p>One of the highlights of this collection is The Gunk. Developed by the team responsible for the SteamWorld series, The Gunk is a 3D platformer that takes place on an overgrown jungle planet. You’ll be tasked with restoring nature as you eliminate the nasty gunk that’s slowly consuming the environment.</p><p>Other notable titles in the lineup include the 2D platformer Grapple Dogs: Cosmic Canines, the hilarious adventure game Tiny Terry’s Turbo Trip, and the roguelike strategy game Tales &amp; Tactics. If you prefer metroidvanias, don’t miss out on Afterimage and Vernal Edge. The former looks stunning with its hand-drawn graphics, while the latter boasts fast-paced action with a deep combo and spell system. There's also the CRPG Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous Enhanced Edition, which is similar to other sprawling, isometric RPGs like Baldur's Gate--but instead of using Dungeons &amp; Dragons as the baseline for its gameplay mechanics like Baldur's Gate does, it uses the Pathfinder 2E tabletop system instead.</p><p>Speaking of tabletop experiences adapted to video games, several digital board games are also on offer in the Platinum Collection, including hits like Root, Everdell, and Munchkin. Root is particularly notable, as its adorable characters are brought to life with a charming cartoon art style, and its many layers of complexity remain intact for this PC adaptation. </p><p>Check out all the games on offer in this month's Build Your Own Platinum Collection below, or head over to Fanatical to start customizing your bundle. All games purchased in the bundle are delivered as official Steam keys. </p><p>If you're looking for more bundle deals, be sure to check out <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fdiamond-collection-build-your-own-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffanaticals-new-platinum-collection-includes-the-gunk-afterimage-pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-and-more%2F1100-6529299%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fanatical's most recent Diamond Collection</a>, which includes games like Control: Ultimate Edition, Journey to the Savage Planet, Bloodstained Ritual of the Moon, and more for as low as $4.50 per game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-says-nba-2k25-surpassed-player-spending-expectations/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Player spending in NBA 2K25 grew by a huge margin in the final months of 2025. So much so that it helped Take-Two Interactive meet their revenue forecast for the latest financial quarter.</p>



<p>According to Take-Two’s <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/quarterly-earnings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quarterly earnings</a> for Q3 2025, the performance of NBA 2K25 “greatly surpassed” the company’s expectations. The report says that the “outstanding performance” of NBA 2K helped Take-Two reach the “guidance range,” or financial forecast, of the quarter. Essentially, Take-Two earned the amount of revenue from spending it predicted it would because of NBA 2K’s overperformance.</p>



<p>The statement reads that Recurrent Consumer Spending (RCS) in NBA 2K grew over 30 percent, attributed to “new features and innovation in our game modes.” In NBA 2K, this RCS metric includes virtual currency, in-game advertisements, and other in-game purchases. Overall, this helped Take-Two Interactive reach a 9% growth in RCS, despite only a 6% increase in mobile spending (below the company’s expectations), and a decline in GTA Online spending.</p>



<p>During this quarter, NBA 2K25 released a number of seasonal updates, including a patch in November that finally added Easy Anti-Cheat for PC users. Each seasonal update also came with a purchasable season pass for $10 or an upgraded “Hall of Fame” version of the pass for $20. Since release, NBA 2K25 has sold 7 million units.</p>



<p>While the overperformance of NBA 2K25 is certainly something Take-Two Interactive is happy about, it’s clear that the company is looking further down the line. In their earnings report they stated that 2025 could be the “strongest [year] ever” for the company. 2025 will see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/civilization-7-goes-gold-ahead-of-release/">the release of Civilization VII in just a few days</a>, followed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-mafia-the-old-country/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a> in summer, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fall-2025/">Grand Theft Auto 6 in the fall</a>, and Borderlands 4. The company is confident they will hit “record levels” of revenue in Fiscal Year 2026 and 2027.</p>

It lets you stream games from your PS5 over Wi-Fi. It's a solid choice for anyone who wants to play their PS5 games from other rooms in their home, or while someone else is using the TV, or even while away from home. The PS Portal can be used anywhere; you don't need to be on the same Wi-Fi network.
