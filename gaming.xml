<p>Excuse me?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We reported on Bandai Namco's naughty pup simulator, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doronko_wanko">Doronko Wanko</a>, back in December of last year, and not just because we were worried about what exactly this particular canine might be up to.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this very bold, but very cute, little doggy — who's name actually derives from <strong>わんこ</strong> <strong>Wan ko</strong>, which is an informal or cute way of saying dog or puppy in Japanese — is into wrecking the place, messing up his owner's stuff and causing havoc. Suddenly we are very, very interested.</p>
<p>The game, which is free-to-play on Steam (where it's currently sat on an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512840/DORONKO_WANKO/">"Overwhelmingly Positive" user-rating</a>) does cost $4.99 for Switch consoles. Boo! It's also launching alongside a bunch of new DLC that adds new breeds and kennels to muck about with. Hooray!</p>
<p>Anyway, if you're into roleplaying a canine character who likes to destroy nice rooms with juice and ketchup, and just generally be a very bad dog, we're sure the price barrier to entry is unlikely to stop you in your messy, bold pup tracks. It's just one of those very specific things.</p>
<figure><a title="Doronko Wanko" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f91ce434669ac/doronko-wanko.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can check out the trailer for the game up top, and here's some more details for those dawgs over at Bandai Namco:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Who’s a good boy? Whoseagoodboyyy? You are! Yes you are! So fluffy, so obedient, so swee—WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO THE HOUSE!?” Terrorize master’s domain with five new adorable-yet-troublemaking breeds as Corgis, Shibas, Jack Russell Terriers, Bulldogs, and Toy Poodles join the mess-making mix.</p>
<p>Fling muck onto every surface: spill wine bottles on the floor, splash paint on the walls, and shake grime from the pupper's filthy fur onto nearby furniture. It’s not all about destruction — haul scattered toys back to their rightful rooms (good dog!) to unlock new items, areas, and mess-making capabilities (bad dog!).</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Double the disarray with the assistance of rogue robo-vacuums and spinning fans that can spread dirt farther than those tiny paws could ever reach. Can these playful pups get any cuter? Yestheycanohmygoodness! Put on precious pirate hats or angelic halos — because they’re innocent!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DORONKO WANKO is now available for <a href="https://stridepr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/25YVWJhkzFCDWhgLPbt6YofXHpuPutNLujZn-5bPf-pngGeM8mAH4t14off9XzvI0aWlZaB18J1GBS5wLmTq_k4kUvs1-swhIBLEwuOwDwEJq3nNWMAMlLKHI-NOqkZDTH_Ra9mFNRLtfMd3YpTXJAfeRQnFRuZPfGfJ7CrQ6-ruTur61PZm7B9lQy2K_tv79NtLu8x989QFf4TyxfByseazx8fTJNHGLde6JDc1G0mVer8kNdqnOwpl7s9tnxqsxUDqskb6HxvAUpJQj-EwtMWsKzL2HE03M8TIEHA">Nintendo Switch</a> for $4.99</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-went-to-square-enix%E2%80%99s-final-fantasy-office-for-a-%E2%80%98creatively-rich-exchange-of-ideas%E2%80%99.1253046/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Some of the key developers behind Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 have visited Square Enix's offices to meet with the Final Fantasy team. The confirmation <a href="https://x.com/nhamaguc/status/1948389582665547854?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came</a> from Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi, who posted a picture of the two groups posing with a Cloud Strife standee.</p>



<p>According to Hamaguchi-san, the two groups engaged in a 'creatively rich exchange of visions and ideas' during the meeting. This will no doubt fuel Final Fantasy fans' hopes that Square Enix might reconsider its stance on turn-based combat.</p>



<p>The most recent games in the franchise have effectively shunned the traditional combat system in favor of action-based combat, as seen in Final Fantasy XVI, Final Fantasy VII Remake, and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-says-realistic-graphics-and-turn-based-combat-dont-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> back in 2022 that the ever-improving realistic graphics was making it increasingly harder for some gamers to accept the inherently not-so-realistic nature of turn-based combat.</p>



<p>However, the success story of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-2x-as-fast-as-any-other-jrpg-on-steam-proving-square-enix-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proves that wrong</a>. Granted, Square Enix would have much higher sales targets for mainline Final Fantasy titles, and Sandfall Interactive's game doesn't use a traditional turn-based system anyway (dodges and parries are performed in real-time). Even so, it's obvious there is a market for this, as shown even by Baldur's Gate 3. Even though that was a Western cRPG, it still used turn-based combat mixed with fairly realistic graphics (perspective notwithstanding) to enormous acclaim.</p>



<p>Did Square Enix ask Sandfall Interactive for tips on how they made it work? Or, better yet, did they discuss a potential partnership on a new project? Co-development is all the rage nowadays throughout the gaming industry, so we wouldn't be surprised at all.</p>



<p>Of course, even if that were the case, it would be a long way from releasing. Nevertheless, it'll be interesting to see whether Square Enix eventually relents to fans to provide a new game with at least the option to play with turn-based fights.</p>

                <p>While last month's Unseen Update was meant to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-577618">Hades 2</a>'s final patch before the 1.0 launch, it turns out Supergiant had one more up its sleeve. The latest patch is full of balance tweaks, improvements, and fixes--including a handful that have come from players' feedback. Here's what's changing.</p><p>For the most part, players are getting a boost in power with the new patch, with many of the game's weapons, boons, and other abilities seeing buffs to damage, range, or other properties. Some abilities are being made easier to use, while a number of enemies are also becoming less punishing.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>The PwC report suggests that the games industry, which saw total revenues of $224 billion in 2024, could grow to nearly $300 billion by 2029. While other forms of digital entertainment are suffering, streaming media especially seeing reduced consumer spending amidst an overcrowded market, video games have proved more resistant to economic pressures.</p><p>PwC isn't the only analyst firm anticipating big things for the future of video games. Another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-next-console-will-drive-major-industry-growth-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6528534/" data-ref-id="1100-6528534">recent report suggested</a> 4 billion people, around half the world's population, would be counted as gamers by 2028. Many industry analysts stress the importance of major releases like the Switch 2 and GTA 6, with the latter's delay into 2026 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-could-wipe-out-a-jaw-dropping-amount-of-money-from-global-games-industry/1100-6531664/" data-ref-id="1100-6531664">causing some concern</a> about the industry's short-term figures.</p>

Multiple sources told us how the cuts have resulted in the loss of institutional knowledge that will make life harder for those left behind. They also criticized Xbox leadership for completely missing the mark when communicating with employees on the day the cuts were announced internally. One source described Microsoft's approach as "inhumane" and said workers were left in a state of "fight or flight" after the company failed to effectively clarify who would be impacted. "Some people were here for 15 years and cut out. Making it so that people have to rush to type a goodbye message into Slack to their colleagues that they've been working with on various projects, that have been making your corporation money for 15 years, is disgusting, they added. The full story is a tough but vital read.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xbox-lowers-down-the-outer-worlds-2-price-from-80-to-70" target="_self" data-discover="true">Xbox lowers the price of The Outer Worlds 2 from $80 to $70</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Nintendo employee data indicates the company excels at retaining workers"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-employee-data-indicates-the-company-excels-at-retaining-workers">Nintendo employee data indicates the company excels at retaining workers</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">New data published by Nintendo shows the company is incredibly adept at retaining talent. The company's revised Employee Data Sheet shows that staff in Japan have an average tenure of 14.4 years, which is more than the national average of 12.5 years. Notably, the company's employee turnover rate in the country is a meager 1.9 percent. Nintendo also posted similarly impressive figures in other regions such as the United States and Europe. Why is this notable? Well, retaining knowledge and keeping teams together is vital in the game industry. It helps ensure production runs smoothly, benefitting both workers and consumers in a world of spiraling development costs and lofty sales expectations.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/mobile-dev-sandsoft-is-laying-off-around-65-employees-and-closing-two-studios" target="_self" data-discover="true">Update: Mobile developer Sandsoft is laying off 21 internal developers to 'double down' on publishing</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Obsidian just cut the controversial price of The Outer Worlds 2"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.polygon.com/news/615369/outer-worlds-2-price-cut-obsidian-xbox">Obsidian just cut the controversial price of The Outer Worlds 2</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Polygon // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Xbox has reconsidered its decision to start flogging games for $80.

The first-party studio shared the news via a tongue-in-cheek social media post, and said it had "worked with [REDACTED]" to revise the price of the sci-fi sequel. An Xbox spokesperson subsequently confirmed the company will be selling its full-priced holiday releases at $69.99 "in line with current market conditions."

The company said the downturn was due to the underperformance of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege X</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which faced "temporary but significant disruptions due to technical pricing issues." Ubisoft expects the shooter to bounce back, which seems like good news given how reliant the company seems on the 10-year-old title. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot also outlined plans to reorganize the company into "Creative Houses" to become more agile and deliver long-term stability.

In a lengthy statement posted on social media, 1047 Games CEO Ian Proulx said the studio ultimately rushed the sequel to market and must now rethink its approach to build the game players deserve. It's the second round of layoffs the company has made this year—but it made headlines for other unsavory reasons too, after Proulx took to the stage at Summer Game Fest wearing a 'Make FPS Great Again' hat to announce </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would be getting a battle royale mode. After the move drew criticism given the moniker's links to U.S. President Donald Trump and his right wing cohort of MAGA supporters, Proulx bravely decided to die on his MAGA-memeing hill and refused to apologize. He then apologized three days later. In an interview with Polygon announcing the layoffs, he said he has made "many, many mistakes." We suspect most would agree with him there.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Supermassive Games is laying off 36 people and delaying Directive 8020"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/supermassive-games-is-laying-off-36-people-and-delaying-directive-8020">Supermassive Games is laying off 36 people and delaying Directive 8020</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Dark Pictures Anthology developer Supermassive Games confirmed it would be making 36 people redundant this week to survive in a "challenging" business environment. The studio's upcoming horror title </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Directive 8020</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has also been delayed to the first half of 2026—but </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Little Nightmares III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> won't be impacted by the cuts. The news comes during period of upheaval for the UK studio, which lost its long-serving leadership team in February 2024. It then laid off a reported 90 people shortly after. That means the company has seemingly made 126 people redundant in around 18 months. How very bleak.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Just how much do consumers care about Nintendo Switch 2 peripherals?&nbsp;"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/even-85-switch-2-controllers-just">Just how much do consumers care about Nintendo Switch 2 peripherals?&nbsp;</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game File (subscription required) // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">New data published by Circana, spotlighted in Game File, indicates Nintendo sold around 512,000 Switch 2 Pro Controllers in the United States during the Switch 2's launch month. It's a number that means the premium gamepad, which retails for $85, had an attach rate of 32 percent in the region—in other words, one in three consumers purchased one with their Switch 2. Circana video game analyst Mat Piscatella also shared another interesting tidbit with Game File. He said the Switch 2's official camera—available for $55 in the U.S.—had a "mid-single digit percentage" attach rate. It'll be interesting to see whether Nintendo eventually shares concrete sales numbers to provide an indication as to how people are responding to the Switch 2's new social features.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Data points to slowing layoffs, but doesn't capture true harm to game industry"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/industry-layoffs-are-seemingly-slowing-but-the-damage-has-already-been-done">Data points to slowing layoffs, but doesn't capture true harm to game industry</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Believe it or not, it appears that game industry layoffs might actually be slowing down. Of course, the caveat is that so many people have been forcibly removed from their jobs over the past few years that you have to wonder how companies are still finding people to hurl out of the door. In her latest piece for Game Developer, veteran reporter Nicole Carpenter looks at how the layoff numbers have stacked up in the wake of a short-lived pandemic boom, how companies are approaching hiring after those widespread cuts, and why an apparent slowdown doesn't mean the industry or its workforce is suddenly out of the woods. Hint: propagating a culture of fear isn't helpful if you want people to make good video games.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>"Microsoft is thriving," said CEO and chairman Satya Nadella in a new statement following a round of layoffs earlier this month that cost 9000 employees their jobs.</p>
<p>The statement, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/">shared publicly and with Microsoft employees</a>, reiterates the company mission, with Nadella doubling down on the importance of AI.</p>
<p>First, he acknowledged the layoffs. "I want to express my sincere gratitude to those who have left," he said. "Their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today. And for that, I am deeply grateful."</p>
<p>He continued: "I also want to acknowledge the uncertainty and seeming incongruence of the times we're in. By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving - our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right. We're investing more in CapEx than ever before. Our overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognised and rewarded at levels never seen before. And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs.</p>
<p>"This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value. Progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding. But it's also a new opportunity for us to shape, lead through, and have greater impact than ever before."</p>
<p>It's clear that AI is now at the heart of Microsoft, as Nadella stated its three business priorities are security, quality, and AI transformation. "We are doubling down on the fundamentals while continuing to define new frontiers in AI," he said.</p>
<p>"What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It's not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It's about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That's the shift we are driving - from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organisation to build whatever they need to achieve."</p>
<p>Discussing company culture, Nadella stated: "Growth mindset has served us well over the last decade - the everyday practice of being a learn-it-all, not a know-it-all. It has reshaped our culture and helped us lead with greater humility and empathy. We need to keep that."</p>
<p>He continued: "It might feel messy at times, but transformation always is. Teams are reorganising. Scopes are expanding. New opportunities are everywhere. It reminds me of the early '90s, when PCs and productivity software became standard in every home and every desk! That’s exactly where we are now with AI.</p>
<p>"Years from now, when you look back at your time here, I hope you'll say: 'That's when I learned the most. That's when I made my biggest impact. That's when I was part of something transformational'.</p>
<p>"What we've learned over the past five decades is that success is not about longevity. It's about relevance. Our future won't be defined by what we've built before, but by what we empower others to build now."</p>
<p>Nadella's statement comes three weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">over 9000 employees were laid off from the company</a>, which Microsoft told Eurogamer was "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace".</p>
<p>While the total number of laid off employees in gaming positions is unknown, the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot, and a new ZeniMaz MMORPG</a> were cancelled.</p>
<p>Roughly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build">200 staff from Candy Crush developer King were laid off</a> and have reportedly been replaced by the AI tools they helped to build. The team at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-motorsport-is-no-more-claims-former-turn-10-employee-following-microsoft-cuts">Turn 10 Studios behind Forza Motorsport is also reportedly "no more"</a>.</p>
<p>The knock-on effect has also resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-next-shooter-project-loses-funding-following-microsoft-cuts">funding being cut for Romero Games' next project</a>, though contrary to reports the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-studio-not-closed-as-publishers-express-interest-in-saving-cancelled-game">studio has not closed</a>.</p>
<p>"And, as even AI's biggest proponents will usually admit, it is fundamentally incapable of actually learning anything," wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-absent-landord-execs-are-only-part-of-a-much-bigger-problem">Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell in response to the recent layoffs at Microsoft</a>. "Creative industries such as video games are human ones, existing because of deeply human urges, irrepressible natures and drives. Drives which run in direct opposition to the horrifying inhumanity of the people who run them."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Controversy has rocked a recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> art contest, following accusations that one of the winning entries was made using AI. Capcom has since disqualified the piece in question, pointing to a rule that explicitly bans AI contributions.
</p>
<p>The art piece in question was created by user Lilithascends on X (formerly known as Twitter), who has since deleted their social media accounts following public accusations for other users. In response to these events, Capcom released the following statement on social media and the art contest website:
</p>
<p>"We want to extend a big thanks to everyone who participated in the latest Street Fighter Art Contest New Challenger Edition. Unfortunately, we have determined that one of the winning entries violated contest rules, specifically Section 5 pertaining to: Entry Submission and Design Requirements.

<p>It's worth noting that the section mentioned above - Entry Submission and Design Requirements - outright prohibits the use of AI, and states: "The design must be the Entrant's original creative work which has not been previously published or entered into other competitions."
</p>
<p>The statement from Capcom continues: "After careful review and discussion, we have decided to disqualify the entry in question.
</p>
<p>"Please note that the entry in question will remain available for voting in the Battle Hub until the end of the voting period. We want to thank those who participated in voting for the entry in question. While the entry in question has been disqualified, we will provide a replacement illustration for the featured character at a later date."
</p>
<p>Their art piece was of Kimberly, depicted colourfully in a street-art style. This piece, as well as a number of other community submissions, were eligible for a community vote on which of the chosen pieces would make it into Street Fighter 6's third season. These art contests have been an ongoing community event that has taken place since the launch of Street Fighter 6.
</p>
<p>Social media users who took a look back at the accused artist's prior works, including <a href="https://x.com/chupabaraa/status/1947783583957192894">fellow artist chupabaraa</a>, found prior art pieces that raised red flags for those levying accusations at Lilithascends, including stark similarities to the work of other artists.
</p>
<p>Is there a silver lining to these shenanigans? Well, one lucky person will have their work taking up the now-empty spot in the community art contest, which is nice. We've also seen <a href="https://x.com/click_burgundy/status/1948324713090195850">beloved FGC artist Hungry Clicker</a> put out their own Kimberly portrait in response, which is stunning. Also, for the artists battling to win this and future Street Fighter 6 art contests, it's surely a warm feeling to know Capcom is willing to stand firm against AI use.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-6-art-contest-rocked-by-ai-controversy-disqualification-issued]]></content:encoded>

			<p>I am not a coder. In fact, I view the actual process of development and coding in much the same way as much of Hollywood with hackers being some kind of modern wizard with arcane knowledge. With that in mind, when I was offered the chance to play a game that puts you in the shoes of a hacker trying to access a sinister organisation’s network, my first worry was that I wouldn’t be able to understand what I was doing. The premise intrigued me enough that I gave it a try and I’m glad that I did, as s.p.l.i.t is up there with the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/26/threshold-review/">Threshold</a> in terms of short experimental horror games.</p>
<p><em><strong>Content Warning:</strong> s.p.l.i.t contains dark elements, with thematic and immersive references to self harm and suicide. I won’t discuss details in the review but these are central enough to warrant caution.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="'s.p.l.i.t' - Release Date Announcement" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKO3UzOTBsA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The aesthetics of s.p.l.i.t are perfectly in keeping with the game. While most of the time you’ll be staring at a simulated interface, you can turn to look around your room when necessary. This will mostly be required to switch between your hacking interface and your messaging screen through which you’ll interact with two mysterious colleagues. All mechanics are carried out through the keyboard, which really nails the immersion. Messaging is performed through mashing the keys to simulate actual typing, but all of the hacking has to be done for ‘real’.</p>
<p>The backstory of s.p.l.i.t is deliberately incredibly vague. You and two accomplices are trying to hack into a system in what appears to be an authoritarian dystopia. You have access to an illegal field kit device that can be used to create an authorisation key but will only have a limited time to finish the job once you have access. This scenario, especially when combined with the sheer immersion of the interface, leads to some of the most harrowing and thrilling gameplay you’ll find in indie horror. The fact that this all revolves around using a DOS-like interface to find and access files and programs within the system makes this a game that you have to play to feel.</p>


<p>There are few guidelines in the game but the signposting is so expertly done that I never found myself lost even though I didn’t have any coding knowledge going in. As mentioned above, the main interface is much closer to a pre-Windows experience as you must navigate file structures, find information and use the hints from your colleagues to proceed. Each major breakthrough is marked by a save point and brings you closer to the game’s conclusion.</p>
<p>In terms of dark themes, s.p.l.i.t is not a game with light and shade. This is a grubby and lo-fi experience that never lets up either in intensity or mood. The constant feeling of threat and surveillance makes the hour or so it takes to play through feel like an ordeal in the best possible way and both of the alternative endings offer no real optimism but both feel entirely appropriate for the game’s themes and setting.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		s.p.l.i.t is a tough game to write about, as at heart it is just a simulation of a textual file interface wrapped up in a dark and oppressive environment, but it is also so much more than that. The perfect fusion of themes and mechanics makes for an experience that is almost suffocatingly immersive and the darker aspects (although absolutely not for everyone) elevate s.p.l.i.t to be one of the most harrowing games you’ll find. Aside from the essential content warning, I’d recommend going in as blind as possible and just playing out your The Matrix and Sneakers fantasies.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s patent infringement lawsuit in Japan against Pocketpair’s open-world survival game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> is ongoing. In the latest development, Nintendo has reworded one of the patents in the case, but what led up to this bizarre move?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Palworld is an open-world survival game that skyrocketed in popularity upon its Steam and Xbox early access launch back on January 19, 2024. It sold 8 million copies in just six days and racked up over 25 million players in one month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game world is inhabited by creatures called Pals, which you can capture and use (read: exploit) to carry out various tasks. The visual appearance of the Pals and the method of capturing them by throwing a ball (Pal Sphere), quickly drew comparisons to Pokémon, with the game even getting nicknamed “Pokémon with guns” for its darker, black humor-infused take on the creature collecting genre. With Palworld’s meteoric rise in popularity, it wasn’t long before Nintendo rival Sony got together with Pocketpair to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>form Palworld Entertainment</u></a> in June 2024, a new business venture aimed at expanding the IP.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company showed signs of keeping an eye on Palworld (for example, this <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/media/news/detail/335.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official statement</u></a> from The Pokémon Company back in January 2024). But it wasn’t until September 2024 that they <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2024/240919.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>officially announced</u></a> they were filing a lawsuit in Japan against Pocketpair for infringement of patent rights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The case involves <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>three patents</u></a> granted by the Japan Patent Office (JPO): two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters. All three patents were filed in 2024, after Palworld came out. However, they are actually derived from earlier Nintendo patents dating from 2021. In other words, it seems that once Palworld came on the scene, Nintendo filed divisional patents that were geared to fight specifically against Palworld’s alleged infringement of the original patents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250508" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>has made changes</u></a> to Palworld’s disputed mechanics. The November 2024 patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pokéball-like Pal Spheres (now Pals just materialize next to you when summoned). In May, another Palworld update changed how you can glide in the game — instead of directly grabbing onto Glider Pals, now you just simply use Pal-buffed Glider equipment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that these changes by Pocketpair are not an admission of guilt. Rather, as Japanese patent attorney Kiyoshi Kurihara <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/expert/articles/a9dd2fc3c0dc4e4d1282d012649b665462137560" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pointed out</u></a> on Yahoo Japan news last month, Pocketpair is following the standard three-pronged defense against patent lawsuits, which is to “deny infringement, argue that the patents are invalid, and avoid infringement through design changes.” He also noted that Nintendo does not have the upper hand, as there seems to be a fierce back-and-forth with Nintendo pushing for patent infringement and Pocketpair pushing for patent invalidity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-7528390/15/ja" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ride mechanic patent</u></a> (which got a sudden rewrite recently) covers a system for mounting and maneuvering pre-selected “boardable characters” (<em>tōjō kyarakuta</em>). Commenting on X, Japanese lawyer Ryo Arashida <a href="https://x.com/IP_Arashida/status/1920369811932262824" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pointed out</u></a> that it could be argued that the way Palworld’s Glider Pals worked prior to the May update infringed part of the patent’s specifications, namely those about the player grabbing onto and hanging from the boardable character, and their subsequent control of that movement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prior to the May Palworld update, you could use an actual Glider Pal to glide (by grabbing onto its feet). However, post-update, players have to use a piece of equipment — a Glider — to glide, rather than actually using the Pals themselves. Instead, Pals now act as passive buffs on your gliding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ironically, as Arashida <a href="https://x.com/IP_Arashida/status/1920412095805571096" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>noted</u></a>, Nintendo’s major argument to get the patent granted in the first place was that a “boardable character” was specifically a character and not a tool, like a parachute. “For this reason, claiming in the lawsuit that a ‘Glider’ (which is a tool) is a ‘boardable character’ would create a contradiction.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This month, Nintendo reworded the ride-switching mechanic patent. Rewording a patent mid-case is legal as long as it doesn’t introduce any new concepts or technical matter. However, as pointed out by IP consultant Florian Mueller at <a href="https://gamesfray.com/nintendo-resorts-to-weird-patent-claims-as-its-litigation-against-palworld-maker-pocketpair-is-struggling/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesFray</u></a>, this only tends to happen if the litigant (in this case, Nintendo) feels the patent is “at a fairly high risk of being deemed invalid in its original form.” Nintendo’s rewriting of the patent makes it more verbose. Mueller focused on the addition of “even when” <em>(-attemo</em> in Japanese) to the wording, noting that “even” is rarely used in patents because it's “too emphatic and subjective.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it's not clear exactly what Nintendo’s motivations are behind this sudden rewording, it’s possible that it is using this as a last-ditch tactic to make it harder for the patent claim to be dismissed as invalid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The case continues. Meanwhile, Pocketpair continues to update Palworld with new features, such as the recently released Terraria crossover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-story-of-the-last-of-us-part-i-and-ii-will-be-available-in-book-form-later-this-year.1253001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you cannot stand video games and TV shows and would like to know what all the fuss regarding The Last of Us is about, the entire story so far will be available in book form later this year. Of course, it's also a perfectly valid option for those who already know the story through different mediums and would like to read it from the perspective of script writers Neil Druckmann and Halley Gross (the latter worked just on Part II).</p>



<p>The hardcover is already available for pre-order <a href="https://amzn.to/46WmXgE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Amazon</a>. It is estimated to be released on December 16, and the price of $69.99 is currently discounted to $66.63 (5% off). Dark Horse Books publishes the book, which is 616 pages long.</p>



<p>Here's the product overview:</p>



<p><em>Join Joel and Ellie from the very beginning of their unforgettable journey. Relive every climactic moment from The Last of Us Part I, from the duo’s time with Tess in Boston, to Ellie’s joy while petting giraffes, to Joel’s heart-wrenching decision at the Fireflies’ hospital. And dive into The Last of Us Part II’s dual-perspective story, including Abby’s shocking introduction to the story, Ellie and Dina forging a bond together, an enthralling encounter with the Rat King, and the final showdown between Ellie and Abby.</em></p>



<p><em>This volume contains the script from both The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II, as well as the DLC, Left Behind, so you can experience every bottle thrown, every bad pun of Ellie’s, and every heart-pounding encounter with the Infected in a totally new way. Much like Savage Starlight was to Ellie, The Last of Us: Part I and Part II Scripts is a must-have for any fan’s bookshelf (or survival kit).</em></p>



<p>The book also includes an art gallery featuring work by Naughty Dog principal character concept artist Hyoung Nam, a buckram-textured cover, and block printing along the pages' edges that evokes the iconic Cordyceps fungus of The Last of Us.</p>



<p>The story as-is can be considered complete. As we previously reported, creator Neil Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-iii-will-only-be-made-with-a-story-worthy-of-the-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> a third game would only be produced if Naughty Dog found a worthy story. Druckmann himself recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/neil-druckmann-hbo-the-last-of-us-naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped back</a> from his additional role as co-showrunner of the HBO series, although HBO reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/hbo-not-concerned-neil-druckmann-departure-the-last-of-us-show-16-emmy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn't concerned</a> about his departure. Even so, the second season <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-sees-big-decline-over-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saw a large decline </a>in viewership, and fans fear the third season will be even worse without the creator's handiwork.</p>

<p>While it's not known what exactly we might be seeing on the Switch 2 from Xbox, there's already been a lot of rumours about key series potentially being ported.</p>
<p>Additionally, Obsidian's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grounded">Grounded</a> team has recently responded to a question from <a href="https://youtu.be/o5tOD0sqfKM?t=1050">Gamertag Radio</a> about the game's sequel potentially getting a Switch 2 release at some point, and it sounds open to the idea of it – mentioning how it wants "as many people to be able to play" as possible (<a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/51091-obsidian-says-we-ll-see-what-happens-in-regards-to-grounded-2-on-switch-2">via GoNintendo</a>).</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Xbox has been releasing more of its IP on other platforms, with <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/gears_of_war_reloaded">Gears of War: Reloaded</a></strong> coming to the PlayStation 5 next month.</p>

Super Heroes both Earth-born and cosmic must now join forces in a star-spanning adventure against the deadly Annihilation Wave. Brawl through the streets of New York City all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone to foil Annihilus’ vow to spread death across the cosmos in classically inspired side-scrolling combat.</blockquote><blockquote>Choose and control your own team of two characters while tagging between them mid-fight with the innovative Cosmic Swap system, capitalizing on distinct superpowers and special attacks to create unique team-ups and dish out devastating damage. Unlock stellar powerups and rewards while experimenting with different duos and bash through a fantastic collection of locales and nemeses from the Marvel universe. Marvel Cosmic Invasion’s action includes a range of accessibility features, empowering the whole family to be Super Heroes (or villains), and supports four-player drop-in/drop-out local and online co-op with crossplay.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>Joining the fight on Switch platforms later this year</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Marvel's been involved with some pretty exciting games in recent times, and hopefully, this trend continues with its upcoming arcade-style beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's launch on the Switch and Switch 2 later this year, Dotemu has today revealed another two playable characters joining the roster. This time we get a brief look at 'Beta Ray Bill' and 'Silver Surfer' who join the fight against the immortal super villain Annihilus.</p>
<p>Here's some PR about the latest character reveals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s hammer time for Annihilus’ forces when Beta Ray Bill smashes into action! With his devastating and mighty hammer known as Stormbreaker, the son of Korbin marshals his cyborg strength to squash any bug battalion standing in his way!</p>
<p>And he won’t be joining the fight alone – from the depths of the cosmos, the Silver Surfer soars into the battle! Imbued with the Power Cosmic, the Surfer can stun any adversary. Easily gliding in the skies or close to the ground, insectoid invaders can’t escape Galactus’ former herald!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Silver Surfer and Beta Ray Bill will join a cast made up of various other characters like Captain America, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Storm, Venom and She-Hulk, as they brawl their way through the streets of Marvel's New York, all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone.</p>

<figure><a title="WWE 2K25" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/03dfc2db8ed2c/wwe-2k25.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 2K</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a> has finally landed on the Switch 2 this week, and while the experience was expected to match other versions of the game, it seems this isn't <em>entirely</em> the case.</p>
<p>Although community creations are available in the Switch 2 release, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k25-lacks-image-uploading-on-switch-2-and-fans-arent-happy">as highlighted by IGN</a>, this version "lacks image uploading" and it appears to have caught some wrestling enthusiasts by surprise.</p>
<p>The official game FAQ actually goes into a bit more detail about these restrictions, noting how Switch 2 players won't be able to upload or view custom images from "other platforms". The <a href="https://support.wwe2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/42408597808019-WWE-2K-Image-Uploader-Tool">same page on the game website</a> also includes the following notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 players will not see Image Uploader based Community Creations from any platform or be able to upload their own"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see below, fans and content creators within this space have shared their frustrations online – with some already speculating <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WWEGames/comments/1m6lovh/no_community_creations_in_nintendo_switch_2/">about the reasons behind this decision</a>.</p>
<p>Our friends at <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/51086-wwe-2k25-on-switch-2-blocks-access-to-user-created-content">GoNintendo</a> have also labelled this a "major disappointment" and have reached out to multiple parties to "try and get an answer".</p>

<p>Apart from this, early impressions suggest <a href="https://x.com/SMetaldave64/status/1948093777320546314">the Switch 2 version of WWE 2K25 is a respectable port</a>. We'll be delivering our Nintendo Life review soon, and if we hear any significant developments tied to this story, we'll let you know.</p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Recently Canceled a Star Wars Outlaws Sequel – Rumor]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-sequel-recently-canceled-rumor-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-recently-canceled-a-star-wars-outlaws-sequel-%E2%80%93-rumor.1252920/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This month, just days prior to the time of this writing, Ubisoft chief executive officer Yves Guillemot blamed<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-outlaws-failure-on-the-ip-says-no-game-can-be-supported-forever/"> Star Wars Outlaws missing its sales targets on the Star Wars IP itself</a>, saying that the Star Wars brand was "<em>in choppy waters</em>" at the time of Outlaws' launch. Now, a rumor has surfaced that Ubisoft has quietly canceled a Star Wars Outlaws sequel. </p>



<p>The rumor comes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bFaIYn9H3g&amp;t=2800s">Tom Henderson and Insider-Gaming</a>, who said on the website's podcast that Ubisoft "<em>recently canceled Star Wars Outlaws 2</em>," adding that it was still in its early stages and that it "<em>hadn't entered [full] production</em>," and that it was "<em>very, very, early</em>." Mike Straw, senior editor at the site, joked that we were "<em>probably seven years away</em>" from seeing it.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Is EA's Last Chance" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bFaIYn9H3g?start=2800&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Henderson has <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/">previously correctly reported</a> internal information about Ubisoft, but this claim remains a rumor for now. It's also arguably not the most wild speculation. You could say that Outlaws was the biggest miss for Ubisoft in 2024, a year rife with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/03/09/skull-and-bones-looks-like-its-doing-worse-than-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/">big misses</a> for the company. It <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">struggled to move units out of the gate</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-star-wars-outlaws-patch-drops-forced-stealth-missions/">underwent significant changes from its original launch version</a> months after release due to a heavy wave of negative player feedback. The game's director even acknowledged <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-director-admits-review-score-disappointment/">disappointment with the response from critics</a>.</p>



<p>Its poor launch sales were also used as an excuse to delay Assassin's Creed Shadows out of 2024 and to its eventual March 2025 launch date. You could make the case that Ubisoft has had anything but negative things to say about Outlaws since it launched. It's not the craziest idea that leadership ultimately decided not to go down the road of a sequel, even if they were exploring what one would look like.</p>

The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h45Sr1kafGU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>resulting video</u></a> is quite funny, showing the new Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) family as they fumble through a few matches as their in-game counterparts.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Meet the family! ✨Marvel Studios The Fantastic Four: First Steps cast's genuine reactions as they try out Marvel Rivals! 😄 <a href="https://t.co/sq8lwMh7pp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/sq8lwMh7pp</a></p>— Marvel Rivals (@MarvelRivals) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/1948513591134679137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's goofy and occasionally hard to watch as Pascal flails his stretchy arms at enemies, but the highlight is no doubt the Fantastic Four cast’s reaction to Invisible Woman’s infamous Marvel Rivals Malice skin. Fans of the game had already taken the time to see everything the shockingly revealing outfit had to offer when it made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/marvel-rivals/Season_1_Battle_Pass_and_New_Skins#Malice_Invisible_Woman_Skin">its debut with Season 1</a> in January. On the eve of the new Fantastic Four movie’s premiere, though, the cast is only just seeing it for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby is the first to joke about the skin: “Thank you. This is my favorite bit of her as well,” she says of the video game version of her Fantastic Four character. “This is my favorite bit. Guys, watch out, like I said, for the sequel. You better watch it.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fantastic Four: First Steps, of course, has yet to receive the green light for a proper MCU sequel, though we do know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-pedro-pascals-reed-richards-lead-the-avengers-the-fantastic-four-first-steps-director-clarifies-previous-comments-insists-its-for-the-russo-brothers-to-reveal"><u>at least some of its major characters</u></a> will make an appearance in the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday. Invisible Woman’s evil black-and-red Malice skin probably won’t make it into the MCU, but the slack-jawed Pascal still shared some of his thoughts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Here we go,” Pascal said. “Costume designer, take notes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Loserfruit’s video also includes the Fantastic Four cast’s reaction to other Marvel Rivals cosmetics, including Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman’s The Life Fantastic wedding skins. Of course, it’s how all four actors reacted to the Malice skin that has started to achieve viral status.

                <p>Epic Games apparently <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1948486101020143845" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">removed passive XP gains</a> from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s main Battle Royale and Zero Build modes on Thursday afternoon, in the midst of its Summer Road Trip event that will award a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-the-free-chevrolet-corvette-in-fortnite-and-rocket-league/1100-6533356/" data-ref-id="1100-6533356">free Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 car</a> body for gaining XP to complete a series of daily quests. Playing Battle Royale had awarded 550 XP per minute, or a little less than half a level per hour, just for existing in the game mode--but that's no longer the case.</p><p>While this certainly is a bit of a nerf, it's actually not typical for Battle Royale and Zero Build to give passive XP. In fact, passive XP was only just added to those modes at the beginning of the current season--before then, we lived without it. The change had made leveling the battle pass this season meaningfully faster.</p><p>Assuming the change will stick for a while, there are two fairly obvious potential reasons for the change. The Summer Road Trip event is one of them, since its quests simply require gaining XP to complete. You only need to gain eight total levels across these quests, so the lack of passive XP in BR probably won't slow anyone down very much. Another possibility is that we're approaching the end of Chapter 6 Season 4, and this change will make it a little tougher for folks who are just now getting started on the battle pass to catch up before the season ends on August 7.</p><p>When Chapter 6 Season 3 ends on August 7, it'll also mark the end of the current seasons of Fortnite OG and Lego Fortnite. In other words, it'll be a pretty eventful season launch. In fact, there's even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ogs-rocket-live-event-is-just-days-away/1100-6533279/" data-ref-id="1100-6533279">an end-of-season event</a> ahead. </p>

These include over 20 payment options, a full-featured mobile app, built-in marketing tools, and more robust pledge management. Indiegogo will also adopt Gamefound's flat 5% fee structure, putting more money in creators' pockets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s time for crowdfunding to be a forward-facing industry again,” said Julie dePontbriand, CEO of Indiegogo in the official release. “Gamefound’s technology is unrivaled, and we’re thrilled to bring it to Indiegogo’s diverse community. Together, we’re making crowdfunding more innovative, creator-friendly, and exciting than ever before.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two sites will continue operating independently for now, with Gamefound remaining focused on tabletop games and Indiegogo continuing to promote tech, film, and other creative projects.

                <p>It seems horror fans are destined to mourn the loss of Kojima's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hills/" data-ref-id="5000-306236">Silent Hills</a> project until the end of time--but that doesn't mean there aren't games out there picking up the torch left behind by its playable teaser, aptly named P.T. Indeed, developer Broken Bird Games has absorbed some of Kojima's vision to craft the eerie mind-bender <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/luto/" data-ref-id="5000-526997">Luto</a>. In this atmospheric horror title, you'll spend your time as a character stuck in a loop within their home, trying desperately to figure out, well, <em>why</em>.</p><p>If you're interested in checking out this chilling mystery but want to know what kind of time investment you're in for before you do, we'll fill you in on how long it takes to beat Luto and how many chapters stand between you and the finale.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mBgdXyIGsQ" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1mBgdXyIGsQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>How long does it take to beat Luto?</h2><p>How long it takes you to finish Luto will depend largely on your puzzle-solving abilities and how well you pay attention to your surroundings. Even with its occasionally obtuse puzzles, Luto is still a relatively brief horror experience that is focused on giving you a meaningful dose of the creeps without wearing its gimmicks too thin. With this in mind, you can expect it to take between <strong>3-5 hours to finish the campaign</strong>. Of course, if you're using a guide to assist with puzzles in Luto, you can almost certainly wrap things up even quicker. </p><h2>Luto chapter list</h2><p>Glancing at the chapter list for Luto may be confusing, with its repeated chapters and strange jumps. But it all makes sense within the bizarre, looping narrative structure of the game, which unravels to great effect as you move deeper and deeper into its twisted tale. While we don't want to ruin anything here about the way the narrative plays out in Luto, you can get a basic idea of what type of experience you're getting yourself into by surveying the chapter list below.</p><ul><li>Chapter 1 - It's Happening Again</li><li>Chapter 2 - Beyond the Noise</li><li>Chapter 3 - One More Time</li><li>Chapter 1 - It's Happening Again </li><li>Chapter 4 - Thanks for Pushing Me</li><li>Chapter 5 - Playing with the Truth</li><li>Chapter 22 - A Mouth Full of Sand Can't Scream</li><li>Chapter 3 - One More Time </li></ul><p>Luto is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p>

Today, during Robert Kirkman's panel at San Diego Comic-Con, the Invincible creator announced another new fighter for the game, and this one is a little more beastly.</p><p dir="ltr">Battle Beast--the fearsome warrior who travels the Invincible universe looking for a fighter to give him a glorious death--is the latest entrant into the Invincible Vs roster. The reveal trailer for the giant showed off some of his smashing moveset--including one attack where he smashed his club into Bulletproof so hard, it knocked off his head and limbs.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Invincible VS - Battle Beast Character Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Battle Beast becomes the sixth confirmed fighter for Invincible Vs., joining the previously mentioned Invincible, Atom Eve, Bulletproof, and Rex Splode, as well as the Viltrumite Thula. Two other Viltrumites, Lucen and Omni-Man, did feature in the game's initial reveal trailer in June, but neither have been officially confirmed as playable characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Invincible Vs. was announced during the Xbox Showcase in early June, with Skybound also announcing the creation of its development studio Quarter Up. Quarter Up is made up of industry veterans from Activision, Riot Games, Xbox, and more, and it was founded by Mike Willette, who previously worked on the Killer Instinct 2013 reboot for Xbox--as a developer and as the voice of the announcer.</p><p dir="ltr">Invincible VS is set to launch in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>
