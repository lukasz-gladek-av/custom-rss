		<p>Time travelling first person VR puzzle adventure <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wanderer-the-fragments-of-fate">Wanderer: The Fragments of Fate</a> has been delayed again to 31st October 2024. The VR remake will be coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PSVR 2</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 2 and 3</a>, and SteamVR, and there’s a new trailer delving into some of the characters and time periods you’ll run through:</p>
<p><iframe title="Wanderer: The Fragments of Fate  | Icons &amp; Eras Deep Dive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PEeE922BMXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A remake of the 2022 game Wanderer – a bit odd, but Mighty Eyes clearly felt that there was more they could do with the same core – The Fragments of Fate blends together first person exploration and combat with time-travelling puzzles and possibilities, throwing you (as Asher Newman) into a quest to save the world.</p>
<p>The trailer shows how Boston in 2061 has been turned into a flooded swamp, where you’ll have to fight past bandits to reach Asher’s grandfather’s apartment with a quirky looking watch that will become your time travel AI buddy.&nbsp;Like Quantum Leap, each time jump with thrust you into another person’s body, the first jump putting you in the boots of Neil Armstrong in 1969, though with the moon landing having gone rather wrong. From there you’ll reach an ancient Mayan landscape in the 1500s.</p>
<p>Wanderer: The Fragments of Fate will sometimes have you explore the same locations in different time periods, or the same place and time as different people. Naturally, your actions will alter time and change what you see from different angles.</p>

<p>The game was announced for PSVR 2 back in February with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/23/zombie-army-vr-the-wizards-wanderer-the-fragments-of-fate-and-more-announced-for-psvr-2/">a much more action oriented trip to WW2</a>, grabbing guns out of your inventory, it shows the breadth and variety of what Wanderer: The Fragments of Fate will offer. At that point, the game was set for a 27th June release, but developer Mighty Eyes has now twice pushed the launch back, first to September, and now to 31st October 2024.</p>
<p>As a remake, Mighty Eyes has also decided to offer a 20% discount to owners of Wanderer from PlayStation VR and SteamVR.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-co-op-hit-we-were-here-forever-passes-one-million-sales.923739/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/we-were-here-forever-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Total Mayhem Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>We Were Here Forever&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a million since the game's launch all the way back in May 2022.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/WeWereHereGame/status/1810916968624508959" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the developer celebrates the new milestone, pledging to "continue making awesome games for you &amp; for more Explorers to join us along the way".</p>
<p>As <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/bramvanlith?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted by PR exec Bram van Lith</a>, who's worked with Total Mayhem on a number of&nbsp;<em>We Were Here&nbsp;</em>games, this marks the third game in the&nbsp;<em>We Were Here&nbsp;</em>series to cross the million mark, which is pretty impressive for a humble little series of indie co-op puzzlers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/we-were-here-forever-sales-snow.jpg?itok=vLut_iqB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/we-were-here-forever-sales-snow.jpg?itok=xXY9UERo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We Were Here Forever&nbsp;</em>is the third game in the series to break a million sales.</figcaption></figure><p>Technically, van Lith doesn't say which other two games in the series crossed the million barrier, but it's likely that the other two are&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/we-were-here-too-review-cooperation-required">We Were Here Too</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chilly-co-op-adventure-we-were-here-together-launches-october-10th"><em>We Were Here Together</em></a>.</p>
<p>The first game in the series,&nbsp;<em>We Were Here</em>, is free, and the latest,&nbsp;<em>We Were Here Expeditions: The FriendShip</em>, was given away for free for the first month or so of its release, so the sales figures are unlikely to apply to those games (although it's not impossible).</p>
<p>As of October last year, however, the entire series had <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/the-we-were-here-franchise-gave-away" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sold a combined total of almost five million units</a>, so it's generally been a very successful run indeed for Total Mayhem. Here's hoping the next game, whatever it turns out to be, continues this hot streak.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/we-were-here-together-bar.jpg?itok=oA0f1Kow 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/we-were-here-together-bar.jpg?itok=o1YaaY9H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>We Were Here&nbsp;</em>series is a very successful one indeed.</figcaption></figure><p><em>We Were Here Forever&nbsp;</em>is the fourth game in the&nbsp;<em>We Were Here&nbsp;</em>series, which began back in 2017 with&nbsp;<em>We Were Here</em>.</p>
<p><em>Forever&nbsp;</em>sees players teaming up to explore a castle in order to solve puzzles and hopefully escape. Puzzles are designed around co-op, and since both players have limited information, there's no split-screen co-op mode; instead, you'll use walkie-talkies to communicate with your partner remotely.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>We Were Here Forever&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1341290/We_Were_Here_Forever/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10002430/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/we-were-here-forever/9PH2TSF7M48X" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

And later this year, there will be a handful of price increases for various tiers. Here's the exact text as it is presented on <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/game-pass-updates-july-2024">Microsoft's website</a>.</p>



<p>The new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>PC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but the that tier will still include Day One releases.</p>

<p>All of these price changes will reflect starting on September 12.</p>

<p>Price changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating. What do you think of the change? Do you plan on maintaining your subscription? Or is it time to cancel?</p>

			<p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim continues to be an impressive game even over ten years since its original launch, mostly thanks to the work of modders who have improved gameplay mechanics and visuals considerably over the years.</p>
<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dreams</a> shared today a new video showcasing how the fifth entry in the series by Bethesda can look in 2024 with a vast selection of mods, over 3100 mods, including the Complete RT shader by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/NiceGuy147" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NiceGuy</a>, an advanced screen space ray tracing shader that lets users add global illumination with effects like Diffuse Illumination and Specular Reflection, ambient occlusion, and glossy reflections to any game.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K60] Skyrim Ultra Modded graphics 3100+Mods - Wunduniik Modlist with Complete Raytracing" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y1NZ1O3csXw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With Bethesda hard at work on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-officially-in-early-development-but-you-wont-hear-any-more-about-it-for-some-time/">sixth entry in the series</a>, it is unlikely we are going to see a proper The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim remake that will take advantage of modern technology to present the game's world like never before. The game, however, is already in a better spot than when it was released, as it was remastered back in 2016 with the Special Edition, which includes the base game, all of the expansions, remastered art and effects, volumetric god rays, dynamic depth of field, screen-space reflections, and more. Another version of the game, the Anniversary Edition, was launched in 2021 to celebrate the game's 10th anniversary with new content and some gameplay tweaks.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Xbox 360 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

That’s next year! Having already waited well over two years, another five months feels too much.

Season 1 wrapped up with a lot of cliffhangers about the future of the severance program and the workers who are a part of it, but the season 2 teaser puts them right back in the office. With all the memory shenanigans, it’s possible season 2 could pick up with characters having no memory of the final moments of the first season. </p><p>Hopefully musician SZA is happy to know when she can watch the second season, even if it isn’t “right the fuck now” as she had begged for in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.complex.com/music/a/tracewilliamcowen/sza-ben-stiller-severance-season-two?d_id=7623969&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.complex.com/music/a/tracewilliamcowen/sza-ben-stiller-severance-season-two?d_id=7623969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media post this May</a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/vr-pvp-shooter-frenzies-announced-for-psvr-2-meta-quest-by-ndreams/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>VR specialists at nDreams and developer Near Light have revealed Frenzies, a new virtual reality multiplayer shooter that embraces chaos and showing off in the combat arena. Frenzies is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PSVR 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest</a>.</p>
<p>A closed alpha test will kick off on 18th July on Quest – sign up via the game’s <a href="https://discord.gg/frenziesvr">Discord</a> – with more details on the game to come in the months ahead.</p>
<p><iframe title="FRENZIES ANNOUNCE TRAILER | nDREAMS | META QUEST &amp; PS VR2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Lw4S8zu9kw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Frenzies will look to build upon the rich pedigree of precision FPS gunplay found within games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/19/fracked-review-psvr-shooter/">Fracked</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/29/synapse-review-psvr2/">Synapse</a> by nDreams, though Frenzies is in development by their 2022 acuisition, Shooty Fruity developer Near Light.</p>
<p>What Frenzies hopes to capture is the chaotic PvP gameplay that has made games like Gorilla Tag so popular in VR. Making that happen is a ‘lucky dip’ gameplay format, so the lobbies of 12 players shift between different maps, game mode types that create and break up alliances, and swapping to and from free-for-all and team play. Fast and fluid VR movement will combine with ziplines and grabbing onto cover to hide behind. At the end of it, your performances across five rounds will determine the winner.</p>

<p>However, it’s not just about winning, because you’ll want to look good doing it. Character models are all in hooded onesies with LED displays for faces, and you’ll naturally be able to customise your look, but then there’s all the free movement and posing of VR available to you for when you want to showboat and muck around. The 1:1 motion tracking and things like finger tracking on PSVR 2’s Sense controllers will allow for more varied gestures, and the trailer shows off moments where a player is captured and then… well, it’d be much more gruesome if they weren’t stylised characters, so it’s best not to think about it too much.</p>
<p>Near Light head of studio Paul Mottram on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/10/ps-vr2-frenzies-revealed-new-metro-awakening-gameplay-details-wanderer-the-fragments-of-fate-in-depth-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog</a>, “Right from when we first started working on Frenzies, we wanted it to have a real sense of fun. We didn’t want to create a straight-faced, military sim and instead took our inspiration from bombastic arena shooter classics such as Quake and Unreal Tournament. We felt that by taking the essence of those games and sprinkling in a dose of unpredictability, we’d landed on something that’s easy to play, challenging to master and leaves you with a big grin on your face every time. We think that there’s something for everyone in Frenzies and even experienced VR shooter fans will have their skills tested in new ways.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nba-2k25-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K has announced the&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>release date, as well as the cover stars you can expect to see on the various different editions of the game. What's more, there's some good news for PC players this year as well.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/ball-over-everything-nbar-2k25-features-nba-champion-jayson-tatum-two-time-wnba-mvp-aja-wilson-and-hall-of-fame-legend-vince-carter-as-cover-athletes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on its official website</a>, 2K confirms that the&nbsp;release date for&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>is September 6th, and that you'll be able to play it across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p>
<p>The game's cover stars will be Jayson Tatum, who'll be appearing on&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25</em>'s Standard Edition cover art; A'ja Wilson, who's the cover athlete for the All-Star and WNBA Editions; and Vince Carter, who's gracing the cover of the Hall of Fame Edition.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nba-2k25-release-date-cover-athletes.jpg?itok=H3FR1mI7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nba-2k25-release-date-cover-athletes.jpg?itok=TxSWobq1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here are your three&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>cover athletes.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're an&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K&nbsp;</em>PC player, you'll likely be aware of the series' history of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-nba-2k24-gameplay-trailer">releasing the last-gen versions of the game</a> on PC, but that practice apparently ends with&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25</em>.</p>
<p>According to the aforementioned announcement post, the PC version of the game will be the "New-Gen" version this year, meaning it'll be equivalent to the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions rather than the PS4 and Xbox One versions.</p>
<p>That means you can expect the vaunted ProPLAY system in the PC version this time around, as well as modes like The W, which allows you to compete in the WNBA, and The City, an open-world hub with sidequests and other distractions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, crossplay still isn't supported between PC and current-gen consoles, it seems. 2K says crossplay "will only be available on New-Gen consoles", so it sounds like the PC version isn't included.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nba-2k25-release-date-cover-athletes-box-art.jpg?itok=XqoYkyKH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nba-2k25-release-date-cover-athletes-box-art.jpg?itok=pcVHFLgQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>will have several different box art styles to choose from.</figcaption></figure><p>2K has yet to reveal the first&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>gameplay footage, but we do know the game will feature "a more compact and interactive" version of the City, as well as "the franchise's most true-to-life basketball experience yet".</p>
<p><em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox on September 6th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Presumably this created enough confidence that the game was in the clear, such that console rival Sony would be prepared to get involved, albeit through an entirely different arm of the company.</p><p>And yet, well, we can all pretend that <em>Palworld</em> isn’t unbelievably obviously copying famous Pokémon, but <em>come on</em>. Releasing merch based on these animals is <em>surely</em> going to make the Big N’s wrath more likely? Yet, merchandize they shall, the new company teaming up with Japanese store <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.aniplexusa.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.aniplexusa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aniplex</a></span>, for as-yet-unannounced products. They will be available “later on.”</p><p>It’s going to be interesting. I genuinely don’t understand how Nintendo will be able to continue sitting on its hands should Palworld Entertainment start selling a Bristla plushie on a store shelf next to one of Pokémon’s Bellossom. Or Jormuntide alongside Gyarados. Let alone the most infamous Grizzbolt and the near-identical Electabuzz. But clearly Sony Music and Pocketpair  feel sure it’s all legally sound.</p><figure id="" data-id="7e7ea8a6a192b793d8ed0fd039949cc7" data-recommend-id="image://7e7ea8a6a192b793d8ed0fd039949cc7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bunch of comparisons of Pals and Pokemon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A bunch of comparisons of Pals and Pokemon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Palworld Wiki / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e7ea8a6a192b793d8ed0fd039949cc7" data-recommend-id="image://7e7ea8a6a192b793d8ed0fd039949cc7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bunch of comparisons of Pals and Pokemon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Well, good luck to all involved.

<p>Riot Games has canceled a 2D fighting game that was similar to Super Smash Bros, according to a new report from <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-smash-melee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mikhail Klimentov</a>.</p>



<p>Known internally as “Pool Party”, the game was to be set in the League of Legends universe, and was being worked on by about “70-80 employees”. The game was canceled in May.</p>



<p>“Riot Games saw an opportunity to build and support the game’s esports scene — unlike Nintendo, which is notoriously hands-off and even hostile toward the Smash competitive ecosystem,” the report reads.</p>



<p>Klimentov’s sources said that the game’s cancelation happened because of a “reassessment of consumer appetite for a Smash competitor.” He added that Riot was “spooked” by the apparent failure of MultiVersus.</p>



<p>Pool Party was originally slated to be a “hardcore fighting game” before the game’s scope was changed to include party elements and a more casual feel. The report states that the changes had “frustrated” people on the project.</p>



<p>In a statement given to Klimentov, Riot senior communication director Joe Hixson said, “We always have a number of projects in various phases of R&amp;D, and spinning projects up and down happens multiple times a year.”</p>



<p>As far as the employees working on the game, at least half were moved to other projects within the company while others were looking to be moved to other projects or had left the company.</p>



<p>The development of Pool Part had no impact on Riot’s other fighting game 2XKO, the 2v2 fighting game scheduled for release in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-a-hot-topic-as-microsoft-hikes-xbox-game-pass-prices<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a hot topic in the wake of Microsoft announcing it will increase the price of Xbox Game Pass and introduce a new standard tier which doesn't include day one releases.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-appears-to-be-getting-another-price-hike">Microsoft announced on July 9, 2024 that it's raising the price of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate worldwide</a> and specifically from $16.99 to $19.99 a month in the U.S. Price changes go into effect for new members on July 10, 2024 and for existing members on September 12, 2024.</p><p>The more basic $10.99 Xbox Game Pass Console tier is "soon" being replaced with Xbox Game Pass Standard too — a $14.99 option which doesn't include the beloved day one release feature, "specific entries to the Game Pass Ultimate library," access to EA Play, Xbox Cloud Gaming, perks, Quests, and discounts on games in the Game Pass library.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-and-game-pass-are-about-to-get-a-little-more-expensive">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate was last increased in price in 2023</a>, from $14.99 to $16.99, meaning paying $14.99 a month for Xbox Game Pass therefore nets users significantly less than it did just one year ago, with Microsoft essentially removing day one titles, EA Play, cloud gaming, and free perks from the service in that time.</p><p>But it's the lack of day one titles on the soon standard tier which has some fans most upset, especially as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-with-xbox-game-pass">Call of Duty will finally appear as an Xbox Game Pass title with 2024's Black Ops 6</a> following <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-69-billion-activision-blizzard-buyout-imminent-after-stock-halted-and-uk-clears-deal">Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>.</p><p>Microsoft has been accused of lying about the status of Black Ops 6 on Xbox Game Pass, as in May 2024 the company confirmed it as a day one title and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-insists-it-wont-lock-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-behind-a-new-game-pass-tier-at-launch">made no indication players wouldn't be able to access it on their current subscriptions</a>.</p><p>"Upon launch, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be playable on Xbox and PC for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Xbox Game Pass for Console members," Microsoft said at the time.</p><p>This is true, however. Microsoft said Black Ops 6 will be available on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Xbox Game Pass Console. But it didn't say the first two would see a price increase worldwide or that the final, cheapest tier would be made obsolete.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Catalog</h3><p>This is the complete list of all Xbox Game Pass games. Log in to copy games, make your own rankings, or mark what games you're playing or have completed. Sort by "Recently Added" to see the newest additions to the catalog.</p></div><p>Microsoft couldn't even guarantee games like Black Ops 6 would come to Xbox Game Pass Standard eventually. These titles "may be added to the library at a future date," it said.</p><p>So the implication at the time that Black Ops 6 would be available through the $10.99 a month subscription is no longer true unless you're subscribed to that tier already, as new customers can't sign up for it. Instead of that $10.99, the cheapest Game Pass tier through which Xbox console players can now access Black Ops 6 is the bumped up Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, at $19.99 a month.</p><p>Fans are therefore a little frustrated, with many saying they plan to cancel their Xbox Game Pass subscriptions once their current run ends.</p><p>"No no, we're not changing Game Pass, we're not doing a price increase, putting Black Ops 6 on Game Pass hasn't change Game Pass pricing," mocked <a href="https://x.com/CODWarfareForum/status/1810926357913710862" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@CODWarfareForum</a> on X/Twitter. "Two months later: Oh yeah we lied again, we're increasing Game Pass subs and we're changing the tiers."</p><p>"Xbox Game Pass prices set to increase by 25%, just in time for the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 release," said <a href="https://x.com/GNGNewsCOD/status/1810908318098981232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@GNGNewsCOD</a>. "Xbox Game Pass's new pricing is basically the 'Call of Duty day one tax' and it's getting seriously wild how expensive subscriptions are become for both PlayStation and Xbox," added <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1810835932406276319" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@SynthPotato</a>. "It's now official despite previous reassurances the standard version of Xbox Game Pass will not include day one titles like the next Call of Duty, Doom, or Indiana Jones," said <a href="https://x.com/oliver_drk/status/1810811331861241886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@oliver_drk</a>.</p><p>Others said they expected the release of Black Ops 6 to bump up Game Pass prices, though they're not necessarily happy about it. "Makes too much sense... incoming COD," said SnatcherHunter on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/windows-central-xbox-game-pass-is-getting-major-changes-new-%E2%80%98standard%E2%80%99-tier-option-for-new-members-with-no-day-one-games-price-increases.923187/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>. "Day one COD doesn't sound so good now," said ChEmIcAl_KeEn on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1dzedib/game_pass_ultimate_price_increase_coming_might_be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>.</p><p>"I thought this would happen in September before Call of Duty. The monthly costs are adding up," said <a href="https://x.com/Otikage/status/1810872072853213288" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Otikag</a><a href="https://x.com/Otikage/status/1810872072853213288" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">e</a> on X/Twitter. "Price increase was expected though, all those studios to cater for. I am sure the price is just gonna keep going up with more acquisitions."</p><p>Rumors around a spike have circulated since May 2024, essentially since Microsoft announced Black Ops 6 would be coming as a day one title. The price rise also comes after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">Microsoft shut down entire studios</a> including Hi-Fi Rush and Ghostwire Tokyo developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

But apparently, there's something spooky on the horizon, judging by Nintendo's creepy new teaser. It tells us nothing about the game--not even its title. But it does pose a single question: Who is Emio?</p><p>We're assuming that Emio is the man in the trench coat with a paper bag over his head that has a hand-drawn face on it. Nintendo isn't exactly known for its Mature-rated horror games, but that's what this appears to be unless Luigi's Mansion 4 is taking a very dark turn.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Emio - Nintendo Switch Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Emio does have a listing <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/emio/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Nintendo's home page</a>, which is also lacking in details. What it does reveal is that the smiling man's expressions can change. And as unsettling as his current look is, one of Emio's alternate expressions is even more sinister.</p><p>Now that the teaser is out, Nintendo will presumably clue fans in soon enough. But as far as first impressions go, Emio feels very unsettling and unlike the vast majority of the publisher's titles. Regardless, it would be intriguing to see Nintendo take a stab at a M-rated horror game, if that's what Emio turns out to be.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-in-progress/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Following the chaotic and potentially world-ending events of both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/24/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-review/">Endwalker</a> and its successive updates, Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail promises new adventures in Tural that have a more laid back, summer holiday tone to them. The past week has seen me dive into a little bit of everything that this grand new expansion offers, already racing up to around level 96, for anyone keeping count.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV: DAWNTRAIL Full Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgiuQwzB6aU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Narratively, Dawntrail follows the Warrior of Light in their objective to aid Wuk Lumat in the rite of succession for what is essentially the throne of Tural, a nation to the west of Sharlayan. This rite comes with challenges aplenty, but also brings with it returning characters we all love, new characters to fall in love with, and – even by the point I’m at in the story – enough twists to round out a decent mystery novel.</p>


<p>The thing I want to strongly stress early on is the relaxed nature of this new story arc overall. This is essentially starting an entirely new tale for the world of Final Fantasy XIV, so it has a slower pace than previously. I’m personally loving the lower stakes at play here, but those coming into this expecting another Shadowbringers will be greatly disappointed. However, Wuk Lamat herself is incredible and I won’t hear anything opposing that view.</p>
<p>By and large, you’ll be running around Tural helping out various NPCs with various returning gameplay mechanics while exploring, such as following folks without them noticing. As and when you get into a scrape with enemies, the combat is much the same as before, though with all of the existing Jobs having been tweaked in small or severe ways. Thankfully my precious White Mage has been changed very little, but your go-to favourite might have had a bigger overhaul.</p>


<p><span data-contrast="auto">Then there’s the new Jobs – Pictomancer and Viper. I’ve not been able to spend a great deal of time with either of them, but in my early impressions they feel like completely different ends of the spectrum from one another. Viper is the smooth-brained, push buttons and see swishes accompanied by big numbers one, while Pictomancer is the galaxy-brained one with odd rotations and really long explanations for every ability. Both, however, are amazing additions and I’m looking forward to playing around more with them.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To test out these changes and new Jobs though, we have a bevy of new dungeons and trials, which once again you can tackle with a group of NPCs or – <em>gasp</em> – with other people. These, so far, have been a huge step up in challenge, with some very interesting mechanics to contend with. I can’t claim to be a perfect player of the game by any means, but some of these instances have truly tested my knowledge of my Jobs and their abilities in the game, so more of this please, Yoshi-P.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Visually as well, there has been a significant step up with Dawntrail, especially with the addition of a widespread graphical update with the 7.0 patch. This has made several changes to lighting, textures and character models that will be immediately noticeable to any long-time players of the game. This graphical update has then been leveraged wonderfully in the areas I have visited with some of the most beautiful vistas that have ever been in the game. What’s more, the team know how good this looks, otherwise I cannot explain the reason for the amount of close-up shots of the beautifully upgraded faces in cutscenes.</span></p>

<p>One area that’s business as usual, in the best possible way, is with Soken’s work on the sound design. Every track in this soundtrack is incredible, especially the song playing in Tuliyollal during the day, which has absolute no right going that hard. Oddly, I love the battle theme in the field this time around too, which I haven’t since A Realm Reborn, but that might say more about me than anything.</p>
<p>So far, Dawntrail is an incredible expansion to an already stellar game. Its slower pace and lower stakes create a calmer and more fun atmosphere to explore, but the increased challenge of the combat instances balance that calmness out with frenetic (and panicked) action. The new Jobs are great additions and the changes to previous Jobs (that I’ve seen so far) haven’t broken anything substantial. It might not be the absolute pinnacle of the Final Fantasy XIV experience, but it’s a joy to behold.</p>
<p>Now, onto the next dungeon I go.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-dev-pocketpair-pals-up-with-sony-to-expand-beyond-video-games.923667/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-sony-deal<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has announced that it has signed a deal with Sony, as well as the company's subsidiary Aniplex, in order to expand open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>beyond the realm of video games.</p>
<p>The joint venture between Pocketpair and Sony was announced via <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1810850865764589587" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter) earlier today</a>. It bears the imaginative name of Palworld Entertainment, and it's been established for "the purpose of accelerating the multifaceted global development of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and its further expansion". That's a mouthful.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1810850911939678235" rel="noopener" target="_blank">followup message</a>, Pocketpair reveals that the first fruits of its Aniplex partnership are already on the way; soon,&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>merchandise will be up for grabs on the <a href="https://store.aniplexusa.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official Aniplex site</a>, although the studios haven't revealed what kind of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>merch you can look forward to yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-sony-deal-workers.jpg?itok=2b9ymmAe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-sony-deal-workers.jpg?itok=AthdS92y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You're about to see a whole lot more of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't yet know exactly what the deal between Pocketpair and Sony will yield, but given that Aniplex is involved, it's safe to assume we'll be getting some sort of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>anime or animated adaptation.</p>
<p>Technically, Pocketpair's deal is with Sony Music Japan, but it's worth noting that Sony Music does have its fingers in some gaming pies; Aniplex publishes the mobile game&nbsp;<em>Fate/Grand Order</em>, as well as games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-sweep-the-board-gameplay">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Sweep the Board</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/danganronpa-creators-new-game-risking-lives">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a>&nbsp;</em>in Japan.</p>
<p>As such, a partnership with Sony Music doesn't necessarily mean we're in for&nbsp;<em>Palworld: The Album</em>, as much as I'd pay to hear that.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that although no official&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>PS5 version has been announced, it looks that much more likely now thanks to this deal with Sony.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-sony-deal-mammorest.jpg?itok=XhqpvJcI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-sony-deal-mammorest.jpg?itok=DGVnU1Sv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It doesn't look like&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is about to get its own album, sadly.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've missed out on the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>hype, it's an open-world survival-crafting game that takes strong influence from&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>in its creature-collecting aspect, as well as games like&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>.</p>
<p>The game launched back in January and quickly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet">gained immense popularity</a>, rocketing up the Steam charts in the weeks after its release. Developer Pocketpair has also released a number of updates for&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/massive-palworld-update-sakurajima">new Pals, a new island, and more</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and it's also available on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. If you're a Game Pass subscriber, you'll be pleased to know it's included with your subscription.</p>

            <p>
A new VR multiplayer game has been announced by nDreams, the developer of Synapse, coming to PSVR 2 and Meta Quest. 
</p>
<p>
Frenzies is an arena multiplayer shooter with gameplay similar to Synapse, split into unpredictable five-round matches with names like Red Light, Green Light and Glitter Pig - it's unclear exactly what that one's about.
</p>
<p>
Round types are both solo and team-based for an unpredictable experience (as the name suggests), all while wearing Squid Game-esque onesies with customisable masks.

<p>

The game has been developed by Near Light, an nDreams Studio. 
</p>
<p>
"The last thing you can accuse Frenzies of is being boring," said Paul Mottram, head of
studio, Near Light. "Taking inspiration from classics like Quake and Unreal Tournament, we
wanted to inject some unpredictable excitement back into the genre while retaining what
makes VR shooters so special. We think Frenzies nails that sweet spot."
</p>
<p>
A closed alpha for the game will begin later this month - you can register interest in <a href="https://discord.com/invite/frenziesVR">the game's discord community</a>.
</p>
<p>
Synapse released last year to critical acclaim, with our Ian Higton describing the game as "some of the best VR blasting out there" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/synapse-a-pure-power-fantasy-that-epitomises-everything-great-about-virtual-reality">Synapse review</a>.

</p>
<p>
Eurogamer also spoke with voice actors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jennifer-hale-and-david-hayter-on-voice-acting-for-vr-reuniting-for-synapse-and-shrivelled-snake">Jennifer Hale and David Hayter on their roles in Synapse</a> and reuniting after working together on Metal Gear Solid.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-reveals-trailer-for-m-rated-game-teases-creepy-emio/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Nintendo released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbhwwG-QvGQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new cinematic trailer</a> today, teasing an apparent horror game with an M-rating from the ESRB, featuring the mysterious “Emio.”</p>



<p>The trailer is very brief and doesn’t include any details about the plot or release window. Instead, it only features grainy cinematic footage of a man standing in the dark, wearing a paper bag with a smiley-face on it. </p>



<p>The trailer description has no other information either, simply inviting fans to ask, “who is Emio?” with a corresponding hashtag. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This off-brand approach for Nintendo’s Emio trailer both surprised and delighted many fans. It’s unclear if the cinematic nature of the teaser relates to the gameplay itself, possibly hinting at the interactive movie genre. </p>



<p>Most recently, Nintendo held a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive direct showcase</a> in June 2024. It featured 40 minutes of new games and updates that will release in the second half of 2024. That included games with a variety of budgets like Farmagia and The New Denpa Man.</p>



<p>Since today’s new M-rated game didn’t make an appearance during that event, it may not launch anytime this year. </p>



<p>If it arrives in 2025, it may even wait to launch on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Switch successor</a>. But this is only speculation, and Nintendo has not confirmed anything about the Emio game’s release date. Nintendo also recently revealed its plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-says-it-is-working-to-stop-leaks-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prevent gaming leaks</a>, so fans might have to wait for something official to hear more.</p>

                <p>Microsoft is once again shaking up its Xbox Game Pass service, as it plans to slowly do away with one of its tiers and is in the process of replacing it with a new one. At the same time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-getting-a-price-increase-and-introducing-a-new-tier/1100-6524819/" data-ref-id="1100-6524819">the price of Xbox Game Pass will be increasing</a>, and with several options available to consumers, things can get a little bit confusing. If you're looking to join the service or upgrade your current membership, here's everything you need to know about what each Game Pass tier gets you.</p><h2 id="What_is_Xbox_Game_Pass_">What is Xbox Game Pass?</h2><p>Introduced several years ago, Game Pass is a subscription service that offers access to a library of first-party games from Microsoft and even more third-party titles. This a comprehensive collection of games across a wide selection of genres, and it can be accessed on PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and through the cloud on compatible devices. Games come and go on the service, but the key draw to Game Pass is that you'll get access to the biggest Xbox games on launch day. This year has quite a few big titles on the way, like the next Call of Duty game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/">Black Ops 6</a>, alongside other titles like Avowed, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and more.</p><h2 id="Xbox_Game_Pass_Core">Xbox Game Pass Core</h2><ul><li><em>$10 per month, </em></li><li><em>12 months for $60. Starting September 18, the annual subscription will increase to $75 per year.</em></li></ul><p>If you're looking to dip your feet into this program, Xbox Game Pass Core is where you may want to start. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-core-all-36-games-revealed-for-tomorrows-launch/1100-6517664/" data-ref-id="1100-6517664">Game Pass Core launched in September 2023 with 36 games</a>, and unlike the other Game Pass tiers, it does not get new first-party games on launch day. Five more games have been added to its library since its launch, and members can choose from titles like Fallout 76, Doom Eternal, and Gears 5.</p><p>In addition to the games, Game Pass Core members also get access to online console multiplayer, deals, discounts of up to 50% off select games, and access to Free Play Days for select games.</p><h2 id="Xbox_Game_Pass_Standard">Xbox Game Pass Standard</h2><ul><li><em>$15 per month</em></li></ul><p>The newest Game Pass tier, Xbox Game Pass Standard has a library consisting of hundreds of games and is available for Xbox consoles. You also get all the Game Pass Core perks mentioned above like console multiplayer and discounts on select games, but this subscription does not include "immediate" access to first-party Xbox games when they launch.</p><h2 id="Xbox_Game_Pass_for_console">Xbox Game Pass for console</h2><p>Xbox Game Pass for console is slowly being phased out, and as of July 10, it will no longer be available for new members. Members who are already subscribed to Game Pass for console and have the automatic payment renewal option enabled will still be able to continue with this membership. Microsoft says it will share more information soon on the future of this Game Pass tier. For anyone who is subscribed to it, this membership offers day-one first-party game releases, a massive library of games, and member discounts on Xbox consoles.</p><h2 id="PC_Game_Pass">PC Game Pass</h2><ul><li><em>$10 per month</em></li><li><em>$12 per month starting September 12</em></li></ul><p>If you don't have an Xbox console and you're not too concerned with cloud gaming, PC Game Pass is also available. You get all the Game Pass perks, all the games in the EA Play library, and access to new day-one titles. The library of available games is different, as the focus here is on PC-first games across genres that play well on this platform.</p><h2 id="Xbox_Game_Pass_Ultimate">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</h2><ul><li><em>$17 per month</em></li><li><em>$20 per month starting September 12</em></li></ul><p>Even with a looming price increase, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is still excellent value for money. Not only do you get full access to its library, new first-party games on day one, and member discounts, but several other exclusive perks as well. This membership gives you access to the Game Pass library on Xbox consoles, PC, and cloud-compatible devices, and you also get free access to the EA Play library of games. Additionally, there are in-game add-ons, consumables, and partner offers for select games.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/welcome-to-xbox%E2%80%99s-rot-economy.923631/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a big week for bad ideas: Fans are pissed at both Xbox and <em>Apex Legends </em>developer Respawn for unveiling new, complicated pricing schemes that tapdance frantically around the fact that they want you to pay more for worse services. It’s a trend that’s come for every aspect of our lives, so maybe we shouldn’t be surprised it keeps coming for video games too.&nbsp;</p><p>On Tuesday, Xbox <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/game-pass-updates-july-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> changes to Game Pass, previously a pretty good deal that featured day one access to new games. I can’t walk you through what happened here without having to write embarrassing phrases like “Xbox Game Pass Standard <a href="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/ad/51/ad517e36-25cc-4d7d-897d-c0f9c667e9cb.pdf?n=FINAL%20Xbox%20Game%20Pass%20options%20for%20consoles.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">includes</a> the perks from Xbox Game Pass Core,” but basically: all Game Pass tiers are getting more expensive (which Xbox demurely calls “<a href="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/42/85/42850801-4997-491d-a5bd-69c5bd7948ac.pdf?n=FINAL%20Game%20Pass%20price%20updates%20by%20country%20and%20currency.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price changes</a>”), and the service is offering less access to day one games.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Game Pass for Console, which once gave access to day one games, is going away, seemingly to be replaced “in the coming months” with Xbox Game Pass Standard, which <em>doesn’t</em> include day one games. If you want day one games, you’ll have to shell out for the now-more-expensive Game Pass Ultimate, or the now-more-expensive PC Game Pass. All of these words crowd the mouth and boggle the mind, but what else would you expect when Xbox names things.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Brought to you by the company that thought it was a good idea to release completely different consoles called Xbox One, Xbox One S, Xbox One X, Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X <a href="https://t.co/8erp9oToVx">https://t.co/8erp9oToVx</a></p>— Mark Serrels (@Serrels) <a href="https://twitter.com/Serrels/status/1810883333909307440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 10, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Many people have pointed out that these changes come just before <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/28/play-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>comes to Game Pass</a> on day one in October. In May, Xbox told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-wont-be-locked-behind-a-new-xbox-game-pass-tier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eurogamer</a> that “Upon launch, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> will be playable on Xbox and PC for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Xbox Game Pass for Console members.” Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writes now</a> “that still appears to be true - albeit now with an additional cost, and not if you're a new Xbox Game Pass Standard subscriber.”&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s pivot to something else that sucks: This week, <em>Apex Legends </em>revealed <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/battle-pass-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changes to its battle pass</a>, which see the once 110-tier, season-long pass split into two 60-level, half-season passes. A lot of the changes are ticky-tacky <em>Apex </em>stuff, but the change that’s got players most <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/apex-legends-players-criticise-plans-to-shake-up-how-battle-passes-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">riled up</a> is that, where you could once buy the battle pass with in-game currency that you could earn through the pass, now you can only buy it with real money. Why? Respawn writes that “The decision to move from AC [Apex Coins] to real world currency is not one that we made lightly, but it does allow us to decrease the price of Premium+ for our community.” Or, as a Twitter community note on the announcement reads, “While Respawn claims this change is made through ‘community feedback’, it is obvious that this change is only profitable for EA Shareholders.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Starting with Season 22, we’re evolving the Apex Legends Battle Pass to improve your experience and progression goals.</p><p>Read on to learn everything to know about the upcoming changes or check out the infographic below to learn more. </p><p>📃: <a href="https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq">https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq</a> <a href="https://t.co/i516ktP9ma">pic.twitter.com/i516ktP9ma</a></p></div>— Apex Legends (@PlayApex) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayApex/status/1810330029265420515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>So now we come to the heart of the issue: all of this shit is worse for users, but makes numbers go up on a line somewhere.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-muddies-the-waters-with-new-game-pass-tier-and-price-hike.923622/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has introduced a new pricing tier for its Game Pass subscription service, and prices have also been hiked across several of the service’s existing options.</p>
<p>Per the official Xbox <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/game-pass-updates-july-2024">support page</a>, the new tier is called Xbox Game Pass Standard, and it’ll cost $14.99 per month. It’s essentially replacing the Xbox Game Pass Console tier, although there’s one critical difference: Standard won’t offer day one Game Pass releases.</p>
<p>If you want to play those, you’ll have to plump for Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass, both of which will still offer day one releases. Confused yet? I’m not surprised.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier-avowed.jpg?itok=KTJp8Vxe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier-avowed.jpg?itok=M0RBvu7b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Games like&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>won't be coming to every Xbox Game Pass tier on day one.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the new tier, you can expect price hikes for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass. They’re not huge hikes, but they are significant.</p>
<p>Game Pass Ultimate will now set you back $19.99 a month, while PC Game Pass will cost $11.99 per month. If you’re in certain countries (although not the US), Game Pass Core, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-core">introduced last year</a>, is also getting a price hike.</p>
<p>These price hikes take effect starting from today for new members, and for existing subscribers, prices will start to change from September 12th, with the next billing charge from that date being the first one to use the new prices.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass-new-tier.jpg?itok=OH44oPWj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass-new-tier.jpg?itok=KVWziEzK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some Xbox Game Pass tiers won't be getting&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>at launch.</figcaption></figure><p>As for Xbox Game Pass Console, if you’re a subscriber and you’ve got auto-renewal on, your subscription won’t change. However, if you disable auto-renewal, you’ll need to switch your plan to one of the others to keep playing games on Game Pass.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that the introduction of this new tier muddies the waters when it comes to Xbox’s “play on day one” message, which must now carry a couple of asterisks; after all, not all Game Pass subscription types offer day one releases.</p>
<p>Also noteworthy is the fact that these new Game Pass changes are being introduced ahead of the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1">arrive on Game Pass</a> (or, rather, certain tiers) on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement">launch in October</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll have to wait and see what effect these changes have on Game Pass’ subscriber numbers, if any. Stay tuned for more info.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-uploaded-a-bizarre-horror-game-teaser<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Nintendo has posted an unusual and unexplained teaser video on its YouTube and social channels, for what appears to be a new horror project. 
</p>
<p>
The teaser features grainy footage of a figure in a trenchcoat wearing a paper bag on their head, with a smiling face drawn on it. 
</p>
<p>
Japanese text at the end of the video translates to "Smiling Man", while text accompanying the video simply states "#WhoIsEmio" - "Emio" being the Japanese pronounciation of "Smiling Man". 
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Emio" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbhwwG-QvGQ?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">
<span>Emio</span>
<template>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbhwwG-QvGQ?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VbhwwG-QvGQ?autoplay=1">
</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<figcaption>Who is Emio?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbhwwG-QvGQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
The teaser features a Nintendo Switch logo and, in the US version of the video, a mature "M" rating from the ESRB. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo fans have been quick to comment on the bizarre teaser, which went live at 2pm UK time this afternoon. 
</p>
<p>
"This is extremely weird/out of character for Nintendo," wrote one person on video game forum <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-uploads-a-really-mysterious-trailer-to-youtube-called-emio-translates-to-smiling-man.923547/page-2">ResetEra</a>. "The fact it's age restricted and the whole tone of video."
</p>
<p>
"A new Nintendo Horror IP?" guessed another.
</p>
<p>
Others suggested this was bizarre viral marketing for Switch 2 (it's not), or that Emio was an unheard-of third Mario brother. (It's-a-me, Emio!)
</p>
<p>
The promience of the teaser on Nintendo's own channels would typically suggest this is an internal project for Nintendo, which has rarely strayed into the horror genre. We've asked Nintendo for more details.

That was the first sign that something unusual was going on. The second was that the page was age-restricted, a rare move for the family-friendly gaming company. Here’s a look at the trailer itself:</p><p>A child’s piano plays a few creepy notes. A person in a trench coat wearing a bag over their head with a smiling Jack-o’-lantern cutout pops into the frame. You can see their shadow cast against a wall that appears to be made of cardboard, with a piece of duck tape running down the middle. The camera suddenly cuts to the person’s hand which appears to be missing a finger. It then cuts to a close-up of their face before cutting back to a shot of a person wearing a different paper bag with a Cheshire cat grin on it. According to fan translations, the Japanese characters that appear at the end say “smiling man.”</p><p>Responses in the comments on Twitter have been all over the place, with some players going “wtf?”, others joking that Nintendo had finally caught a recent well-known video game leaker. Some are wondering if this is a sign that Nintendo is making a first-party horror IP from the ground-up. The teaser shows all the signs of an attempted viral alternate reality game (ARG) for a potential analog-style creep-fest. </p><p>Nintendo’s mission statement is to “put smiles on the faces of everyone we touch.” Emio gives that wholesome motto a new sinister twist. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/10/ps-vr2-frenzies-revealed-new-metro-awakening-gameplay-details-wanderer-the-fragments-of-fate-in-depth-look/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new blog post</a> from PlayStation, Vertigo Games teased new images, plot details, and a pre-order release window for Metro Awakening.</p>



<p>Creative director Martin de Ronde and game director Samar Louwe confirmed that pre-orders for the VR game start in September 2024. </p>



<p>They said Metro Awakening is a “standalone installment in the franchise, set before the events of the original game Metro 2033.”  They added that it features “a very, very personal, emotional story for our protagonist.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Vertigo Games first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-metro-game-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Metro Awakening</a> during PlayStation’s latest State of Play event. This included a brief cinematic and gameplay trailer, though it didn’t reveal much. </p>



<p>Some of the dialogue teased at the “emotional story,” asking the protagonist to “focus your mind on your wife, and step into the void.”</p>



<p>Martin de Ronde and Samar Louwe also mentioned VR features. They said they wanted the VR interactions to be as “immersive and diegetic as possible,” including adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. However, they do reassure fans that gameplay will maintain “stealth-combat dynamic.”</p>



<p>Metro Awakening does not have a release date yet, but Vertigo Games reiterated today that it is due sometime “later this year.” The pre-orders for Metro Awakening do hint at a potential launch window. </p>



<p>The devs built Metro Awakening exclusively for VR. It will be available on PlayStation VR2, Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest 3, and Steam VR in 2024.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, 4A Games stated last February that the next mainline Metro game will only <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/4a-games-says-the-next-mainline-metro-game-will-launch-when-its-ready/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch when it’s ready</a>.</p>

<p>For the first time in four years, NBA 2K will bring the “New Gen” version of the game to PC with NBA 2K25. That means the PC version will have the same features as those on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>Previously, the game was treated as a last-gen title on PC along with the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>“NBA 2K25 on PC will be New Gen, which means that all associated modes and features, excluding crossplay, will be available to play on PC via Steam,” <a href="https://nba.2k.com/2k25/pc-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2K Sports said</a>. “This includes ProPLAY™, MyCAREER, MyTEAM, Play Now and, for the first time on PC – The City, MyNBA Eras, and The W.”</p>



<p>As mentioned in the statement from 2K, the only feature the PC version won’t have is cross-play with the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. For online play, it will only be between PC players. It will, however, be fully Steam Deck compatible.</p>



<p>NBA 2K25 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k25-is-coming-september-2024-cover-athletes-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on September 6</a>.</p>

			<p>Star Wars Outlaws is less than two months away from its August 30 launch date, and Ubisoft Massive has partnered with IGN to unveil even more details about the open world game throughout the month of July.</p>
<p>The first feature is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6nCdIslajQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a video interview</a> with Game Directors Julian Gerighty and Mathias Karlson. The duo confirmed, among other things, that the studio decided to go for quality rather than quantity.</p>
<p><em><strong>Julian Gerighty:</strong> We don't want things to be just big for big sake; we need it to be contained, always fun, always proposing different activities.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Mathias Karlson: </strong>It's about calibrating size to substance. When you see something that breaks pattern, that stands out for whatever reason, when you go there and look there's something there to do, and that repeats frequently enough and that the quests, the bespoke kind of content of the game, make use of it so that it doesn't feel like a separate experience but it's all one.</em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-qa-game-length-can-double-with-side-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our own interview with the Star Wars Outlaws team at Summer Game Fest</a>, we were told that the game size would essentially double if considering the side content, which ranges from expert missions (in which protagonist Kay Vess helps other NPCs to get something from them), quick contracts for underworld factions, playing Sabacc or the Asteroid Field arcade shooter game, and more. But there are also emergent events happening throughout the whole game, as Gerighty told IGN:</p>
<p><em>Every two or three minutes, there'll be something that's happening, whether it's an ambush or the Empire arresting some civilians or combat with some criminal syndicates, and it's up to you whether you want to engage or not.</em></p>
<p>The video interview also goes over the process of gathering more information and unlocking more of the planets' maps, which does not happen through old-style Ubisoft towers. Massive went with a far more organic approach instead, as discussed by Gerighty:</p>
<p><em>You're going to have to take some risks. You're going to have to go to a Cantina where you can eavesdrop and pick up on some conversations that will lead you to another location that reveals a location within the open world that you have to get on your speeder to go and find.&nbsp;There will be a fog of war that you'll be able to clear up and that's really where your curiosity will open things up even more.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, Ubisoft Massive tried to make the universe Star Wars Outlaws feel alive. For example, if you're in good standing with certain criminal factions and they happen to be nearby when you get into a fight with the Empire, they will help.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-goes-gold-nearly-2-months-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is already 'gold'</a>, so there won't be any delays. For a comprehensive overview of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/star-wars-outlaws-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-open-world-game-in-the-far-far-away-galaxy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out this article</a>.</p>
