            <p>
Naoki Yoshida, Final Fantasy 14's producer and director, has addressed fan fears of recurrent problems impacting the launch of the next expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-everything-we-know-so-far">Dawntrail</a>, stating there's "almost no chance" of server congestion.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer at a preview event for Dawntrail, Yoshida discussed improvements to servers since the launch of previous expansion Endwalker, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-suffers-ddos-attack-ahead-of-dawntrail-release">impact of the recent DDoS attack</a>.
</p>
<p>
"It was a source of great inconvenience for our players last time," said Yoshida of Endwalker server woes. "Since we are looking towards the future of Final Fantasy 14 and its expansion as well, we have been excessive with planning and preparing servers.

<p>
"Now if we feel it is necessary, we can open up the new servers with a press of a button. So I think there's almost no chance that we would face a situation where we cannot accommodate the number of players required."
</p>
<p>
Yoshida also explained how players can now travel to different data servers during non-peak times. "So with that in mind, I think we should be good in terms of preparation," said Yoshida.
</p>
<p>
He added, however, that should access be smoother for Dawntrail, it's not due to a drop in players but because the development team has prepared so many new servers.
</p>
<p>
Yoshida also discussed the recent DDoS attack from May that caused technical difficulties in data centres across the globe.
</p>
<p>
"They are very simple in nature," said Yoshida, "but it's precisely because of that, that it's difficult for us to defend ourselves."
</p>
<p>
Of course, Yoshida wouldn't go into too much detail on countermeasures, but explained the team runs simulations to identify possible patterns of attack. 
</p>
<p>
"There is not a zero chance of [an attack] happening," said Yoshida. "But we would basically work on preparing more defence patterns, so that we aren't impacted by that kind of situation.
</p>
<p>
"It is, by nature, just defensive, but this is the way that we are fighting and I just hope that everyone can remember that we are putting in the effort to defend ourselves."
</p>
<p>
Square Enix added a <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/f65d0cde87a0620f16abde630e008841fb8d70f4">new European data centre</a> and three worlds at the start of May, though they are not yet accessible. Plus <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/93750e4b0d6d5a4faf6a00dee199082392f1a754">more are coming to North America too</a>.
</p>
<p>
Queues for Endwalker were so long, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-promises-extra-free-game-time-for-those-long-final-fantasy-14-endwalker-queues">free game time was offered to players to apologise for the long login times</a>. It proved so popular, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-is-so-popular-its-been-pulled-from-sale">game was even pulled from sale</a>.


</p>
<p>
Dawntrail will release on 2nd July (or 28th June for those with early access) and promises to offer "the very best summer vacation". It will be released across PC, PlayStation and Xbox Series X/S.

  <p id="DZzuSk">Announced in July 2023, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24167088/dawntrail-prepare-how-to-get-ready"><em>Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail</em></a> was a step in a new direction for Square Enix’s behemoth of an MMORPG. With a near decade-long story coming to a close through the <em>Endwalker</em> expansion, Creative Studio III teased a new start to the never-ending journey of the Warrior of Light, this time promising players a “summer vacation” of sorts set on a continent in the midst of political turmoil as it chooses its new leader. And with the new expansion would come further adjustments to the game, alongside the inclusion of two new job classes and a complete graphics overhaul. Square Enix provided Polygon with the opportunity to dive into a slice of <em>Dawntrail</em>, which included a look at both the Viper and Pictomancer job classes and the chance to run through one of the new dungeons.</p>
<p id="5Jq8z3">When I was present at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23811679/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-expansion-2024-release-date-ff14">Fan Fest 2023</a>, I was enticed by the idea of a new job class, mostly because I had grown tired of the continuously gutted Summoner, the lack of engagement while playing Gunbreaker (or any tank), and the homogenization of most of the healing job classes. So I jumped at the chance to give Viper a whirl at this recent preview event. Having now played them, the Viper and Pictomancer remind me of the more experimental age of <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> that arrived with the release of the <em>Heavensward</em> expansion — when the job classes were more interesting, and when Creative Studio III was still ironing out the wrinkles of <em>A Realm Rebor</em>n. </p>
<p id="Ay33wR">These two new job classes are both refreshingly complex. On the surface, Viper seems akin to the Ninja with its dual blades and dexterous animations, but in practice, it’s a more involved version of the Reaper, which was introduced through <em>Endwalker</em>. The Viper is fast and fluid, with your attacks built on devastating sweeps of your dual blades or combining the blades into a polearm through special attacks and stances to rip and tear through enemies. You are constantly swapping between stances, applying debilitating debuffs to enemies, and ramping up your attack speed to cancel animations to deal as much damage as possible in short bursts of time. Like the Reaper, the Viper has a healthy selection of single-target and AoE attacks, which means you will be able to reliably build up your Vipersight and Serpent’s Ire gauge. <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> has remained a game of building up your gauges to burst down enemies within very specific time windows, and <em>Dawntrail</em> doesn’t seem to stray from this path.</p>

<p id="uLKJXJ">However, the Pictomancer does provide an additional bit of support in combat, outside of being a damage-focused job class, through buffs, which is honestly quite refreshing. Through the use of spells brought to life by the strokes of a multicolored paintbrush, the Pictomancer paints swatches of color hastily on a canvas to manifest a hammer or the wingbeats of a Moogle to damage enemies. As you continue to color the world with vibrant flecks of paint and pain, you will accumulate color on your palette in the forms of highly saturated colors or pastels. Filling your palette will grant you access to more powerful spells, such as Holy in White or Comet in Black, which you need to balance between channeling the abilities of more powerful creatures and objects through your illustrations. Overall, Pictomancer is a very complicated job class that provides that aforementioned team support in the form of the Starry Sky Motif skill, which augments a party’s offensive capabilities. Where it will stand when it comes to Savage Raids and other endgame content like Ultimates will be interesting.</p>
<p id="LxjDBd">Alongside the addition of the Pictomancer and Viper, Creative Studio III will implement changes and updates to various job classes as part of <em>Dawntrail</em>. This has included a shift in how Monk is played, alongside adjustments to Black Mage. What I noticed with jobs like White Mage and Gunbreaker was that skills such as Presence of Mind or Bloodfest now transform into an additional skill once used. Presence of Mind turned into Glare IV, and Bloodfest became the full Renzokuken combo from <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>, Lionheart finisher included. Job classes will certainly be getting more skills, as I noticed the White Mage does have a dash similar to Dancer, but this adjustment has at least prevented further button bloat for those playing with controllers. The user interface also indicates what skills will change upon being used more clearly, which means you won’t accidentally be putting two of the same skill on your hotbars anymore.</p>

<p id="hK81FL">But above all else,<em> Final Fantasy 14</em> is a pretty game and perhaps one of the best-looking MMORPGs on the market. <em>Dawntrail</em> expands upon this not only through the texture update, which received a new benchmark after the initial one had seemingly gone <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/4603966abf780d1e177e0513dbecd574ad0d397a">awry</a>, and through the lush environments of Tural. Creative Studio III was not shy in hiding its inspirations for this expansion, billing it as a “<a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/contents/">vacation</a>” to the warmer climates of Eorzea’s version of Latin America. The dungeon of Ihuykatumu is full of vibrantly colored plants and other such creatures, even if it is just a trip down the Amazon River (in Final Fantasy form, of course), and the mountainous region where the Pelupelu are found is just as visually saturated. Tuliyollal, a large port city, is decorated with swaths of brightly colored cloth with intricate patterns, and houses are made out of a healthy mix of wood and stone. </p>
<p id="ZuSpbO">When asked about obvious nods to Latin America in <em>Dawntrail</em>, producer Naoki Yoshida (also known as Yoshi-P) mentioned that the team had some consultation on what would appear in the expansion. This included input from the global team at Square Enix and members of the translation team. However, Creative Studio III did choose to reach out for further input regarding the representation of the cultures they would go on to depict in<em> Dawntrail</em>. Yoshida also mentioned that even with consultation, there is always a potential risk.</p>

<p id="RXWKfk">“Of course our team is very cautious about taking risks, and they would advise, like, <em>So this might be a little too risky</em>, or <em>You might want to avoid this thing</em>, but we didn’t stop there. We tried to understand why they would consider it a risk, and figure out how to avoid any situation that could arise,” Yoshida said. “How do we understand, and how do we deepen our understanding so that people won’t take offense as to how we depict them and what they would interpret as offensive? We dug really deep into what is considered appropriate or inappropriate, even down to the textures that we used in wall patterns or even curvature for specific symbols. If that symbol was representative of something that a particular culture might find sacred, we don’t want to offend that. Sometimes we might do research and understand that meaning for ourselves.</p>
<p id="K7QL4l">“So we might make the decision that, <em>OK, this is what that represents, this is what it symbolizes, and this is how we want to use it.</em> Or if it’s too much of a risk and we don’t want it misinterpreted by our audience, we would instead try to figure out how to modify this to steer away from offensive content and make sure that we are symbolizing something similar, but be mindful of the culture that we are trying to depict. We don’t want to make this one-sided. It was a learning experience for sure. But at the same time, we didn’t want to let go of certain elements just because someone would seek a potential risk in it. I feel like the fruits of our labor are very clear, and that people will see what we have tried to do and appreciate it. We’re hoping that the different cultures represented are respected, and that it will be appreciated by the players as well.”</p>
<p id="y3GRHS">When asked about possible official support for Latin American countries such as Brazil and Mexico, given <em>Dawntrail</em>’s heavy dose of inspiration, Yoshida said he is aware of issues concerning latency for players in that region. He mentioned that having a physical data center for Latin America is “technically possible, and not that difficult of a task to do, so to speak,” but the lack of dedicated language support makes it more complicated. “We don’t have a dedicated Latin American language specialist,” Yoshida explained. “So we always have to rely on outsourcing for any translations of the Spanish and Portuguese language. And considering <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> is a live service game, it needs constant support. Not having that dedicated person does create a bottleneck.” But he went on to mention that Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu is a strong supporter of more language support for other regions. “I myself traveled to Brazil last year,” Yoshida concluded. “I met many passionate players there, and there is a desire, for sure.” </p>

Two of my friends came across a Queen Bee, which was an exceptionally powerful target that could be hunted in <em>Dawntrail</em>’s open environments. They couldn’t take on it themselves, eventually asking for assistance from me and some other nearby friends.</p><p><strong>Pre-order <em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em>:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffinal-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffinal-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><p>A handful of us tried our hand at the fight and still failed. The aides at the event went around buzzing at other players, letting them know what we were up to, and indicating that we might need further help. Before long, our numbers grew until there were about a dozen of us fighting this one monster. Even with our greater ranks, we seemed to be wiping pretty quickly.</p><p>Then, one player took the initiative and started calling out the buffs, debuffs, and abilities that the Queen Bee was using. They also issued commands, such as telling us when to rush in or stay back to avoid some of her attacks. Before long, our party of players, who for the most part <em>didn’t </em>know each other, whittled her down and vanquished her, with everyone involved letting out a triumphant roar across the preview hall.

I’ve played stretches of it with friends and others by my lonesome, but the story has always been front and center. I’ve mostly been playing catch up since picking up the game right around the launch of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ffxiv-s-biggest-expansion-yet-endwalker-will-take-you-1847854594&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ffxiv-s-biggest-expansion-yet-endwalker-will-take-you-1847854594"><em>Endwalker</em></a></span><em> </em>at the end of 2021, and so whenever I log on, I’m heads down in the ever-evolving saga of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, rarely touching any of <em>FF14</em>’s side content, let alone its endgame activities. I don’t enjoy the game <em>with </em>others so much as I enjoy it while I happen to be <em>around</em> them.</p><p><em>Dawntrail </em>will mark my first expansion that I’m playing alongside <em>FF14</em>’s renowned community. I finally get to experience firsthand the excitement of the fandom as we get to unravel the mysteries of Tural together. I get to run the same dungeons, trials, and raids as everyone else, and I’ll likely be colliding with more players than ever before as we take on creatures in the wilds. Jumping into <em>Dawntrail </em>holds the promise of more experiences like my preview encounter against the Queen Bee.</p><p>That segment of the preview is what I keep turning over in my head. I really enjoyed sampling <em>Dawntrail</em>’s new jobs and one of its new dungeons, and getting to talk to the game’s director, Naoki Yoshida, but the unplanned Queen Bee fight is the thing to beat. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-dawntrail-ps5-controller-1851385139&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-dawntrail-ps5-controller-1851385139">I became a PC player</a></span> at this preview, and yet the biggest thing to happen was this singular moment where I felt like part of a larger community. The possibility of enjoying the world of <em>FF14</em> alongside others suddenly unfurled as if for the first time, despite the fact that I’ve been playing this MMO for more than two years now. And it felt joyous in a way that <em>FF14 </em>has never quite felt for me.</p><p>It feels as though I’ve been closing myself off to this whole other way to experience <em>FF14</em>, and it took this completely innocuous fight to shake me from my bad habit. Now, I want to be inundated in the game’s community at launch, help pick <em>Dawntrail </em>apart, and feel like I’m embarking on a whole new journey with a village at my back, one who’s ready to raise me when I’ve fallen and have my back in the trials to come. It feels like I’m finally prepared to enjoy <em>FF14</em> the way it ought to be enjoyed. And I owe it all to that Queen Bee that thankfully knocked sense into me.</p><p><strong>Pre-order <em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em>:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffinal-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffinal-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Humble Bundle</a></span><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This article is based on play of an in-development build of FINAL FANTASY XIV: Dawntrail, and content in the final version is subject to change.</p><p>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="348" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A new era of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> is just on the horizon as our beloved Warrior of Light and their companions set sail for the New World, Tural, in <em>Dawntrail.</em> The MMO’s next expansion teases a refreshing, summer vacation-styled adventure; it’s a moment of reprieve for the heroes who traveled to the edges of the universe and saved their star.</p> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true">Though, as is the case with any beach episode, it’s all fun and games until God shows up to ruin the fun. While we don’t know the exact <em>Dawntrail</em> scenario, <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>director and producer Naoki “Yoshi-P” Yoshida has dropped a few sly teases indicating Version 7.0 won’t be a strictly fun-in-the-sun affair. Tural is full of adventure, and after spending a day in some of the expansion’s earliest zones, I’m more than ready to set sail.</p>
 <p data-characters="467" data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true">During a recent press event hosted by Square Enix, I played an early build of <em>Dawntrail </em>— one that didn’t include some of the more recent benchmark graphic updates, mind you — and realized even a full day of playtime isn’t long enough to sample the entire slice. In a game like <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, I’m eager to chase the story behind every environmental detail, all while remembering there’s a wealth of new combat and system changes to try out, too.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-fabled-golden-cities-of-the-new-world" data-injectable="false">The fabled golden cities of the New World</h2> <p data-characters="494" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">Since the<em> Endwalker </em>patches, <em>Final Fantasy XIV’s</em> team has promised a sizeable graphics overhaul that includes everything from improved textures across models to more dramatic lighting and shadow effects. Seeing those changes in person, even after several livestreams and an updated benchmark, make the upgrades clearer than ever. <em>Dawntrail</em> is gorgeous, no doubt. It’s perhaps the most visually stunning expansion yet, and there’s a lot riding on 7.0’s drastic makeover. </p>

For a<em> Final Fantasy XIV</em> city, there’s a noticeable jump in the number of items peppered across the landscape here. The expansion’s home point feels like a sizeable step up, and that’s with most of the bustling NPCs and flavor text removed from the build. According to Yoshida, those were cut to spare us from spoilers. Though in hindsight, I realize it was probably for the best, as my enchanted oh-what’s-that reactions while perusing the lush greenery and elaborate architecture had me itching to stop and Gpose everywhere. </p>
 <p data-characters="669" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">Tuliyollal reminds me a lot of another favorite destination, Radz-at-Han, mostly for its interesting uses of verticality and a skyline to die for. There’s a neighboring forest that slopes into the coastline through a gradient of vegetation and colorful architecture. Then at night, the docks glow with posts and strings of warm lantern light, leading the way from Tuliyollal’s beaches into the Aetheryte Plaza. Among my favorite stops were Brightploom Post and the Arch of the Dawn. The former, I’m assuming, serves as some sort of government stronghold within the city; it hosted a few tough military types. The latter was where I found the Alpacas. </p>

Again and again, I doubled back to investigate the nearby market, brimming with vibrant tapestries and tightly packed stalls managed by vendors all dressed in striking textiles. So striking, in fact, that I couldn’t just pass any of them up once, and combed the details of their wares for new items on my<em> Dawntrail</em> furniture wishlist. Here’s to hoping that Square Enix gives us at least a sliver of the new furnishings I spotted across Tuliyollal, I’ve got a place to bulldoze and redecorate. </p>

Neither of which I’d ruminated for long after their respective reveals prior, but it’s these areas that have left me reeling in the days after. It’s where I had that old familiar feeling; you know the one. It’s the moment the expansion is real. It’s when a bewildering decade’s worth of storytelling kicks into high gear, leaving me to frantically scan my surroundings for anything and everything to indicate what happened, what’s happening, and what’s gonna happen. </p>
 <p data-characters="569" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">And well, maybe it’s a shocker, but I did not manage to find any of those grand details in the terrain that would lead me to a moment of mystery-solving genius. So no, I still don’t know what on earth<em> Dawntrail </em>is about other than the big Festival of the Hunt inspirations it seems to invoke from <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, but the wheels are turning. I mean, really turning, too. Every cog up there that sickly read and reread the Eorzean Encyclopedias and side stories is desperately trying to find meaning in every suspicious hillside and ominous blade of grass. </p>

Come launch, <em>Dawntrail’s </em>Main Scenario, and a series of Aether Currents, will undoubtedly guide the way, but seeing it laid out in totality for the first time certainly gave me a bit of decision anxiety. With so many options ahead, I chose a few places to stop and sightsee in more detail than others.</p>
 <h3 id="h-what-s-the-story-behind-urqopacha-s-landscape" data-injectable="false">What’s the story behind Urqopacha’s landscape? </h3> <p data-characters="631" data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true">My exploration left me with more questions than answers about anything waiting beyond the Indigo Deep. Some of my curiosity was rooted in previous Live Letter broadcasts, but Yok Tural no doubt has plenty of history to tell. In the Eorzea we’re familiar with, the acceptance of the New World’s actual existence seems more recent than anything, just within the last 80 years or so. It was Urqopacha’s southern landscape, in particular, that spurred my desire to dig and learn more. The land is covered in crumbling ruins, some stretched along the mountains or tucked into valleys, all in different states of decay.</p>
 <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">The map also revealed locale names, with places in the south like Proof, Shades of Grief, Sunken Stars, and the Indelible Passage. It’s a sharp contrast from the land up north that leads back to Tuliyollal, where the terrain seemed more hospitable, and stops like Ciblu’s Coffee Grounds, Miplu’s Mate Garden, and The Family Ranch sure sound like places where Yok Tural’s history was a little kinder. </p>

While that civilization is long gone, I’m assuming the modern-day’s <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yok Huy</a> must, somehow, tie into those Gigant ancestors. There are traces of the giant civilization everywhere. Also, someone, or something, definitely smashed in the mountainsides all along the southern area, and it was certainly bigger than the neighboring Pelupelu.</p>
 <h3 id="h-the-waterfalls-and-rainforests-of-kozama-uka" data-injectable="false">The waterfalls and rainforests of Kozama’uka</h3> <p data-characters="523" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="true">Tuliyollal’s nearby Kozama’uka is a little livelier, lined with endless rivers and smaller communities thriving in and around its rainforests. The regional climate seems forgiving in contrast to Urqopacha’s rugged terrain, and the abundance of life is testament to that. Just in passing, I spotted several of the local Tribes already revealed as Yok Tural residents, like the newer PeluPelu, along with the distant relatives of the Vanu Vanu, the Hanuhanu, and finally the Goblin-like creatures, Moblins. </p>
 <p data-characters="538" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true">It’s another sprawling zone, only made more impressive by the rocky crags erupting into the skyline. They’re visible in some form from nearly all vantage points in Kozama’uka, and after several trips from one side to the other, I developed an appreciation for the varied biomes at every level. Sure, at a glance, it’s mostly lush greens, but there’s a thoughtful approach to life along the vast, stoney outcroppings at their highest peaks versus how the flora and fauna adapt to the rivers and runoff below. </p>

Following the twisting and turning rivers landed me somewhere a little more central, with one area aptly labeled the Breath Between. The Hanuhanu seem to favor the region, and they’ve built shops and boardwalks just above the raging rivers below. There’s no Aetheryte here or striking fixtures denoting importance, but I loved running the stretch of bridges offering such a perfect view of the lowest and highest grounds in Kozama’uka. </p>
 <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">There’s a lot to see here, and if said Aetheryte placements are any reasonable indicator, Kozama’uka is the larger of the two preview zones, with three total. Ok’hanu and its familiar naming convention is the closest to Tuliyollal, in the north. I mostly point that out because, from the looks of it, the Level 91 dungeon — Ihuykatumu — easily serves as a journey to the other side, all the way south. The Duty begins along raging rapids, slowly guiding the party up, through the vast jungle and ending somewhere along the mountainside.</p>
 <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">I’d hoped to spot an obvious purpose for Ihuykatumu’s location and clear path there, but I’m still not sure if its position means we’re taking a shortcut to see all, or most, of Kozama’uka’s sprawling forests early on. Perhaps that’s not it, and we’ll go the long way through Urqopacha. Alternatively, the answer is both, and this is where<em> Final Fantasy XIV’s</em> formulaic split between beginning zones happens in<em> Dawntrail.</em> </p>
 <h2 id="h-expand-your-horizons" data-injectable="false">Expand your horizons</h2> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">As for the dungeon itself, Ihuykatumu blends right into the beginnings of <em>Dawntrail’s</em> earliest moments in Tural. There’s no strange, otherworldly technology looming in the background and no fiery trails of Magitek-fueled wars, either. It was just me, the Warrior of Light, Erenville, and a leisurely boat cruise down the river. </p> <p data-characters="510" data-current-count="842" data-injectable="true">Or at least, that was partially it — Alisaie, Wuk Lamat, Alphinaud, and Krile were along for the ride as well, and this must be where some of that fight for Tuliyollal’s throne really comes into play. Just as we began, Alisaie warned of another boat ahead, with either Zoraal Ja or Bakool Ja Ja on board. Yoshida explained that most of this build’s dialogue was cut to avoid major spoilers, but there was enough information there to contextualize which Mamool Ja was the bastard that busted my boat.</p>

For even moderately experienced players, lowly dungeon mobs are everything you expect them to be, and that’s fine. I ran Ihuykatumu twice as a Scholar: once with other players, then again with Duty Support. Neither struggled, and I used the breezy combat to test out new abilities.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Dawntrail’s earliest dungeon encounter, Ihuykatumu</h3> <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true">The real meat, of course, is in the boss fights. The first encounter was with Prime Punutiy, a darling manatee sporting an uncharacteristically bad temper, and then there was Drowsie, a sleepy troll with a green thumb. The former most certainly has a minion; it’s at the end of the <em>Dawntrail</em> benchmark. As for the latter, I’ve yet to spot the darling, dopey boy anywhere else. Fingers crossed, but I’m hoping similar existing models mean Drowsie gets the mount treatment.</p>

There’s little I hate more than the idea of complimenting a giant bug, but credit where credit is due, the creature put up a fun fight. Some of its mechanics, while all iterations on old <em>FFXIV </em>tricks, felt surprisingly busy for a dungeon encounter. </p> <p data-characters="503" data-current-count="868" data-injectable="true">It was also Apollyon’s arena that made a few of the duty’s recurring design choices click. Bosses had, quite literally, spelled out a mechanic for me, but the warning was easy to ignore if you’re the type to autopilot through dungeons. It’s nothing the game hasn’t done before; it’s just more apparent now. Even in <em>A Realm Reborn</em>, bosses inexplicably announced their secrets in cryptic monologues tucked away in the text chat, while more fights added extra on-screen text later. </p>

Each with cautionary text, some white and red, smack-dab in the center of it all. Underneath, a bar signaled how much time I had left before the sequence began. I can’t help but think the idea’s new implementation leans into the controversial ways some players use third-party tools in the MMO’s battle content. In this case, we aren’t talking about world first races or extra early raid warnings, so it’s less contentious. The design is a net positive in story-driven combat and a little relief in a game with chaotic screens and narrow text. </p>
 <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">I get it, too. I nearly leapt over the moon when <em>Endwalker</em> offered a way to center recast timers and increase their size. Tweaks like this are the small, meaningful I appreciate in <em>Final Fantasy XIV’s</em> steady evolutions. For all of the hemming and hawing I do over the minutiae, these elements are what I hope make entry-level content less intimidating to friends and other prospective players. </p>
 <h2 id="h-go-forth-and-seek-discovery" data-injectable="false">Go forth and seek discovery</h2> <p data-characters="525" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">For those eager to get further in the weeds,<em> Dawntrail’s</em> preview build at least gave me a better idea of how some of my favorite Jobs should feel come launch. As context, I’ve spent most of my time in Eorzea playing Scholar, though my resume does include chaotic stents as an Astrologian, White Mage, Machinist, and impressively dead or dying Dragoon. I’m never matching the brilliance of the scene’s most talented players, but I’ve limped my way through (almost) every Savage tier and other battle content.</p>
 <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">This is all to say I’m at least familiar with how every expansion’s combat felt, quite fond of how Scholar plays now, and happy with the <em>Dawntrail</em> makeover. If you’re a Job veteran longing for the days of Bane or Miasma II, an AoE DoT removed in<em> Shadowbringers</em>, then perhaps you’ll dig the changes to Chain Strategem.</p> <figure data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false"> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/FFXIV_Dawntrail_Preview_Embargo_Scholar_Job_Tool_Tip-1.png&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1920&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;1080&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive=""> </figure> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/FFXIV_Dawntrail_Preview_Embargo_Scholar_Job_Tool_Tip-2.png&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1920&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;1080&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive=""> </figure> </figure> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="708" data-injectable="true">Now, the Scholar Ability lasts a little longer, but it’s not done after one use. Chain Strategem gives the Healer a 30-second window, Impact Imminent, where you hit the target and surrounding enemies with an AoE DoT, Baneful Impaction. It doesn’t spread Chain Strategem, so we can let go of that dream, but I’m eager to see how this works into <em>Dawntrail’s </em>harder content.</p>
 <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">Taking a Job’s most notable abilities one step further seems to be a recurring thing with <em>Dawntrail</em>. When I swapped to Astrologian, I noticed Divination became Oracle, a massive arena-wide hit only available under another limited window, and White Mage’s Temperance became Divine Caress. For now, I dig that change, but until I’ve had more fights to sample, I’m staying firmly optimistic about how our new kits shape encounters. </p>
 <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">Try as I might, there was no way I was fulfilling so much of my curiosity around the patch in just one day’s time, and that optimism is a theme through so much of my early<em> Dawntrail </em>experience. It’s a bright-eyed shift in my outlook from here, one that’s had no lack of ups and downs since 2013, but after saying goodbyes in <em>Endwalker </em>and brute forcing my way through the Pandaemonium Raid series, it’s nice to be back here. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollywood-animal">Hollywood Animal</a> is a management sim about turning a bankrupt movie studio into a money printing machine, set in Hollywood’s golden age. While a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-frostpunk-2-its-not-the-cold-thats-your-enemy-but-human-nature">Frostpunk 2</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-tips-and-tricks">Manor Lords</a> might have you grapple with the elements, here it’s all about balancing a fickle audience and Tinseltown’s seedy underbelly. Maybe making some worthwhile art, too? Sorry, did I say ‘worthwhile art’? I meant to say “lots of money.” Let’s get clicking!</p>
<p>First up, I need to name my studio (I settle on Horace's Revenge) as well as my crack new team of business bastards. There’s my chief legal officer, Jebediah End. My CCO, Anne Egg, and CFO, Rummy McLastdrink. He doesn’t have a sauce problem, because obviously I wouldn’t put him in charge of money if he did. In the wreckage of the studio, we find an unedited film reel hidden in the waffles n’ cocaine cupboard. It’s a noir thriller named ‘Messenger Of Death’. Whatever influential critic is currently directing this era’s discourse has chosen to categorise each film as genre percentages (‘60% detective/40% thriller’), and setting (‘modern American city’.) Let’s just hope those pigs in the stands recognise a solid gold picture when they see one!</p>

<p>This movie is already made, so things like themes, events, and roles are already picked out for me. Later, I’ll be able to customise these myself to drain as many dollars from the predictable pig public as possible. Uh, I mean, make great art! The game probably could have gotten away with being a bit loose and silly when it came to detailing these elements, but substantive flavour text for each pick starts to spell out a pretty convincing facade of a film. Hollywood Animal seems to love film in the way that, say, Two Point didn’t necessarily love hospitals, despite keeping some sardonic distance from the actual industry of it all.</p>
<p>Each film is rated for both ‘audience approval’ and ‘artistic appeal’. This may seem like an unnecessarily stringent binary, but remember this was pre-Boss Baby, so no-one knew you could master both yet. This is just the post-scripting phase, though. The ratings can still be tweaked by things like cast and crew, and that’s before you start filming and send everything off to be edited and scored.</p>

<p>It’s time to pick an editor. I made that gag about my CFO being an alcoholic earlier, but it turns out one of my two potential editors does actually have an ‘alcoholic’ trait. Apparently this makes him unpredictable and aggressive. But, since this is the 40’s, I can only assume he’s far more qualified than my other choice, who is a woman. What visionary editor doesn’t like a few sherberts and a casual game of chasing the valets around the outside of the hotel with a golf club in one hand and the latest issue of Racism Monthly in the other! You’re hired, champ!</p>
<p>It happened again! I keep making silly observations about the era, but the game is one step ahead of me. One of my potential composers has the ‘racist’ trait. You know what? No. I pick the other guy, whose much better and cheaper anyway. I outsource some of the more boring production tasks, hire some department heads, and its time to wait out post production. In the mean time, let’s write a new script! First I’ll need a script department. This is where your more traditional building sim/management bits come into play. The script dept. is just one building among many, and I find space on my lot to pop it down. The twist here is that I can choose between construction companies - cheap, fast, and bad, or slow, pricey, and good.</p>
<p>Along with the choices I’ve already made for the first film, balancing these kind of trade-offs looks to be where most of the actual strategy is in Hollywood Animal. While that’s building, I pop down to ground level for a bit. There’s a fair bit of foot traffic, some moving vehicles, but this seems mainly for show. The lowest level of simulation, so to speak, is at the named hire level, people who have different loyalty scores, skills, and quirks. As for what I’m actually trying to earn here, there’s two major resources: reputation, and the almighty dollarydoo.</p>
<p>While I’m waiting, an event pops up: Rummy McLastdrink wants me to start locking the office doors so he’s not tempted to bone his hot wife when he should be working - it’s effectively a trade off between loyalty and happiness. I’m afraid your boning habits do not fall under business strategy, Rummy, so I refuse.</p>
<p>Messenger of Death finishes post-production, and we move to distribution. Here, you can tweak things like release schedules, and weekly screenings across your own network of cinemas. You’ll have to keep costs like venue rental and film printing in mind, and then there’s the advertising campaign to think about. We market the film towards adults, since that’s a thing you could do and reasonably make money back.  It’s then a new resource pops up - influence, which is how you do all your backroom dealings. Here, the studio I took over doesn’t want our film to see the light of day, but I didn’t keep my editor in caffeinated scotch and whiskey-nated cocaine just to back down now, so we tell them to go suck a lemon.</p>
<p>The script department finishes construction, so its time to write our first film! I’d love to tell you what it is, but I’ve got you sneak weasels pegged, see. The last time I shared my idea for a groundbreaking piece of media, Universal Pictures refused to pay me a red cent for the Battleship movie. I’ll tell you this, though: Hollywood Animal might not reinvent the management sim, but it leans into the theme enough that I’m well up for grabbing the popcorn for more.

Square Enix said the Octopath Traveler series has sold over four million copies worldwide.</p><p>Team Asano, the Square Enix group led by Bravely Default and Octopath Traveler designer Tomoya Asano, released a surprise free update for Octopath Traveler 2 that includes Extra Battle mode, which becomes available after defeating the final boss in the final chapter. The Extra Battle mode lets players test their skills against newly added tough opponents, including the main characters of Octopath Traveler, Square Enix said. This mode is available on Xbox consoles from launch and has been added to the PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch, and PC versions today, June 6, via an update.</p><h2>Octopath Traveler 2 update 1.1.0 patch notes:</h2><p><strong>Title Screen</strong></p><p>• Added new mode: Extra Battles (available after clearing the story).<br>
<strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p><p>• Edited the credits.<br>• Edited various graphics.<br>• Implemented new tutorial text for update additions.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

        <p>Niko Partners report also says region generated $85.5 billion in 2023</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The Asia, Middle East, and North Africa (MENA) games market increased 4.6% year-on-year to $85.5 billion in 2023, and is expected to rise to $97.1 billion by 2028, according to a new report by Niko Partners.</p>
<p>The study covers China, India, East Asia (Japan and Korea), Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam), and MENA (Middle  East and North Africa) markets.</p>
<p>The report suggests that India is expected to surpass China by reaching 277 million players in 2028, accounting for 72% of growth across the Asia and MENA region during this period.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Asia and MENA region accounted for 58% of global player spending on mobile games in 2023, while it made up 50% of global player spending on PC.</p>
<p>The report also estimates that there will be nearly two billion players in the Asia and MENA market by 2028, up from 1.6 billion in 2023. The average gaming hours per week in Asia has also increased 36.2% year-on-year.</p>
<p>"Asia and MENA remain critical in the global games market, and drivers to the growth in these regions include localisation, increase in participation by female gamers, government support for esports, growth of out-of-app monetisation of mobile games, and rising spending power," said CEO of Niko Partners Lisa Hanson.</p>
<p>"In order to gain meaningful access, companies must get to know the local market realities and clearly understand the context behind the data they use for their strategic planning."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/concord-store-listings-show-sony-maintaining-helldivers-style-lower-price-point-for-live-service-titles<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Upcoming hero shooter is $40 price tag in US, £35 in UK, dispelling rumours of free-to-play model</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sony is following the formula for success it found with Helldivers 2 by offering its next live service game, hero shooter Concord, for the same lower price.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/06/ps5-pc-shooter-concord-appears-to-be-a-usd40-game">Push Square</a> points to the upcoming title's listing on the Australian PlayStation Store, which is selling pre-orders for the game's standard edition at AU$59.95 – the same as Arrowhead Games' Helldivers 2.</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> checked the listings on the US and UK stores, showing price tags of $39.99 and £34.99 respectively (again, same as Helldivers 2). The lower price point bucks the trend of most AAA games selling for $70 during the current generation.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 launched at this price point earlier this year, which was likely a key factor in the multiplayer shooter shifting <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-full-year-revenues-rise-to-275-billion-but-narrowly-misses-ps5-sales-target">12 million copies in 12 weeks</a>, making it the fastest selling PlayStation game to date. We <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-names-shams-jorjani-as-its-new-ceo">recently spoke to Arrowdhead's leadership</a> about how the game's success has boosted the studio and its ambitions.</p>
<p>Concord was announced <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/astro-bot-and-concord-bookend-playstations-state-of-play-showcase">during last week's State of Play showcase</a> and is part of Sony's ongoing pivot towards live service games. Since live services require larger audiences to succeed, lowering the price of entry increases the chance of attracting more players.</p>
<p>There had been speculation as to whether Concord would be free-to-play, but this store listing appears to put that to rest.</p>
<p>The current console generation initially sparked backlash among consumers as the price of AAA games was increased to $70. As development costs continue to rise, there is uncertainty whether audiences would accept another price increase, although <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracers-lars-wingefors-on-the-brutal-truth-of-the-aaa-market#:~:text=%22I%27m%20not%20saying%20you%20can%27t%20increase%20the%20price%2C%22%20Wingefors,tries%20to%20increase%20pricing%3F%20That%20remains%20to%20be%20seen.%22">Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors recently told GamesIndustry.biz</a> he believes some titles could charge even more.</p>

			<p>Rockstar Games shared details on the next major GTA Online update. As <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/1774797o5ka358/coming-this-summer-a-new-brand-of-vigilante-justice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> on the developer's blog, the game is due to receive brand new Bounty Hunter missions this summer.</p>
<p><em>This summer, it’s time for some (high-value) target practice to clean up the roving reprobates of Southern San Andreas with your very own bail enforcement and bounty hunting business in the next major update for GTA Online. Meanwhile, back in town, Vincent needs help enforcing his authority without official oversight — get behind the wheel of your souped-up Cruiser and conduct a range of off-the-books enforcement activities across Los Santos. Plus, utilize new tools and props to create custom, high-octane Drift and Drag Races in the Creator, and much more later this month.</em></p>
<p>The update will also add some new cars and boost payouts for specific activities, such as Taxi Work, Open Wheel Races, and Operation Paper Trail.</p>
<p>The GTA Online Creator mode has been improved, too, thanks to the expansion of custom drift race tracks and drag race courses, as well as new units in all tracks, from drivers doing donuts and bouncing lowriders to crowd animations and more.</p>
<p>In addition, testing races is easier as creators can now launch tests from any selected checkpoint, and Drag Races now have the option to run multiple rounds before a winner is declared, along with a number of new improvements designed to help the community create and share their races, deathmatches, and more.</p>
<p>GTA Online was the proverbial golden goose for Rockstar Games. Its success essentially meant the studio focused on expanding the multiplayer mode instead of making any single player expansions to Grand Theft Auto V. It will be interesting to see the transition between GTA Online on GTA V and the online mode for GTA VI, which is slated to hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Fall 2025</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-last-of-us-show-will-have-a-shorter-season-2-but-season-3-will-be-larger-and-there-may-even-be-season-4.890940/</guid>

			<p>Yesterday, The Last of Us show co-creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann unveiled plenty of new details on Season 2 of the HBO series. The upcoming season will be a bit shorter, having only seven episodes compared to the original season's nine. However, the creators confirmed Season 3 would be larger, and Season 4 is also practically guaranteed due to the sheer length of the source material (Part II is twice as long as the original game). Here's what Craig Mazin <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-count-season-4-roadmap-1235945923/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Deadline</a>:</p>
<p><em>The story material that we got from The Last of Us Part II is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons. When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the national breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.</em></p>
<p><em>We don’t think that we’re going to be able to tell the story even within two seasons because we’re taking our time and go down interesting pathways, which we did a little bit in Season 1 too. We feel like it’s almost assuredly going to be the case that — as long as people keep watching and we can keep making more television — Season 3 will be significantly larger. And indeed, the story may require Season 4.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Later, Mazin was even more adamant that there would be a Season 4 of The Last of Us show.</p>
<p><em>One thing is absolutely for sure, I don’t see how we could tell the story that remains after Season 2 is complete in one more season. We just want to put people’s minds at ease that the idea that this season coming up is a little bit shorter than the first one is not because we’re taking less time to tell the stories, it’s because we want to take more time. The story that we’re telling is much bigger than the story of Season 1, there’s just a lot more going on, it’s a lot harder to produce but we want every episode to feel like its own blockbuster to be honest with you.</em></p>
<p>The Last of Us series was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-series-renewed-for-a-second-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renewed</a> for the second season in January 2023, shortly after the show hit record numbers. It became the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-second-largest-premiere-decade-behind-house-of-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second-biggest HBO premiere in a decade</a> following House of the Dragon and registered the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-tv-sets-hbo-record-for-pilot-to-episode-2-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest pilot-to-second-episode growth for HBO</a>.</p>
<p>The second season will add many talented actors to the cast, such as Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, Isabela Merced as Dina, Young Mazino as Jesse, Ariela Barer as Mel, Tati Gabrielle as Nora, Spencer Lord as Owen, Danny Ramirez as Manny and Jeffrey Wright as Isaac.</p>
<p>It is currently slated to premiere in 2025, which, according to a rumor, is also around the time The Last of Us Part II <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-pc-completed-november-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might be released on PC</a>.</p>

			<p>Square Enix has just released Octopath Traveler 2 for Xbox and Game Pass alongside the original Octopath Traveler on PS4 and PS5.</p>
<p>Yesterday <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-ii-xbox-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we already reported that Octopath Traveler 2 would be hitting Xbox later this mont</a>h, and shortly after, the title was finally made available on Xbox Series as well as Game Pass. Not only that, but the first entry in the series has also rejoined Game Pass. In addition, this first entry is now also available on PlayStation platforms after being only available on Switch, PC, and Xbox. "That means that both OCTOPATH TRAVELER titles are now available to play on current console platforms for the first time", Square Enix <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/octopath-traveler-i-and-ii-now-available-current-console-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a> on its official blog. "What’s more, both OCTOPATH TRAVELER I and II are available for download on Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass for PC."</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/octopath-traveler.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Interestingly, a new Octopath Traveler 2 update has also been released across all platforms, adding a brand-new extra battle mode, which becomes available after beating the game's final boss. This mode allows players to fight against even tougher opponents than in the main game, including the main characters of the first Octopath Traveler.</p>
<p>Both games are available separately through the Microsoft and PlayStation Stores, but can also be purchased as a bundle. We've included the new bundle trailer that Square Enix released below:</p>
<p><iframe title="Octopath Traveler &amp; Octopath Traveler II | Bundle Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vMH8Zve2qAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Octopath Traveler was released for the Nintendo Switch back in 2018. A PC version of the game was released in 2019 with the Xbox version launching in 2021. The game's sequel, Octopath Traveler 2, was released last year across Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, and PC.&nbsp; Here's what we wrote about the sequel in our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii-same-systems-superior-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> launch review</a> back then:</p>
<p><em>While Octopath Traveler II doesn’t venture too far out of the box mechanically, the game’s writing and world-building are, thankfully, quite a bit more ambitious. This time around, each story feels less episodic and more like a cohesive and complete character arc. Yes, the game deals in familiar archetypes, but it pushes them in some interesting new directions</em>.</p>

The RPG was previously only available via Steam, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation. Both the original <em>Octopatch Traveler</em> and the sequel <em>Octopath Traveler 2</em> have also joined Game Pass for both Xbox and PC, giving subscribers the opportunity to jump into both games as part of the membership.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="OCTOPATH TRAVELER II - Accolades Trailer - Nintendo Switch" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsjnfEcgBQs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-a-surprise-update-as-well" data-injectable="false">A surprise update as well</h2> <p data-characters="480" data-current-count="780" data-injectable="true">The sudden Xbox release and Game Pass additions aren’t the only surprises Square Enix dropped today for <em>Octopath Traveler</em> <em>2</em>.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">More than any other story campaign Bungie has ever made in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">The Final Shape</a> is full of mechanics. Instead of just shooting a bunch of baddies, you're often tasked with deactivating mechanisms and solving puzzles in order to progress. In the second mission of the campaign, Temptation, you'll need to interact with three black sundials to deactivate three "conduits" and bring down a shield. Here's how they work.</p><p dir="ltr">The dials are scattered around the area of The Landing and guarded by several enemies. Once you clear those troops out, Taken Psions will appear nearby. The psions are the key to turning the dials and deactivating the conduits, but you'll need to check the dials themselves to know how many psions to shoot.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll find each dial near the floating, triangular Splinters of Darkness (which look like pyramids with their points facing down). As you get near a dial, you'll see that orange spikes of light are sticking out of nodes around the edges. The first dial has one spike, the second has two, and the third has three. These spikes tell you where to turn the dial, like a combination lock.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4313710-finalshapepsiondial.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313710" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4313710-finalshapepsiondial.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313710"></a><figcaption>The idea here is to deposit Psionic Insight into the dial to turn it to the lit node along the circle's edge.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4313710-finalshapepsiondial.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When you kill an Insight Psion, which spawn in small groups around each dial, you'll gain a buff called Psionic Insight. Each Psion gives you one stack of Psionic Insight. To activate the dial, you need to gather insight and then "dunk" it into the dial by using the activate button near it.</p><p dir="ltr">Each stack of Psionic Insight moves the dial one notch around the outside edge, so the trick is to look at the dial, determine how many notches around the circle the spike of orange light is, and then collect that number of Psionic Insights to activate the dial so that it turns and stops on the lit node.</p><p dir="ltr">There doesn't seem to be any penalty for missing because you have too much or too little Insight, as long as you eventually get the dial to the right spot. To do it quickly and efficiently, the dial lets you dunk Insight into either side of it, in order to turn it either clockwise or counterclockwise. So, once you know how much Psionic Insight you need and which way you want to turn the dial, it's just a matter of shooting some Psions and getting back to the dial before the timer on the buff expires.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4313711-finalshapepsions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313711" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4313711-finalshapepsions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313711"></a><figcaption>Shoot the Insight Psions to gain the Psionic Insight buff. Each psion you kill gives you one stack of the buff. When you then interact with the dial, each stack will turn it one notch along the circle.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4313711-finalshapepsions.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Each dial is slightly more complicated than the last. On the second dial, you'll notice that there are two spikes of orange light and that one is significantly bigger than the other, while the third dial has three spikes, each a different size. The size of the spikes indicates the order in which you need the dial to stop on each of those nodes, with the largest spike indicating the first node to stop on, the next-largest spike indicating the second spot, and so on. Again, there doesn't seem to be any penalty for mistakes other than spending more time shooting enemies, so don't worry about it if you dump too much or too little Insight.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you've cleared the area and deactivated each conduit, the shield will drop and you'll be able to continue the mission pursuing Crow. The best strategy for the dials is to take your time, clearing enemies to keep yourself safe while you're working the mechanics--especially if you're on Legendary difficulty.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Destiny 2: The Final Shape guides hub</a> for a ton more coverage of what there is to find in the Pale Heart of the Traveler.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/galacticare-has-got-that-old-bullfrog-spirit.890856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/galacticare-review-impressions-pc-bullfrog-theme-hospital<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A fantastic part of my existence at Aftermath is that, freed from the need to know about every single game coming out on every platform at all times, I can once again be surprised by something nice and unexpected. And nothing has been nicer or more unexpected this year than <em>Galacticare</em>.</p><p>I saw it pop up while browsing Steam the other night, and my first thought was "this looks neat". My second thought was "the algorithms have failed <em>catastrophically </em>if this is the first I'm hearing about this game". My third, a couple of hours later, was "this <em>is </em>neat".</p><p><em>Galacticare </em>is a proud member of a particular type of subgenre that I don't think even has a name. It's a management game, yeah, but it's a very <em>specific </em>type of management game, one that anyone who has played <em>Theme Hospital</em>, <em>Theme Park</em>, <em>Two Point Hospital</em> or even <em>Planet Zoo</em> will be familiar with. Basically you're running a place, things are happening to people in that place, and it's your job to look after them by building things, hiring staff, responding to repeated crises and, most importantly, being amused by a distinctly British sense of humour.</p><p>That last one is key because "humour" and "strategy" don't often go together, which is why the 90s classics of developer Bullfrog, who made <em>Theme Park</em> and <em>Theme Hospital,</em> are still so revered within the subgenre (Bullfroglike?) they basically created: they're great management games, sure, but they also had a wonderfully dry and very British sense of humour that perfectly offset the mayhem and mismanagement going on around you. A succession of spiritual successors have never <em>quite </em>got that last and most crucial part right.</p><p><em>Galacticare </em>does! And it plays a <em>big </em>part in making this such a great video game. Developed by Bright Rock--who made <em>War for the Overworld</em>, another "let's remake a classic Bullfrog game" project, only that one was <em>Dungeon Keeper</em>--<em>Galacticare </em>is a robust management game that puts you in charge of a sci-fi medical provider, whisking you around the galaxy for a number of themed "missions" where you open hospitals alongside music festivals, freight terminals, weird space farms and more.</p><figure></figure><p>A lot of what you do is to be expected: you open rooms to treat patients, you hire doctors to look after them, then as the game goes on you unlock more rooms to deal with weirder patients and an ever-increasing roster of maladies. Setting <em>Galacticare </em>apart from peers like <em>Two Point Hospital</em> is that these patients are multiple species of alien, and each one has different needs and desires, which makes creating the "perfect" hospital entirely dependent on who is coming through the door at any given time and who you've hired to staff your treatment facilities.</p><p>As a management game, it's pretty solid. At no point do you ever feel lost or lacking in any information; anything you would ever want to know about wait times, your budget, treatment types or staff details are only ever a click away, and the game's interface is crisp, clear and a breeze to navigate. Between visual indicators like thought bubbles over people's heads to indicate a particular shortcoming and constant dialogue with a supporting cast, <em>Galacticare </em>always makes you feel like you're fully in control, which I think is probably the most important thing a game like this--which is all about making decisions based on the tiniest variable--can make you feel.</p><p>What really elevates it, though, is that this is a genuinely funny video game, one that truly captures that old Bullfrog sense of humour. The writing here is wonderful, and the voice acting <em>incredible</em>, up to and including<a href="https://x.com/BenKearns6/status/1457332694820524035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the inspired decision to cast Ben Kearns, aka the Matt Berry guy</a>, though I should note that everyone here is brilliant, from your asshole AI assistant to the Pinocchio-esque HEAL to a corporate boss who--in keeping with the game's broader anti-capitalist stance--is more Silicon Valley than Alpha Centauri. I love them all, and as fun as <em>Galacticare</em> is to play, I would also just happily listen to them all talk to each other for hours.</p><p><em>Galacticare </em>is out now on PC, Xbox and PS5.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Galacticare Release Trailer | Launching May 23" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R55ftpZEpK4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Weirdly, I don't think anything in this trailer is that funny.

                <p dir="ltr">The divide between PC and console gaming has blurred over the last decade. While there are still plenty of games designed to be played with a keyboard and mouse on PC, between consoles using more PC-like hardware and the growing popularity of handheld devices like the Steam Deck, most PC games can be played with a traditional controller--many even require it.</p><p dir="ltr">While the breadth of options means there are some amazing PC controllers out there, picking one can be challenging. Of course, if you own a console or two, you probably already have a great controller that will work well on PC. That said, you may want something with more features than the standard Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch controllers. PC users typically have more control over their gaming experience in general, so it makes sense to want a versatile PC controller.</p><p dir="ltr">To help you find one that works for you, we've rounded up the best PC controllers in 2024. The list includes everything from pro-style controllers and retro gamepads to arcade sticks, racing wheels, and more.

You can save up to three unique profiles, remap the pair of excellent back triggers, adjust stick tension, vibration intensity, and trigger sensitively. This type of in-depth customization is usually reserved for far pricier controllers--not a $50 controller. It runs for up to 22 hours on a full charge and comes with a matching charging dock.</p><p>One particularly welcome feature goes unseen but is important nonetheless. The analog sticks use Hall Effect technology, an advancement that utilizes magnets to detect movement. This frictionless design prevents wear and tear and the dreaded stick drift.</p><p>The 8BitDo Ultimate's high performance coupled with an extremely reasonable price point makes it an easy recommendation.

Still, it's a remarkable controller with a decidedly retro design that makes it a great choice for those who play a lot of classic games or run emulators on their PC. It's also the ideal pick for players who prefer aligned analog sticks and games that play better with D-pad controls.</p><p>The Pro 2 includes two back buttons, custom profile switching, and support for Android, Steam Deck, and Switch. The most recent version of the controller updates the design with anti-drift Hall Effect sticks, closing the feature gap between the Pro 2 and Ultimate.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://howl.me/cjkybKKSWgh" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.me\/cjkybKKSWgh&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.me/cjkybKKSWgh">Best Pro-Style PC Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://howl.me/cjkybKKSWgh" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.me\/cjkybKKSWgh&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.me/cjkybKKSWgh">Xbox Elite Series 2</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specs</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Battery:</strong> 40 hours</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Hall Effect sticks:</strong> No</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Headphone jack:</strong> Yes</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Pro features:</strong> Four back paddles, swappable thumbstick and D-pad styles, more button mapping options, trigger locks</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Xbox Wireless, Bluetooth, USB-C</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Supported platforms:</strong> PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One</li></ul><p>It’s pricey, but Microsoft didn’t cut a single corner with the Elite Series 2 (except maybe Hall Effect thumbsticks, but we'll let that slide for now).

You can also swap between three different D-pads--the one shown above, eight-way, and traditional cross--and change thumbstick caps to shorter and taller formats. It even comes with a six-button, microswitch fight pad for the right side of the controller. The triggers can be locked at five different pull distances to suit your preference, and there are four, well-placed back triggers. You can remap inputs on the fly and store up to three control profiles.</p><p>Though the Pro BFG doesn't <em>feel </em>as premium as the Elite Series 2, it's the best pro-style controller around when it comes to customization.

So if you’re looking to bounce around from battle royales to RPGs and want to make sure your hands are comfy during extended play sessions, put the Switch Pro Controller at the top of your list.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Chroma-Gaming-Controller-x/dp/B09CKFSRK7?tag=gamespot-pccontrollers-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-Wolverine-Chroma-Gaming-Controller-x\/dp\/B09CKFSRK7?tag=gamespot-pccontrollers-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Chroma-Gaming-Controller-x/dp/B09CKFSRK7?tag=gamespot-pccontrollers-20">Best wired PC controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Chroma-Gaming-Controller-x/dp/B09CKFSRK7?tag=gamespot-pccontrollers-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-Wolverine-Chroma-Gaming-Controller-x\/dp\/B09CKFSRK7?tag=gamespot-pccontrollers-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Chroma-Gaming-Controller-x/dp/B09CKFSRK7?tag=gamespot-pccontrollers-20">Razer Wolverine V2 Chroma</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specs</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Battery:</strong> N/A</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Hall Effect sticks: </strong>No</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Headphone jack:</strong> Yes</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Pro features: </strong>Customizable thumbsticks, four back buttons, two top buttons, trigger actuation locks</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity:</strong> USB-C</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Supported platforms:</strong> PC, Xbox, PS5</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Wireless controllers have become the norm, but that doesn't mean wired pads are outdated.

We'll start with the Victrix Pro FS since it's the option best suited for serious fighting game players who want a full-size option.</p><p dir="ltr">The Victrix Pro FS is a robust aluminum fight stick available in two options: The Victrix Pro FS, use uses a traditional arcade-style layout with an eight-directional joystick, and the all-button Victrix Pro FS-12, which replaces the joystick with a button-only configuration style they's become popular in recent years. Both are excellent choices and, aside from the differences in input, offer virtually identical features. Both models feature tactile full-size buttons and are easily moddable. They also sport integrated PS5 touchpads--which, yes, means this is compatible with PS5 and PS4 consoles if you also play on those platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">The Victrix Pro FS and FS-12 stand out against our second choice, the more compact and streamlined 8BitDo Arcade Stick, providing an authentic arcade experience and extensive modifiability.

The stick has been around for over 10 years at this point, but it is still readily available and regularly tops best-of lists, with good reason. It's a beefy, 14-pound peripheral with a solid metal base and all-metal throttle stick. It also packs almost every input or flight function you could ask for, including hat and flick switches, toggles, buttons, and more. The only missing feature is dedicated Z-axis rotation. That can be easily mapped to one of its many other inputs, however, so it's not a total absence.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog is an excellent flight stick that will make everything from realistic flight sims to interstellar dog fights in zero-g space feel awesome--as long as you can afford it, that is. The controller often sells around the $450 range, which isn't outlandish in the world of flight sticks, but not exactly affordable either. Luckily, Thrustmaster offers several cheaper devices that could be better suited to first-time flyers, such as the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FThrustmaster-T-Flight-Hotas-Flight-Stick-PC%2Fdp%2FB001CXYMFS%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-pccontrollers-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fbest-pc-controller%2F1100-6496530%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">T.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-2-vrihn-boss-strategy-on-legendary-difficulty.890820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-vrihn-boss-strategy-on-legendary-difficulty/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=destiny-2-vrihn-boss-strategy-on-legendary-difficulty<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="416" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The final part of the first mission in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> pits players against the boss Vrihn, Subjugator of Gardens. On normal difficulty, most of the boss encounters are rather straightforward. However, on Legendary difficulty, Vrihn can be quite a challenging first-boss fight. Thankfully I’ve found a very effective strategy to take down Vrihn on Legendary difficulty in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-vrihn-subjugator-of-gardens-boss-strategy" data-injectable="false">Vrihn, Subjugator of Gardens boss strategy</h2> <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="785" data-injectable="true">When you reach the end of the first mission in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>, you’ll want to be prepared to take on the mission’s pinnacle boss: Vrihn, Subjugator of Gardens. As you enter the final arena for the mission, you’ll first encounter two waves of enemies before Vrihn himself spawns. The first wave is pretty straightforward while the second wave requires you to take out Prismatic-shielded enemies, meaning you will need to enter your Prismatic form to do so.</p>
 <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">After defeating the first two waves, Vrihn will spawn with a few extra minions that will immediately start attacking you. Quickly focus on the extra adds—thankfully they don’t have Prismatic shields in this phase—before switching to Vrihn.</p> <figure data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">The absolute best strategy for dealing with Vrihn on Legendary difficulty is to look to the right when entering the area and run up the stairs to the top platform. From here you can carefully attack Vrihn while easily dodging his powerful attacks including his puppetmaster attack that restrains you in place.</p> <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">In the event you do get hit by his puppetmaster attack, simply try to quickly move in one direction which will over-time break the binding.</p>
 <p data-characters="488" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true">Each time you deplete a bar of Virhn’s health, he will spawn more adds to send at you. This can very overwhelming on Legendary difficulty as even normal enemies can deal lots of damage and take you down. This is why coming up on the elevated ground is such a great strategy. Your enemies will slowly funnel near the stairway as they try to get you up on the top platform, as opposed to consistently running at you if you were on the ground. Take them out, then switch back to Vrihn.</p>
 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">After depleting each health bar, focus on the adds then switch back to Vrihn. After depleting all four of his health bars, you will defeat Vrihn, Subjugator of Gardens, and complete the first mission of <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24172358/under-paris-review-netflix-shark-attack-thriller<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="G4A8g7">Conventional wisdom says there are two ways to make a shark attack movie. You can set it at sea, where most sharks live, and try to use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgdxIlSuB70">character, plot, compelling action</a>, and maybe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS8I9H07wKw">over-the-top devourings</a> to make your story feel unique. Or you can lure in viewers by putting sharks somewhere no one expects sharks — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharknado">flying through the air and landing all over Los Angeles</a>! <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24048114/tommy-wiseau-big-shark-audience-participation">Roaming the streets of downtown New Orleans</a>! <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2622826/reference/">Swimming through the snow at a ski resort</a>! <a href="https://tubitv.com/movies/657092/land-shark">Bursting out of the ground in the jungle!</a> Most filmmakers who choose the latter path have to abandon any sense of reality and embrace absurdism. Netflix’s French thriller <em>Under Paris</em>, from <em>Hitman</em> director Xavier Gens, is a bold attempt to have it all. </p>
<p id="QBFGoK">Gens and co-writers Maud Heywang and Yannick Dahan seem to want their thriller to be both a serious, thoughtful, character-driven movie and a pulpy, gory thriller where a CG shark converts people into chum in the City of Light. That plot stretches believability at every point, but Gens refuses to cede any of the ground around tone or realism that’s expected from a “shark in an impossible place” movie. Instead, he slaps the most serious face on it that he can.</p>
<p id="618MJX">Even so, it’s an <em>extremely</em> silly and not particularly scary movie.</p>

<p id="mkcQHJ">Best Actress Oscar nominee Bérénice Bejo (<em>The Artist</em>) stars as Sophia, a marine researcher whose <a href="https://www.globalsharkmovement.org/">shark-tagging project</a> went terribly wrong when a mako designated as “Lilith” attacked her dive crew years ago. Traumatized to the point where she spends most of the movie wearing an unchanging half-determined/half-lost expression, Sophia winds up in Paris, giving desultory aquarium lectures to bratty school groups.</p>
<p id="ZBx0cj">Her past resurfaces (along with a familiar fin) when fervent young activist Mika (Léa Léviant) contacts her on behalf of a resistance group called SOS, or Save Our Seas. Mika’s team hacks into wildlife tagging systems to deactivate the tags so fishing boats can’t use them to hone in on animals’ locations. SOS is tracking Lilith’s tag, and they’ve traced her to the Seine. Mika, her hacktivist friend Ben (Nagisa Morimoto), and their group want to save the shark by luring it back out to the ocean. Sophia just wants to keep Parisians from getting eaten by a deep-sea shark they don’t expect to encounter in a relatively shallow freshwater river.</p>
<p id="2JsaQQ">As much as this premise feels like cult-movie goofiness aimed at fans of trashy creature features, there is at least a little science behind it. Sharks have been found in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/venomous-sharks-london-scli-intl-gbr-scn/index.html">England’s Thames river</a>, some shark species can <a href="https://www.citrusreef.com/blogs/news/types-of-freshwater-sharks">navigate freshwater or transition from rivers to oceans and back</a>, and dwindling habitats and <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-global-temperature-record-streak-continues-april-2024-was-hottest-record">rising global temperatures</a> have pushed many animal species to behave in odd ways or <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/living-world/2022/urban-evolution-species-adapt-survive-cities">evolve rapidly to fit into new ecosystems</a>. (The film is also drawing heavily on recent <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/paris-mayor-is-confident-that-water-quality-will-allow-olympic-swimming-in-the-river-seine">real-world attempts to detoxify the Seine</a> so it can be used for 2024’s Olympic Games.) </p>

<p id="EhCeEy">All of which makes <em>Under Paris</em> one of the most substantive of the many <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23277870/aquatic-horror-movies-jaws-the-meg-shark-week">aquatic-attack horror movies</a> that have tried to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23854259/jaws-movie-reaction-steven-spielberg-sequels">coast along in the wake of Steven Spielberg’s <em>Jaws</em></a><em>, </em>at least for most of its run time<em>. </em>The leads are established actors with well-earned reputations, projecting grim, soulful determination. The cinematography is razor-sharp and superbly lit, a standout in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23661749/why-movies-look-dark-cinematography">an era of murky filmmaking</a>. The themes, about climate change and generational discord, have some resonance. At nearly every moment, this movie asks viewers to take it all at face value. </p>
<p id="j3m4Zs">Gens and his co-writers don’t want to get too egg-headed about any of the movie’s details. Whenever a character brings up the implausibility of an immense mako picking off Parisians, Sophia changes the subject as rapidly as possible, with a crisp “You didn’t question it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/10/beluga-whale-that-strayed-into-river-seine-dies-during-rescue-operation">when it was a beluga whale</a>!” or a tossed-off comment about climate change and evolution. </p>
<p id="knqs7G">Overstuffing the script with characters and plot threads feels like a similar diversion, designed to keep people from thinking too much about what they’re watching. That might be the best explanation for most of the scenes involving Nassim Lyes, the lead of Gens’ <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24022711/mayhem-review-action-movie-farang-xavier-gens">hard-hitting recent action movie <em>Mayhem!</em></a>, as Sgt. Adil, the leader of an eerily militarized River Brigade police force that monitors the Seine, taking down unauthorized divers and kayakers. His group, naturally, first refuses to believe there is a shark, then refuses to entertain the idea of rescuing it instead of killing it.</p>

<p id="7RzAbx">A surprising percentage of <em>Under Paris</em>’ 101-minute run time goes toward Adil and others arguing about and trying to prove or disprove the shark’s existence. At times, that’s a tedious process, since the audience already knows the answer. But at least it’s a way to solve one of the biggest problems most ocean-going shark attack movies face: how to keep getting people back into the water, where they can get dramatically eaten. Eventually, though, the action ramps up — and at that point, Gens veers sharply, abandoning seriousness and turning the movie into the pulpy, over-the-top, eye-rolling shlock feature he’d worked so hard to avoid.</p>
<p id="TW8Deb">If you want to define the “two ways to make a shark movie” split along an even simpler axis, you could also say that the basic paths are “Copycat <em>Jaws </em>for all you’re worth” and “Do literally anything else.” Again, <em>Under Paris</em> has it both ways. At first, Gens and company build unique characters and chart their own path. Then they introduce the Big Important International Swim Event that’s about to take place in the Seine, and the mercenary, won’t-hear-reason mayor who refuses to cancel it just because people keep getting killed. Suddenly, the movie feels like a pale echo of Spielberg’s masterpiece, following its playbook line by line, right down to the obligatory scene where Sophia makes a dramatic discovery during a shark autopsy.</p>
<p id="TI1of0">But when the inevitable bloodbath starts, <em>Under Paris </em>seems to be cribbing from much messier shark attack movies instead: an unlikely bisection of a diver straight out of <em>Deep Blue Sea</em>, mixed in with <em>Piranha 3D</em>’s barrage of over-the-top CG water action. All of which leaves <em>Under Paris</em> feeling like a slapdash attempt to grab every possible audience at once, in a way that doesn’t fully serve any of them.</p>

<p id="tCqIir">None of this odd tone-shifting, copycatting, or narrative overcrowding would matter if <em>Under Paris</em> was tense, frightening, and engaging. Scientists and researchers complain that the endless stream of killer-shark movies has <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12756769/The-Jaws-Effect-movies-like-Meg-Shallows-Jaws-fuelling-excessive-fear-sharks-despite-57-attacks-year.html">driven irrational fear of animals that generally just aren’t that dangerous</a>, but it seems natural enough for viewers to maintain a fascination and dread around primordial killers that most victims will never see coming. Killer-shark movies — of both the winkingly ridiculous “land sharks gone wild” variety and the at least slightly plausible ones — will keep getting made as long as people remember their first experience watching <em>Jaws</em> and hope to recreate that thrilling tension.</p>
<p id="zFho1w">But regardless of what mode filmmakers lean into for a shark movie, they need to bring something worthwhile to that mode. <em>Under Paris</em> gets about halfway there on every front — drama, thrills, terror, character conflict, humanity-versus-nature messaging — and not much further than that. It’s a film destined to be outpaced within a year by its own “every shark attack in <em>Under Paris</em>” YouTube supercut, when someone realizes how easy it would be to whittle this distracted, everything-and-the-kitchen-sink movie down to a much simpler experience aimed at a much simpler audience. </p>

            <p>
It looks like Sony's recently revealed 5v5 sci-fi shooter Concord will take a leaf out of Helldivers 2's wildly successful live-service playbook and launch with a relatively modest price tag of £35.
</p>
<p>
Concord, the debut game from Sony's FireWalk Studios, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-exclusive-pvp-shooter-concord-is-firewalk-studios-first-game">announced with only minimal detail</a> last May. More was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-concord-is-a-5v5-sci-fi-shooter-with-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vibes">revealed</a> during last week's PlayStation State of Play, however, when Concord was confirmed to be a 5v5 first-person shooter - seemingly one with a touch of Overwatch in its DNA - featuring 16 launch characters, along with various modes and maps.
</p>
<p>
Concord's live-service nature (which doesn't seem to have been met with an abundance of enthusiasm among PlayStation fans) had some wondering how Sony might price the game when it launches for PlayStation 5 and PC on 23rd August - particularly given the modest price point of Sony's recent live-service smash-hit Helldivers 2 - and it now appears the company is opting for a similar pricing strategy this time around.

<p>
As spotted on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-pricing-appears-on-australian-ps-store-page-same-as-helldivers-2-60-aud-standard-95-aud-digital-deluxe.890364/">Resetera</a> (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/06/ps5-pc-shooter-concord-appears-to-be-a-usd40-game">Push Square</a>), the Australian PlayStation Store currently <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-au/concept/10002695">lists</a> Concord's Standard Edition with a pre-order price of $59.95 AUD and its Digital Deluxe Edition at $94.95. That matches Helldivers 2's Australian price tag, strongly suggesting Concord will retail for £34.99/$39.99 (£49.99/$59.99 for the Digital Deluxe Edition) in the US and UK.
</p>
<p>
As per the same Australian listing, Concord's Digital Deluxe Edition features three days of early access, 16 character skins, and a Monarch Pack containing the Vale's Monarch Frontliner Sniper Skin and Dead Reckoner Weapon Skin Pack. Those that pre-order get early access to Concord's beta, which is currently set to launch this July.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-reveal-summer-game-fest-rumor/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Geoff Keighley has cautioned fans that this year’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer Game Fest</a> kickoff show <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-2024-will-be-quieter-when-it-comes-to-shocking-announcements-says-keighley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won’t have as many “shocking announcements” as in the past</a>, although it seems like this may be a case of ol’ Geoff cannily managing expectations so he can exceed them. We already know <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-alan-wake-dlc-slitterhead-good-for-horror-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of exciting horror-related reveals</a> are slated for Summer Game Fest, and according to a new rumor, the next entry in the Borderlands series may also be making its big debut this Friday.</p>
<p>This rumor comes courtesy of relatively new leaker Kurakasis, who has delivered some accurate information recently, <a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/2k-will-reveal-borderlands-4-at-summer-game-fest.90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the backing of eXputer</a>. Per the leaker, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borderlands 4</a> will either be making its debut at the Summer Game Fest kickoff, or it might be announced shortly before, with a meatier reveal of the game during the SGF show.</p>
<p>Of course, take this rumor with a grain of salt until we get confirmation, but 2K Games already teased they’ll be a part of the Summer Game Fest activities, saying they’ll “reveal the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises.” That kicked off all sorts of speculation, with some folks hoping that a new Mafia might be revealed, but Borderlands was always the more likely scenario, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-borderlands-movie-trailer-is-finally-here-at-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly with a Hollywood movie on the way</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">2K plans to reveal the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises at <a href="https://twitter.com/summergamefest?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SummerGameFest</a> on Friday, June 7. <a href="https://t.co/1vyFXE2N4z">pic.twitter.com/1vyFXE2N4z</a></p>
<p>— Summer Game Fest (@summergamefest) <a href="https://twitter.com/summergamefest/status/1791201250521825718?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Back in March, 2K Games parent company <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-buys-gearbox-for-460-million-confirms-new-borderlands-game-among-other-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take-Two Interactive purchased Gearbox</a> from the embattled Embracer Group for $460 million. At the time, it was made quite clear more Borderlands was in the works, with T2 CEO Strauss Zelnick praising Gearbox’s ability to efficiently pump out hits…</p>
<p><em>“We have all the respect in the world for Randy Pitchford and his team. He has the ability to bring AAA products to market, responsibly and on a very reliable and rather rapid cadence. And he is a hit maker. And it's very hard to make a new hit, and [Tiny Tina] was a new hit. And of course, Borderlands just goes from strength to strength. So we're thrilled to have Gearbox in the family.”</em></p>
<p>The Summer Game Fest kickoff show streams live this Friday (June 7) at 2pm PT. What do you think? Excited to what the Borderland folks have cooked up?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/branch-riders-ttrpg-coming-to-kickstarter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of tabletop gaming can agree the hobby has therapeutic qualities. It is an inherently social and creative hobby that requires trust between players for catharsis and thrills. Enter The Bodhana Group with their first original TTRPG project, <em>Branch Riders</em>.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, <em>Branch Riders</em> is a narrative TTRPG developed by <a href="https://www.thebodhanagroup.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Bodhana Group</a>. They are a nonprofit organization dedicated to educating and training people in tabletop gaming in therapeutic and clinical practices.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/branch-riders-realm-artwork.jpg?itok=0dFKf1Bm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/branch-riders-realm-artwork.jpg?itok=NMIVszH6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Whereever you go, there you are.</figcaption></figure><p>What sets <em>Branch Riders</em> apart from other TTRPGs is its eight-realm setting. Each realm is based on different genres (fantasy, sci-fi, superhero, etc.). The game is designed to satisfy players of any age or level of experience and facilitate immersive storytelling.</p>

<p>In <em>Branch Riders</em>, you play as someone from one of these eight realms. They are also a special agent dedicated to defending the realms from a force called The Blight. You bring your courage, talents, and gifts from your home into these realms alongside other players.</p>

<p>But these agents must face The Blight in secret. The people of the realms do not know other realms exist, let alone The Blight or Branch Riders themselves.</p>

<p>The game features a simple three-dice pool system with narrative resolution. You decide your Approach, followed by your Technique, then roll the corresponding dice. The dice can range from a d4 to a d12. Roll a 4 or higher and you succeed. The game will feature multiple Approaches and Techniques at character creation, allowing for multiple combinations.</p>

<p>The third die is determined by the Exposure Tracker. This tracker shows the level of danger the players are in. Depending on the situation, the type of die may change for skill rolls. Condition cards track damage in the game. These conditions include Depleted, Hurt, Weakened, Prepared, or Encouraged.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign for <em>Branch Riders</em> will launch June 11. The campaign will include several stretch goals, including making your own Blights and Gifts. The game will be published by Onyx Path Publishing, the same company behind <em>Exalted</em>, <em>Pugmire</em>, and <em>Scion</em>.</p>

Zero will release without local multiplayer — a staple in anime arena fighters — the game will seemingly have both an online and local multiplayer feature on release.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/SLOplays/status/1798299849198379507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>X/Twitter user SLOplays</u></a> and verified by IGN, Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero’s updated listing on the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation store</a> states the game will have local multiplayer. Prior to the game’s store update, players were under the impression that Sparking! Zero wouldn’t launch with local multiplayer because its <a href="https://x.com/ShonenGameZ/status/1733073976245600505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation and Steam pages listed it as a single-player game</u></a>. It was also previously reported from a fan-translated interview with producer Jun Furutani that local split-screen modes wouldn’t be included in the game due to unspecified <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dragon-ball-z-sparking-zero-reportedly-wont-launch-with-split-scree-mode-co-op-2-player/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>“issues relating to Sony and Microsoft.”</u></a> </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Save for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/jujutsu-kaisen-cursed-clash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash</a>, anime arena fighters typically have a local multiplayer feature that allows players to molly-whop on their friends and witness their anguished defeat firsthand before uttering the age-old phrase: run it back. Rumors that Sparking! Zero wouldn’t have local multiplayer were understandably bizarre and frustrating for longtime fans, considering every entry in the series has had the feature. </p><p>Now all that’s left for Sparking! Zero to do to continue its streak of making diehard Dragon Ball Z fans hype is to officially announce the game’s release date. Hopefully, <a href="https://x.com/summergamefest/status/1796204988202692629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>come Summer Game Fest</u></a>, players will finally know when the momentous return of the beloved 3D fighter will be.</p><p>Dragon Ball: Sparking!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24172387/united-paizo-workers-union-diana-jones-award-finalists<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Ja3IG4">Though the original <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/10/12416080/gencon-diana-jones-trophy-burned-book-eric-lang">Diana Jones Award</a> for Excellence in Gaming trophy is thought to be gone — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22714697/diana-jones-award-history-lost-in-mail">it got lost in the mail</a> in 2019 — the show must go on: A winner must be selected from five nominees that have shown excellence in their field of gaming. </p>
<p id="jGwynQ">The award can go to anyone or anything, according to the organization’s FAQ — concepts, publishers, products, and people. The breadth of that scope is on display for this year’s nominee class: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23664838/warhammer-40k-golden-demon-america-adepticon-2023">Adepticon</a>, the Midwest miniatures games convention that hosts the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23664838/warhammer-40k-golden-demon-america-adepticon-2023">North American Golden Demons</a>; <a href="https://pinktigergames.com/pages/about-us">Ami Baio</a>, game designer of <a href="https://pinktigergames.com/">Pink Tiger Games</a>; <a href="https://www.fastaval.dk/en/">Fastaval</a>, an RPG and board game convention held in Denmark; TTRPGs for Trans Rights in Florida, <a href="https://itch.io/b/1753/ttrpgs-for-trans-rights-in-florida">an itch.io bundle</a> that raised $283,977 for trans advocacy and support groups in Florida; and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/22726765/paizo-workers-form-union-demands-cwa-pathfinder-starfinder">the United Paizo Workers</a>, tabletop gaming’s first workers union.</p>
<p id="8ROnVX">“The United Paizo Workers are delighted and honored to be a finalist for the Diana Jones Award this year,” United Paizo Workers steward and Paizo organized play coordinator Alex Speidel told Polygon. “To be recognized among such industry luminaries is a testament to the power and importance of worker solidarity in this industry. We hope this nomination shows others in the industry that not only is advocating for yourself and collective action in the workplace possible, but that doing so is a mark of honor among your peers.”</p>
<p id="2Xlbmr">Speidel also mentioned that United Paizo Workers member Rue Dickey is actually nominated twice; Dickey led the TTRPGs for Trans Rights in Florida charity bundle. “We also want to recognize the tremendous achievements of one of our members, Rue Dickey, who is nominated alongside us for their advocacy and charity work for the transgender community,” Speidel said.</p>
<p id="vQEzrt">A winner will be chosen at an awards ceremony held July 31 in Indianapolis, Indiana ahead of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2023/8/3/23818514/gen-con-2023-event-best-board-games-rpg-tcg-indianapolis">tabletop gaming convention GenCon</a>. Who chooses? That’s actually a secret. The committee keeps it that way to make it “impossible for a manufacturer or publisher to stuff the ballot or interfere with the voting,” <a href="https://www.dianajonesaward.org/about-the-diana-jones-award/">according to the award FAQs</a>. The committee is “mostly anonymous,” though several folks have been public about their involvement, including game designer Matt Forbeck.</p>
<p id="vBpTJU">As for the trophy, <a href="https://x.com/mforbeck/status/1555196272440754177">a new one was debuted in 2022</a> — it’s pointy! The original trophy is the last copy of the unpopular and poorly-received <em>The Adventures of Indiana Jones Role-Playing Game</em>, published in 1984 by TSR. The game was set ablaze, then immortalized in acrylic.</p>
<p id="lkgXC5"><a href="https://www.dianajonesaward.org/the-2023-award/">Last year</a>, roleplaying game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23353743/coyote-and-crow-indigenous-tabletop-rpg-anthology"><em>Coyote &amp; Crow</em></a> took home the top prize; “Coyote &amp; Crow is an RPG created by Cherokee designer Connor Alexander. In the game Alexander shrewdly imagines an alternate universe that exists outside of the horrors of colonialism,” the awards committee wrote on its website. The first Diana Jones Award went to Wizards of the Coast founder Peter Adkison.</p>

Then a year later, one of those devs turned around and cloned the other’s game and, when questioned about it, replied that this kind of thing happens “every day homie.” </p><div data-video-id="196663" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="429" data-playlist="196663,196086,195189" data-current="196663"><div><p>The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22220.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/card-games/dire-decks-wildcard-clone/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/card-games/dire-decks-wildcard-clone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>PC Gamer</em> on June 5</a></span>, indie game developer kindanice claims that he was recently contacted by another developer, Terry Brash, who he’d previously spoken to and shared some advice with back in 2023. This time, Brash who was excited to show him his new game, <em>Wildcard</em>. The thing is, the game appears to be an almost identical clone of kindanice’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://kindanice.itch.io/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kindanice.itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dire Decks—</em>out now on itch.io</a></span>.<em>&nbsp;</em>That’s not my or kindanice’s opinion, by the way. In DMs reportedly shared with <em>PC Gamer</em>, Brash introduced <em>Wildcard</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2854060/Wildcard/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2854060/Wildcard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which already has a Steam page</a></span>,<em>&nbsp;</em>to kindanice as<em> </em>a “clone” of <em>Dire Decks</em>.</p><p>As you might expect, kindanice was confused and shocked by this whole situation. He reportedly asked Brash if the developer thought it was cool to just take art and concepts from one game and use them in your own. Brash replied that the game used new, redrawn art and original code. Brash then apparently asked kindanice if he wanted an “inspiration” credit. </p><p>“Bro... there’s ‘inspiration’ and then there’s blatantly copying an entire game,” kindanice replied, according to <em>PC Gamer.</em><br></p><p>Kindanice and Brash then discussed copyright laws and if <em>Wildcard</em> violated any before kindanice told Brash that, regardless of what the laws might say, copying someone’s game wasn’t good. He told Brash that his friends also found the situation weird. </p><p>“I’m confused, what’s weird here?” Brash replied in DMs, “I liked the game, so I made a clone with extra stuff. Happens every day homie.”</p><p><em>Kotaku </em>reached out to Brash, but didn’t hear back before publication. </p><p>Kindanice has asked Brash to remove <em>Wildcard </em>from Steam, but Brash has refused. When kindanice warned that this move could hurt Brash’s reputation among developers, he didn’t seem to care, replying: “The decision’s been made. I accept my fate.” That would be the last time they directly chatted with each other, according to <em>PC Gamer. </em></p><p>On June 3, kindanice publicly posted about the odd and frustrating situation, alleging that Brash had “copied” <em>Dire Decks</em> and was releasing a clone on Steam without his permission. He wasn’t sure what to do next, but is thinking about a copyright claim against Brash as he prepares to release <em>Dire Decks</em> on Steam. However, he would prefer if Brash just removed the game from Steam on his own. That seems unlikely. </p><p>Over on Brash’s Twitter account, the developer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797981318439211335&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797981318439211335" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has posted tweets</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797909490261745806&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797909490261745806" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seemingly referencing and joking</a></span> about the whole situation.
