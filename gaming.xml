			<p>Having been delayed to early 2025, Assassin's Creed Shadows is now in direct competition with Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yotei, but this won't be a problem for the new entry in the long-running open-world series, according to Ubisoft's CEO.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-ghost-of-yotei-ubisoft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot commented on the two games launching in the same year, saying that there's a lot of space for very high-quality games and that the two games can both sell well. Assassin's Creed Shadows, in particular, will set itself apart from the competing game with its dual protagonists and the two different complementary gameplay styles.</p>
<p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot further commented on Assassin's Creed Shadows and its recent delay in a new internal memo sent to staff before today's earnings call, as reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yves-guillemots-internal-memo-to-staff/">Insider Gaming.</a> The memo highlighted how the game's delay to <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/">February 14th, 2025</a>, was motivated by the need to release ultra-polished games on day one, something that did not happen with the recent Star Wars Outlaws, whose initial sales were lower than expected.</p>
<p>While not mentioning Assassin's Creed Shadows outright, Yves Guillemot also commented upon the company's creative choices, which are not dictated by any specific agenda. As an entertainment company, Guillemot continued, Ubisoft's mission has always been to <em>"entertain players and enrich their lives with original and memorable experiences, that resonate with a global audience."</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows launches, as mentioned above, on February 14th, 2025.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Earlier this week during Sony's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-september-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5793/" data-ref-id="2900-5793">State of Play</a>, the company announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-a-ghost-of-tsushima-follow-up-announced-at-state-of-play/1100-6526653/" data-ref-id="1100-6526653">Ghost of Yotei</a>, the first sequel to the acclaimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-tsushima-review-you-khan-do-it/1900-6417501/" data-ref-id="1900-6417501">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. But instead of continuing the story of Jin Sakai, Ghost of Yotei jumps ahead a few centuries and introduces a new female ronin named Atsu, who has adopted Jin's Ghost persona as her own. Somewhat predictably, Atsu's very existence has already sparked a backlash from gamers who don't want to play as a heroine. That led to a direct response from ex-Sony executive Shawn Layden.</p><p>Layden, who was the former chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios, reacted to a post on X that complained about Atsu. Layden's reply was simple: "It's a game. If you don't like it, don't buy it."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ShawnLayden/status/1838781831010754672" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">1 It's a game. An entertainment. A story a team of creators believes in. They want to make this.<br>2 it's a game. If you don't like it, don't buy it. In fact, why not make the game you want yourself?</p>  — shawn layden 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🇺🇸🇯🇵 (@ShawnLayden) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnLayden/status/1838781831010754672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>It does seem odd and regressive that simply placing Atsu in the leading role is seen by a few players as some sort of affront to their idea of what gaming should be. There have been plenty of heroines in the history of Japan-centric video games, including the similarly themed Tenchu: Fatal Shadows and Red Ninja: End of Honor. And just because Atsu is the Ghost in this game doesn't mean that another character can't assume the role in any potential sequel that emerges.</p><p>Sony and developer Sucker Punch Productions haven't released any gameplay trailers for Ghost of Yotei yet, but the game is expected to hit PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-goku-how-many<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <em>Dragon Ball</em> game, <em>Sparking Zero</em>, is just around the corner, and with its immense <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dragon-ball/news/the-ultimate-surprise-the-final-reveal-of-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-full-character" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly-200-character roster</a> comes the reemergence of a question as old as time: How many Gokus are in this one?</p><p>Before I delve into the nitty gritty, I must give credit where credit’s due: Aftermath’s own Chris Person first asked this question of <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em> <a href="https://x.com/Papapishu/status/1002659819768238082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back in 2018</a>, and he and our esteemed former colleagues Harper Jay (now at Double Fine) and Eric Van Allen (<a href="https://x.com/seamoosi/status/1838575296422805724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hire him!</a>) proceeded to argue it out at <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-many-gokus-are-in-dragon-ball-fighterz-exactly-1827369805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Old Website</a>. I am merely carrying forward the torch they lit, and I will do my best to honor the shared Goku-counting rubric they created by cherry picking the parts of it I like and leaving out the parts I don’t. With that said, let’s begin:</p><ul><li><span>Android 13 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Android 16 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Android 17 (<em>DB Super</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Android 17 (<em>DBZ</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Android 18 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Android 19 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Anilaza - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Babidi - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Baby Vegeta (<em>GT</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Bardock - Looks exactly like Goku, but is actually Goku’s dad. Therefore, not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Beerus - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Bergamo - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Bojack - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Broly (<em>DB Super</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Broly, Super Saiyan (<em>DB Super</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Broly, Super Saiyan Full Power (<em>DB Super</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Broly (<em>Z</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Broly, Legendary Super Saiyan (<em>DBZ</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Broly, Super Saiyan (<em>DBZ</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Burter - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cabba - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cabba, Super Saiyan - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cabba, Super Saiyan 2 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Caulifla - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Caulifla, Super Saiyan 2 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cell, 1st Form - And now we reach our first rough patch. Cell looks nothing like Goku, but he is technically composed of some of Goku’s cells, along with those of the other Z fighters. How many? We don’t know. But he is technically some tiny percentage of a Goku, as are all of his other forms. So let’s go to the source for this one: While the original manga implies that Cell is the sum of microscopic matter from a number of powerful lifeforms, it only mentions Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo, Freeza, and Freeza's father by name. Thus, for our purposes here today, Cell counts as one-fifth of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cell, 2nd Form - One-fifth of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cell, Perfect Form - One-fifth of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Perfect Cell - One fifth of a Goku. (Also, a note: I’m not sure why they’re differentiating “Cell, Perfect Form” and “Perfect Cell,” but every version of this list I’ve seen published contains both. Maybe it’s a reference to the form Cell achieves after he blows himself up in an attempt to kill Gohan? I guess we’ll see.)</span></li><li><span>Cell Jr. - I’m tempted to say that Cells Jr – short, stout Cells that split off from the main body – would count as a smaller subdivision of a Goku, but they’re a byproduct of asexual reproduction, which tends to result in an identical organism to the original. So: one-fifth of a Goku.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Chiaotzu - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cooler - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cooler, Final Form - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Cui - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Dabura - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Dodoria - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Dr. Gero - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Dr. Wheelo - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Dyspo - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza (<em>DB Super</em>) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza, 1st Form (DBZ) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza, 2nd Form (DBZ) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza, 3rd Form (DBZ) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza, 4th Form (DBZ) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza, Full Power (DBZ) - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frieza Force Soldier - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Frost - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Bojack, Full Power - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Fused Zamasu - Fused Zamasu is – deep breath – a fusion of Zamasu, a mortal-hating god, and Goku Black, a time-traveling version of Zamasu who stole Goku’s body in an alternate timeline. If you gave Goku Black a DNA test, it’d say he’s Goku. As a result, he counts as one full Goku. Therefore, Fused Zamasu is one half of a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Fused Zamasu, Half-Corrupted - Half corrupted, but still the same guy. Thus: one half of a Goku.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Fusion Android 13 - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Future Trunks - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Future Trunks, Super Saiyan - Not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Ginyu - He did once possess Goku’s body, but this is Ginyu in his own body. Therefore, not a Goku.</span></li><li><span>Gogeta (<em>DB Super</em>) - Gogeta is a fusion of Goku and Vegeta.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blizzard-reveals-overwatch-2-x-my-hero-academia-collab-starcraft-heading-to-pc-game-pass/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the Xbox Tokyo Game Show 2024, Blizzard revealed some of its upcoming plans. These included a collaboration for Overwatch 2 with the hit anime My Hero Academia, as well as StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft II, both heading to <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-sends-1-month-pc-game-pass-trial-triggering-speculation-of-more-games-joining-the-service/">PC Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>The Overwatch 2 collaboration will begin on October 17 and through October 30, where players will get the opportunity to obtain skins of characters such as Deku, Uravity, All Might, Kiriko, and Tomura Shigaraki. Of course, these skins are premium, so players will have to fork over some money to get the skin they choose. The skins are typically $19 each, with the bundles typically being about $67. The paid skins have been a point of controversy since Overwatch 2 was released. While the loot boxes were predatory to a degree, they at least gave the option for people to try and earn the legendary skins for free via loot boxes rather than forcing them to pay for it or hope they scrounge up enough currency from purchasing the Battle Passes. It's unlikely Blizzard will ever go back on this decision.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The second main announcement that came from Blizzard during the Tokyo Game Show was regarding StarCraft. As of November 5, StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft II: Campaign Collection will be available to those who have a PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate subscription. This franchise is incredibly popular and is one of the most iconic games in the franchise. For the most part, StarCraft: Remastered was well revered in the community and felt like a faithful remaster of the game, as the campaign and gameplay elements were unchanged. For the most part, StarCraft: Remastered was the perfect game for professional players, as it's an 'almost perfect' remaster of the original. However, for the ordinary player, it fell a bit short.</p>
<p>With the game being added to Game Pass, it means players will be able to test out the game without having to fork out more money on the Battle.net client to be able to play StarCraft. The original StarCraft is still available on Battle.net for free, but you'll have to <a href="https://eu.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/starcraft-remastered" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pay $15.99</a> if you want to play the remastered version.</p>
<p>While it may seem on Battle.net that you can play StarCraft II for free, you will have to pay to be able to play the campaign if you want to dive into the expansive story. With the games being added to Game Pass, it's significantly cheaper to play them via Game Pass than purchased on Battle.net.</p>
<p>By being on Game Pass, players will be able to experience the game that helped continue to influence the RTS genre, with players able to interact with three different factions throughout both games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24252575/sony-ps5-pro-playstation-5-preorder-buy-price-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re inching ever closer to a mid-cycle refresh for the PlayStation 5, as the PS5 Pro’s staggered preorder schedule is beginning. The $699.99 console is about to be available to preorder in the US at <strong>10AM ET / 7AM PT</strong> through Sony’s <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console">PlayStation Direct storefront</a>, so if you want to secure one ASAP, you’ll want to jump in line at Sony’s site (be sure to have your PlayStation Network login info handy).</p><p>Also going up for preorder at the same time are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24249013/sony-playstation-ps5-pro-30th-anniversary-retro">Sony’s retro-styled 30th Anniversary</a> PS5 Pro bundle (<a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle?emcid=ot-ps-456950">$999.99</a>), PS5 Digital Edition slim (<a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle-model-group-slim?emcid=ot-ps-456950">$499.99</a>), PlayStation Portal (<a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/playstation-portal-remote-player-30th-anniversary-limited-edition?emcid=ot-ps-456950">$219.99</a>), DualSense (<a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/dualsense-wireless-controller-30th-anniversary-limited-edition?emcid=ot-ps-456950">$79.99</a>), and DualSense Edge (<a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-30th-anniversary-limited-edition?emcid=ot-ps-456950">$219.99</a>) — these prices have been reported on social media, but not by Sony itself. We’ll update this article if we hear any more information before sales start.</p><p>However, if you don’t have much luck in the queue, preorders for the standard PS5 Pro at retailers like <a href="https://howl.me/cm93fQtADXd">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPLAYSTATION-PS5-PRO-CONSOLE%2F11839818124">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-pro-console%2F-%2FA-93620188">Target</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGY63Z2H?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> are set to open on October 10th.</p><p>The main prospect of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24167932/ps5-pro-sony-specs-announcement">PS5 Pro</a> is improved graphics and performance. The new console may <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240906/sony-ps5-pro-disc-drive-separate-price">lack a disc drive</a> (you can get one for an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL5HJNLM?tag=theverge02-20">additional $80</a>), but its new GPU, AI upscaling, and better ray tracing promise a new level of fidelity for this console generation — with the ability to maintain 4K resolution at 60fps across select titles. It may not be the most logical upgrade over a regular PS5 for everyone, but if you’re hungry for the best performance on exclusives like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248448/the-ps5-pro-makes-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-look-so-much-better"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a>, it may be the only way to achieve it (at least until <em>Rebirth</em> and other exclusives find their way to PC).</p><p><h3>How to preorder the standard PlayStation 5 Pro</h3></p><p>As mentioned above, Sony is opening up preorders for its $699.99 console first through <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console">PlayStation Direct</a>, which requires a PlayStation Network account. The site adds you to an online queue that refreshes automatically. If you’re one of the lucky ones to get through the queue without a hitch, you’ll be given a timed window to preorder the console and any accessories you might want. The PS5 Pro is set to land on November 7th, so preorders are expected to arrive then.</p><p>The <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console">official PlayStation storefront</a> may get first dibs on preorders, but retailers will have their opportunity to shut up and take your money on October 10th. That includes big ones like <a href="https://howl.me/cm93fQtADXd">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPLAYSTATION-PS5-PRO-CONSOLE%2F11839818124">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-pro-console%2F-%2FA-93620188">Target</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGY63Z2H?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>. If the nightmarish PS5 restocks we witnessed in the early days of the pandemic were any indication, some retailers will have an organized queue in place while others (cough, cough... Amazon) may feel a bit like a bot-infested wild west. Here’s our go-to advice when the time comes:</p><div><ul><li>Create / log in to your account with the retailer ahead of time.</li><li>Have your billing / shipping info saved to make checkout as quick as possible.</li><li>If possible, try accessing the retail site using both your computer and the accompanying mobile app for your phone or tablet.</li></ul></div><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="BT5qcu" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console">PlayStation 5 Pro</a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->700</span></p><p>The “pro” version of Sony’s PlayStation 5 has a bigger GPU, new PSSR AI-based upscaling, advanced ray tracing, and 2TB SSD (with expandable storage). The new features allow for better graphics at higher frame rates, allowing for the blending of “fidelity” and “performance” modes in some games.</p></div><p><h3>How to preorder the 30th anniversary PS5 Pro</h3></p><p>Launching two weeks after the PS5 Pro is Sony’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24249013/sony-playstation-ps5-pro-30th-anniversary-retro">special 30th anniversary collection</a>, a capsule of limited edition hardware honoring the arrival of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/6/20995937/playstation-25th-anniversary-original-ps2-ps3-ps4-vita-photos-sony">original PlayStation</a> console 30 years ago. As a whole, the collection offers fans their pick of the following retro-styled editions: an extra-special PS5 Pro bundle, a Digital Edition PS5 slim, a PlayStation Portal, a DualSense Wireless Controller, and a DualSense Edge controller — all of which are available for preorder via the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle?emcid=ot-ps-456950">PlayStation Direct storefront</a> and launch on November 21st (aww thanks for the birthday gift, Sony).</p><p>The 30th anniversary PS5 Pro bundle is the ultra-exclusive one, as Sony is only making 12,300 individually numbered sets, and the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle?emcid=ot-ps-456950">$999.99 bundle</a> includes a PS5 Pro console, two controllers (one of which is a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review">DualSense Edge</a>), and extra accessories / collectibles. If the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/9/7362193/playstation-4-20th-anniversary-photos">last anniversary PlayStation console</a> is any indication, preorders are likely to sell out incredibly fast.</p><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="SM2ls9" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle?emcid=ot-ps-456950">PlayStation 5 Pro Console – 30th Anniversary Limited Edition BundIe</a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->1000</span></p><p>A limited edition bundle containing a PS5 Pro and accessories, all of which are clad in classic PlayStation styling. The bundle includes the console with a disc drive cover plate, vertical stand, DualSense controller, DualSense Edge controller, DualSense Charging Station, and various PlayStation-branded accouterments (including a collectible poster).</p></div><p><h3>How to preorder the 30th anniversary PS5 slim</h3></p><p>The Digital Edition PlayStation 5 (slim) is also getting the 30th anniversary treatment, and Sony isn’t making it as exclusive as the Pro. Right now, you can hop in the waiting room preorder the more modest console from <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle-model-group-slim?emcid=ot-ps-456950">PlayStation Direct</a> for $499.99 ahead of its launch on November 21st. Aside from the coloring of the console and controller, as well as the included cover plate for a disc drive, it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955005/sony-playstation-5-ps5-slim-size-comparison-photo-gallery-hands-on-impressions">the same PS5 slim</a> that’s been with us for nearly a year now.</p><p><h3>How to preorder the 30th anniversary PlayStation Portal</h3></p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24012547/sony-playstation-portal-handheld-remote-player-ps5-chiaki-review">PlayStation Portal</a> remains a quirky little peripheral, as the 8-inch handheld has one sole purpose: to stream games off your PS5 via Remote Play, complete with full DualSense integration and features. The Portal looks almost odd to my eyes in Sony’s retro aesthetic, but if you were already planning to pick up Sony’s latest mobile experiment and want a little nostalgic flare, you can currently get in line preorder the LE edition from the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/playstation-portal-remote-player-30th-anniversary-limited-edition?emcid=ot-ps-456950">PlayStation Direct storefront</a> for $219.99 ahead of its November 21st release date.</p><p><h3>How to preorder the 30th anniversary DualSense controller</h3></p><p>Sony’s DualSense Wireless Controller is the cheapest way to dip your toe into the nostalgic waters of the 30th anniversary collection. The limited edition DualSense and DualSense Edge gamepads offer the same features as the standard models, only with multi-tone gray paint jobs and colorful PlayStation logo / button shapes. The <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/dualsense-wireless-controller-30th-anniversary-limited-edition?emcid=ot-ps-456950">DualSense</a> and <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-30th-anniversary-limited-edition?emcid=ot-ps-456950">DualSense Edge</a> are available to preorder via <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us">PlayStation Direct</a> for $79.99 and $219.99, respectively, and are set to arrive on November 21st. <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-DualSense-Wireless-Controller-30th-Anniversary-Limited-Edition%2F12284220058">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cnaSW9Rybtv">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DHLH13R5?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> also have listings for preorders of the 30th Anniversary DualSense.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><p><em><strong>Update September 26th:</strong> Added links to other retailers for the 30th Anniversary DualSense controller.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>You might remember Kara Stone as the developer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ritual-of-the-moon">Ritual Of The Moon</a>, a game about a banished witch that is played in bursts of five minutes a day, over the course of a lunar cycle. Alice B (RPS in peace) dedicated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ritual-of-the-moon-diary-day-one">an article series to it back in 2019</a>, summarising it as "a sad, quiet, meditative game about breathing and loneliness and drawing pictures in the stars". Stone's forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/known-mysteries">Known Mysteries</a> is a ritual of the sun, I guess. Slated for launch on 23rd October, it's the first of several, creatively low-carbon projects that will run off a custom, solar-powered server Stone has set up on her apartment balcony in Calgary, Canada.</p><!--more-->

<p>Stone's solar server project is broadly an exploration of the artistic possibilities of reliance on locally-generated renewable power. Known Mysteries itself is a sorrowful climate change fable in which a woman from a small Canadian town reckons with the dastardly doings of the neighbourhood oil-tech corporation. I'm not captivated by the premise and confessional tone, if I'm honest, but I love the corroded, iridescent visuals, and I'm very interested in how Stone (who serves as writer, designer, artist and programmer) has tailored Known Mysteries towards the server's capacities.</p>
<p>"The game is designed to be low-carbon," she observes in a press release. "It has highly compressed images and video that utilizes found footage, a low frame rate, and is divided into three distinct streamable chapters."</p>
<p>I wrote about Stone's solar server for <a href="https://www.techradar.com/features/the-quest-for-the-solar-powered-gaming-console">Techradar</a> in 2022, back when I plied the ever-ravenous waves of freelance. We talked a little at the time about how embracing the practicalities of locally generated solar power - for example, variable yields based on the time of day or weather, and difficulty scaling up with demand - might push back against always-on recreational culture.</p>
<p>"The idea is that things don't have to run 100% of the time, especially access to a game - it's really not crucial for anyone's life," Stone told me back then, scandalously. "So even if the server was down every night in my timezone - which it shouldn't be - I think that's fine." The emphasis on not having constant access to the game naturally makes me think of Ritual Of The Moon's daily rhythms and minimised playtime. (The server is hooked up to a car battery, so it can store a bit of power for overnight operation.)</p>
<p>Stone aside, Known Mysteries is the work of another programmer <a href="https://www.ckerich.com/">Chris Kerich</a> and voice actor <a href="https://partygirlrising.bandcamp.com/music">PARTYGIRL</a>, with music from <a href="https://amateurpainter.bandcamp.com/">Amateur Painter</a>. Stone has yet to announce any other games for the solar server. I'm intrigued to see whether the distribution platform might give rise to a range of bespoke "solar" genres, perhaps comparable to the disarming alt-history fusions of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ufo-50-review">UFO 50</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-doubles-price-of-horizon-zero-dawn-after-remaster-announcement/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you plan on picking up a copy of Horizon Zero Dawn in preparation for the launch of the remaster, get ready to pay a higher price. </p>



<p>Earlier this week, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered was announced during PlayStation State of Play. The game, set to release for PlayStation 5 (PS5) and PC, brings updates to visuals and performance.</p>



<p>For those that currently own the original Horizon Zero Dawn on PS4, the upgrade will cost you just $9.99/£9.99. But if you expected to get a copy of the game from the PlayStation Store now before upgrading, you will to be paying more than you would have just days ago.</p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://x.com/GamePittReviews/status/1839018836357476399" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamePittReviews</a> and verified by Insider Gaming, Sony has quietly raised the price of Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition on the PlayStation Store. For the better part of the last six years, the game had been $19.99/£15.99 on the PlayStation Store. However, as of September 25, the <a href="https://psprices.com/region-us/game/1838981/horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">price has jumped up</a> to $39.99/£34.99 on the store, doubling its cost.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With the price increase, that would put the cost of getting Remaster version of the game at $49.99/£45.99 instead of $29.99/£25.99 if you were to buy new from the PlayStation Store. The price increase seems to just be at the PlayStation Store as you can still get the physical version of the game from stores like <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/products/horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition---playstation-4/160630.html?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=feeds&amp;utm_campaign=%24PLA_%24LowCP_Catalog_Preowned%20Software&amp;utm_id=20619203887&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwjNS3BhChARIsAOxBM6rYn4yKUzyFSjDuyhE-BygALM2pYImwcqFDCkVmqpX_Ey5lRR_DEf0aAuRVEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameStop</a> for $19.99 as of writing. You can also find it on the second-hand market even cheaper if it’s something you want to look for.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to PlayStation for comment on the price increase.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has announced a series of changes and quality-of-life improvements to both Xbox's UI and the Xbox app on mobile devices and PC. The update includes the ability to pre-load games and game updates on Xbox consoles via the mobile app, although Microsoft hasn't yet announced a specific date when this feature will go live.</p><p>One feature has already gone live, however: Game Bar Compact Mode. Optimized for smaller screens, Game Bar Compact Modes allows users to more easily navigate the Xbox app on mobile or handheld Windows devices. It can also be used to rapidly exit a game that's currently running.</p><p>"With Compact Mode enabled, access to widgets and navigation is simplified to ensure you can get to the content you want as easily as possible on smaller screens," explained <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/25/xbox-update-september-game-bar-compact-mode/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a recent Xbox blog post</a> announcing the contents of the September update. "Compact Mode is also optimized to navigate with a controller, and you can quickly switch between widgets with left and right bumpers."</p><p>On the "coming soon" list is another feature for PC users, which will allow them to more easily peruse and install DLC and other game add-ons.</p><p>"Now you can view and install all add-ons related to the game that you are installing, regardless of when you acquired them or if they were part of the same bundle," Microsoft's blog post says of the upcoming feature. "This helps you see all content related to the game you are installing at a glance, instead of having to navigate the app to see and install the different add-ons or content tied to the game you want to play."</p><p>Xbox's mobile app is also getting a facelift via an update that will allow users to manage their Game Pass subscription right from the app. In the past, Microsoft oddly separated Xbox Game Pass content into its own app rather than within the Xbox mobile app.</p><p>According to Microsoft, players can expect the mobile app's update to begin rolling out this week--but only for Xbox beta members. Microsoft also announced that, due to the changes, new downloads of the Xbox Game Pass app will no longer be supported as of November, suggesting non-beta members may gain access to the new and improved app around the same time.</p><p>"Starting this week, we’re streamlining the mobile app experience by moving features from the separate Xbox Game Pass app into the Xbox app," the blog post explains. "These updates will be available for Xbox beta members on mobile and will be coming to everyone soon. As part of these changes, we will no longer support new downloads of the Xbox Game Pass app, starting in November. Key features--like the ability to explore Game Pass and manage your membership--will now be found in one place with the Xbox app on mobile."</p><p>The new app will also allow users to browse the entire Game Pass catalogue, and Game Pass Ultimate members will be able to claim their perks through the app and even livestream "select games" via Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS or Android devices.</p><p>September's update has a treat for console users, too: the ability to pre-download games and game updates so they're ready to go as soon as a game launches or an update goes live. Like the PC app's new Game Bar Compact Mode, this new feature is already live on Xbox consoles, and can be accessed by selecting "My Games &amp; Apps," then "Manage," then "Updates," which will take players to a page displaying all currently available pre-downloads.</p><p>"This [pre-download] feature is supported by some of your favorite games now, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sea-of-thieves/">Sea of Thieves</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/">Minecraft</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cassette-beasts/">Cassette Beasts</a>--and expect many more titles to support it soon," the blog post reads.</p><p>But Xbox's September update has one final treat for console users: notifications that are genuinely useful.</p><p>"With the new update, when a game on your wish list is released, enters the Game Pass library, or becomes available as part of a Free Play Day promotion, you will now receive console notifications."</p><p>For users who--for whatever reason--don't wish to be alerted to a chance to play wishlisted games for free, these notifications can be toggled off in the console's user settings menu.</p><p>For more information on Xbox's September update, check out <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/25/xbox-update-september-game-bar-compact-mode/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official Xbox blog</a>, which also includes a page dedicated to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/25/xbox-update-september-game-bar-compact-mode/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">details regarding the new Game Bar Compact Mode</a>.</p>

        <p>French union calls employees to walk out for three days.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
French staff at Assassin's Creed publisher Ubisoft have been urged to strike for three days next month, after being told they should return to the office three days a week.
</p>
<p>
The call to walk out, first reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-workers-urged-to-strike-in-october-over-return-to-office">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, comes a week after Ubisoft announced that all of its 19,000 employees worldwide would be required to work from the office three days out of every five - albeit with some flexibility for certain individuals, and without a firm start date for the change.
</p>
<p>
Members of the French video game workers union STJV (Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo) have now <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/09/call-for-strike-for-all-french-ubisoft-entities-on-october-15-16-and-17-2024/">called</a> on Ubisoft staff to strike on 15th to 17th October.
</p>
<p>
The move back to the office three days a week is one "without any tangible justification or any consultation with the workers' representatives," the STJV said.
</p>
<p>
"After more than five years of working efficiently in the current remote-work context, many of our colleagues have built or rebuilt their lives (family life, housing, parenthood, etc.) and simply cannot return to the previous working conditions," it continued.
</p>
<p>
"Our employer knows this perfectly well. The consequence of its decision will be the loss of our colleagues' jobs, the disorganisation of many game projects, and the drastic increase in psychosocial risks for those who remain."
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft declined to comment when contacted by Eurogamer.
</p>
<p>
It remains to be seen how many Ubisoft staff will walk out next month, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/700-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-france-over-failed-salary-negotiations">more than 700 employees took part in a day of strike action organised by the STJV back in February</a> this year, after annual salary negotiations collapsed. 
</p>
<p>
The call to strike lands further pressure on Ubisoft after a bruising 24 hours. Yesterday, the embattled publisher admitted <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws</a> had underperformed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">Assassin's Creed Shadows would be delayed</a>, and it would now be carrying out a comprehensive review of projects as a result.

<p>This is the first major patch for Space Marine 2 since its launch on 9th September – outside of a quick hotfix a couple days after release. The game has proven to be a big hit for Saber Interactive, Focus Entertainment and, of course, for Games Workshop, having sold 2 million copies in that first full day of release!</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">our Space Marine 2 review</a>, Dom said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-woes-mount-with-investor-and-strike-threats.993048/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like Ubisoft's troubles are far from over. After admitting to an unsatisfactory financial performance for the first half of the year in a statement yesterday, the studio is now facing a potential employee strike, as well as mounting investor gloom.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Ubisoft announced it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">delay&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>until February next year</a> to add extra polish. The company also admitted that&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>hadn't been as successful as it would like, so that makes two major releases that aren't quite panning out the way Ubisoft might want.</p>
<p>Now, French union STJV is <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/09/call-for-strike-for-all-french-ubisoft-entities-on-october-15-16-and-17-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">calling for</a> French Ubisoft employees to strike over the studio's decision to force a return to the office for three days a week, which STJV says was a decision "made without any tangible justification or any consultation with the workers' representatives".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-ubisoft-yasuke-naoe.jpg?itok=tVHjKZBm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-ubisoft-yasuke-naoe.jpg?itok=R73ITjZo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has been delayed, but Ubisoft's troubles don't end there.</figcaption></figure><p>STJV is also calling for "an immediate increase in salaries to compensate for the drop in our living standards in recent years", as well as an end to Ubisoft's gender pay gap, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/french-union-solidaires-informatique-sues-ubisoft-over-harassment">recurring problem for the company</a> in recent years.</p>
<p>That's not all, though. Earlier this month, activist investment company AJ Investments <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change">called for Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot to step down</a>, as well as other sweeping changes to the company's corporate structure and strategy.</p>
<p>Now, according to a letter shared with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ubisoft-activist-investor-says-it-has-support-10-shareholders-management-tussle-2024-09-26/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, AJ Investments says it has the support of 10% of Ubisoft's shareholders, calling once again for management to "allow the sale of the company to third parties or private equity firms at a fair price".</p>
<p>It's another headache for a studio that arguably can't afford many more before something major has to give. Pirate game&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones</em>, which was infamous for its prolonged development time, launched this year to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/skull-and-bones-review-dead-and-buried-already">not very much fanfare at all</a>, and other recent Ubisoft releases haven't exactly thrilled either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skull-and-bones-ubisoft.jpg?itok=iIxp3PWf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skull-and-bones-ubisoft.jpg?itok=lPU5W1ui 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft hasn't released&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>sales figures, but it doesn't look great for the game.</figcaption></figure><p>It remains to be seen what awaits Ubisoft on the horizon; there's every chance that its pivot away from Season Passes and its decision to release PC games day-and-date on Steam will turn things around for the company.</p>
<p>One thing's for sure, though; Yves Guillemot's studio needs hits, and it needs them quickly to stave off challenges from what appear to be increasingly agitated investors. It also likely needs to engage in open dialogue with employees and unions to see off mutiny on that front. Stay tuned for more.</p>

If discovering everything is your goal, this will require diving into optional dungeons scattered throughout the map, defeating bosses you might’ve otherwise never faced, and completing a wide variety of side-quests.</p><figure id="" data-id="fac884f3de8423195b2d0fb4629913d8" data-recommend-id="image://fac884f3de8423195b2d0fb4629913d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda summons a slain foe in a puzzle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zelda summons a slain foe in a puzzle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fac884f3de8423195b2d0fb4629913d8" data-recommend-id="image://fac884f3de8423195b2d0fb4629913d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda summons a slain foe in a puzzle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Many of the echoes (summons) earned in these optional locations can massively improve your ability to move around the map, or more easily complete puzzles. As such, you can (and should) go out of your way to collect all the possible combinations if you want to get the most out of the game. Aiming to collect all of the echoes and complete all of the side-quests in the game can take up to <strong>25 to 30 hours</strong>.<br></p><h2 id="h88592"><a id=""></a><strong>Can you use a sword in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>?</strong></h2><p>While Zelda’s primary method of combat includes summoning enemies to fight on her behalf, you might be surprised to hear that you <em>can</em> actually summon a sword, too! Doing so grants you the swordfighting form, letting you function similarly to Link in combat as you slice and dice through your foes. However, this form uses energy that can run out fairly quickly, and will require you to collect orbs to replenish it, so you’ll want to save its use for scenarios where it really matters.</p><h2 id="h88593"><a id=""></a><strong>Does <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> have fast travel?</strong></h2><p>All of the cool echoes you find exploring can make for faster and easier movement around the map, but even so, long-distance journeys can take a while. There’s some good news: <strong>the game offers fast travel</strong>. You can use waypoints across the map to quickly move to previously-visited locations, cutting your travel time by a significant amount.</p><h2 id="h88594"><a id=""></a><strong>Does <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> have difficulty modes?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="610dfb083b8f2cec6584e3d3c7444068" data-recommend-id="image://610dfb083b8f2cec6584e3d3c7444068" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda's very happy about a moblin find." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zelda's very happy about a moblin find." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="610dfb083b8f2cec6584e3d3c7444068" data-recommend-id="image://610dfb083b8f2cec6584e3d3c7444068" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zelda's very happy about a moblin find." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes! <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> features two difficulty modes: Normal and Hero. The former provides the standard experience that most players are likely to want to play. However, the latter features multiple changes that make things more challenging, such as Zelda taking increased damage from enemies, and no hearts being dropped in the overworld for quick health regeneration.</p><p>It’s important to note that you can change the difficulty in the menu at any time, so if you start on Hero Mode and find it too challenging, you can always bump things down a notch to make it a bit easier on yourself.</p><h2 id="h88595"><a id=""></a><strong>Does <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> have co-op?</strong></h2><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> is a single-player game, so it does not offer any type of couch or online cooperative play. Players assume the role of Zelda exclusively throughout the game, and thank goodness Tingle doesn’t seem to be around. However, due to having the ability to summon foes to aid you in battle, it can sometimes feel like you’ve got friends helping out—because you kind of do! Just, not human friends.</p><h2 id="h88596"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> any good?</strong></h2><p>Thank goodness, the answer is yes! While reviews are more critical than <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>’s unadulterated adulation, at the time of writing its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metascore is a very healthy 86</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/legend-zelda-echoes-wisdom-review-switch-1851657826&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/legend-zelda-echoes-wisdom-review-switch-1851657826"><em>Kotaku</em>’s own review</a></span> has many great things to say about a lovely game.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Last week, Sony revealed a new line of PS5 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">PS5 Pro</a> consoles to celebrate the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sony-announces-playstation-30th-anniversary-collection-of-nostalgic-consoles-and-controllers/2900-5784/" data-ref-id="2900-5784">30th anniversary of PlayStation</a>. Featuring a PS1 color scheme and nostalgic small details, these are expected to sell <em>very </em>quickly due to them being limited-edition releases. That's exactly what happened when preorders went live today in the UK, and predictably, several of these consoles are now listed on eBay at a very high price.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4373953-ps5-pro-ebay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4373953" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4373953-ps5-pro-ebay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4373953"></a><figcaption>Several of the PS5 Pro console bundles currently for sale on ebay.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4373953-ps5-pro-ebay.jpg"></figure><p>A quick glance at the site reveals that a handful of the PS5 Pro consoles--of which Sony is only producing 12,300--are being sold for up to $3,000 each. The original retail price in the UK was £959.99, and US pricing will officially be revealed later today. While the regular PS5 Pro costs $700, this anniversary bundle has a higher price tag due to it including a number of extras, like a disc drive cover, an extra DualSense Edge controller, PlayStation shapes cable ties, and more.</p><p>There is one single listing on eBay for the bundle priced at an astronomical $10,000, enough cash to buy 14 regular PS5 Pro consoles and still have change left over for a few games. It's worth noting that what these sellers are asking for the PS5 Pro bundle and what they could eventually sell for are two different things entirely, as several of these listings include eBay's "Best Price" feature that allows a potential buyer to haggle with a seller on the price.</p><p>If you're after a regular PS5 Pro, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorder-guide-price-release-date-amazon-best-buy-walmart/1100-6526406/" data-ref-id="1100-6526406">you can preorder one starting today</a> from PlayStation Direct and at major retailers starting October 10. The new PS5 console is equipped with a larger GPU and a 2TB SSD, but out of the box it is a digital-only console and you'll need to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-buy-a-disc-drive-for-ps5-pro/1100-6526391/" data-ref-id="1100-6526391">purchase the $80 disc drive attachment</a> to use physical discs on it.</p><p>"The PlayStation 5 Pro seems like a tough sell, especially to players who already own the original PS5. That's a sentiment I had going into a preview event for the PS5 Pro and one I still have after spending a few hours with the new console," Jordan Ramée wrote after going <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-time-with-the-ps5-pro-reaffirmed-i-shouldnt-spend-700-right-now-my-base-ps5-is-still-enough/1100-6526684/" data-ref-id="1100-6526684">hands-on with the PS5 Pro</a>.</p>

            <p>Blizzard co-founder Mike Morhaime left the company he started up in 1991 with his university classmate because he was tired of constantly butting heads with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/bobby-kotick">Bobby Kotick</a>.</p>
<p>An excerpt from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-09-25/book-excerpt-play-nice-the-rise-fall-and-future-of-blizzard-entertainment">Bloomberg</a> reporter Jason Schreier's upcoming book Play Nice: The Rise And Fall Of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/blizzard-entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a> has shed more light on Morhaime's departure from the company in 2018.</p>
<p>According to Schreier, the Blizzard co-founder was tired of fighting the former Activision CEO on a myriad of issues. Problems reportedly began around six years after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-and-vivendi-to-merge">Blizzard and Activision merged to become Activision Blizzard</a>, with the cancellation of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> successor project known as Titan.</p>

<p>Following this cancellation - which was said to cost Blizzard around $80m - Activision moved to assert more control over the Diablo maker, and in 2013 Kotick made a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-buys-independence-from-vivendi">deal to buy Activision Blizzard's independence from Vivendi</a> (Blizzard's then parent company). Following this, Blizzard was encouraged by Activision execs to hire chief financial officer Armin Zerza to "keep costs in check", with Kotick clearly bitter about Titan's cancellation.</p>
<p>Zerza - who had previously worked in the marketing and distribution of products such as detergent and shampoo - came on board in 2015, with the CFO soon looking to nix events such as the company's annual BlizzCon event due to low profit margins.</p>
<p>"Before Zerza, the company was run by Blizzard lifers and video game enthusiasts, but the CFO brought a completely different mindset," Schreier's book reads, adding Blizzard employees would scoff behind the CFO's back due to his "inability to understand the video game industry".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kotick believed Blizzard was letting down its community by not releasing games and content more frequently, but said he wouldn't force the developers to release a title before it was ready for launch - something Morhaime along with his own inner circle were said to consider contradictory. "Kotick celebrated when Blizzard produced a new hit but failed to grasp what it took to create one."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Mike Morhaime is now CEO of Dreamhaven.  | <span>Image credit: <cite>DreamHaven</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Morhaime continued to battle Kotick in the subsequent years, arguing for the importance of departments such as customer service and Blizzard's cinematics team (which made short films based on the company's games), as well the matter of employee bonuses. Kotick reportedly felt the teams who delivered the largest profits should get the biggest bonuses, while Morhaime believed this would stifle creativity and the entire company should benefit from profit sharing.</p>
<p>Morhaime reportedly felt Blizzard was losing its independence for many years, but following a meeting of Activision, Blizzard and King leaders in 2018 themed around unification - or "One ABK" - Morhaime wrote a lengthy email to Kotick. In this email, Morhaime said that Blizzard had reached a tipping point.</p>
<p>"I believe that preserving Blizzard's culture and magic is a necessity for preserving <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>'s advantage of having an organisation that can attract and retain the best creative talent in the world and that can consistently produce the highest quality games and experiences," he wrote. "It has been increasingly hard for me to provide Blizzard leadership and staff confidence that Blizzard has a stable future."</p>
<p>Morhaime had actually submitted a resignation letter prior to this meeting, in 2017, but was convinced by Kotick and others to remain at the company. However, in 2018, Morhaime ultimately announced he was stepping down from his position at Blizzard. While <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/22549840/message-from-mike-morhaime-and-j-allen-brack">publicly</a> Morhaime made no mention of his ongoing disagreements with Kotick and Activision, those who knew him personally reportedly knew this to be a key reason for his departure.</p>

<p>Following Morhaime's resignation, in 2021, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-california-sues-activision-blizzard-over-frat-boy-culture">State of California sued Activision Blizzard over allegations of a "frat boy" culture</a> that created "a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women". Despite no longer being part of the company, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-blizzard-boss-mike-morhaime-on-allegations-i-am-ashamed">Morhaime released his own statement</a> at this time, writing: "It is all very disturbing and difficult to read. I am ashamed. It feels like everything I thought I stood for has been washed away."</p>
<p>In October last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft purchased Activision Blizzard for the sum of $68.7bn</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-boss-bobby-kotick-departs-in-just-a-few-days">Kotick subsequently departed the company</a> at the end of December.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/merge-games-shuts-down<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Smalland: Survive the Wilds&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX&nbsp;</em>publisher Merge Games has announced it's shutting down, putting an end to a 15-year journey in the games industry.</p>
<p>Posting <a href="https://x.com/MergeGamesLtd/status/1839264412579831900" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Merge announces that it's closing down, although it doesn't disclose a reason in the post. However, in all likelihood, the closure of Merge is related to the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/maximum-entertainment-merges-six-games-divisions-under-parent-brand" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unification of all of parent company Maximum Entertainment's divisions</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>In its post, Merge says its team started "from a tiny, cramped attic" and grew to "a tight, multi-disciplined 22-person team", bringing "hundreds of indie gems to storefronts around the world". Rather poignantly, Merge says its team "loved every moment of it".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/merge-games-smalland-frog.jpg?itok=nVt9Jhx2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/merge-games-smalland-frog.jpg?itok=9lnEW4cH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Merge Games is responsible for games like&nbsp;<em>Smalland: Survive the Wilds</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Merge continues by thanking its fans for their support and asks that if you see a former Merge employee or interact with them, "just know that they're an incredible person who worked their hardest".</p>
<p>With regards to Merge's upcoming releases, which include narrative adventure&nbsp;<em>Spirit of the North 2&nbsp;</em>and cozy farming RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pixelshire-is-cute-farming-rpg-coming-in-2023"><em>Pixelshire</em></a>, the studio <a href="https://x.com/MergeGamesLtd/status/1839266756545671227" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> its slate will "be managed by [its] parent company, Maximum Entertainment".</p>
<p>It's not clear whether all of Merge's employees will be laid off or whether they'll be absorbed into Maximum Entertainment, although the wording of Merge's post suggests that its staff might be out of a job now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/merge-games-pixelshire.jpg?itok=mLjA7iIl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/merge-games-pixelshire.jpg?itok=NWXIgyJS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Merge's upcoming releases, including&nbsp;<em>Pixelshire</em>, will be handled by Maximum Entertainment.</figcaption></figure><p>Merge is just one of a number of studios that have been shut down or significantly downsized in the industry in recent months. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/risk-of-rain-2-hopoo-games-valve"><em>Risk of Rain 2</em>'s Hopoo Games</a>,&nbsp;<em>Doom 3 VR&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-3-vr-developer-archiact-shuts-down">Archiact</a>, and (allegedly)&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Risen&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report">Piranha Bytes</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Of course, it's possible that Merge's shutdown has been on the cards since February's Maximum consolidation, and it's fair to say that the above studios don't all have the same reasons for shutting down. Still, today, we mourn the loss of a fascinating little publishing house. Stay tuned for more.</p>

The enormous fantasy RPG is due out October 11, but roughly six hours of the game are already available, across consoles and PC. Except, it turns out that PC version isn’t working out so well.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The extraordinarily huge 43 GB demo is struggling with performance issues, as players report stuttering and a number claim the game is only running on one CPU core. This means a game that doesn’t exactly push graphical boundaries is seeing its framerate leap about uncomfortably, despite running smoothly on PS5 and Xbox Series.</p><p>This matched my own initial experiences. My PC is a few years old now, but remains a decent AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, with 32 MB RAM, and a GeForce RTX 3070. Despite the first playable section of the game running at a smooth 60 FPS, as soon as I was in the first busy combat, it was jumping all over the place, rarely dipping below 40, but changing so frequently as to be extremely distracting. (I’m no framerate weirdo, and would be very happy to play at a steady 40 FPS, but the jittering between is the issue.)</p><p>The demo also lacks a large number of standard PC graphics settings, without even options for anti-aliasing, which suggests a dubious port of the console version, for the demo at least. It’s something PC players see too often, where vital settings required to play properly on the wheezing towers are missing. It also raises concerns for those hoping to play the full game on their PC in three weeks’ time. We’ve reached out to Sega and Atlus to ask about all this.</p><h2 id="h26657"><a id=""></a>Possible ways to fix <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>’s performance issues</h2><figure id="" data-id="a8e824aa2610be7d0636caa744571a8a" data-recommend-id="image://a8e824aa2610be7d0636caa744571a8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Rendering Scale options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Rendering Scale options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8e824aa2610be7d0636caa744571a8a" data-recommend-id="image://a8e824aa2610be7d0636caa744571a8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Rendering Scale options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, some are suggesting some solutions. Reading through Steam reviews of the demo—which are currently a mix of people furious about how badly it runs, and other people telling them that they’re wrong—it seems the most frequent solution on offer is to reduce the game’s rendering scale. Which sounds like a bummer of a fix, until you learn that the game is frequently defaulting to 125 to 150 percent in the first place. My own launched at 125 percent.</p><p>And yeah, it worked. I put it down to 100 percent (of what? I’m honestly not sure—I feel like more than 100 percent should have had the game hanging out the sides of my monitor, but the options go from 50 percent to 200), and then I was hitting a solid 60FPS in busy streets packed with dozens of NPCs.</p><p>In fact, after changing this I was able to put Texture Quality up to High and didn’t see any performance knock at all. And this is all running at 2560x1440 in a window.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/metaphor-refantazio-demo-launches-on-pc-to-framerate-woes-but-fans-are-already-cracking-fixes-for-the-new-jrpg/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/metaphor-refantazio-demo-launches-on-pc-to-framerate-woes-but-fans-are-already-cracking-fixes-for-the-new-jrpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GamesRadar</em></a></span> also spotted <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MetaphorReFantazio/comments/1fpnsne/metaphor_refantazio_pc_stuttering_fix/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MetaphorReFantazio/comments/1fpnsne/metaphor_refantazio_pc_stuttering_fix/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Reddit thread</a></span> that suggests a slightly harder-core solution (pun so very much intended). With the game running, open Task Manager (Ctrl Shift Esc is a neat shortcut for this!), choose the Details tab, then right click on METAPHOR.exe and choose “set affinity.” Deselect all the cores but one, hit OK, then do it again and re-select all the cores. Apparently this will help if rendering scale does not. I tried it too, and yeah, I then put my rendering scale up to 150 percent, and my framerate hovered between 55 and 60. Which is good enough for me!</p><p>Hopefully, by the time the game comes out October 11, the PC version will feature a far better suite of options, including standards like anti-aliasing, DLSS, etc, and have any core use bugs ironed out. In the meantime, these fixes worked for me and others.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-20-million/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been revealed that Black Myth Wukong sold 20 million units in its first month across the PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>



<p>The information comes from Ken Kutaragi at the Toyko Game Show (via <a href="https://x.com/deantak/status/1839133380891300082/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dean Takahashi</a>), in which a presentation slide reveals that Black Myth: Wukong sold 10 million units in its first three days and 20 million units in one month. The game also saw three million concurrent players across all platforms.</p>



<p>Interestingly, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2358720/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamID</a>, just over 2.4 million of these concurrent players were on PC (assuming this was the 3 million peak), meaning that around 600,000 players were on PlayStation 5. That means that according to these numbers, at least for the concurrent number at least, about 80% of Black Myth: Wukong’s players were playing on PC.</p>



<p>20 million units in one month puts Black Myth: Wukong firmly in one of the top spots as one of the fastest-selling games to date.</p>



<p>According to review aggregator Metacritic, the game received generally favorable reviews from PC and PlayStation 5 users, with an 81/100 score for PC and 75/100 on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>According to analyst&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/DanielOlimac/status/1835067614118527363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1835067614118527363%7Ctwgr%5Ed1ce3b33a730825310523a25d786dc3b5b5b2039%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.geekinout.pt%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Daniel Camilo</a> (who also reported the 20 million number a few weeks ago), <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-coming-early-2025-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLC for Black Myth: Wukong</a> is expected to release sometime around Chinese New Year.</p>

Instead, it focuses on the first mission of the game as Naked Snake--the future Big Boss--goes behind the Iron Curtain to retrieve a Russian scientist named Sokolov. In the lore of the game, Sokolov is the creator of the Shagohod, a nuclear tank that is the forerunner of every Metal Gear that came after it.</p><p>The trailer features Snake's first encounter with Ocelot and offers a glimpse of the elite Cobra Unit. But more importantly, it reenacts Naked Snake's betrayal at the hands of his mentor, The Boss, as she turns on her country and defects to Colonel Volgin's renegade Soviet forces. From there, Snake's mission takes a turn for the worse as Volgin launches a nuke that will have repercussions later in the game. To close out the trailer, Snake finally meets Eva, the double agent who proves to be his only reliable ally in the country.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid 3's original voice recordings were retained for the remake, including David Hayter as Naked Snake, Lori Alan as The Boss, Michael Bell as The Fear, Richard Doyle as The Fury, J. Grant Albrecht as The End, Neil Ross as Colonel Volgin, and Suzetta Miñet as Eva.</p><p>Konami has yet to reveal the release date for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, but it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
