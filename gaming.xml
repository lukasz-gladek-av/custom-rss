            <p>Eagle-eyed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> players have spotted a new feature on the weapon selection menu.</p>
<p>Right at the top there now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1kyfyzm/really_i_have_to_see_this_shit_now_even_in_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">sits advertisements promoting premium weapons and skins</a>, so players get exposed to ads for microtransactions in-game.</p>
<p>As some players point out, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1kylh9d/comment/muyu6jx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">it's not an advert in the classic sense</a>, and no one's trying to flog you a cheeseburger or a pair of jeans every time you swap a weapon. Nonetheless, it's a new and insidious addition that we haven't seen in Call of Duty games before.</p>

<p>"One of the unwelcome changes I’ve noticed with Season 4 is that they’ve now inserted a new ad spot at the top of the list of your weapon specifics builds," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1kylh9d/season_4_brings_new_ad_spot_in_game_for_weapons/">wrote</a> one player. "So now every time you toggle between weapon builds you get to stare at ads for $20-$30 skins. I’m sure the Activision developer who suggested this terrible feature is very proud of themselves.</p>
<p>"This change is especially unneeded because you could already toggle from Builds to Shop on any given weapon and apparently not being thrown directly in our faces didn’t make them enough money. Many of us payed [sic] $60-$100 for a feature game and don’t want to be bombarded with additional ads."</p>

<p>Earlier this year, in a  update shared on social media, developer Treyarch said it recognised cheaters "are frustrating and severely impact the experience for our community" but insisted it was addressing the issue, and will continue to do so "throughout 2025". At the same time, it confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-bans-another-136000-cheaters">136,000 ranked play accounts were banned for cheating across both Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/people-can-fly-cancels-project-gemini-due-to-failed-deal-with-square-enix-will-scale-down-teams/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Polish developer People Can Fly has announced the cancellation of two projects: Project Gemini and Project Bifrost.</p>
<p>People Can Fly CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski <a href="https://x.com/PCFPeopleCanFly/status/1929140540697727466" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relayed</a> the news earlier today on X:</p>
<p><em>Today, we made a very difficult decision to suspend the development of Project Gemini and Project Bifrost - the relevant current reports have been released to the market. The suspension of the Gemini project is a consequence of the fact that the Publisher has not presented us with a draft of the subsequent content rider to the Publishing Agreement covering the terms and conditions of further milestones on project Gemini and the lack of communication from the Publisher as to its willingness to continue or terminate the Gemini project.</em></p>
<p><em>Project Bifrost was suspended due to the above and the analysis of the Group's cash flow, which showed a lack of prospects for securing organizational resources and funds necessary to continue the production and release of this project. As a result, we have to significantly regroup as a studio and scale down our teams, which hurts the most. We wish to express our deepest regret and sadness over how these events have unfolded and our sincere gratitude for everyone's contribution up to this point.</em></p>
<p>Project Gemini was being developed for publisher Square Enix and already <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-can-fly-removes-30-developers-from-unannounced-square-enix-game-project-gemini-to-shrink-scope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered</a> from a shrunken scope and the layoff of 30 developers in early 2024. People Can Fly had previously worked with Square Enix on Outriders. As for Project Bifrost, it was slated to be the last Virtual Reality game made by the studio, as they recognized that there wasn't enough of a market for VR yet.</p>
<p>A bit over a year ago, People Can Fly had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-can-fly-cancels-project-dagger-action-adventure-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> Project Dagger, a new IP in the action/adventure genre that would have been published by Take-Two. Even with all these failed projects, the Polish team is still working <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-is-being-co-developed-by-people-can-fly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Gears of War: E-Day for Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-can-fly-reaches-agreement-to-develop-a-new-game-based-on-sonys-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another unknown game based on a Sony IP.</a></p>

            <p>Elden Ring Nightreign already has a duos mode mod.</p>
<p>Luke Yui - yes, the same Luke Yui behind the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s Seamless Co-op and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-sekiro-mod-lets-you-play-co-op-and-pvp-with-your-friends">Sekiro's co-op mod</a> - had a mod up and running within hours of Nightreign's launch to support pairs of players that would rather play as a duo instead of Nightreign's requirement to pop you into a three-player fireteam.</p>

<p>"There will be more to come, but whilst the current game lacks 2-player modes, this mod will be available in this state," Yui wrote on his <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/3">Nexus Mod page</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-a-two-player-co-op-mod-on-pc/1100-6531963/">Gamespot</a>). "This mod will be expanded on in the future.</p>
<p>"There's no way to get banned using this mod unless you modify it with the intent of connecting to vanilla players," Yui added, noting that compatibility hadn't been tested against other mods.</p>
<p>As Ed wrote in his review, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">he wouldn't recommend Nightreign as a solo game</a> at this point as it's "clearly not the intended way to play". However, it seems FromSoftware is aiming to respond to the current backlash to make solo play more feasible, with the studio previously stated it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-could-receive-two-player-mode-post-launch">considering a two-player option post-launch</a>, acknowledging it was "something that was overlooked during development".</p>
<p>"FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour," Ed wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p>
<p>If you've jumped into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> this weekend and have struggled to find a Player 2 - and/or a Player 3 - you're not alone. In a brief statement posted to official Elden Ring social media accounts over the weekend, FromSoftware is recommending players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoft-acknowledges-issues-with-elden-ring-nightreign-matchmaking">"restart the matchmaking process" if they're struggling to find a co-op partner</a>. It later also suggested players check their NAT type.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>People Can Fly has cancelled two projects and "scaled down" its teams.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7334906069715972096/">statement</a> posted to LinkedIn this afternoon, CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski said it had been a "difficult decision" but attributed the suspension of Project Gemini and Bifrost to the publisher "not present[ing] us with a draft of the subsequent content rider to the Publishing Agreement", and the Group's cash flow, "which showed a lack of prospects", respectively.</p>
<p>"Today we made a very difficult decision to suspend the development of project Gemini and project Bifrost - the relevant current reports have been released to the market," Wojciechowski wrote.</p>
<p>"The suspension of the Gemini project is a consequence of the fact that the Publisher has not presented us with a draft of the subsequent content rider to the Publishing Agreement covering the terms and conditions of further milestone on project Gemini and the lack of communication from the Publisher as to its willingness to continue or terminate the Gemini project.</p>
<p>"Project Bifrost was suspended due to the above and the analysis of the Group's cash flow, which showed a lack of prospects for securing organisational resources and funds necessary to continue the production and release of this project.</p>
<p>"As a result, we have to significantly regroup as a studio and scale down our teams, which hurts the most," Wojciechowski added. "We wish to express our deepest regret and sadness over how these events have unfolded and our sincere gratitude for everyone's contribution up to this point."</p>
<p>Wojciechowski did not specify which publisher he thought had failed to "communicate", but the studio has worked with several publishing partners, most recently <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, Krafton, and Sony.<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-e-day-dev-the-coalition-drafts-in-people-can-fly-as-partner-studio"> It's also working on Gears of War: E-Day</a>. </p>
<p>In December, People Can Fly the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outriders">Outriders</a> developer announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outriders-developer-people-can-fly-reportedly-lays-off-over-30-employees">second round of layoffs in less than a year</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outriders-studio-people-can-fly-cuts-more-than-120-jobs-in-second-round-of-layoffs-this-year">this time affecting "more than 120" people</a>. The move accompanies the cancellation or downsizing of several projects, with the studio blaming "external market pressures".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/677300/dotemu-ceo-games-retro-ninja-gaiden-marvel-absolum<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Dotemu is on a pretty good run. The video game studio and publisher has been around since 2007, and much of its history is largely working on remakes and remasters of older games. But it’s also been involved with major hits in the form of sequels and new games that are in the spirit of older classics, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242538/streets-of-rage-4-review-ps4-xbox-steam-switch"><em>Streets of Rage 4</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/18/23172898/tmnt-shredders-revenge-classic-arcade-game-interview"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em></a>.</p><p>All of that work is culminating in what looks to be a promising 2025, with three new but classics-inspired games: <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>, a new side-scroller for the series; <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, an arcade-y beat-’em-up; and <em>Absolum</em>, an original beat-’em-up with roguelike elements. </p><p>“We’re open to everything,” CEO Cyrille Imbert tells <em>The Verge</em>. Despite his title, Imbert says his job involves acting like an executive producer to bring together concepts that answer specific needs for franchises.</p><p>Before <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em>’s 2022 release, for example, there hadn’t been a good side-scrolling <em>TMNT</em> game for “a while,” he says. (<em>Turtles in Time</em>, which helped inspire the game, came out in 1991.) “We were convinced that there was a need for that.” There was: the game sold 1 million copies in its first week, <a href="https://x.com/TributeGames/status/1547248576467722243?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1547248576467722243%7Ctwgr%5Eb8d322e893ca98cd09185a69abca6879f7701a81%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fventurebeat.com%2Fgames%2Fteenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge-sells-1m-in-its-first-week%2F">developer Tribute Games said</a> at the time.</p><p>Dotemu takes on “most of the risk” of a project based on an existing franchise, Imbert says, meaning that while the company needs to convince a franchise owner to get on board, Dotemu typically finances everything and is responsible for finding a studio to execute a concept.</p><p>“From A to Z, we are in control of the project, but we take the risk from A to Z as well,” explains Imbert. “Sometimes the studio will also participate financially, but it’s fairly rare, or it’s usually a minority of the total spending.” </p><p>With the new <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> game, for example, Imbert says he was familiar with the 3D iterations of the franchise on Xbox, and he also saw the success of recent action-platformers like <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F764790%2FThe_Messenger%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>The Messenger</em></a>. So, he started conversations with Koei Tecmo, and then worked with The Game Kitchen, the developer of <em>Blasphemous</em>, on a pitch. “That’s the story, basically,” Imbert says.</p><p>For <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, Imbert says that following <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>, “lots of people” had been asking for a new <em>X-Men</em> game that was like what you used to find in arcades. “We knew there was a need and that people would really like it,” he says, especially if it got a similar treatment as <em>Streets of Rage 4</em> or <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em>. The idea was “very obvious” to the Tribute Games team as well, so Dotemu and Tribute made a pitch to Marvel Games.</p><p><em>Absolum</em>, as a fully original game, is different from its other titles. From a pure business perspective, it’s a way for Dotemu to diversify its lineup so that the company doesn’t rely entirely on licensed games. Internally, the Dotemu team felt like they could do their own thing, and by making it inspired by classics, it would still fit in Dotemu’s lineup, Imbert says. They also wanted to work with Guard Crush, which worked on <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>, on another beat-’em-up.</p><p>It all adds up to what’s going to be a busy year for the company. It has three games that show the different approaches it has to making these kinds of experiences, and all of them were chosen for a specific reason. “That’s how we’re going to be proud of what we do.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>These latest comments come after Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford made headlines when he told a X/Twitter commenter that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">"real fans" would find a way to get their hands on a copy of the game, even if it came with a $80 price tag.</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment">He later tried to justify it</a>, all the while saying pricing was "not [his] call".</p>
<p>In this latest social media post, Pitchford wrote the word "free" four times, each time in blockcaps.</p>

We are out here struggling, Randy," <a href="https://x.com/Bungied2theTree/status/1928507212567097682">said</a> one player, while another <a href="https://x.com/TastyThumbs/status/1928512933576781858">wrote</a>: "Dude you need to shut up already. No reason games should be $80 especially if its anything like 3 or that shit ass excuse of a movie."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid the industry is moving in that direction and it’s just reality that we'll have to accept," Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1928518680968634658">insisted</a>. "The price for Borderlands 4 is going to get announced by the publisher soon. My wish, having worked my ass off on the game, is for as many people as possible to get to play it."</p>
<p>When <a href="https://x.com/Lt_Frost935/status/1928508928851325080">another</a> commented: "So Randy, you think making backhanded comments towards your consumers about them being 'cost sensitive' is the plan? Wtf happened to you," he <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1928517946726396351">responded</a>: "Backhanded? There are literally people who want to play great video games, have a game-ready PC, but may not be able to spend enough to buy a new AAA game for awhile and this week there’s a free offer for one of the best shooter looters to come out over the last five years…"</p>
<p>"Saying 'cost sensitive' as the CEO of a company (In lieu of criticism of an $80 price tag for BL4) when a lot of your fan base is struggling to even pay for the roof over their heads and food on their tables is a crazy sentence to utter," said another <a href="https://x.com/Frost2dd/status/1928514727023411472">player</a>.</p>
<p>Just a week before the "real fans" kerfuffle, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/play-borderlands-4-first-and-understand-the-choices-weve-made-randy-pitchford-tells-fans-querying-minimap-removal">Pitchford implored we "play the game first and understand the choices [the development team has] made"</a> before passing judgement on changes Gearbox has made to the shooter's head's up display, including the removal of the mini-map.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4, as we learned a couple of weeks ago, is now arriving earlier than expected on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">12th September</a>, and developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-some-new-borderlands-4-gameplay-to-go-with-that-revised-release-date">Gearbox recently shared more of its latest looter shooter in a new PlayStation showcase</a>. It showed off a couple of new Vault Hunters, some of its new weapons, new traversal mechanics, its new planet, and more all to whip-up enthusiasm for what creative director Graeme Timmins called "hands-down our best Borderlands ever".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> update, Chronicle, is due out next month with a newly revealed June 24th release date, and developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/kinetic-games">Kinetic Games</a> have offered up some details on what it calls one of the game's "biggest updates" so far. So, let's have a look at what that entails! The key addition with this update is the arrival of sound evidence, which as you can probably guess is a new haunting paranormal proof type that you'll acquire by using the newly added sound recorder.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In turn, the journal has been completely redesigned. The photos tab will now be the media tab, which organises evidence into photos, videos, and those aforementioned sound recordings. You'll need to fill your book up with unique media to achieve a perfect investigation, and there's some new events like EMF spikes, interactions like rocking chairs, and different ghost forms to help you do this.
</p>
<p>
The media quality system has been revamped too. Now whenever you capture your first bit of evidence of any media type, it'll be marked as unique, so you'll get some bonus dosh and experience once you've wrapped up a contract. Plus, there are some bug fixes coming with this update too.
</p>
<p>
Following the release of Chronicle, a rework of Grafton Farmhouse will be coming too. Kinetic explained in a <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-dev-preview-19">blog post</a> that the whole map has been overhauled, namely some re-themed rooms, certain spaces increasing or decreasing in size, and there's a new "crowded attic, complete with sheet covered old furniture."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year Kinetic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/phasmophobia-is-getting-a-new-haunted-location-but-wont-be-getting-any-more-big-maps">outlined the future of Phasmophobia</a>, promising more (but not big) maps, more map reworks, and Horror 2.0, the long awaited full release of the, uh, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game.

            <p>
Developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/rebellion-developments">Rebellion Developments</a> revealed a first look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/atomfall">Atomfall's</a> first DLC expansion yesterday. Titled Wicked Isle, it unsurprisingly brings you to an island called Midsummer Island that is, in fact, a bit wicked, but like, in the bad way, not in the something a teen in the 2000s would say about something they like kind of way. Specifically it'll have a bit more of a folk horror vibe to it, which I'm certainly into conceptually. Lots of great folklore in the UK, as long as it's not stepping over frequently trodden upon territory.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Rebellion head of design Ben Fisher explains that the island is "close to the Windscale Atom Plant and as a result the levels of infection in both the people and environment are higher than on the mainland." It'll feature new enemies like pirate bandits and infected druids to fight, though you'll get some new weapons to fend them off in kind. That includes things like a blunderbuss shotgun, a cutlass, daggers, a new bow, and a beekeeper's staff. You know, the typical kind of things you find on a creepy island.

<p>
The completionists amongst you might also like to know (or dread to hear depending on how much you liked the game) that some of the new storylines can lead to new endings in the base game. No details on what those are, obviously, but I suppose the joy of experiencing things for the first time is just that!
</p>
<p>
There's a release date for the expansion too: June 3rd, just a few days away at the time of writing. Let's all see how it shapes up, as our own James found himself left wanting a bit with a lot of what Atomfall had to offer in his own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/atomfall-review">review</a> of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>.

			<p>There's a lot of speculation about what the new Nintendo Switch 2 console, due to debut next week in stores globally, can achieve in terms of system performance. The system supports up to 120 frames per second in handheld mode and up to 4K and 60 frames per second in docked mode, and complex open world games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-new-comparison-videos-highlight-how-the-game-and-technology-have-come-a-long-way-since-1-0-version/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and Star Wars Outlaws are being ported to the hardware.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nobunagas-ambition-awakening-complete-edition-qa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speaking to Koei Tecmo</a> in an interview about the launch title NOBUNAGA’S AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition, we learned that the Japanese team tried to run the game at 4K resolution and 60FPS but had to scale down to just 1080P@30FPS. Here's what game producer and director Michi Ryu told Wccftech:</p>
<p><em>We are not using NVIDIA DLSS. The game runs at Full HD and 30fps. We also experimented with 4K and 60fps, but the power required to render the Japanese archipelago with these graphics is more than you can imagine and difficult to keep stable, so we had to give up. We hope to revisit this challenge in the future if the opportunity arises.</em></p>
<p>NOBUNAGA's AMBITION: Awakening isn't exactly the most taxing game, as you can see from its recommended requirements for PC:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>OS: Windows 10, Windows 11, 64bit</em></li>
<li><em>Processor: Intel Core i7-3770 or over (Windows 10), Intel Core i3-8350K or over (Windows 11)</em></li>
<li><em>Memory: 8 GB RAM</em></li>
<li><em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060(6GB) or over, AMD Radeon RX580(8GB) or over</em></li>
<li><em>DirectX: Version 11</em></li>
<li><em>Network: Broadband Internet connection</em></li>
<li><em>Storage: 25 GB available space</em></li>
<li><em>Sound Card: 16-bit stereo, 48KHz WAVE file can be played</em></li>
<li><em>Additional Notes: 1920 x 1080 Display required</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Still, owners of the Nintendo Switch 2 will at least see a major graphics improvement, according to Ryu:</p>
<p><em>Thanks to the hardware evolution of Switch 2, the graphics have been significantly improved. Elements like the sea, sky, and ground look much more real, enhancing the immersive experience of the game. Being able to have this level of graphics in a portable format is a major point to be enjoyed by players. Additionally, with mouse operation via Joy-Con 2 and USB mouse support, intuitive controls are now possible. We have also included some game content that was previously only available in Asia, so we hope players will enjoy those as well.</em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on Thursday, June 5. Check out our info roundup article <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Kinetic Games has confirmed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s next content drop, Chronicle, will release on 24th June, and it'll be its "biggest update yet".</p>
<p>As well as introducing a "total overhaul" of how evidence is collected, the team said Chronicle will expand investigations with three new evidence types, a completely redesigned Journal, reworked levelling and progression, a refreshed Main Menu UI, and "many eerie surprises still lurking in the dark".</p>

<p>But at the "heart" of the Chronicle update is the debut of the all-new Sound evidence. An entirely new haunting paranormal proof type can be captured through the new Sound Recorder, bringing "a new dimension to gameplay, revealing subtle clues that might otherwise be drowned out by terrified screams". Available in the customary three upgrade tiers, players will be able to record audio from ghost events, Spirit Box responses, and Paranormal Sounds like those detected by the Parabolic Microphone.</p>
<p>It's this new evidence type that's necessitated a Journal upgrade, too. The Photo tab will be rebranded as "Media", and keep all your photos, videos, and new sound recordings in one place. Importantly, you'll have to fill your journal with all these unique media types, including "EMF spikes to ghostly interactions and fleeting glimpses of otherworldly forms", to complete a "perfect" investigation.</p>
<figure>

<p>"Chronicle will also introduce a revamped media quality system," Kinetic teased. "The first evidence capture of any media type will be marked as 'Unique', granting extra cash and XP rewards at the end of each contract. Any subsequent captures of the same evidence type will be classed as 'Duplicates', offering smaller rewards. The new system will also add tier bonuses based on the equipment used and adds all media captures into the Reward Multiplier, making every shot, sound, and sight count even more toward player’s final payouts."</p>
<p>Don't forget that this year, Phasmophobia will also rework Grafton Farmhouse, following Bleasdale Farmhouse's recent overhaul. Before then, though, we'll also get to see the new levelling and progression system and Main Menu UI when Chronicle arrives at the end of June.</p>

            <p>
Yesterday, ZeniMax Workers United-CWA, the union made up of more than 300 quality assurance workers at Microsoft via its subsidiary <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/zenimax-media">ZeniMax Media</a>, reached a tentative contract agreement with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/microsoft">Microsoft</a>. The union was formed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">back in 2022</a>, and has been bargaining with Microsoft in the intervening years since. Last month, the union was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/union-workers-at-fallout-and-elder-scrolls-company-ready-to-strike-against-microsoft-after-two-years-of-haggling">preparing to potentially strike against Microsoft</a>, but now it seems like this may be avoided.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
If fully agreed to, the contract will bring in "substantial across-the-board wage increases as well as new minimum salaries for workers", according to a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft">press release</a> from the CWA. On top of that, there would be protections against arbitrary dismissal, grievance procedures, and a "crediting policy that clearly acknowledges the QA workers’ contributions to the video games they help create." The press release notes that the agreement would also include an agreement made in 2023 in relation to how AI is used in the workplace.
</p>
<p>
To be clear, this contract isn't set in stone just yet. Explanation meetings need to be held for members over the coming weeks, and according to the CWA a ratification vote should be completed by June 20th. If it goes through, it will be a huge win for the workers, and should set a big precedent for game workers employed at a Microsoft-owned studio.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, a union made up of almost 200 <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-devs-have-formed-an-almost-200-person-strong-union-with-the-cwa-called-the-overwatch-gamemakers-guild">was also formed alongside the CWA</a>, called the Overwatch Gamemakers Guild. Microsoft have already recognised this union as well. If things continue to go well for ZeniMax Workers United-CWA, perhaps we'll see wins at other unions further down the line. I for one have my fingers deeply tied for such results.
