            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> has been out for a little while already, what with me giving its multiplayer largely a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review">thumbs up</a>. Still, it's an ever-evolving thing and Activision have announced the game's first seasonal drop. It's a hefty one with a lot of additions, so I'll try my best to break down the good stuff. TLDR: there's some new maps for multiplayer and zombies, new modes, and a few extra bits. I'm mildly excited for more. More in this case is good.</p>

<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a> Season One kicks off on November 14th and it'll bring with the usual assortment of things. Some guns, many of which will likely be meta almost immediately. One is a power drill melee weapon that I immediately want but can't be arsed to unlock. There are new Operators, too, one of which looks like the Haze guy from that PS3 game.</p>
<p>Really, though, the highlights here are the new maps. Hideout being a training site home to some "intense indoor combat", which looks fine? Heirloom looks the most interesting, being a private art gallery filled with lots of nice sculptures and shiny lobbies to sling lead in. Hacienda arrives mid-season, the vineyard estate returning from Black Ops 4 and sure to please fans of a game I genuinely can't recall.</p>

<figcaption>Warzone's getting a new Resurgence map called Area 99, too.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8vuGF6g2TI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>A new game mode called Ransack arrives at launch, where you've got to loot gold bars from crates dotted around maps, then bring them successfully back to your team's stash. It's all about collecting and raiding and pilfering - sounds fun, to be honest.</p><p>One new scorestreak has caught my eye, with it being a big Hand Cannon. Hit 900 points in a single life and you'll "equip a massively powerful hand cannon for a finite amount of time". It'll have "high-penetration shots that can one-shot enemies", a bit like the Golden Gun from the Hunter class in Destiny 2, eh.</p>
<p>In zombies there will be a new Directed mode, that I'll 100% use. Turn this on and it'll mean that zombies objectives will be clearly marked with a maximum round cap of 15, turning it into an easy to follow story experience. I'm also looking forward to the new map, which is an "abandoned castle", with promises of a "medieval village".</p>
<p>Elsewhere there's a new ranked mode for people who take their Duty very seriously and the introduction of omni-movement and Blops 6's guns to Warzone.</p>

That’s nearly a decade ago, surprisingly enough, and it’s making me feel old, as I remember seeing the previews and press screens of the game back in the day. But here we are, multiple sequels deep Now, a new studio takes the helm from Don’t Nod. Developer Deck Nine Games, known for<em> Life is Strange Remastered Collection</em> and <em>The Expanse: A Telltale Series</em>. However, the new dev hasn’t quite landed on the same success as the original titles from Don’t Nod, unfortunately.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196013" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="316" data-playlist="196013,196358,196663" data-current="196013"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21533.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As of this writing,<em> Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> sits at a ‘Mixed’ rating on Steam. Most of the game’s negative reviews mention the lack of Chloe as the primary reason they didn’t enjoy this experience. Of course, most of the positive reviews also mention Chloe. </p><p>On the topic of the negative reviews, we would be remiss not to mention the advanced access edition of the game, which asked players to spend more money to play <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>—a story-driven single-player game—a few days ahead of the full release. Developers use this tactic to coax a nice chunk of change out of the community’s pockets, and many pay. </p><p>But let’s talk about the positives, because<em> Life is Strange </em>remains an exceptionally complex and captivating story worthy of attention and, for the most part, praise. Regarding the many positive reviews on Steam, players note the story, facial expressions, graphics, and, of course, the characters themselves, like Max and Amanda. They remain fan favorites.</p><p>Whether you’re new to the franchise or a returning player looking for closure from this long-running tale, <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> provides a unique experience that captivates most players from the get-go. Here’s a look at the latest <em>Life is Strange</em> game, as told by Steam reviews!</p><figure id="" data-id="b44284ed06f5354d5bb47f91b79480dc"

Firstly, he suggested PlayStation needs to be checking in earlier on during  the development process to determine if things are on track or not. Secondly, the company has been too siloed when approaching new projects, needing more communication between teams. Thirdly, the release timing for <em>Concord</em> might have been especially bad. And finally, live-service multiplayer games are just risky even if everything is done right. </p><p>Here are Totoki’s full comments during today’s second quarter earnings call via Sony’s translator:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Currently, we are still in the process of learning and basically with regards to IP you don’t know the result until you actually try it. So for us for our reflection probably we need to have a lot of gates including user testing and user evaluation and the timing of such gates we need to bring them forward and we should have done those gates much earlier than we did. </p><p>And also we did have a siloed organization so going beyond the boundaries of those organizations in both development and sales and I think that could have been much more smoother. </p><p>Going forward in our first-party titles and third-party title we do have many different windows and we want to be able to select the right and optimal window so we can deploy them on our own platform without cannibalization so we can maximize performance in terms of title launches.</p></blockquote><p><em>Concord</em> launched back in August, and struggled to gain any traction with players—a death sentence for a live service game that relies in part on a healthy player pool to reduce matchmaking times, and make players confident that the game they’re investing in won’t soon disappear. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what happened with the hero shooter after Sony took the unprecedented step of unreleasing it just a couple weeks later. The game, with an initial development deal <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290"><em>Kotaku</em> previously reported</a></span> at $200 million, has since been fully refunded and the team behind it, Firewalk Studios, disbanded in a mass layoff last month. </p><p>“The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title,” PlayStation co-CEO Hermen Hulst said at the time. “We will take the lessons learned from <em>Concord</em> and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area.” The 170 developers cut as part of Firewalk brings Sony’s total gaming layoffs for the year up to 1,290. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto is one of the most famous and groundbreaking creative types across all of entertainment, but the man himself doesn't agree that he's a genius. As part of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106_2e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's latest earnings briefing</a>, Miyamoto pushed back against the suggestion that he's been able for decades to turn out hit after hit because he's a "genius."</p><p>"You referred to me as a 'genius,' but I consider myself quite ordinary," he said.</p><p>Miyamoto went on to say he gives a speech each year to Nintendo's new hires, and the feedback he gets from these people is that he is "surprisingly ordinary."</p><p>Making great games allows Miyamoto to have an easier career, he said. "I often think it would be fun if I didn't have to work, so I'm always thinking about things like, well, if I have to work, how can I do it more efficiently. And if I am going to do the same work, how can I make it more of a hit, because when a project is a hit it makes future work easier," he said.</p><p>Miyamoto went on to reveal more of what he tells new hires coming to Nintendo. He said many people come to work at Nintendo and aspire to make "upgraded versions" of games they've played before. But Miyamoto pushes back against this idea and encourages them to think differently.</p><p>"[Game design] is about observing the world around us and figuring out how to assemble those elements into an engaging video game," he said. "I explain that game design is about planning. That is, it is about assessing what hardware and development environment to use to create the game, whether the desired game can be realized with its available processing power, and engaging in trial and error to bring it to life."</p><p>Miyamoto has had a long and illustrious career at Nintendo. The 71-year-old started at Nintendo all the way back in 1977 and helped create Donkey Kong, Super Mario Bros., and The Legend of Zelda. He's remained a key player at Nintendo to this day in his "Creative Fellow" position, contributing to all manner of Nintendo game franchises. In addition to his work on Nintendo's game franchises, he was an executive producer on 2023's The Super Mario Bros. Movie and will produce the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-planned-to-come-out-this-decade/1100-6527603/" data-ref-id="1100-6527603">live-action Legend of Zelda film.</a> He's also involved in the Nintendo theme parks.</p><p>Miyamoto has no plans to retire, but has admitted he has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/miyamoto-has-no-plans-to-retire-but-is-thinking-about-it-in-case-something-does-happen/1100-6520073/" data-ref-id="1100-6520073">spent time thinking about who may fill his shoes</a> one day.</p><p>As for Nintendo's hardware business, the Switch is now in its eighth year on the market. It's sold more than 146 million units worldwide, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-announcement-is-still-five-months-away-at-most/1100-6527576/" data-ref-id="1100-6527576">all eyes are on Nintendo to reveal the Switch 2 by April 2025. </a></p>

Almost two years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>'s PlayStation launch, Sony Santa Monica has - after introducing the feature in September's PC release - finally made it possible to stop blabbermouth companions from incessantly spewing out puzzle hints on console.

Puzzle-ruining companions were one of the most consistent criticisms levied at the otherwise extremely well-received God of War Ragnarök back in 2021, with users lamenting Sony Santa Monica's rather condescending decision to almost immediately shower players with hints on encountering a new puzzle, rather than giving them space to find solutions for themselves.
</p>
<p>
"I am now many (many) hours further into Ragnarök, and yet these 'hints' just keep on coming," a rather exasperated Victoria Kennedy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-overly-helpful-characters-create-a-puzzling-puzzle-problem">wrote on Eurogamer at the time</a>, "with varying degrees of abruptness from those delivering them."

<p>
Thankfully, when God of War Ragnarök finally made its way to PC back in September, Sony Santa Monica had taken criticism of the PlayStation version to heart, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-on-pc-lets-players-reduce-intrusive-puzzle-hints">introducing an option that specifically reduced the frequency companions doled out puzzle hints</a>. And that option - as Sony previously promised - is now available on console.
</p><p>
The feature arrives as part of Ragnarök's 06.00 update, which also brings a new Audio Descriptions accessibility option for all in-game cinematics, bug fixes, and a range of PS5 Pro-specific enhancements. The latter include a new mode enabling Favour Quality features while running at 60fps, a PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution option, plus the ability to unlock framerates when using variable refresh rate monitors. Full details can be <a href="https://support.sms.playstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/31642737345293-Patch-Notes-v-06-00">found on Sony's website</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for the PC version of God of War Ragnarök, Digital Foundry was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-a-quality-port-with-small-issues-and-here-are-our-best-settings-selections">broadly impressed</a> when it took a closer look back in September, praising some "super-smooth gaming" while criticising "edge case problems that need addressing".

            <p>Activision has unveiled what's coming up in Call of Duty <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>'s first season, which is scheduled to launch on 14th November.</p>
<p>Along with five multiplayer maps - three of which are brand new - players can also expect a "vast amount" of free and premium content, including a new Zombies "experience in-season", plus full integration with Call of Duty's spin-off battle royale, Warzone.</p>

<p>Treyarch has outlined what's coming up in painfully busy infographic below, revealing that as well as the arrival of Racket (2v2 and 6v6), Hacienda (6v6), and Nuketown Holiday (6v6) mid-season, three new maps are also en-route: Hideout, Extraction, and Heirloom.</p><p>Hideout is described as a medium-sized training site featuring signature Black Ops design, whilst Extraction boasts the medium-sized Avalon Heliport "built for a variety of playstyles". Heirloom is more compact and features a "fine art museum built for fast-paced action". All are available for 6v6, with the latter also coming for 2v2.</p>
<p>Players can also expect ranked multiplayer games, as well as the new modes Ransack and Prophunt - the former requires you to loot gold bars and get them out whilst ensuring the enemy can't raid your stash, whilst the latter is "an infamous game of hide-and-seek". Whilst Prophunt launches mid-season, Ransack goes live at launch.</p> <div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-sims-competitor-inzoi-set-to-enter-early-access-in-march-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In August, inZOI released a demo of the game's Character Studio so that those who were interested to see how The Sims competitor played out could have a chance. The game was originally meant to be released before 2024 was finished, but it looks like that dream has been dashed, and it's now set to enter Early Access on March 28, 2025. Today, inZOI Director and Producer Kjun made an announcement<a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1854509177508593738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1854509177508593738%7Ctwgr%5E7b573ef972c48b9dd35f814b1f86691118ccede4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.destructoid.com%2Fthe-sims-competitor-inzoi-will-now-enter-early-access-on-march-28-2025%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in Discord</a>, giving the statement that the Early Access period of the upcoming competitor has been delayed to March 28. inZOI was also a game that was showcased at Gamescom and received a lot of positive chatter and feedback about their title.</p>
<p>"After reviewing your feedback from inZOI: Character Studio and analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests, we have made our decision to release inZOI in Early Access on March 28, 2025. We apologize that we could not bring you the game sooner, but this decision reflects our commitment to giving inZOI the best possible start."</p>
<p>Of course, to those who enjoy life simulators, this does come as a pretty disappointing announcement, especially as the Character Studio seemed to be well received, with many people posting pictures of their creations online. Compared to The Sims, the game is shaping up to be hyper-realistic, with a ton of built-in customization, something that is often seen to be a little bit lacking in The Sims without the use of mods or custom content.</p>
<p>Continuing his statement, Kjun provided a peculiar analogy: "It is said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. The extra love and care that is required to properly nurture a child is how I see our journey with inZOI—a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth."</p>
<p>At the moment, it's uncertain whether the Character Studio demo will remain available for people to keep playing on, as<a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-partners-with-overwolf-to-bring-official-mods-into-life-simulation-game-inzoi/"> KRAFTON</a> and inZOI's development team haven't made an announcement about this as of yet. However, it's possible that they will mention this in their Discord server, which is a hub of activity and conversation between fans and developers alike.</p>

And now, this trend will continue on November 20 with the addition of <em>The Storybook Vale</em>, bringing a whole lot of cool stuff to the game we’ve never seen before.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know about what’s coming in <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>’s all-new <em>The Storybook Vale</em> expansion.</p><h2 id="h3172"><a id=""></a>It has a new story and new villains!</h2><figure id="" data-id="e6a5a938f802e195eef58b8589311dcb" data-recommend-id="image://e6a5a938f802e195eef58b8589311dcb" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters from Hercules are portrayed in a painting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters from Hercules are portrayed in a painting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e6a5a938f802e195eef58b8589311dcb" data-recommend-id="image://e6a5a938f802e195eef58b8589311dcb" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters from Hercules are portrayed in a painting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A new story will take place within the DLC, promising exciting twists and turns as you work to fend off the influence of two new villains who have taken over the Vale.

<p>A number of employees at Marvel Rivals and Destiny: Rising developer NetEase Games have been arrested, according to a new report.</p>



<p>According to Chinese outlet <a href="https://www.leiphone.com/category/industrynews/D1r2qIXu83HaLD5q.html">Leifeng</a> — with additional context via <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/netease-says-police-detained-executives-for-alleged-bribery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg Law</a> — nine employees, including two senior executives, were arrested for allegedly laundering money.  </p>



<p>Per the report, the contract value appears to be worth 2 billion yuan, which is just about $278.6 million. In actual money, it’s a  bit lower at 800 million to 1 billion yuan, or $111.4-$139.3 million.</p>



<p>The two executives implicated in the case are Xiang Lang and Jin Yuchen. Xiang served as the head of NetEase’s esports division while Jin was the head of the company’s publishing side.  Neither executive is still with the company.</p>



<p>Names of other employees at the company weren’t made available. At least one who was questioned by outlet <a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/netease-responds-to-the-rumors-of-corruption-saying-things-are-under-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yicaiglobal</a> has denied any claims of money laundering. </p>



<p>The allegedly corruption took place within the segments of the company the two executives worked, the company said. They also confirmed that 27 different companies have been blacklisted due to links to fraud. </p>



<p>Other details of the incidents couldn’t be shared due to there still being an active investigation. More information will be provided at a later date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-what-we-create-is-more-important-than-the-amount-spent-on-development<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"The more you polish something that has never existed before, the more value it brings."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106_2e.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent Q&amp;A</a> with investors, Nintendo executive and storied designer Shigeru Miyamoto answered a question about the trend of rising development costs, saying that what Nintendo creates is far more important than what it spends on development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question related to rising development costs, asking if Nintendo's own expenses would increase in the future and if the company could mitigate those increases. Miyamoto stepped in to respond first, saying that while cost increases are inevitable, and Nintendo is focused on creating good and unique experiences first, it's also quite possible to make great games without spending massive piles of money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's his response, in full:</p><blockquote>Our research and development expenses have been increasing each year. Since our scale of development has grown, a corresponding increase in costs is, in some respects, inevitable.</blockquote><blockquote>However, our belief is that what we create is more important than the amount spent on development. We continue refining our products until we are confident that we have created something that our consumers will be satisfied with. With that in mind, what is important is to find ideas that are worth honing, and this has not changed since the era of Nintendo Entertainment System. Everyone has different interests, so we cannot make sweeping statements about what ideas are worth pursuing. However, one thing we are sure about is that it should be something which has not existed in the past. The more you polish something that has never existed before, the more value it brings. We believe that it is important to nurture developers who take this unique concept to heart, allocate funds to development if necessary, and release games only after we are confident in the product – and repeat this process over and over again.</blockquote><blockquote>On the other hand, in the entertainment business it is possible to create appealing products based on intriguing ideas, without incurring significant costs. Children’s toys are a prime example of this. We believe that not all products require large costs. Even in the case of video games, with the current technology it is possible to create fun games with a small number of developers in a short period of time. We believe it is important not to lose sight of this perspective.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/gettyimages-2173872596-1731077735788.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto. Photo by Lars Nicolaysen/picture alliance via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fellow executives Shinya Takahashi and Ko Shiota followed up on Miyamoto's answer. Takahashi reiterated the importance of "unique titles that are small in scale" that can be expanded, rather than spending huge amounts of money. He added that the Switch has evolved in such a way that it includes different methods to limit cost increases. And Shiota added that the company is working hard to ensure developers can work efficiently, and that "bigger budgets do not necessarily equate to better ideas." Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa threw in at the end that investment in development is a necessity - otherwise Nintendo won't have great hardware and software at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same Q&amp;A, Miyamoto <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendos-shigeru-miyamoto-creator-of-mario-zelda-donkey-kong-and-more-denies-being-a-genius">dismissed a question</a> referring to him as a "genius", saying new Nintendo employees had referred to the Mario, Zelda, and Pikmin creator as "surprisingly normal" after meeting him. Miyamoto has also recently made statements about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-wants-nintendo-to-be-left-out-of-the-game-wars-focused-on-high-specs-and-performance">wanting to be left out of the console wars</a>, and said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-on-ai-nintendo-would-rather-go-in-a-different-direction">Nintendo would rather go in a "different direction"</a> than the rest of the industry when it comes to artificial intelligence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this comes ahead of Nintendo's announcement of its Switch successor console. The company recently confirmed the Switch 2, for want of a better name, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-officially-be-backward-compatible-with-original-switch-games">will play Switch games and Nintendo Switch Online will carry forward</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Lars Nicolaysen/picture alliance via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-machine-learning/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Although the Xbox Series X machine learning hardware is not on the same level as the PlayStation 5 Pro's, it has some use cases, but Microsoft never showed any interest in using it.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of their Weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> addressed a point of discussion that's been circulating on social media in the past few days, suggesting that Sony, with the PlayStation 5 Pro, has finally caught up with Microsoft regarding machine learning, saying that having machine learning hardware in the console, and not doing anything with it doesn't exactly mean catching up. The around 100 TOPS of the Xbox Series X are in reference to INT4, which is usually not used for machine learning upscaling. Still, there's nothing preventing Microsoft from developing a machine learning model that could run on the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, but the company just doesn't seem interested in doing so. The Series consoles' machine learning hardware could have been used, for example, to run <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-showcases-auto-sr-automatic-super-resolution-the-first-os-integrated-ai-upscaling-technology-powered-by-npus/">Auto SR</a> for Xbox 360 backward-compatible games, as the company developed a model that can operate on 40 INT8 TOPS MPUs, something that would have been easily manageable by the current generation consoles' machine learning hardware.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #187: Concord Dead, Indiana Jones Hands-On, Horizon PC Tested, 'Disaster Remasters'" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dtY1se3Nvj8?start=5683&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Given that the Xbox Series X|S architecture was developed back in 2016 when machine learning was on the horizon, it's not surprising that it wasn't used for anything. Things, however, are definitely set to change in the future console generation, especially after seeing the excellent results the first iteration of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution</a> is capable of achieving.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-physical-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-physical-edition-launches-for-ps5-in-december.1031013/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-physical-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The physical version of celebrated action RPG&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date, so mark your calendar if you've been waiting to check this one out on disc.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/PMStudiosUSA/status/1854901792414241099" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> by physical game company PM Studios, the physical version of&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>arrives on PS5 on December 12th. Naturally, the PC version's not getting a physical edition; after all, when was the last time your PC had an honest-to-goodness disc drive?</p>

<p>If you're worried that the physical version of the game will just be one of those empty-box-with-no-actual-disc-inside deals, you needn't be. PM Studios <a href="https://x.com/PMStudiosUSA/status/1854909999048458693" rel="noopener" target="_blank">has confirmed</a> that the box will, in fact, contain a proper disc, and not just a code.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-physical-release-date-staff-spinning.jpg?itok=pSoRRQjZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-physical-release-date-staff-spinning.jpg?itok=pWIyjJ0C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A physical version of&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is finally on the way next month.</figcaption></figure><p>The physical version of the game will contain a code for the Deluxe Edition upgrade, which will net you an extra staff and set of armor, as well as an additional curio. You can claim this equipment from the Keeper's Shrine menu.</p>

<p>If&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s physical launch is anything like as successful <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m">as the digital version was</a>, then we can likely expect this release to break a couple more sales milestones, which will no doubt make developer GameScience happy.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, it's an action RPG developed by Chinese studio GameScience and based loosely on the classical novel&nbsp;<em>Journey to the West</em>.</p>

<p>Rather than Wukong himself, you control the Destined One, a distinctly simian warrior whose destiny is to follow in the footsteps of the legendary trickster god. Along the way, you'll meet plenty of colorful characters and visit lots of beautiful locations inspired by classical Chinese mythology.</p>




<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is a Soulslike, so you can expect tough boss fights and plenty of semi-linear exploration, although the game goes a little easier on the difficulty than the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/black-myth-wukong/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. The physical version of the PS5 release is due to arrive on December 12th.

And without it, the the adorable little creatures are useless unless they happen to have a special ability attached to them. Most do not, however, leaving whoever goes first immediately hamstrung. </p><p>Instead, it’s the person who goes second who gets draw their first energy and get the attack rolling. A Farfetch’d with one energy can immediately start hitting for 40 damage. If you’re opponent plays <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gacha-loot-box-gambling-1851690838&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gacha-loot-box-gambling-1851690838">an EX card on their first turn</a></span>—special, more powerful variants of existing rare <em>Pokémon</em> cards, they get a head start on racking up the energy needed to use gaming winning attacks. From that point on, whoever went first is just playing catch-up.</p><p>It’s already become an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1glo6d2/just_why/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1glo6d2/just_why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">established meme</a></span> within the <em>TCG Pocket</em> community that this sucks. It’s not just that going first in the game doesn’t convey the usual card game advantages; it’s that going first is basically a fake turn that doesn’t actually let the player engage with the most important mechanic in the game. <em>TCG Pocket</em>’s first PvP event going live earlier this week made made the pain point even more pronounced as top-tier decks steamrolled everyone. </p><p> “If this event has shown me anything,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1glygha/one_advantage_however_is_that_you_can_concede/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1glygha/one_advantage_however_is_that_you_can_concede/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one player writes on Reddit</a></span>, “if you go first against any of the top 3 decks right now you will more then likely loose unless they draw like shit.”</p><p>“While it’s hard to achieve a true 50/50 between going first and going second, if not impossible,” argued another, “this game’s balance between the two is atrocious, surely you could get closer than this, it feels like a good 70-30 split, if not worse.”</p><p>Card games have tried to balance the first-mover advantage in different ways. <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> doesn’t let whoever goes first draw a card in the first round, a consequential move given the big deck sizes and the importance keeping up momentum with new resources to deploy. <em>Hearthstone</em> deals with the issue by letting the second player mulligan an extra card and get a one-time extra mana boost. <em>Marvel Snap</em> side-steps the issue entirely by having both players play their turns simultaneously. And while the table-top version of <em>Pokémon TCG</em> still stops the first turn from attacking, it at least lets you attach an energy and get your hand rolling.</p><p>Someone will always have a slight advantage in <em>TCG Pocket</em> depending on the turn order. That’s why there’s a coin flip to help make that as random as possible. But it would still feel way better if the player who goes second got to do something extra, rather than just penalizing whoever goes first. It’s possible as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974">new cards are added</a></span> to the game, the turn one advantage of playing extra cards will be more valuable—that’s even more likely given another of <em>Pocket</em>’s big changes from the full TCG: letting Trainer cards be played on that first turn.</p><p>But for now it’s only easily exploited by water decks running <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=aBlvs1ab1gc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=aBlvs1ab1gc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Misty trainers and Articuno EX</a></span>, and all of those players are scumbags anyway. <br></p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket encourages you to open packs, perform Wonder Picks, battle the AI and real-life opponents, and complete Missions. The latter is very interesting as Pokémon Pocket has unadvertised Secret Missions—but we know what they are and what they reward you with.</p>



<p>I don’t know what it is, but knowing a secret most people don’t is invigorating. It doesn’t make you feel special, but it’s cool having exclusive knowledge unknown to anyone else. Most of Pokémon TCG Pocket’s mechanics and functions are out in the open—even the famous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-bent-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bent Pack Trick</a>—but the community is largely in the dark about Secret Missions.</p>



<p>Daily Missions and Premium Missions are all well and good, but if you didn’t know, Pokémon TCG Pocket has several Secret Missions that take weeks to complete.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-secret-missions-does-pokemon-tcg-pocket-have">How Many Secret Missions Does Pokémon TCG Pocket Have?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Secrets no more. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket has seven Secret Missions </strong>for you to chase, and believe me when I say—it could take you a <em>long time</em> to even finish one of them.</p>



<p>Depending on your propensity to procure Poké Gold, it’s conceivable that weeks pass before you tick off any of the missions. Each Secret Mission revolves around collecting cards in the Genetic Apex set. It’s entirely feasible more missions are added in Pokémon TCG Pocket’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-expansion-rumors-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next expansions</a>, but for now, let’s concentrate on the initial Secret Missions.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-pokemon-tcg-pocket-secret-mission-amp-rewards">Every Pokémon TCG Pocket Secret Mission &amp; Rewards</h2>



<p>To complete every Secret Mission in Pokémon TCG Pocket, you need to <strong>own every card in the Genetic Apex set</strong>.</p>



<p>This is a brutal proposition as this requires a ton of luck, time investment, and probably money. Without further ado, check out the list in full, their requirements, and your luxurious rewards for managing each impressive feat.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Secret Mission Name</th><th data-align="center">Mission Requirements</th><th data-align="center">Mission Rewards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Complete the Kanto Pokedex!</td><td data-align="center">Complete the Kanto Pokedex by collecting all 151 Kanto region Pokemon cards.</td><td data-align="center">Mew</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Genetic Apex Museum 1 (Charizard)</td><td data-align="center">Collect full art cards of Gloom, Pinsir, Charmander, Rapidash, Lapras, Alakazam, Slowpoke, and Meowth.</td><td data-align="center">x36 Wonder Hourglass<br>x12 Pack Hourglass<br>x10 Shop Tickets</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Genetic Apex Museum 2 (Mewtwo)</td><td data-align="center">Collect full art cards of Bulbasaur, Cubone, Golbat, Weezing, Dragonite, Pidgeot, Ditto, and Porygon.</td><td data-align="center">x36 Wonder Hourglass<br>x12 Pack Hourglass<br>x10 Shop Tickets</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Genetic Apex Museum 3 (Pikachu)</td><td data-align="center">Collect full art cards of Squirtle, Gyarados, Electrode, Diglett, Nidoqueen, Nidoking, Eevee, and Snorlax.</td><td data-align="center">x36 Wonder Hourglass<br>x12 Pack Hourglass<br>x10 Shop Tickets</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">The Gym Leaders of the Kanto Region 2</td><td data-align="center">Collect full art cards of Brock, Misty, Lt.

<p>As you can see, these missions must be swiftly cleared. You get some of Pokémon TCG Pocket’s best cards, but you also get much-needed consumables: <strong>Hourglasses and Shop Tickets</strong>.</p>

            <p>Five years is a milestone lifespan for any game, especially a live service title, so how does <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> continue to evolve and keep up with an ever-changing, ever-competitive space? Recently, I had the opportunity to speak to several of the development team about this new mode and the history of the Apex games so far, as well as discussing the new limited-time Launch Royale mode that takes you back to the very beginning to round off 2024.</p>
<p>"We've changed the game a lot since launch," design director Evan Nikolich told me. "Season 20 last February was a big change to the armour work, the pick ups and other things. It came around 'what would it feel like if we went back? What's the difference between the game we play today and the new game?" When asked why now was the right time to release Launch Royale, Nikolich said that it was now a good time for reflection on how far Apex had come. "It was a good time to show how much we've changed and evolved, and to celebrate our history. As we close out the year and head into another anniversary season there will be more change, so why not look back and reflect a little bit?"</p>
<p>Launch Royale is a limited-time mode that takes you back to the original Kings Canyon map almost exactly as it was when Apex Legends exploded overnight after shadow-dropping in 2019. This includes the first eight Legends as they were back then (no upgrades, plus their first sets of abilities) and original weapons that all worked together to mark the start of the Apex games.  Even the mode's teaser trailer, dropped on X the day of the new season launch, was an intentional callback to the first season's shadow drop.</p>

<p>Depending on when you first dove into the Apex games, Kings Canyon's original format may well be one you're fond of (as I am myself). It's been a long time since the original has been actively playable, but are there any new map secrets for players to look out for? Mode and Events lead Mike Button suggested the introduction of fresh Easter eggs had to balance bringing back a map fans were familiar with.</p><p>"You should see all the things you remember from the OG map, but it's not a full rebuild," Button told me. "We went back, with everything we could pull and dust off from that time." Kings Canyon has had a number of iterations over the years so it's worth noting that this version isn't the pure original build of this map, as some issues needed to be resolved by the map team to bring it to today's quality standards. "It should be as remembered," Button continued, "so if there were secrets in that OG map that people remember fondly, head into the map and search them out!" For me, after numerous evenings spent diving into this mode back in the day, the map is definitely how I remember - and even some older, playful strategies still work like sniping from the skeleton laying around Skull town.</p>

<p>Launch Royale as a mode has been an idea for a while, the team said, but Season 23 provided the best opportunity to bring it to life as its themes aligned for the game's Events team to finally bring it to life. As someone who was there for the original season, the goosebumps that crawled up my spine during my first match reminded me of just how important Kings Canyon was and is for Apex. Was it an easy job for the game's team to ensure their work still captured that same feeling now?</p>
<p>"It took time," Button said. "You want to get it right, especially something like this where there's a lot of nostalgia and you want to match people's memories. Some things we thought would be easy were super hard and some things we thought would be hard were easy, it was figuring it out to make it happen.'</p><p>Kevin Wolski, Senior Technical Game Designer, was part of the team that put together Launch Royale and was surprised how easy some parts were to bring back, including the weapons that ended up being the easiest to bring back to their original designs. Part of this was made easier by Respawn delving into an archive of game data that helped remind the team how specific things functioned back then. The Legends themselves, however, were harder to bring back, Wolski said, as they've evolved a lot more.</p>
<p>"For example, Lifeline's Revive Shield is something we had to dig up and make work again because her revive Drone ability has changed so many times," he noted. "It was a super fun process to dig all this stuff [up] and find 'can we even make Lifeline's Revival Shield work again? Do we even have these things left over? It was kind of like an archeological dig in certain ways."</p>

<p>It's not an exaggeration to say that the original Kings Canyon map was and is still an extremely important map for Apex, as it's where everything began. "Original Apex was taking a lot of old and existing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a> spaces, stitching them together and getting the original Kings Canyon put together as quickly as possible," Nikolich said, highlighting that lessons were rapidly learned from this process.</p><p>The team quickly learned that stitched together deathmatch maps created high elevation points and 'death bowls', as Nikolich likes to call them. Lessons learned from this can be seen reflected in later maps, such as World's Edge and Olympus. "We've seen with Storm Point the ultimate compounding of the live game community but also our hyper competitive community as well," he said.</p>
<p>As a regular Apex player, its five years and 23 seasons have flown by. But for the team, each new update has provided plenty of lessons, not least from developing the continuously-evolving game in such a competitive field, and doing so while also maintaining a large player base. "We've definitely had some wins," Nikolich said, highlighting how important listening to the player base and aligning their taste with your own on the development side had been.  "The big one is that you've got to listen to the players," Nikolich continued. "As we've grown, being able to engage with players and get really good at listening to them is still something we're learning how to do every day as not everything hits all the time. So, we keep working on it."</p>

<p>A big example of how community feedback has helped evolve Apex and shape it into its current iteration is its Ranked mode. "[There have been] lots of lessons learned there and I think we're aligned, we're getting there," Nikolich said. "We've tried to be very responsive to the ranked changes, we've been on quite a journey with that. We're right on the forefront of 'what does it mean to be a ranked competitive game?'. We're not a Counter-strike or a Valorant where it's just two teams, so we've been on that journey for a while and [we're]  definitely trying to listen to the players [about things like] placements vs kills, combat and what does it mean to be a good ranked competitive Apex player?"</p><p>"When we've been out this long and been making so many changes, we can't be scared anymore," lead battle royale designer Eric Canavese said. "Nothing is sacred, challenge the status quo. What worked five years ago might not be working now. It's always looking internally at what we've done and always trying to push to greater heights. Sometimes that means making incredible risky changes and seeing how the player base likes or dislikes it. Then responding to the feedback they're giving us."</p>
<p>"This season and last season were showing that we're not scared to make even more rapid changes than we've done in the past," Canavese continued. An example of this is the reworked Lifeline that's dropped this season with multiple new abilities including gliding with the DOC drone and the introduction of Rift Relics as special ground loot coming from cosmic rifts littering the skies. "Even now we're continuing to learn and evolve, I'm really excited for the future and what that mentality will net us as we move forward," he teased.</p>

<p>Season 23 introduced the second rework of a Legend, with big changes to Lifeline. As well as a new base look (AJ is rocking the purple hair) her abilities also got an overhaul. "We've had a lot of safe changes we used to make in the past to try and make sure we keep things balanced," lead Legend designer Devin McGuire told me. "But they didn't hit with excitement or fervour, and characters fell under the radar when they were launched." Rampart's launch in Season 6 was one such example of this, which didn't land with fans despite care given to try and balance how powerful her Amped Cover Tactical would be. "We've been taking steps to be a less conservative with our changes to allow Legends to shine, to find the spots that hit with players and then peel them back into their rightful spot," McGuire said.</p><p>"Fast forward to something like Lifeline, back in the day we never would have considered adding a secondary passive that was also a movement ability," he continued, referring to her new ability to glide with DOC. "But the game has changed, it's evolved, sped up - people are more skilled and are evolving with the way the game has. Taking those risks for something that is fun and helps drive combat is something we have learned through this experience. We're now less afraid to do [this] because we know how to tune changes back if they get out of hand by knowing how movement abilities affect the game."</p>
<p>With a current roster of 26 Legends, it's hard to think that there are still places for the design team to go when bringing in new characters, but Devan suggested there are almost limitless possibilities when it comes to creating new ways to fight. "There are still areas we want to explore, there are more areas in the Recon space and the Control space of how to handle the field which isn't just putting down a big area you can't get through - we're actively looking there for opportunities. "Skirmishers and Assault characters are things that come naturally to us - anything that has movement on it is naturally a fun thing in Apex and there are lots of different ways to express movement that can lead to an ability or character's identity." Still, with such a large character roster, it takes longer to develop a unique take. "It takes us more time to find and carve out that niche amidst the cast already while not stomping on others toes or that's done better in that space already," McGuire concluded.</p>
<p>Where would the Legends be without their weapons in the Apex arena? Dead probably. But for the game's team, the same concerns apply when adding new guns, or revamping old favourites. "We have to be very careful about making sure that any addition is providing interesting new gameplay, that it's not another version of a gun we've already got," Canavese said. "We take it really seriously when adding content and that's why you may have noticed we've slowed down a bit on the weapons, because now we've got a healthy roster and we like the ecosystem it has given us.</p>
<p>That's not to say that further changes aren't possible, however. "Weapons that are still close to the same version of their former selves that I certainly want to look at are things like the Volt," he continued. "It's one of those great weapons that does what it does and does it well, but I think there's more we can do with it - we just don't know what that is yet." That promise of more seems to run throughout Apex Legends which, five years in, has plenty of life in it still.</p>

			<p>If you're trying to decide whether you should be playing Baldur's Gate 3 on PlayStation 5 or PC and are feeling a little bit daunted by the specification requirements on PC, don't panic. It's been tested and confirmed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-baldurs-gate-3-on-ps5-is-effectively-the-pc-version-at-ultra-settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those over at Eurogamer</a> that the settings on PlayStation 5 are essentially the same as the settings on PC if you were to play it on Ultra. Of course, many people are unable to do so, as the game is very graphically intensive, the world is expansive, and there are lots of visual effects that you need to contend with. Baldur's Gate 3 has been out on PC for quite a while, and since the start of its release, there have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-now-available-for-mac-and-consoles/">a number of fixes</a> to work on making the performance of the game better for rigs of all capabilities. While there was some concern about how Baldur's Gate 3 would run on PC, it's been confirmed that it runs fine in Act Three, but it suffers some of the same issues that the PC version does.</p>
<p>While the game is very obviously tailored with a Keyboard and Mouse in mind, the game works just fine with a controller on both PS5 and PC. At the start of the game, it's quite tolerable, and although it looks a little bit odd, it works. However, the more abilities and items you unlock and use, the more complicated your radial menus will get, which can make the interface incredibly overwhelming.</p>
<p>Although this doesn't really affect the performance of the game on PS5 in any way, it does make it a little bit more finicky to work with. Visually, the PS5 version is very similar to that on PC, and it looks almost the same as how it would if the game was being played on PC in ultra settings. Compared to other games on the console, this comes as quite a surprise. As explained in the article by Eurogamer, there are only two options available for image quality on the PS5, with the game being native to 1440p, with no signs of reconstruction or dynamic resolution. If you're unsure whether you should be playing the game in Quality or Performance mode, it doesn't really make much difference.</p>
<p>The Performance mode on PS5 looks very similar to the Quality Mode, but there is a little bit of artifacting and fizzing artifacts in areas that feature a lot of fine detail. This is to be expected, especially considering how they've tried to keep the game running at the highest quality.</p>
<p>When it comes to the performance of the game, the Performance mode of Baldur's Gate 3 on PS5 targets 60fps. For the vast majority, it does do just that, especially if you're inside or in enclosed spaces, even during combat. However, there are some areas that will start to struggle. Even on PC, the city in Act 3 struggles massively, so it's not a surprise that it struggles on the PS5, too. From the tests that Eurogamer ran, it seems that the performance drops to the low twenties when it's at its worst. They've also mentioned that there is a fair amount of screen tearing when the frame rate starts to dip from 60. There is, of course, the option to play the game using the Quality Mode, which easily sees Baldur's Gate 3 run at a target of 30fps. Regardless of being in Quality Mode, you will still see some issues in Act 3, with how densely populated the city is.</p>
<p>Overall, Baldur's Gate 3 has been confirmed by many to run fine on PS5, as long as you can get over the radial menus and get used to how janky they become later on down the line.</p>
