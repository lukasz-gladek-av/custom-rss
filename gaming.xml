		<p>Happy Friday! Once again we’ve made it to the end of the week, and before we relax into the welcoming arms of the weekend, we’re going to have a think about what’s been keeping our controllers busy over the last seven days. I’ve mostly played Metaphor ReFantazio – it’s very good – as well as a spot of Fera: The Sundered Tribes and my usual Overwatch 2.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing Sky Oceans Wings for Hire for review, and we’ll find out what he thinks next week. Also he’s been playing Football Manager 24 where he’s had quite an interesting career. He tells us, I started at Man United, got sacked, hired by Nottingham Forest after they were relegated from the Premier League and got them back into the Prem in my first season, and then they performed poorly so I left before getting sacked. Now close to being at Valencia for 2 years. In my first year I got them into the Europa Conference league, 2 years ahead of the Board’s schedule, and this season I’m challenging for the Champions League. I have a 30-year-old Dominic Calvert Lewin to thank for that who is a goal machine, and I bet Tottenham regret letting me nab him for free!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile,<strong> Nic B</strong> played what he’s called IndiUncharted Wars: A New Franchise. By which I think he means Unknown 9: Awakening. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/unknown-9-awakening-review/">You can find out what he thinks right now</a>! <strong>Ade</strong> has been playing Neva for review, the new game from the makers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/12/13/gris-review/">Gris</a>, and a bit more Skull and Bones and Mario Odyssey – what a wild crossover!</p>
<p><strong>Nick P’s</strong> week has been dominated by the excellent Silent Hill 2 and a bit of Vision of Mana, while <strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing Diablo IV latest expansion and season, as well as Vendetta Forever for review, <em>and</em> Sonic x Shadow Generations. Also, he tried Two Point Academy last night because he’s wanted to play it for ages and it went onto PS+ on Tuesday. He says it’s good!</p>

<p>In real-world gaming he also made a level 5 Elf Blood Hunter who can turn into a hybrid werewolf for Halloween D&amp;D, telling us, “I’m quite excited about that!”</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> has hit the point of no return in Cyberpunk 2077 and, rather predictably, he’s used this as a signal to go and do a load of side quests instead of barrelling down the golden path. He’s also been playing New World: Aeternum, Amazon’s MMO relaunch which is out now on PC and consoles. He says, “Obviously, it’s changed a lot since I dipped my toes in the beta version several years ago with a ton of new and refined features. I’m currently playing as a Mystic (healers will forever be my go-to class in MMOs) and I’m enjoying my time in the starting area.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> finished up with the superb Silent Hill 2 (he will be going back for replays soon) and immediately followed it up with a batch of Halloween spooky demos in the Steam Next Fest. It’s not all scary stuff though, as he says, “To balance the frights and fears I’ve been playing the fun Nikoderiko – a very Crash Bandicoot-influenced platformer that first came to my attention through YouTube ads of all things. Finally I started the lovely Snufkin game on Switch and look forward to some cozy evenings spent with the Moomins and a warm mug of cocoa over the winter months”.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub’s</strong> week has consisted of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/arizona-sunshine-remake-review/">Arizona Sunshine Remake</a>, Destiny 2, and Diablo IV which he’s unfortunately finding rather boring. Oh well, back to Destiny 2 then?</p>
<p>He was joined in Arizona Sunshine Remake by <strong>Tef</strong>, who also visited the original game to see just how much has changed – spoilers: <a href="https://youtu.be/gM9UPrBeUkI">a hell of a lot</a>! He also wrapped up our review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/super-mario-party-jamboree-review/">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, and got to spend some time with a little indie [<em>sic</em>] game that you’ll hear about in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-1-02-performance-improvements/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Final Fantasy XVI PC update went live a few hours ago, introducing new graphics settings, enhanced performance and several other improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>The 1.02 update introduces, besides a cursor lock option and improved help text for Photo Mode, and improvements for Shadow Quality settings, which now include cloud quality at all three levels instead of leaving the cloud quality always at high. This should bring performance improvements when selecting medium or low. Graphical Fidelity settings have also been changed to improve overall performance.</p>
<p>The new Final Fantasy XVI update also introduces fixes for aspect ratios other than 16:9, graphics not displaying correctly in certain scenarios, crashing issues on select hardware configurations, and more. The full update notes can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2515020/view/4545912721046242416?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">review of last year's PS5 release.</a></p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XVI heralds in a new standard for Japanese role-playing games and while the RPG components themselves are limited by Square-Enix standards, it's the narrative and gameplay that exceed all expectations. What begins with kingdom-wide subterfuge and destruction ends with a world forever changed and the player, as Clive Rosfield and Ifrit together, are the driving force to see it all through until the end.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gone-home-studio-fullbright-are-now-making-games-about-horrible-toilet-spiders.1013274/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gone-home-studio-fullbright-are-now-making-games-about-horrible-toilet-spiders<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
You probably still know Fullbright as the studio behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gone-home">Gone Home</a>, a delicately experimental first-person yarn about a girl exploring her family home after travelling overseas, and learning about the turmoil in her absence. Picture that game in your mind: the quietness of the hallways versus the crash of a thunderstorm outside, the sickly-sweet 90s décor, the fairy lights and screwed-up balls of paper, the gentle amber pressure of cloistered teenage memories. Now, imagine a faint scuttling behind the skirting boards. A rattling in the pipes. Was there a toilet in Gone Home's autumnal mansion? I can't recall, but you should probably steer clear.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Now available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3098700/Fullbright_Presents_TOILET_SPIDERS/">Steam</a>, Toilet Spiders is the first in a new anthology series of "short, strange, lo-fi games", gathered under the label Fullbright Presents. To crib unceremoniously from the Steam blurb, it's "a short, replayable lo-fi first-person survival horror game where you must learn to judge your odds and manage your resources to avoid or scare off the giant radioactive spiders laying in wait inside filthy toilets that contain the keys and items you need to complete your mission and escape with your life." 
</p>
<p>
The game takes place in some kind of Exclusion Zone, with you playing a nameless "volunteer" sent by an evidently tyrannous regime, and the map is broken into several floors. "Scavenged items like old light bulbs, surplus flash grenades, and lucky coins will aid you on your mission, but their numbers are precious few," the Steam page continues. "You must learn how best to weigh your odds and make your own luck if you want to live."</p>
<p>Personally, I think the game has missed a trick by not including some kind of pooping mechanic, because as every arachnophobe knows, the real terror of the hypothetical toilet spider is realising you forgot to check the bowl before plonking yourself down. Mind you, you can always increase the intensity by downloading on Steam Deck and playing it while riding the porcelain express.
</p><p>
Fullbright's games have always contained the suggestion of horror, of course. Gone Home plays with your expectations a bit, dangling the red herring of supernatural activity only to swap it for the, er, emerald pilchard of it all being a metaphor for closeted emotions. Fullbright's subsequent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tacoma">Tacoma</a> makes that more overt, being set aboard a space station haunted by holograms. Still, I'm impressed at the speed with which Fullbright have transited from "psychological motif" to "literal atomic arachnid gnawing my face off". Could the giant spiders be a metaphor for something as well? I wouldn't be surprised if the game's B-movie stylings were another red herring.
</p>
<p>
The less-fun context for all this is that Fullbright aren't the same Fullbright who made Gone Home or Tacoma. Back in 2021, co-founder Steve Gaynor was accused of mistreating staff and creating a toxic workplace by several former employees. Gaynor subsequently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gone-home-studio-co-founder-steps-down-following-allegations-of-toxic-workplace-culture">stepped back from his role</a> on the company's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/open-roads-review">"short but bittersweet"</a> fable Open Roads, and parted ways with the development team, who became a separate entity.</p>
<p>As of September 2023, Gaynor was Fullbright's sole remaining employee. I think Toilet Spiders is mostly his work. It is... dangerously easy to read Toilet Spiders as some kind of commentary on the events above, and on Gaynor's state of mind since. Don't let that stop you, though.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and Persona director Katsura Hashino has said he avoids reading fan feedback to protect his mental health.</p>
<p>Hashino discussed the topic of fan feedback with Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama in <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202410/20753">Famitsu</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/metaphor-refantazio-and-persona-director-katsura-hashino-keeps-his-distance-from-user-feedback-to-spare-his-mental-health/">Automaton</a>), but the two creators had opposing views on the matter.</p>
<p>Hashino said he "tries not to be that conscious of" fan feedback and aims to keep some distance.</p>

<p>"Of course, I do check things out at certain times, such as right after launch," he said. "But it's not like I can adjust [the game] based on what I see. When I need to look something up, I do it quickly in one go, because constantly looking at reactions isn't good for your mental health."</p>
<p>He added that he doesn't look up his own name online, or use social media.</p>
<p>Toyama, who is busy developing the forthcoming Slitterhead, said his attitude towards user feedback is changing over time. Though he was dismissive in the past, he is now keen on actively listening to fans online and adopting opinions he finds useful - that's despite Slitterhead not being a live-service game that needs to be tuned in response to player demands.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio has certainly received praise from fans and critics alike. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-surpasses-1m-sales-on-launch-day-to-become-fastest-selling-atlus-game">sold 1m copies on launch day</a> to become the fastest-selling Atlus game.</p>
<p>Hashino has also spoken about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazios-lord-of-the-rings-influence-thrown-out-as-originality-defines-atlus-says-director">the influence of traditional fantasy on the game</a> and how this was thrown out in favour of focusing on the originality that "defines" Atlus' games.</p>
<p>Slitterhead, from Bokeh Studio, is set for release next month and lets players inhabit the bodies of various people - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterhead-really-wants-you-to-know-you-can-play-as-a-dog">even a dog</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Fullbright, the studio behind the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gone-home">Gone Home</a> and Tacoma, has released its next game in early access.</p>
<p>With very little, if any, fanfare, yesterday the developer surprise dropped Toilet Spiders on Steam. The game is said to feature a "lo-fi hell world of giant spiders jumping out of toilets onto your face".</p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3098700/old_view/4520017023190305114">Steam</a>, solo developer Steve Gaynor said he had started an "ongoing series of small, strange, lo-fi games" which would be released in early access, as part of a 'Fullbright Presents' push. And, Toilet Spiders is one of these games.</p><p>"This isn't a super-rough alpha early access launch either, the game is actually a pretty polished version of itself," Gaynor wrote. "There's a little more in the way of features and content to add, balance to improve, and bugs you'll help me find that I'll need to fix, but really at its heart this is the game as it's intended to be played."</p>
<p>Gaynor's young daughter, Juniper, gave him the idea for Toilet Spiders. Apparently, one day she asked about a spider jumping out from the loo and scaring her grandma. "And of course my immediate response was, well I could make a video game out of that," Gaynor explained, and now we have Toilet Spiders (with credit to Juniper, of course).</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Fullbright</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"The idea for the game ended up aligning with a number of other conceptual items I'd been wanting to play with: a game set in an abandoned research facility, a straight-up horror game, a game about managing your resources and tilting the odds inspired by the brilliant <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2835570/Buckshot_Roulette/?snr=1_2108_9__2107">Buckshot Roulette</a>. And so, for better or worse, TOILET SPIDERS was born."</p><p>Gaynor added a few amusing review quotes to his post, proclaiming that Toilet Spiders is "what Psycho did for showers..." and "Jaws did for the ocean". So, will you be able to look at your toilet the same way again?</p>
<p>If you are interested, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3098700/Fullbright_Presents_TOILET_SPIDERS/">Toilet Spiders is available on Steam</a>, for less than £5.
</p>
<p>As for Fullbright's previous games, we were quite taken with Gone Home, calling it a "triumphant exploration of a beautifully textured family space" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gone-home-console-review">Eurogamer's review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Remedy Entertainment confirmed that<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/alan-wake-2"> Alan Wake 2’s</a> second expansion, The Lake House, will arrive for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC next week on 22nd October. This DLC will go even deeper into the scares of the horror universe, as made clear by the new gameplay trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2: The Lake House - Launch Trailer | Xbox Partner Preview October 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/591RFRnhNEY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Similar to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/07/alan-wake-2s-night-springs-dlc-looks-amazing/">the Night Springs DLC</a> earlier this year, The Lake House looks to bleed together the Remedy Connected Universe even further. There’s deeper ties back to the FBC as a newly playable character emerges in response to the new AWE event &nbsp;at the titular Lake House.</p>
<p>FBC Agent Estevez heads to the Lake House research station at Cauldron Lake, a standalone story that can happily exist alongside the spiralling tale of the main game. It runs parallel to the earlier part of Saga’s side of Alan Wake 2 as Estevez deals with an Overlap.</p>
<p>In particular, there’s a mysterious living painting that is spewing out fresh horrors to deal with. Thankfully, while she doesn’t have any paranatural abilities of her own, Estevez is equipped with both a standard issue firearm and an FBC-specific weapon specifically for taking on paranatural entities.</p>

<p>While Night Springs was a bunch of standalone ‘What If?’ episodes, The Lake House is a more contiguous world to explore and try to survive – it’s more survival horror.</p>
<p>Accessing the expansion, The Lake House will be playable from the main menu, but it’s also (much like with the Night Springs expansion) slotted in with the main campaign if you want to play through the whole lot. This will have you bouncing back and forth between the menagerie of characters and experiences.</p>
<p>Looking back on the original release, Alan Wake 2 was one of the best games of last year.</p>
<p>“Just as it gives equal screen time to its two protagonists, Alan Wake 2 is a fine blend of equal parts narrative and survival horror,” said Nick in our<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/26/alan-wake-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 10/10 review of Alan Wake 2.</a> “Both aspects are brought together in brilliant fashion to create a game that is going to mess with your head, scare the hell out of you and make you grin about it as you plunge forward once more, eager to see what’s next.”</p>
<p>This wasn’t the only Remedy news from the Xbox Partner Direct, with the studio also revealing their online co-op Control spin-off, now called <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/fbc-firebreak-brings-three-player-co-op-to-the-federal-bureau-of-control/">FBC: Firebreak</a>.</p>

<p>I’m not sure about you, but I’ll put up with even the most mediocre of shooters for the sake of FMV ghosts that excellently terrible. Also, shout out to the last-second Halloween costume housemaids that just walk right up to you with a fresh knuckle sandwich, despite you very much holding a shotgun.</p>
<p>“Journey into a mansion on the Island of Matinicus where you'll arrive to find the mansion full of hellacious demonic creatures,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1733170/Killing_Time_Resurrected/?curator_clanid=5644295">reads the Steam page</a>. “Solve deadly puzzles, uncover the secrets behind a famous mystery and discover an ancient artifact from the Pharaoh Ramses, if you can live long enough to find it.”</p>
<p>There are also some ‘key features’ further down the page. Well, I have to tell you about those. They’re key!</p>
<blockquote><p>• Immerse Yourself in 4K Resolution, 144 FPS, Anti-Aliasing and Upgraded/New 2D Screens and Menu art.</p>
<p>• Face off against enemies from both 3DO and PC for the first time, utilizing weapons that were once exclusive to each version.</p>
<p>• Experience and interact with otherworldly apparitions through a collection of over 50 live-action video sequences. These restored specters offer vital clues about the horrific events that once occurred in the cursed Conway mansion. Do you have what it takes to survive and uncover the mystery?</p>
<p>• Enjoy a full 360 view, allowing you to look up, down, and all around. The three-dimensional island features both indoor and outdoor areas, brimming with intricate details that capture the essence of the haunting and distinctive 1930s atmosphere.</p>
<p>• Explore over 45 killing zones with hundreds of enemies and rooms sprawling across the vast estate.</p>
<p>• Discover at your own risk unearthed cut content, including the pool house, shipwreck and a variety of ancient artifacts.</p>
<p>• A fright-fest for the true aficionado of first-person corridor mayhem, enjoy continuous gameplay with no load time between areas, and much more!</p></blockquote>
<p>I was curious about this one’s history, so I flew <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Time_(video_game)#Release">to Wikipedia</a> and found out two interesting facts. Firstly, the game originally shipped on a red disc, which featured a bug where “the screen (became) pixelated and obscure(d) the view” of an entire stage. The 3DO Company, who published the game, offered to replace any copies mailed to them, but very few people apparently took them up on it. As such, the black replacement discs are now very rare.</p>
<p>The second fact is that Killing Time was, hold on to your chairs, number two in GamesMaster’s 1996 list of best 3DO games. Here’s the full list:</p>

            <p>Bloober Team have announced their next horror game at last night's Xbox Partner Preview showcase. It's called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> and it's about - bear with me here - going to the past, harvesting souls, then going to the future so they can help you. It's all because you are, um, wanting to find a special rift in the <em>future</em>, so you can go back to a special version of the past. I think. Anyway yeah, it looks kinda fine to good.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Cronos is set in a "grim world", based on Eastern European brutalism and mixed with some "retro-futurist technology". From the looks of the trailer, you play as the Commando from Risk Of Rain, who's seemingly joined the Collective, a time-hopping organisation that wants to plumb the future for ways to return to "1980s era Poland".</p>

<p>Now, parts of the game take place in the past, which is undergoing The Change: a cataclysmic event of some description. And when you pop into the future, you'll see its results, having created a world ravaged by horrible, skittering demons.</p><p>In the trailer, you see Commando play speed chess with an old lady, before the Commando goes Edward Scissorhands and, presumably, harvests her brain. This is because you'll need to bring people from the past into the future to help you discover these rifts and survive, although we don't know much more. Otherwise, most surviving and surveying looks to be done with your trusty sidearm, from a typically over-the-shoulder Resi perspective.</p>
<p>And that's your lot. I will say that off rip, Cronos gives me proper double A energy and I think that's a good thing. It has the sort of name that immediately conjures up a 7/10, where it'll be a bit janky but have some interesting ideas and a fun gimmick.</p>
<p>You can find the game over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101960/Cronos_The_New_Dawn/">Steam</a> and it's due out sometime next year. Also, it isn't affiliated with Chronos From The Ashes, a middling Soulslike I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/chronos-before-the-ashes-review">reviewed</a> not long after I joined RPS and has such a similar name that I keep getting them muddled in my noggin.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Yakuza developer RGG and publisher Sega announced a new release date for Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii last night, during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-microsofts-xbox-partner-preview-october-2024">Microsoft's October Xbox Partner Preview</a> event. Now, we know why.</p>
<p>The upcoming pirate-centric game was originally planned for release on 28th February. But, that date is no longer, for two reasons. The first, "because development is progressing more smoothly than expected," RGG said.</p>
<p>And the second? It's because the team wanted us all to "be able to play the game that comes after it, with peace of mind".</p>

<p>While RGG didn't name names, a quick look at 2025's release calendar shows a clash between Pirate Yakuza's previous date and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-out-february-next-year">launch of Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, which is also set for 28th February.</p>
<p>As such, Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii will now make its debut a week earlier, to 21st February.</p>
<p>"I would like to take the opportunity to thank everyone involved," RGG studio director Masayoshi Yokoyamasaid said while announcing this revised release date. The developer noted Sega had been supportive of the studio's decision.</p>

Images featuring the likes of Shrek and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a> protagonist Carl Johnson have managed to find their way into the PC version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</a>, thanks to an exploit in its Custom Battle mode.
</p>
<p>
Custom Battle mode allows players to craft their own unique stories in-game, using any of the 182 available characters on the roster. (To be clear: this roster does not include Shrek or CJ.) These stories can then be uploaded to Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero's World Library, allowing other players to access, like and even share any of the Custom Battles that end up being featured.

This mode should only allow players to create battles using the assets and tools that Sparking Zero provides, but some people have found a way to circumvent these restrictions through the use of mods. 
</p>
<p>
The images you attach to your Custom Battles can only be taken using the game's 'Thumbnail' function, which allows players to take an in-game screenshot. While this limits the images you take to ones captured in-game, it does not account for PC players being able to include replace the game's original character models using mods.

<p>
Take, for example, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonballsparkingzero/mods/25">GOKU DRIP on all Goku</a> mod, which gives the character some snazzy new clothes. Sparking Zero won't realise anything is amiss when uploading a screenshot of it to the World Library servers. 
</p>
<p>
The same is true of the CJ mod, which I spotted in an image for a Custom Battle earlier this week. It does seem Bandai Namco is aware of the issue though, as this Custom Battle has since been pulled - although I've now seen other unauthorised images already started popping up in its place.

<p>
Some of these are completely innocent in nature, such as one that features Goku wearing his costume from the Dragon Ball Super: Broly movie, or another that has a thumbnail of Super Saiyan 4 Broly (neither of which are available in Sparking Zero).
</p><p>
But, of course, there are less wholesome examples. I came across an image that featured Shrek battling a couple of women from the anime "Uma Musume Pretty Derby", including a shot that showed one of the women's underwear. There's further potential for misuse here, too, as there are already a few different Sparking! Zero nude character mods. It only takes one idiot to upload a screenshot of one of these X-rated offerings for Bandai Namco to find itself in truly hot water (the game has a PEGI rating of 12).
</p>
<p>
At least, if the disappearing example of CJ is anything to go by, Bandai Namco is aware of the potential issue - even if there's no permanent yet fix for the exploit itself. We've contacted Bandai Namco for more, and to find out if a patch is in the works. Perhaps the publisher can even nerf the Afterimage Strike skill while its at it.
</p>
<p>
"Sparking! Zero is everything Dragon Ball fans will have wanted, but it's also just a blast for those unbothered by its extensive fan-service," Lewis Parker wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Eurogamer's Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero review</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel%E2%80%99s-wolverine-might-be-shown-soon-according-to-leaker.1013199/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-might-be-shown-soon-according-to-leaker/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been over three years since Insomniac Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniacs-wolverine-announced-for-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that it was developing Marvel's Wolverine, a game dedicated to James 'Logan' Howlett, the most beloved X-Men, for PlayStation 5. Back then, the studio said the project was in early development, but we've waited long enough that fans are getting antsy.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1847057694894522819" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to leaker Kurakasis</a>, that might change soon enough, as Insomniac is preparing to show off Marvel's Wolverine to the public. Kurakasis said they're unsure whether it will be at The Game Awards or at some other event, but it should happen before the end of the year. That would make sense if they are planning to release the game at some point in 2025.</p>
<p>As you might recall, Insomniac Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-hacked-by-a-ransomware-attack-data-surrounding-marvels-wolverine-surfaces-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered a major hack in December 2023</a>, leading to the leak of a lot of data on its projects, including Wolverine. It is presently unclear whether this translated into a delay for the project. Interestingly, while sifting through the leaked data from the hack, someone <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-might-feature-co-op-according-to-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> a string seemingly related to cooperative multiplayer, which would be a peculiar addition. Logan is notoriously a lone wolf, but this side of his character could be worth exploring from a narrative standpoint should the game indeed offer some sort of cooperative action between him and some other Marvel character.</p>
<p>In any case, let's recap the little we know for sure about Marvel's Wolverine. It will be an original and self-contained story; however, it is very much set in the same Marvel universe created by Insomniac for the Spider-Man games. Whether Peter Parker and/or Miles Morales appear in Wolverine is, of course, still a mystery.</p>
<p>The game is being directed by Brian Horton and Cameron Christian, who worked side by side on Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. The writers are Mary Kenney, who co-wrote Miles Morales with Ben Arfmann, and Walt Williams and Nick Folkman, who wrote Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</p>
<p>Marvel's Wolverine will be released exclusively on PlayStation 5, although Sony's new PC strategy suggests the game will reach the PC shoes within a couple of years from its release on console.</p>

            <p>Genre tags are slippery, fickle things at the best of times, but I feel like each one I use to label <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dunebound-tactics">Dunebound Tactics</a> almost diminishes it, as I’m sacrificing something precious for the sake of powering on through the arid sands of easily comestible, digestible, poop-estible online content. Ah well, circle of life and all that. Plus, at least it’s thematic: you’ll have to make sacrifices yourself if you want to progress across its unforgiving deserts. This one’s got shades of roguelite, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, strategy, and turn-based tactics. Nothing too uncommon, but it’s the shades of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-faction">Red Faction</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sunless-sea">Sunless Sea</a> that have me interested.</p>

<p>"Lead your band of survivors on a perilous trek across unforgiving sands in search of a new home," reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3034660/Dunebound_Tactics/">the Steam page</a>. “Battle ruthless factions, scavenge dwindling resources, reshape the terrain to your advantage and make life-or-death choices.” It’s that terrain bit that first caught my attention. As you can see from the trailer, battlefields are blown up and reshaped as you play. I’m well up for new threats and opportunities being introduced as fights progress, rather than just being allowed to sit pretty behind a sturdy dustbin.</p>
<p>"Manipulate a fully destructible and reshapable terrain to mold the battlefield and seize the advantage. Unleash devastating abilities and devious tricks to outwit your enemies at every turn—this isn’t your typical cover-and-shoot affair, it’s a relentless test of strategy." You hear that? Relentless! Utterly without relent.</p>
<p>But what really looks great here is the way it’s all supposed to tie together. You’ll travel in a steamboat-lookin’ caravan, scavenging for resources and solving story events. Along the way, your crew might get wounded. If you’ve got resources to spare, you can heal them, but your caravan has limited space. So, I dunno, maybe Johnny always-gets-shot accidentally falls into the power generator, fuelling the machinery so you can keep chuffing along? If you fail entirely, elements will carry over to your next run - "either in the form of modules, or potentially even survivors, as you find the previous caravan’s wreck."</p>
<p>This one’s from Terahard, whose previous work includes co-development on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/human-fall-flat">Human Fall Flat</a>, with a release date TBC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/surgent-studios-game-division-redundancies/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/surgent-studios%E2%80%99-game-division-on-notice-for-redundancy-amid-funding-concerns.1013193/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/surgent-studios-game-division-redundancies/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Surgent Studios, the multimedia mind behind the recent Tales of Kenzera: ZAU has just posted on social media a concerning message. It wrote that the games division of the company is being put on hiatus and the team is on notice for redundancy as the future of the studio’s funding is uncertain.</p>



<p>This news comes just north of eight months after Tales of Kenzera: ZAU was released by Surgent.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-comes-next">What Comes Next</h2>



<p>On Twitter, Surgent Studios posted the following message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve decided to put the work of the Surgent games division on hiatus while we secure funding for our next project. In the meantime, we’ve unfortunately had to put our team on notice for redundancy.</p>



<p>Everyone at Surgent worked incredibly hard to create Tales of Kenzera: ZAU – a game that truly comes from the heart. Their passion, creativity, and dedication are nothing short of extraordinary.</p>



<p>There are still a couple of exciting updates coming down the pipeline for ZAU.</p>



<p>But, for now, we have a message:</p>



<p><strong>Our team has created a prototype for a bold new project. It’s darker, edgier, and more visceral than our first game, but it retains all ZAU’s high-octane combat and cultural depth. And we’re looking for a partner.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The post then goes on to direct potential partners to Surgent Studios’ contact page.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tales-of-kenzera-interview-abubakar-salim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I sat down with Abubakar Salim</a>, one of the creative minds that drove the foundation of Surgent Studios and whose own real-world experiences served as the groundwork for the story of ZAU.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time that the studio has been impacted by redundancies. Earlier in the summer, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tales-of-kenzera-zau-studio-hit-with-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Surgent was struck</a> by a wave of layoffs.</p>



<p>It’s unclear at present how many team members could be impacted if these redundancies go ahead.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/mistfall-hunter-is-a-dark-fantasy-soulslike-extraction-rpg-coming-to-pc-and-xbox/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mistfall-hunter-is-a-dark-fantasy-soulslike-extraction-rpg-coming-to-pc-and-xbox.1013166/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mistfall-hunter-is-a-dark-fantasy-soulslike-extraction-rpg-coming-to-pc-and-xbox/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the Xbox Partner Preview that aired yesterday, independent Chinese developer Bellring Games announced Mistfall Hunter, a dark fantasy third-person multiplayer extraction RPG with some rather obvious inspiration from the Soulslike genre.</p>
<p>The game takes place in a setting where there has been an all-out war between Supreme Gods and Outer Gods, resulting in a Ragnarok-like apocalypse. Nearly all the Gods have fallen, and their blood has turned into the Gyldenmist, a corrosive force that swept across the land, warping the souls of the living and driving them to madness and monstrous mutations.</p>
<p>A few humans still remain, seeking refuge in the last remnants of civilization. However, a mysterious girl called Dew has the power to resurrect fallen heroes and give them immortal bodies. These reborn champions, known as the Gylden Hunters, follow her into the heart of danger, battling Gyldenized creatures and harvesting Gyldenblod. Their mission is to mend the shattered Web of Fate and bring the world back from the brink of oblivion.</p>
<p>Mechanically, Mistfall Hunter is described as a third-person action game where aiming is key. Players can master a variety of combos and customize skills to suit their strategy. The game offers different classes, such as the Mercenary, Sorcerer, Blackarrow, and Shadowstrix, each equipped with unique weapons and traits.</p>
<p>Some classes can wield multiple weapons, unlocking entirely new combat styles. Players can then seamlessly switch between weapons to turn the tide of a fight. The RPG elements are ensured with a variety of talents across classes to create powerful builds. Players will collect high-level gear and stack unique modifiers to unlock powerful passive abilities and greatly increase their effectiveness in every battle.</p>
<p>As a Gylden Hunter, you can play solo or team up with up to two friends. The land is rich with precious Gyldenblod and endless loot, but you'll have to go through the fearsome Gyldenized creatures and rival players. As with any extraction game, each battle is a high-stakes gamble, where death means losing everything you've gathered so far, keeping the tension high at all times.</p>

<p>Mistfall Hunter will have its first closed beta playtest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3282300/Mistfall_Hunter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> later this year, and you can sign up for it by completing <a href="https://survey.isnssdk.com/q/66593/65312fF1/0308/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this survey</a>.</p>

			<p>One of the biggest announcements of the October 2024 Xbox Partner Preview is certainly Subnautica 2. Unknown Worlds has revealed the game will launch next year in early access on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/subnautica-2-d27f94" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/subnautica-2/9PJPCB188SVG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Store</a>) and Xbox Series S and X, and it will also be available to Game Pass subscribers from day one.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;<span>publisher KRAFTON previously&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-is-a-multiplayer-sequel-using-game-as-a-service-model-says-krafton-will-be-made-with-ue5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a></span>, the game will support multiplayer for the first time in the franchise. Up to four players will be able to explore the ocean's vast environments together, working together to craft tools, build bases, and face the challenges of a planet filled with beauty and danger.</p>
<p>In this sequel, players will venture to an all-new ocean world that features multiple biomes, from towering underwater cliffs to lush coral fields. Each biome has its own diverse ecosystem and unique creatures. Players will explore a world full of mysterious life forms, from the smallest fish to the largest Leviathans. They will scan creatures to learn more about them and use the Biosampler to collect samples for study. They will even get the chance to evolve their own genetics to better adapt for survival. As a survival game, the series also emphasizes tool usage, and Subnautica 2 will include recipes for more advanced ones. Thanks to an overhauled building system, bases will be more customizable.</p>
<p>PC players can already take a look at the minimum and recommend system requirements below.</p>

<p>We could be getting a new look at Marvel’s Wolverine from Insomniac before the end of the year. According to a claim by <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1847057694894522819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">known inside</a>r Kurakasis, Sony and Insomniac are “gearing up” to show fans more from Wolverine soon.</p>



<p>“From my little digging, it looks like Sony is gearing up to show off some new stuff from Marvel’s Wolverine,” they said. “It’s hard for me to determine when it’ll happen, but I’m guessing it’ll be this year—either at TGA or at some unannounced, super-secret event.”</p>

<p>There has been no confirmation PlayStation or Insomniac that a new look at Wolverine is coming. So, despite the source being accurate in the past, please take the information with a grain of salt until something is announced or Insider Gaming has confirmed its legitimacy.</p>



<p>Insomniac and PlayStation have been quiet regarding Wolverine in an official capacity for some time. The last news players got about the game came via the massive leak that happened in late 2023 and early 2024. At that time early looks at gameplay mechanics made their way online.</p>



<p>There’s been no confirmation of a release date for the game, either. However, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniacs-wolverine-wont-release-until-2025-report-claims/">last rumor from 2023</a> claimed that Wolverine wouldn’t launch until 2025 at the earliest. It will also reportedly have a more dark and violent tone than past Insomniac games.</p>



<p>When do you think we’ll get another trailer for Marvel’s Wolverine? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/gaming-leaks-and-rumors.15/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

The new console is available to preorder now at major retailers ahead of its November 7 release, and the machine features a larger GPU that--according to Sony--allows for up to 45% faster rendering. It also has AI-driven upscaling and advanced ray tracing, so those thousands of creepy rats in the Plague Tale game should look even more horrifying.</p><hr><p>Other game deals to keep an eye out for include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-metaphor-refantazio-on-pc-for-a-discount-at-fanatical/1100-6526977/" data-ref-id="1100-6526977">Metaphor ReFantazio</a>'s launch discount at Fanatical, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-black-ops-6-for-only-50-right-now/1100-6527105/" data-ref-id="1100-6527105">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> for only $50, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-ea-sports-college-football-25-for-only-41-at-amazon-before-its-gone/1100-6526931/" data-ref-id="1100-6526931">EA Sports College Football for just $41</a>.</p><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-kindle-colorsoft-e-ink-color-ereader-comic-books-new-kindle-models-2024/1100-6527202/">Amazon's New Full-Color Kindle Could Be A Game Changer For Comic Books</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-preorder-guide/1100-6524005/">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preorders - Bonuses, Game Pass Deals, Branded Gear, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-this-75-bundle-has-all-you-need-to-play-no-console-or-pc-required/1100-6527064/">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 - This $75 Bundle Has All You Need To Play, No Console Or PC Required</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-gets-official-corsair-gear-call-of-duty-themed-gaming-pc-keyboard-mouse-and-more/1100-6526620/">Black Ops 6 Gets Official Corsair Gear - Call Of Duty-Themed Gaming PC, Keyboard, Mouse, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-nes-is-on-sale-for-20-off-this-week-save-54-while-supplies-last/1100-6526872/">Lego NES Is On Sale For 20% Off This Week - Save $54 While Supplies Last</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-is-already-discounted-but-not-for-long/1100-6527148/">The Legend Of Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom Is Already Discounted, But Not For Long</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorders-live-at-amazon-walmart-and-best-buy/1100-6526406/">PS5 Pro Preorders Live At Amazon, Walmart, And Best Buy</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-xbox-elite-series-2-is-down-to-its-best-price-of-the-year/1100-6527087/">The Xbox Elite Series 2 Is Down To Its Best Price Of The Year At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-remaster-adding-significantly-more-npcs-to-make-towns-feel-more-alive-on-top-of-other-improvements<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Feed the birds.</h2></div><section><p>Horizon: Zero Dawn was developed by Guerrilla Games, and its remaster is being worked on by them as well. But today, the remaster's co-developer Nixxes stepped into the spotlight on the PlayStation blog to highlight a number of improvements we'll see in the remaster, including the addition of lots of new NPCs.</p><p>The post <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/17/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-a-deep-dive-into-its-enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breaks down a number of updates to the game</a>, perhaps the most notable of which is that Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered will "significantly boost the number of non-player characters." This doesn't mean more quests or story, but it does mean that villages and camps will have more folks just wandering around, attending to their business. Brian van Nunen, senior technical game designer at Nixxes, offered more details and what I find to be a delightful example of this:</p><blockquote>Building the game for PS5 allowed us to leverage the increased amount of memory available, enabling us to significantly boost the number of non-player characters," he said. "We added many more places for NPCs to stand, sit, work and fulfil their needs. We gave them more varied schedules to increase movement and liveliness in different areas. We also tried to make creative use of existing animations. For example, there is now a woman feeding geese at the well in Meridian, reusing an existing sowing animation. Additionally, on the bridge to Meridian, we’ve made significant strides in improving the atmosphere and sense of activity.</blockquote><p>Let's hear it for feeding the geese!</p><p>More NPCs isn't the only change players will see. The blog also goes into detail about how foliage is being overhauled to be more dense, realistic, and closer to the original concept art. Terrain, too, is being updated, including snow and sand that actually moves as it's disturbed. This was a feature in the Frozen Wilds expansion, but in the remaster we'll see it elsewhere.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In addition to these improvements, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered benefits from 10 additional hours of motion capture data for various characters, which Nixxes says will make conversations seem livelier and closer to those in Forbidden West. Mark Bazelmans, senior technical artist, has a really fascinating explanation for how all this data was incorporated into the massive game:</p><blockquote>Horizon Zero Dawn has almost 300 conversations and well over 3100 dialog options, so we needed to find a way to easily integrate this huge number of updated animations into the conversations," he said. "We created a tool with Python to process the almost 2500 mocap files that Guerrilla provided to replace the original animation in the conversations, removing deprecated events and replacing those with the mocap and setup.</blockquote><blockquote>We then focused on creating a pipeline in Maya for our animators to easily load, edit and re-export the individual mocap files for any other edits that were needed, such as finger animation, art direction feedback and fixes. Animators could select the conversation and subsequent dialog option from a list which created the scene from scratch, or simply opened it if it already existed. Our tool referenced the characters and imported the dialogue audio, so the animators could time the movement better and create the camera cuts and layout. Later, we extended this pipeline to also include existing animations for both conversations and cinematics, as some of these also required edits. Our animators could then go into Guerrilla’s DECIMA engine and edit or change the updated conversation.</blockquote><p>And there's more. The blog post goes over details to how lighting was improved, both world and cinematic, and how character models were updated to have more detail to hair, skin, and oufits. Aloy has peach fuzz, and apparently you can see it. And while before only Aloy would react to the environment and weather, now both her and her companions will react when it's too hot or cold.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered Screenshots - State of Play September 2024</h3></div></output><p>If you're a sicko for fascinating, in-depth explanation of how game dev works, this blog goes into incredible detail about how some of this stuff works with quotes from a number of Nixxes developers.
