            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-living-things-is-a-stop-motion-artbook-puzzle-game-based-on-a-600-year-old-alchemical-manuscript<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Have you ever immediately wishlisted a game on Steam based on aesthetics alone? I ask because that's just happened to me with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/all-living-things">All Living Things</a>, a stop-motion game inspired by The Ripley Scroll, a 15th-century alchemical manuscript. Doesn't that just seem like a guaranteed feast for the eyes? Developer MOXO self-describes it as an "animated art-book <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game", which feels perfectly apt for it. The general presentation is simple, this strange, alluring art book on a black background waiting for you to click around.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's apparently 12 puzzles to solve in total, "each reflecting a stage in the alchemical process." You have to select certain parts of the art book to set certain sequences in motion, resulting in some wonderfully tactile looking animations. The wild thing is that despite looking like real, hand-made claymation, <a href="https://x.com/stvulture/status/1907275427770400777">it's all been digitally sculpted</a>. You could have fooled me quite easily into believing otherwise if I hadn't confirmed it for myself.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Discover the secrets of alchemical processes, the hidden secrets of world and even deeper secrets hidden within us‚Ä¶</p><p>All Living Things has a steampage, wishlist to be notified for the upcoming early demo!<a href="https://t.co/A68GqHk0o2">https://t.co/A68GqHk0o2</a> <a href="https://t.co/D3xJDSLRI2">pic.twitter.com/D3xJDSLRI2</a></p></div>‚Äî ùñòùñÜùñéùñìùñô ùñõùñöùñëùñôùñöùñóùñä (@stvulture) <a href="https://twitter.com/stvulture/status/1925525849022857381?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
I'm not entirely sure how the puzzles work, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681340/All_Living_Things/">Steam page</a> for the game is suitably vague and cryptic, hinting at how you'll be able to figure it all out but not quite laying things in front of you. There's no release date for the game just yet, not even a release window. That's ok with me, as a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681490/All_Living_Things_Demo/">demo is due out June 10th</a>, meaning it won't be long before I can try and suss out what exactly this strange artbook game wants from me.
</p>
<p>
The thing that appeals most of all to me, outside of its aesthetic sensibilities, is that it's quite plain about there only being 12 puzzles. It really sounds like a game you could just spend your evenings ticking away at, figuring them all out in small doses, with the end quite close in sight. Love a game that knows when to stop, will definitely be checking this one out.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/journey-together-pokemon-card-prices-are-crashing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I wanted <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-etb-amazon-in-stock">Journey Together</a> to hit big. After <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-may-20-2025">Surging Sparks</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-restock-prismatic-evolutions-surprise-boxes-amazon">Prismatic Evolutions</a> delivered some real heat, it felt like we were on a roll. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But instead of a clean three-hit combo, this set tripped over itself on the way out the gate. Prices were inflated from the start, and now that the market has had time to breathe, this correction is aggressive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs still a solid set. Great art, fun pulls, some nostalgic hits. But a lot of the single prices were built on hype that couldn‚Äôt hold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collectors thought we‚Äôd get another round of rapid value climbs. That didn‚Äôt happen. If you're buying now, you're catching cards on the way down instead of riding them on the way up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just go in knowing what‚Äôs worth grabbing and what‚Äôs still floating on leftover launch-day fumes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Illustration Rares</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Articuno had a strong start. Prices hit $55 back in late March, which made sense at the time‚Äîit's a fan-favorite Legendary with great artwork. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, it‚Äôs taken a 36% dip and now floats around $35. Honestly, that‚Äôs still a bit high. I‚Äôve seen near-mint listings at $18.69, and that feels more in line with where this card belongs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think it‚Äôs a solid pickup if you just want a great-looking bird without the early adopter tax.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wailord was one of those early hype Illustration Rares that got pumped fast, mostly because it‚Äôs Wailord and people have a soft spot for absurdly large water types. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It hit $60 at the end of March, which didn‚Äôt last long. It‚Äôs now dropped 63.66% to a market value of around $22.49, and I‚Äôve seen copies listed for as low as $14.55. Personally, I think this one‚Äôs due for a soft bounce back to $30, but only once the panic listings clear out and the Wailord fans circle back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My favorite Illustration Rare is N‚Äôs Reshiram. The artwork is top-tier, and the character pairing actually adds something meaningful to the card. It started at $39.43, which honestly didn‚Äôt feel too far off given the demand at launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now it‚Äôs sitting around $17.44. Even the Journey Together stamped variant, which you'd think would carry some extra value, is undercutting the regular one at about $14. That‚Äôs a 79.51% drop, and in my opinion, a steal. If you want a chase card without paying chase prices, this is the one.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Special Illustration Rare And Hyper Rares</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/09/pixel-9-2025-05-09t103754-924-1746783490499.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pok√©mon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Lillie‚Äôs Clefairy ex SIR was positioned as the face of the set, and for a moment it looked like it might stay there. Prices hit $400, which was wild, considering the only thing more expensive than that in Journey Together was probably regret. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now it‚Äôs sitting around $180 and in my opinion, it‚Äôs still too high. It‚Äôs a gorgeous card, no doubt about that, but I think we‚Äôll see it hit $150 soon. Not a crash but a correction to something a little more in line with what most people are willing to pay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I thought Iono‚Äôs Bellibolt ex SIR was going to be the top card of the set. It had the rarity, it had the character, and it looked just chaotic enough to become a fan favorite. Instead, it‚Äôs hovering around $80, which is fine. Not great, not terrible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The price feels stable, and I don‚Äôt think it's going to tank like some of the other launch-day hype magnets. If you like it, grab it. If you're hoping it doubles in value, maybe take a walk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Salamence ex SIR is probably the best example of what went wrong with Journey Together‚Äôs early pricing. At launch, people were paying up to $250 for it like it was the last dragon card ever printed. Now it‚Äôs going for about $106, and I think it‚Äôll settle closer to $100. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still expensive, sure, but at least now it‚Äôs priced like a high-tier chase card and not a collector‚Äôs retirement plan. The art‚Äôs strong, and Salamence has always had staying power, so I think this one holds up better than most.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Full Arts</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Iono‚Äôs Bellibolt ex is my favorite full art, mostly because I pulled it and immediately convinced myself I was sitting on gold. At launch, it was going for around $80. It's now comfortably sitting in the $7‚Äì$8 range. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Honestly, if you paid anything above $15, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. It‚Äôs a great-looking card, though, and I think it‚Äôll stick around this price for a while now that the dust has settled. Just maybe don‚Äôt buy it thinking it's the next Supporter-tier Iono. It‚Äôs a Bellibolt. Let‚Äôs be reasonable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lillie‚Äôs Clefairy ex had a bizarre start. Prices climbed past $110 before launch, which had me wondering if people thought it was a Special Illustration Rare by mistake. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs now found its lane at around $17‚Äì$19, which is where it probably should‚Äôve been all along. I think it‚Äôs a great pickup at that price if you're into Lillie, or Clefairy, or just want something that won‚Äôt lose half its value before it hits your mailbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">N‚Äôs Zoroark ex started out a little more grounded at around $30, but even that wasn‚Äôt safe from the drop. It's landed around $12 now, which honestly feels like a fair deal. The card still looks fantastic, and it‚Äôs got some collector appeal thanks to N.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/14/pixel-9-7-1744647077516.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">But when I say Journey Together prices are crashing, this is exactly what I mean. Remember all those ‚Äúcan‚Äôt-miss deals‚Äù I was posting at launch?

        <p>Shifting gears, literally</p>

    </div>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lightyear-frontier">Lightyear Frontier</a> launched into early access a little over a year ago, and it generally seems to have trudged along reasonably well since then. It's not quite ready for 1.0 just yet, but a new update was announced by developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/frame-break">Frame Break</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/amplifier-studios">Amplifier Studios</a> earlier this week that sounds like it'll be bringing in some much needed changes.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Appropriately titled the Shifting Gears Update, there's two big things it's changing. For one, the world itself is about to get a lot bigger. The devs explained that while a lot of people liked the "lush nature of the game world," it was also just a bit too small. So, the map is increasing in size for "large-scale farming", with the main progression system receiving a rework for "higher emphasis on farming." 
</p>
<p>
Hazards like tornadoes have been added in too to make getting around this bigger world a bit more challenging (but you can also just turn that off if you're just in it to relax).
</p>
<p>
Plus, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1677110/view/512957645996427407">as previously mentioned by the devs</a>, the narrative is getting reworked, namely mostly cutting out the character PIP-3R as a constant voice in your ear. Jay Castello called this one quite accurately in their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lightyear-frontier-early-access-review">early access review</a> of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming sim</a> last year. 
</p>
<p>
The narrative isn't going away completely, and PIP-3R may appear again further down the line. But for now the way you'll learn about the story is through Inspection Points, which are just bits of flavour text that appear in certain areas, and Artifacts Findings, which are also just bits of flavour text from artifacts you find.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of that, there's a lot more features coming like a new mod chip system to upgrade your mech, automated drone watering, and a lot more. You can check out the full list of additions over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1677110/view/512958914879291494?l=english">Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Shifting Gears update isn't too far away either, as it's currently due out June 4th, just under a couple of weeks away.

            <p>We should all know by now that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Joy-Cons feature a mouse sensor, but we've also just learned that Nintendo's new system will also support USB mice, too.</p>
<p>As shared in a video by Koei Tecmo, and transcribed by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-supports-usb-mouse-controls-developer-reveals/">VGC</a>, Nobunaga‚Äôs Ambition: Awakening Complete Edition producer Michi Ryu showed off how a mouse can be used on the new system, demonstrating the feature by using both the built-in mouse and a USB one plugged into the console.</p>
<p>You can watch it for yourself in the video below:</p>

<p>"The functionality is the same as the already released Steam version, allowing for left click, right click and wheel operations," Ryu said as he moved the Joy-Con's analogue stick up and down, as though wheeling a mouse scroll button. He also illustrated how the left Joy-Con 2 can also be used at the same time to access shortcuts.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Ryu then showed the same functionality using the same left Joy-Con 2 shortcuts, but by using a USB mouse instead. Each time he changed input devices, there was a message on the screen confirming the change.</p>
<p>On its debut, the Switch 2's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-gamechat-function-includes-welcome-accessibility-features">GameChat will include text-to-speech and live captions</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reserves-the-right-to-brick-your-console-following-unauthorised-use-in-bid-to-prevent-piracy">Nintendo will also be able to record video and voice chats stored on your console for a limited time</a>, if you give consent. This is to ensure a "safe and family-friendly online environment", Nintendo said, with footage only reviewed as part of its user-report system. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-gamechat-feature-requires-a-mobile-phone-number">Those wanting to utilise the Switch 2's GameChat feature</a> will need to register a phone number.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will be available worldwide in just under two weeks time, on 5th June. For more, you can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-specs">check out our guide to the Switch 2's specs here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Part of me feels like whoever it was must be loaded; I mean, you‚Äôve combined two already great flavors into something that Reese‚Äôs would more or less build a whole brand on. And then part of me thinks it plays out like the hypothetical guy who invented the Chicken McNugget in The Wire. A pat on the back from a big shot, and then it‚Äôs back to the basement to figure out a way to make the fries taste better. I don‚Äôt know the answer; I hope it's the former. But every now and then, you come across an idea, a combination of things, that‚Äôs so good that you wonder how nobody‚Äôs ever done it before. And every time my squad and I sprinted back to our time-traveling dropship, stopping only to deal with the Time Reapers that stood in our way, I wondered how the hell nobody had ever said ‚ÄúHey, what if we combined Overcooked and Gears of War?‚Äù pre-Pizza Bandit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pizza Bandit‚Äôs setup is pretty simple. You‚Äôre Malik, a former bounty hunter with dreams of being a chef who is pulled back into the bounty game when he‚Äôs scammed out of his pizza shop and his former crew needs his help to get out of a jam. Pizza Bandit‚Äôs writing is pretty silly, but that‚Äôs part of the charm. I can‚Äôt get mad when Albert, the android that upgrades your weapons, tells me he doesn‚Äôt know how to apologize for what happened to my pizza shop because he‚Äôs just an android, or when my pilot waxes nostalgic about how he misses the fog, or when someone utters the odd nonsensical line. It‚Äôs too silly, and the whole setup is just there to, well‚Ä¶ set up Pizza Bandit‚Äôs wackiness.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">See, you‚Äôre not just any bounty-hunting crew. You‚Äôre a time-traveling bounty hunting crew, and that means you‚Äôll be going all over space and time to get the job done. Don‚Äôt ask me how any of this works. All I know is that pizza heals and bullets kill, and that the Time Reapers ‚Äî nasty little buggers that seem to be invading every timeline ‚Äî don‚Äôt want this pizza shop owner to make any dough. And that‚Äôs not gonna fly. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pizza Bandit‚Äôs writing is pretty silly, but that‚Äôs part of the charm.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes Pizza Bandit unique is that you‚Äôre not just shooting stuff. You‚Äôre also, well, kinda playing Overcooked. After squading up, my first mission saw my crew (you can play with up to three friends) heading to the Restaurant from N owhere, a hidden outpost run by another bandit crew. Our job: fulfill the pizza orders for other bounty hunting teams, and send them off in time-traveling rocket pods. That meant putting together the right type of pizza, getting it to the oven, making sure we were getting their drink orders right, and adding some extra bullets for when things got spicy, cramming it all into a pod, and doing it on time while fighting off the Time Reapers, who really, really don‚Äôt like supporting small businesses.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pizza Bandit Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that‚Äôs where the other part of the Overcooked/Gears of War marriage comes into play. See, the Time Reapers mean business, and you‚Äôre not going to talk them out of some time reaping. That‚Äôs their whole bag. The only solution, fellow bandit, is incredible violence. I‚Äôve played several builds of Pizza Bandit at this point, and let me tell you, your arsenal is up to the task. You start with your choice of assau lt rifle, minigun, and sniper rifle, but the fun really begins when you start unlocking your secondary weapons by completing jobs. They start simple: landmines, grenades, that sort of thing, but once you unlock the disco ball that attracts enemies and gets them dancing before it explodes? Whew, buddy. And the sentry turret? Perfection. You could slice and dice them Time Reapers with a katana, but have you ever considered using a pizza slicer as big as a man? It‚Äôll change your life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the Time Reapers will force you to use everything in your arsenal. You got your standard guys who will just run at you, but there are also Time Reapers that‚Äôll crawl around on all fours, Terminator-looking ones that will leap at you, giant ones with hammers, guys who throw fireballs (these can really ruin your day), the works. You gotta prioritize.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/24/ss-fc17574392f72dbb6c6579ab57335f4af8f3e918-1920x1080-1748046545180.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Pizza Bandit is at its best when you‚Äôre with a good team, calling out orders. A good match should be shouts of ‚ÄúWe need a pepperoni pie!‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on the Coke!‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm down!‚Äù interspersed with lots and lots of gunfire. Simple choices, like when to call down your own, once-a-mission rocket pod full of pizza and supplies, and more complex ones, like where to put it (you can block off a stairway, for instance), spice things up, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here‚Äôs the thing: so far, I‚Äôve just talked about Restaurant from Nowhere, which is only the first level. Pizza Bandit isn‚Äôt a one-trick pony. One of my favorite levels has you taking over a sushi joint and making sure you have the right stuff on the delivery turntable for your customers. Sometimes that means running downstairs and grabbing a big ol‚Äô tuna, taking that bad boy upstairs, and chopping him up before the Time Reapers whack you and you drop him. Other times that means frying an egg, or making a cucumber roll. You gotta stay ahead of the curve, because new customers are prioritized over old ones, and the Time Reapers aren‚Äôt gonna sit there and wait for you to plate your masterpiece.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/24/ss-26bd1a7af2e8fec5f2c57033cb8a23f4a04c87d2-1920x1080-1748046559606.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes, you‚Äôre not even cooking food at all. Another favorite level, Wizard‚Äôs Tomb, has you exploring a magically booby-trapped tomb in search of a sarcophagus. You‚Äôll have to navigate the tomb‚Äôs traps, solve basic puzzles to reveal the way forward, and take out the arcane heart powering the whole enterprise before getting to the sarcophagus itself, which you‚Äôll naturally transport with jetpacks before booking it back to your ship. It isn‚Äôt enough to get any given job done; you gotta get home, too. Just another day in the life of a pizza bandit.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pizza Bandit is always ludicrous, and its inspirations are obvious, but it‚Äôs never less than fun.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are more, of course: in one, you‚Äôll defend a cabin with Dr. Emmert Browne (Great Scott, Jofsoft, I see what you‚Äôre doing here, and I like it!) while he invents the time travel device that makes your whole business profitable. Winning it all means keeping him warm, satiating his hunger with rabbit or venison, and stopping all those nasty Time Reapers (and Wendigos?) who are trying to stop time travel from happening. You‚Äôd think that the Time Reapers would understand time paradoxes, but I guess not. Can‚Äôt reap time if there‚Äôs no time to reap, y‚Äôall.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/24/ss-db483c1838bc283a6d4572159679b419ad7b521b-1920x1080-1748046577176.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"> Or maybe you‚Äôll break into an enormous safe with a laser drill, like you‚Äôre roleplaying the opening scene of Michael Mann‚Äôs Thief with a drill that‚Äôs constantly exploding. That seems safe, right? But hey, apparently there‚Äôs a magical cookbook in that vault whose recipes can alter reality, and we‚Äôre being paid to get it, exploding drill or not. A Pizza Bandit always gets the job done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"> And there‚Äôs always time to do your best Breaking Bad impersonation and help a couple of guys cook some ‚Äúmagic powder‚Äù and hide it inside some chicken. Oh, and you have to kill and cook the chickens. Only fresh, never frozen, baby. Pizza Bandit is always ludicrous, and its inspirations are obvious, but it‚Äôs never less than fun.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/24/ss-fa18e950efd8078ae934ab25415fd4f8c22c49c9-1920x1080-1748046597852.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Between missions, it‚Äôs back to Pizza Bandit (your restaurant), where you can acquire and upgrade your weapons, decorate Pizza Bandit itself, use the ingredients you find during missions to bake and share a pie for some stat boosts on your next run, or get some spiffy new duds for your bounty hunter. The milk carton backpack is a classic choice, if I do say so myself, but I‚Äôm still saving up for one of the cat ones. The things we do for fashion, am I right? Then it‚Äôs right back to it. A bandit‚Äôs work is never done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes, you don‚Äôt know you want something until you get it. I didn‚Äôt know I wanted Pizza Bandit until the first time I played it at PAX two years ago. It was one of those games that generated a lot of word of mouth, but it‚Äôs one of those concepts that doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôll work until you get a controller in your hands and everything makes sense. I don‚Äôt know why we‚Äôve never gotten something like Pizza Bandit before, but once I played it, I knew I wanted more. Pizza heals, bullets kill, and Pizza Bandit rocks. If Jofsoft can stick the landing, we‚Äôre in for a tasty slice of New York pie.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/level-5-are-so-pleased-with-how-fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-is-doing-theyre-giving-away-a-free-bit-of-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
I wasn't expecting it personally, but it seems like the new hotness is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, 'ey? Sure, it's from a studio like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/level5">Level-5</a>, who've made massive games from Yo-kai Watch to Professor Layton. I just didn't expect a sequel to a 3DS game from over a decade ago to do so well. In fact, it appears Level-5 is so happy with how much money everyone's given them, it'll be giving away a free bit of DLC for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> at some point in the future.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The DLC is called "<a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250523_01/">Update the World!</a>" which is a wonderful little title, and a sentence I'd expect from some anime villain obsessed with tech who wants to install a new operating system on Earth, or something. In terms of what it'll include, there'll be "new content designed to make use of high-rarity weapons obtained from Treasure Groves and other sources." 
</p>
<p>
Maybe that'll mean more quests, or side activities, I'm not entirely sure, it's pretty vague. Though perhaps not as vague as the fact that there'll be "new recipes added" in the DLC too. Yummy, I love recipes! Level-5 also promised that they will "continue to update and improve Fantasy Life i so that players can enjoy its world more comfortably and for an even longer time."
</p>
<p>
As it stands, there's no release date for this bit of DLC, kind of seems like a "we sold lots of copies so we can announce this but we're not quite ready for it yet" type of announcement. Either way, there's already lots to be getting on with given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alternate-between-14-lives-in-level-5s-latest-open-world-fantasy-rpg-out-on-pc-this-week">you've got 14 lives to choose from</a>, an existentially terrifying point that I won't spend too much time on.

<p>As Matt summarised for us recently, The Girl Who Steals Time is a sequel to Level 5's Fantasy Life - a sort of job-focussed mash-mash of life sim and RPG - which enjoyed modest critical and commercial success when it launched for Nintendo DS back in 2012. Eurogamer's celebrated its "abundance of features" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-review">our 6/10 review</a> at the time, but noted the result was often "less than the sum of its parts".</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is available now on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and Switch, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> version coming later this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-tier-list-best-characters">Zenless Zone Zero</a> Season 2, entitled Where Clouds Embrace The Dawn, will launch on 6th June.</p>
<p>Calling it "a significant update and milestone moment" - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-its-not-a-joke-zenless-zone-zero-really-is-coming-to-xbox">the gacha game will also release on the same day for Xbox</a> - HoYoverse teased that in Version 2, players will "embark on a brand-new and exciting journey to Waifei Peninsula, alongside Yixuan from Yunkui Summit".</p>
<p>"In this expansive update, Proxies will venture into the all-new Waifei Peninsula alongside trusted allies such as Yixuan from Yunkui Summit, revitalize the Suibian Temple nestled within the bustling Failume Heights, and take on more challenging Hollow combat in a more open and spacious environment. To commemorate the game's first anniversary, Version 2.0 will bring a wide array of celebration rewards including a free S-Rank Agent, a free S-Rank W-Engine, 1,600 Polychromes and 20 Encrypted Master Tapes," the developer added.</p>

<p>Following the resolution of the Sacrifice crisis in previous chapters, Season 2 sees Proxies further uncover the hidden secrets of Phaethon and experience new Hollow exploration gameplay that harnesses the forces of Ether.</p>
<p>"The region's main city Failume Heights thrives near the Lemnian Hollow, renowned for the rare resource Porcelume. It offers distinctive tea houses, pawnshops, and dessert stalls, inviting Proxies to immerse themselves in the local atmosphere," HoYo added. "Meanwhile, Proxies will take on management of their very own Suibian Temple, upgrade the temple's facilities and earn in-game rewards by dispatching Bangboos, completing commissions, and collecting resources from the Hollows."</p>
<p>Several new allies will join the roster: Yixuan, also known as the Grandmaster, will join the combat as an S-Rank Agent, Ju Fufu, the senior disciple of Yunkui Summit, who will debut as an S-Rank Fire Stun Agent, and Pan Yinhu, Yunkui Summit's A-Rank Physical Defense Agent.</p>
<p>The S-Rank Ether Support Astra Yao and the S-Rank Physical Defense Caesar will return to the Version 2.0 banners.</p>
<p>Players can also expect Hollow Zero: Lost Void to be updated with "new commissions and the possibility to equip multiple Gears to different Agents, adding more strategic options to battles", plus a brand-new 3D map with enhanced navigation features.</p>
<p>"In Version 2.0, Proxies will be able to enter the cinema in Lumina Square to enjoy movies with different characters during the Gravitational Attraction event and obtain exclusive rewards by completing certain tasks, including an A-Rank W-Engine Reel Projector," we're told. "In the Soul of Steel: Golden Bond event, Proxies can pilot sleek mechs into the Hollows, take on a variety of challenges, and earn abundant rewards."</p>
<p>In March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-zenless-zone-zero-actors-lose-jobs-over-ai-dispute-without-notice-finding-out-alongside-players">two voice actors working on Zenless Zone Zero were suddenly recast due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike over AI abuse</a>, and discovered the change alongside the publication of the game's patch notes. In a statement subsequently shared on social media, the studio said its contracts offer "explicit AI protections, regardless of union status" and it will continue to work on its clients' projects "in the most human way possible".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/673768/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em> starts off by asking a simple question: what happens when you pluck a handful of colorful teenagers from their homes, plop them in a state-of-the-art school filled with every convenience, then force them to fight for their lives? Your guide as you navigate this question is an unsettling and creepy-cute mascot that knows more than it‚Äôs let on, and there‚Äôs an overarching mystery to the world that you can‚Äôt quite put your finger on. </p><p>If you, like I, answered ‚Äú<em>Danganronpa</em>!‚Äù ‚Äî as this premise sounds very much like the plot of the quirky and irreverent murder-mystery series from Spike Chunsoft ‚Äî then congratulations! We‚Äôre both totally wrong! And after 45 in-game days with <em>LDA,</em> I still have no idea what‚Äôs going on, and I love it.</p><p>I‚Äôm going to be gentle with myself and you for thinking <em>LDA</em> is another entry in the genre of high school-themed killing games. After all, it was developed by Kazutaka Kodaka, creator and writer of the <em>Danganronpa </em>franchise, in collaboration with Kotaro Uchikoshi, known for his work on the adventure-puzzle game series <em>Zero Escape</em>. And though <em>LDA</em> oozes with the DNA from both series, it stands so completely apart mechanically and narratively that while I can get a grasp on the former, I‚Äôm lost with the latter.</p><p>The premise is simple enough. You play as Takumi Sumino, who gets whisked away to the Last Defense Academy, where he and a group of others use their newly awakened powers to defend the school from monster attacks for 100 days. Should they fail, the invaders will destroy the school and thereby‚Ä¶ because of plot‚Ä¶ all of humanity. Usually past a certain point, I can figure out a game‚Äôs core gameplay loop and rough narrative thrust. When the first body dropped in <em>Danganronpa</em>, I immediately understood that I‚Äôd be spending the rest of the game solving my classmates‚Äô murders. But I haven‚Äôt been able to figure out <em>LDA</em>.</p><div><p><em>LDA</em> fills the gaping hole <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23557639/fire-emblem-engage-nintendo-switch-review"><em>Fire Emblem Engage</em></a> created and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23688312/advance-wars-reboot-camp-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Advance Wars </em>remakes</a> could not fix</p></div><p>I understand the gameplay loop easily enough: it‚Äôs a tactical RPG with visual novel-like relationship-building elements. Combat takes place on a gridded battlefield with each combatant able to attack in a different configuration, similar to chess. One of Takumi‚Äôs abilities attacks enemies in a straight line. My ally, Gaku, attacks in a rectangular pattern. Each of my allies‚Äô attacks contributes to a voltage meter that allows us to use our special abilities when full. And if one of my allies should fall, they‚Äôll be revived before the next wave of enemies. </p><p>I like how the tactical combat isn‚Äôt like <em>Fire Emblem</em> or <em>Triangle Strategy</em>. <em>LDA </em>is unique, as you‚Äôre not trying to manage the complex rock-paper-scissors formula of what weapons are strong or weak against each other. Instead, life is the engine that drives combat. Actions you take are determined by how many action points, or AP, you have, and killing certain enemies grants you more AP. On the flip side, allies who are near death can unleash big special attacks that can clear entire battlefields at the cost of losing them for the rest of the wave.</p><p>Combat then becomes a function of playing with life totals ‚Äî my enemies and mine. I‚Äôll arrange my attacks in such a way that every time I act, I kill an enemy and gain more AP so I can just keep going, denying my enemies the chance to fight back. Then, when I‚Äôm out of AP, I can unleash a killing blow that ends the round. My allies get revived the next round, and I can start the process all over again. I‚Äôve been left so unsatisfied by the crop of tactical RPGs lately, and <em>LDA</em> fills the gaping hole <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23557639/fire-emblem-engage-nintendo-switch-review"><em>Fire Emblem Engage</em></a> created and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23688312/advance-wars-reboot-camp-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Advance Wars </em>remakes</a> could not fix.</p><p>But while I‚Äôve got a handle on the combat, I still haven‚Äôt the faintest clue of the story it‚Äôs trying to tell. My confusion is so thorough that as I go through each new day, my experiences start sounding like wartime letters from the front lines.</p><div><blockquote><p>It‚Äôs day 33. Our self-proclaimed leader, Hiruko, is still missing. We‚Äôre starting to suspect she‚Äôll never return. Meanwhile, the enemy keeps hurling themselves at our defenses. So far, we‚Äôve been able to hold them off. Gaku recently developed his power, revealing himself to be a peerless ranged fighter. But our forces are nowhere near full strength, since Ima, Kako, and Shouma refuse to fight. And alas! Our foodstores have burnt up and I fear we‚Äôll starve soon. War is grim, but I fight knowing the closer I get to the 100th day is a day I am closer to returning home‚Ä¶ or so I hope.</p></blockquote></div><p><em>LDA</em>‚Äôs narrative is so unlike anything I‚Äôve ever experienced that not knowing what‚Äôs happening next is part of the fun. I like getting dragged along for the ride, discovering new developments alongside the characters, who are themselves a delight. <a href="https://aftermath.site/darumi-amemiya-the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-emo-cringe-punk">As other outlets have pointed out</a>, Darumi Amemiya is the physical manifestation of the irony-poisoned and terminally online dirtbag edgel(ady), and I adore her even if her characterization gets uncomfortably familiar sometimes. </p><p>I also really enjoy how the characters are over-the-top caricatures themselves ‚Äî Darumi‚Äôs the creepy murder-obsessed emo girl, Takemaru‚Äôs the typical fighting-obsessed delinquent ‚Äî but make decisions like normal people. I often struggle to get into ‚Äútransported to another world‚Äù stories because none of the decisions made in them have ever made sense to me, a woman who can‚Äôt turn off her overly logical and reason-obsessed brain in order to just go with the flow. So it‚Äôs incredibly refreshing to see these characters push back on the circumstances they‚Äôve been dropped in. </p><p>Instead of just accepting that they‚Äôve been taken from everything they‚Äôve ever known and forced to fight <em>and die</em> (even if that death is temporary), some of my allies maintain a healthy level of skepticism, question everything, and refuse to fight. I know I would! And even better, other characters in the game understand and acknowledge that as a reasonable position. There‚Äôs no rah-rah speech of ‚ÄúYou must fight!‚Äù that convinces them to take up arms. The reluctant characters are given the space to come around on their own time and for their own reasons.</p><p>That may sound boring. After all, in an isekai-like narrative, the characters are usually forced to get on board quickly otherwise there wouldn‚Äôt be a plot. So seeing a game take its time with the reluctant characters, letting them work through their hangups in a natural and unforced way, was pleasing to my brain.</p><p>In the almost 50 days I‚Äôve spent with <em>LDA</em>, I do have some working theories as to where the overall story will go. How it gets there, though, I have no clue, but I‚Äôm excited to see what twists the game will take along the way.</p><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em> is out now on Switch and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>NetherRealm has confirmed there will be no more additional story chapters or characters "from this point on".</p>
<p>In a statement posted to X/Twitter, the studio said that despite "hearing players' requests for continued game support of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>", "there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released". It will, however, "continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes".</p>

<p>"It's disappointing because there's no thorough QoL, no online lobbies, &amp; locked away skins....you truly gave us an unfinished $140 game," <a href="https://x.com/Mikemetroid/status/1926025851734196480">replied</a> one player. "An extreme low from WB/NRS. What changed over there???"</p>
<p>As for that "next project" NetherRealm refers to? Well, no-one's entirely sure as it's not been formally confirmed as yet, but that's widely thought to be Injustice 3. Let's watch this space.</p>
<p>Some fans aren't surprised by the announcement, however. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-mortal-kombat-1-definitive-edition-has-fans-thinking-warner-bros-has-quietly-wrapped-up-development">NetherRealm Studios released its surprise Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition on Switch, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC earlier this month with minimal fanfare</a>, bundling together the main game, its Khaos Reigns story expansion, Shang Tsung, two Kombat Packs featuring additional fighters and Kameo characters, some in-game currency, and a selection of skins. Animality finishing moves have also been added in a free update for all players.</p>
<p>"The arrival of the definitive edition meant it was over with the previous games, so... I guess that was it," noted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1kmhhqw/this_means_its_over/">one poster on the Mortal Kombat subreddit</a> at the time, a sentiment largely shared across the playerbase.</p>
<p>Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition costs ¬£55/$70 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, while Switch players can pick it up for $60. There's also a ¬£50/$60 Definitive Edition Upgrade ($50 on Switch) for Mortal Kombat 1 owners wanting to get everything in the new version without purchasing each bit of DLC separately.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-army-set-preview-awoooo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The grimdark future of <i>Warhammer 40,000</i> is constantly evolving, and with each new edition comes the promise of refreshed armies and new tactical opportunities. For the Sons of Fenris, that promise is finally being delivered with the highly anticipated Space Wolves Army Set and Space Wolves Codex Supplement. Packing brand-new sculpts, the essential new Codex, and a suite of datacards designed to get you howling into battle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We‚Äôve recently covered army sets from the warp with our reviews of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-world-eaters-gorestorm-slaughterpack-review-gory-goodness" rel="nofollow">World Eaters Army Set</a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-death-guard-poxwrought-vector-review-so-sick" rel="nofollow">Death Guard Army Set</a>, so join us now as we take a sneak peek at this massive army set release.</p>

<h2><b>Space Wolves Army Set Contents</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-wolves-army-set-full-picture.jpg?itok=filYwPyz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-wolves-army-set-full-picture.jpg?itok=HCoLMTHc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>So what‚Äôs included in the Space Wolves Army Set? A lot!</p>

<ul><li>1x Wolf Guard Battle Leader</li>
	<li>1x Wolf Priest</li>
	<li>10 Grey Hunters</li>
	<li>10 Blood Claws</li>
	<li>6x Wolf Guard Headtakers</li>
	<li>1x Special Edition Codex</li>
	<li>25x Datacards</li>
	<li>1x Transfer Sheet</li>
</ul><p>Estimated MSRP: $230 USD</p>

<h2><b>Space Wolves Army Set - Special Edition Codex</b></h2>

<p>I really like the look of the Codex, and reading through it we get, as usual, a really great and extensive dive into the lore of this Chapter. From the start of the chapter on the death world of Fenris, to detailing how this Chapter battles with the ferocity of the wolves of their home planet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There‚Äôs also an extensive section in the lore describing the heraldry of the Chapter, as well as how each of the different ‚Äúpacks‚Äù of warriors (like the Blood Claws and Grey Hunters, which we‚Äôll speak to in a moment). Finally, the Codex includes all the rules you need to play, including how Sagas work for this Chapter.</p>

<p>Now let‚Äôs take a Quick Look at the individual units included in this Army Set!</p>



<p>The new Space Wolves Army Set comes with five units all ready to hit the battlefield (after some assembly, of course) and fight until the Wolftime dawns! As opposed to one of our more in-depth reviews where we break down all the stats, for this Army Set preview I really want to just take a Quick Look at what makes each unit feel different from one another and special.</p>

<h3><b>Wolf Guard Battle Leader</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-battle-leader.jpg?itok=RPNs3_Vt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-battle-leader.jpg?itok=X6xvQBgY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Let‚Äôs start with the Wolf Guard Battle Leader - veterans of battle and some of the bravest warriors in the army. What makes this unit most unique is how customizable it is. You can choose from an array of melee weapons (a power weapon or a thunder hammer) and ranged options (Carbine, heavy bolt, or plasma pistol), and as a leader you can attach this unit to Blood Claws, Grey Hunters, or Wolf Guard Headtakers.</p>

<p>When you set them up as a leader, you give their unit the Sustained Hits 1 keyword and let them re-roll 1‚Äôs when you‚Äôre attacking within 6 inches. Not bad for a melee-happy Chapter like the wolves!</p>

<h3><b>Wolf Priest</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-priest.jpg?itok=TtWVfNLJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-priest.jpg?itok=V0r4gklv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Next up is the Wolf Priest, the physical and spiritual leader of the group. And while they‚Äôre outfitted with decent weaponry, their abilities truly make the Wolf Priest an extreme standout.</p>

<p>You can attach them to Blood Claws, Grey Hunters, or Wolf Guard Headtakers, and as they act as leaders you‚Äôll get two special abilities. First, you‚Äôve got the Litany of Hate ability, which says if the Priest is leading a unit they add 1 to wound rolls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the real prize here, and what makes the Wolf Priest stand out, is the Healing Balms ability, which says ‚ÄúWhile this model is leading a unit, in your Command phase, you can return 1 destroyed model (excluding Character models) to that unit.‚Äù That‚Äôs not a once-per-battle thing, which is huge!</p>

<h3><b>Wolf Guard Headtakers</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-headtakers.jpg?itok=UtiqqE40 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-wolf-guard-headtakers.jpg?itok=JGQ1VlUm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Wolf Guard Headtakers are tasked with breaking through enemy lines and taking down important figures in the enemy camp. To do that, they‚Äôre joined by their ferocious Hunting Wolves!</p>

<p>What makes this unit special is that, at the start of your deploy units phase, you actually split this unit up into two units - one for the marines and the other for the wolves! This unit can also can name one enemy unit as their quarry which gives the marine models in this unit Devastating Wounds and Precision keywords tied to attacking their quarry!</p>

<h3><b>Grey Hunters and Blood Claws</b></h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-blood-claws.jpg?itok=NCnjymrg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-blood-claws.jpg?itok=HU7kOajz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Space Wolves Blood Claws</figcaption></figure><p>Blood Claws are the youngest members of the Chapter, hungry to prove themselves in savage battle. Contrasting that are the Grey Hunters, who are older, more mature, and patient marines. These are two different units, but they each only have one thing making them each stand out - beyond the impressive weaponry of your standard space marine.</p>

<p>For the Blood Claws, their fiery and impatient nature is brought to life via their Berserk Charge ability, which let‚Äôs them charge in the same turn it Advanced, meaning these marines can cover some serious ground.</p>

<p>For the Grey Hunters, their stalking nature is portrayed in the Cunning Hunters ability, which let‚Äôs them re-roll Wound rolls of 1 and, if they‚Äôre within range of an object marker, the ability is upgraded to allow them to re-roll all Wound rolls.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-gray-pack.jpg?itok=nzLq0QHV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-space-wolves-gray-pack.jpg?itok=Kldmcjxt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Space Wolves Gray Pack</figcaption></figure><p>Along with the Codex, Codex Cards - which do a great job of making it super easy to keep track of your units - and the models, this feels like a very solid offering, and similar to other Space Marine Army Boxes we‚Äôve seen since the launch of 10th. I‚Äôve got some playtesting to do with these models, but on first look - I think you could use this box as the start of an extremely aggressive Force!</p>

Basically: a Very Confident Man was doing his own bathroom reno, and despite the best advice from‚Ä¶ everyone speaking to him, made a succession of terrible decisions, many stylistic, others load-bearing (like weakening the floor beneath the tub). It became so notorious that in 2019<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-hot-new-doom-mod-is-a-nightmare-diy-bathroom-renovation-bathdoom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a Doom mod was made to commemorate the job</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Something Awful | bEatmstrJ</figcaption></figure><p>Anyway time moved on, the bathroom was completed,<a href="https://aftermath.site/escape-to-the-country-tv-series-review-from-the-circles-of-hell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> we found other fucked up houses to focus our attention on</a> and got on with our lives. The Doom Bathroom was filed away in our memory banks, where like so many Jokes Of A Time I would have expected it to remain.</p><p>But no! It's now back! Because the house the Doom Bathroom emerged from the depths of hell to take residence in<a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/25380-Coral-Canyon-Rd-Corona-CA-92883/79835564_zpid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> is currently up for sale</a>. For just $1,088,000, you could live in this "uniquely remodeled home", which upstairs--provided you equip a chainsaw and are aware that at some point you're going to need to rip and/or tear--features a "master bathroom [that] has been fully transformed with a sleek, modern design that stands out from the rest".</p><p>It really does stand out! The rest of the house is absolutely not to my taste, but it is at least consistently to <em>a</em> taste, in the way so many other American homes built (or renovated)<a href="https://mcmansionhell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> over the last 20 years are</a>. You could click through 94% of this gallery and think this was a normal, boring, house, were it not for the three photos in the middle that show a completely unrelated <em>bathroom from hell</em>.</p><p>If you've never seen the house before please check it out. And while you're there, maybe an American familiar with real estate listings could tell me why every exterior photos looks like a cel-shaded screenshot from a Telltale adventure game.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hockey-stickhandling-video-game-dangleverse"><h3>This Video Game Is Also a Hockey Training Tool</h3></a><p>Dangleverse, which I've been using to practice hockey off the rink, is in beta right now</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/geoguessr-blackout-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia"><h3>GeoGuessr Map Makers Make Most Popular Maps Unplayable In Protest Of Saudi-Backed Esports World Cup [Update]</h3></a><p>"The GeoGuessr community is diverse and includes many members of groups that would be harshly persecuted were they to live in Saudi Arabia"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/midea-u-shape-ac-gone"><h3>The Most Popular Window Air Conditioner Has Disappeared From Store Shelves</h3></a><p>The Midea U-Shaped air conditioner is universally beloved.

                <p dir="ltr">AMD announced its latest graphics card, the Radeon RX 9060 X, at Computex 2025 earlier this week. This is the third GPU in AMD's 9000 series lineup that also includes the RX 9070 and 9070 XT, and its slated to launch June 5. While it's positioned as the entry-level option in the RX 9000 series, the RX 9060 XT runs on the same RNDA 4 architecture as the more powerful RX 9070 and 9070 XT and includes FSR 4 resolution upscaling and frame generation, as well as DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b support. </p><p dir="ltr">AMD is producing two versions of the RX 9060 XT: one with 8GB VRAM and another with 16GB VRAM. Both models will feature 32 RDNA 4 CUs (computation units), up to 3.13GHz clock speed, and between 150W and 182W power draw, depending on the model's VRAM and clock speed. While those are solid specs for an entry-level card, things get a bit more confusing from there.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Power and pricing</h2><p dir="ltr">AMD lists the MSRP as $300 for the 8GB model and $350 for the 16GB model. However, the company is not releasing RX 9060 XT reference cards itself. Instead, third-party manufacturers like Asus, Acer, Gigabyte, and others are launching their own versions of the RX 9060 XT starting June 5. As such, performance, power draw, and pricing will likely differ between the various RX 9060 XT models (especially for overclocked models), but at least some of these GPUs will stick to the reference clock speeds and therefore MSRP (assuming the ongoing tariffs do not impact those prices).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4500190-asus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4500190" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4500190-asus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4500190"></a><figcaption>Asus is launching three RX 9060 XT models</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4500190-asus.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As for performance, the RX 9060 XT 16GB is positioned as the replacement for AMD's RX 7600 XT as its flagship entry-level GPU, making it the primary competitor to Nvidia's $300 GeForce RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti (which costs either $380 for the 8GB version or $429 for the 16GB version). According to AMD's Computex 2025 presentation, the company's internal testing found the RX 9060 XT is roughly six percent faster than the RTX 5060 Ti on 40 games running at 1440p--and at roughly $80 MSRP cheaper. However, those tests compare the RX 9060 XT 16GB to the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, rather than the RTX 5060 16GB. The RX 9060 8GB model's performance is a bigger question, as the smaller amount of VRAM could lead to significant performance dips.</p><p dir="ltr">On X (formerly Twitter), AMD's Chief Architect of Gaming Solutions and Gaming Marketing, Frank Azor, explained that most players use a 1080p display, for which 8GB of VRAM is more than enough. While technically true, it doesn't alleviate the concerns over confusing consumers who may see the above comparisons of the RX 9060 XT 16GB's 6% performance boost over the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB and assume that applies to <em>all </em>RX 9060 XT models. And again, the actual performance will likely differ between the various SKUs launching June 5, which could further compound the issue.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AzorFrank/status/1925651286998794443" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Majority of gamers are still playing at 1080p and have no use for more than 8GB of memory. Most played games WW are mostly esports games. We wouldn't build it if there wasn't a market for it. If 8GB isn't right for you then there's 16GB. Same GPU, no compromise, just memory‚Ä¶</p>  ‚Äî Frank Azor (@AzorFrank) <a href="https://twitter.com/AzorFrank/status/1925651286998794443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><h2 dir="ltr">Where to find the AMD RX 9060 XT</h2><p dir="ltr">Those potential concerns and unanswered questions aside, the RX 9060 XT nevertheless looks like a solid entry-level choice for those already invested in AMD's hardware. As mentioned above, multiple manufacturers are releasing RX 9060 XT GPUs starting June 5, and while none are currently listed for preorder, you can learn more about the models announced from <a href="https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/prime/prime-rx9060xt-o16g/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus</a>, <a href="https://store.acer.com/en-us/components/graphics-cards" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Acer</a>, and <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/us/Graphics-Card/All-Series?fid=3124" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gigabyte</a>, at each company's online store. Other brands like PowerColor also showed off upcoming RX 9060 XT GPUs on the Computex 2025 show floor. We'll be sure to update this post once the GPUs are available.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-bros-1993-movie-30th-anniversary-edition-blu-ray-where-to-watch-buy-amazon/1100-6531622/">Highly Limited Super Mario Bros. 30th Anniversary 4K Blu-Ray In Stock At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-board-game-monkey-palace-strategy-building-set-amazon-deal-2025/1100-6528660/">Lego Monkey Palace Board Game Is Over 50% Off At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-leverless-arcade-controller-xbox-switch-2-pc-preorder-amazon/1100-6531585/">8BitDo Reveals Leverless Arcade Controllers For PC, Switch, And Xbox</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/locke-key-keyhouse-comic-compendium-gets-massive-limited-time-discount/1100-6531565/">Locke &amp; Key Keyhouse Comic Compendium Gets Massive Limited-Time Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-mario-kart-mario-standard-kart-review-where-to-buy/1100-6530000/">Lego's Awesome New Mario Kart Display Set Is Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/joe-abercrombie-the-devils-new-fantasy-book-series-2025-amazon/1100-6531472/">First Book In Joe Abercrombie's New Fantasy Series Is Finally Here</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/transformers-optimus-prime-lego-set-restocked-and-20-off-at-amazon/1100-6509331/">Amazon Restocks Lego Transformers Optimus Prime, Offers Big Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-super-mario-bowser-muscle-car-amazon-deal-retiring-lego-set/1100-6531375/">PSA: Lego Bowser's Muscle Car Is Retiring - Save Big On 3 Mario Sets Before They're Gone</a></li>   </ul> </div>

The company publicly explored the idea of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhj3C1H5JWo">brain-computer interfaces for gaming</a> at GDC in 2019.</p><p>But Newell decided to spin off the idea. That same year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125379/is-gabe-newells-neuralink-competitor-coming-out-of-stealth">he quietly incorporated</a> a new brain-computer interface startup, Starfish Neuroscience ‚Äî which has now revealed plans to produce its very first brain chip later this year.</p><p><a href="https://starfishneuroscience.com/blog/ultra-low-power-miniature-electrophysiological-electronics/?header-bg=card-bg0">Starfish‚Äôs first blog post</a>, spotted <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1925459695713525986">by Valve watcher Brad Lynch</a>, makes it clear we‚Äôre not talking about a complete implant yet. This bit is the custom ‚Äúelectrophysiology‚Äù chip designed to record brain activity (like how Neuralink can ‚Äúread your mind‚Äù so patients can interact with computers) and stimulate the brain (for disease therapy), but Starfish isn‚Äôt claiming it‚Äôs already built the systems to power it or the bits to stick it into a person‚Äôs head.</p><p>‚ÄúWe anticipate our first chips arriving in late 2025 and <strong>we are interested in finding collaborators for whom such a chip would open new and exciting avenues</strong>,‚Äù writes Starfish neuroengineer Nate Cermak (bolding theirs), suggesting that Starfish might wind up partnering with other companies for wireless power or even the final brain implant.</p><p>But the goal, writes Starfish, is a smaller and less invasive implant than the competition, one that can ‚Äúenable simultaneous access to multiple brain regions‚Äù instead of just one site, and one that doesn‚Äôt require a battery. Using just 1.1 milliwatts during ‚Äúnormal recording,‚Äù Starfish says it can work with wireless power transmission instead.</p><p>Here‚Äôs the chip‚Äôs current spec sheet:</p><div><ul><li><span>Low power: 1.1 mW total power consumption during normal recording </span></li><li><span>Physically small: 2 x 4mm (0.3mm pitch BGA) </span></li><li><span>Capable of both recording (spikes and LFP) &amp; stimulation (biphasic pulses) </span></li><li><span>32 electrode sites, 16 simultaneous recording channels at 18.75kHz </span></li><li><span>1 current source for stimulating on arbitrary pairs of electrodes </span></li><li><span>Onboard impedance monitoring and stim voltage transient measurement </span></li><li><span>Digital onboard data processing and spike detection allows the device to operate via low-bandwidth wireless interfaces. </span></li><li><span>Fabricated in TSMC 55nm process</span></li></ul></div><p>Neuralink‚Äôs N1, for comparison, has 1,024 electrodes across its 64 brain-implanted threads, <a href="http://whole ASIC consumes approximately 6 mW">a chip that consumed around 6 milliwatts as of 2019</a>, a battery that periodically needs wireless charging, and the full implant (again, not just the chip) is around 23mm wide and 8mm thick. The Elon Musk-led company has reportedly already implanted it in three humans; while some of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24152758/neuralinks-first-implant-in-a-human-started-to-detach-from-the-patients-brain">threads did detach</a> from the first patient‚Äôs brain, he still has functionality and <a href="https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/full-q-and-a-neuralink-patient-noland">has been giving interviews</a>.</p><p>Starfish says it could be important to connect to multiple parts of the brain simultaneously, instead of just one region, to address issues like Parkinson‚Äôs disease. ‚Äúthere is increasing evidence that a number of neurological disorders involve circuit-level dysfunction, in which the interactions between brain regions may be misregulated,‚Äù Cermak writes.</p><p>In addition to multiple simultaneous brain implants, <a href="https://starfishneuroscience.com/research/">the company‚Äôs updated website says</a> it‚Äôs working on a ‚Äúprecision hyperthermia device‚Äù to destroy tumors with targeted heat, and a brain-reading, robotically guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) system for addressing neurological conditions like bipolar disorder and depression.</p><p>In case you‚Äôre wondering how any of this might make its way back to gaming, I‚Äôll leave you with Valve‚Äôs talk from GDC 2019 about brain-computer interfaces.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">There are a lot of different jobs to choose from in The Sims 4, including a pretty robust group of careers included with the base game and plenty more that have been added via DLC over the decade-plus that The Sims 4 has been out. What jobs you have your sims sign up for is totally up to you, but there are a lot of factors that can affect your performance, like whether your sim's skills are appropriate for the job you want. If you want your sims to be successful, some knowledge and effort are required--just like it is with a real job.</p><p dir="ltr">While there are specific things you'll need to know about each individual career that can help you get ahead, there are also some universal tips that can help your sims climb their corporate ladders.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#General_tips_for_any_Sims_4_career">General tips for any Sims 4 career</a><ul><li><a href="#Pick_an_active__self_employment__or_rabbit_hole_job">Pick an active, self-employment, or rabbit hole job</a></li><li><a href="#Do_well_in_school">Do well in school</a></li><li><a href="#Get_career_related_reward_perks">Get career-related reward perks</a></li><li><a href="#Actually_do_the_job">Actually do the job</a></li><li><a href="#Work_overtime">Work overtime</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#All_Sims_4_normal_careers">All Sims 4 normal careers</a><ul><li><a href="#Astronaut">Astronaut</a></li><li><a href="#Athlete">Athlete</a></li><li><a href="#Business">Business</a></li><li><a href="#Criminal">Criminal</a></li><li><a href="#Culinary">Culinary</a></li><li><a href="#Entertainer">Entertainer</a></li><li><a href="#Painter">Painter</a></li><li><a href="#Secret_Agent">Secret Agent</a></li><li><a href="#Tech_Guru">Tech Guru</a></li><li><a href="#Writer">Writer</a></li><li><a href="#Critic">Critic</a></li><li><a href="#Politician">Politician</a></li><li><a href="#Social_Media">Social Media</a></li><li><a href="#Conservationist">Conservationist</a></li><li><a href="#Gardener">Gardener</a></li><li><a href="#Freelancer">Freelancer</a></li><li><a href="#Military">Military</a></li><li><a href="#Education">Education</a></li><li><a href="#Engineer">Engineer</a></li><li><a href="#Law">Law</a></li><li><a href="#Style_Influencer">Style Influencer</a></li><li><a href="#Salaryperson">Salaryperson</a></li><li><a href="#Civil_Designer">Civil Designer</a></li><li><a href="#Romance_Consultant">Romance Consultant</a></li><li><a href="#Undertaker">Undertaker</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#All_Sims_4_active_careers">All Sims 4 active careers</a><ul><li><a href="#Doctor">Doctor</a></li><li><a href="#Detective">Detective</a></li><li><a href="#Scientist">Scientist</a></li><li><a href="#Retail">Retail</a></li><li><a href="#Interior_Decorator">Interior Decorator</a></li><li><a href="#Reaper">Reaper</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="General_tips_for_any_Sims_4_career">General tips for any Sims 4 career</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Pick_an_active__self_employment__or_rabbit_hole_job">Pick an active, self-employment, or rabbit hole job</h3><p dir="ltr">There are three main types of careers in The Sims 4. Most of them are rabbit hole-type jobs, where your sims just go offscreen and do their thing without any meaningful input from the player. But there are also "active" careers, where you follow your sim to their place of business and you'll have to make them do various tasks (though you can also play these as rabbit hole jobs if you'd prefer), and self-employment and freelance careers where your sim will complete individual gigs from the comfort of their homes, like writing a book, painting a picture, or building furniture.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Do_well_in_school">Do well in school</h3><p dir="ltr">Teens who get good grades in high school will automatically earn a career level or two in any job they take--a B GPA starts you at level 2 of every career your sim joins for the rest of their lives, and an A will let them start at the third tier. Likewise, there are specific college degrees that will help both your starting level and your performance--we'll note those below.</p><p dir="ltr">In your lifetime aspiration rewards, there are some perks you can purchase that will help a lot with any career you take on. Professional Slacker (4000 reward points) will make it so you'll never lose your job or get demoted for bad performance, and the Connections trait will make it so you start any career three levels higher than you normally would--this stacks with any bonuses you earned in high school or college as well. The Savant perk (4000 points), which increases all skill gains by 25%, will also help, as most jobs have specific skill requirements for promotions.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Actually_do_the_job">Actually do the job</h3><p dir="ltr">For the most part, the job will tell you exactly what it is your sim needs to do to get ahead. Most jobs will require you to complete certain tasks while you're off the clock (homework, basically) or increase certain skills in order to earn a promotion--whatever those requirements are will be listed in the career tab in the bottom right corner of the screen. Likewise, active careers will have random tasks for your sims while they're at the office, and if you don't do at least some of them each day, you'll end up making very little money.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Work_overtime">Work overtime</h3><p dir="ltr">Some jobs allow your sim to stay two hours past the normal end of their shift, which improves their job performance and earns them overtime pay. Using that option whenever it's available can advance your career much more quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond that, you'll also want to level up each career's relevant skills and make sure your sim is in the best mood for the job whenever possible. To help you with that, below you'll find a list of each of the normal and active careers in The Sims 4, along with a rundown on the relevant skills, ideal moods, and which college degrees are most relevant. Follow this guide, and no matter which career you put your sim in, they'll be raking in the cash and vacation days in no time.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="All_Sims_4_normal_careers">All Sims 4 normal

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-roblox-grow-a-garden-geoguessr<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For better and, often, worse, traditional video games have calcified. If you check Steam‚Äôs top ten most-played games on any given day, you‚Äôll likely find a lineup of the usual suspects: <em>PUBG</em>, <em>DOTA</em>, <em>Counter-Strike</em>, <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, and the odd recent breakout hit (with a major license attached) like <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Across the way, on their own clients, you‚Äôll find mirror realm versions of the aforementioned games like <em>Fortnite, Valorant, </em>and <em>League of Legends</em>. But then, in another universe, there‚Äôs <em>Roblox</em>, which plays by its own, different set of rules. This week, its latest crop to yield viral fruit, <em>Grow A Garden</em>, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made headlines</a> by outpacing anything on Steam. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we discuss how it and other games of its ilk offer young people something that more traditional games don‚Äôt.</p><p>This time around we‚Äôre joined by <a href="https://aftermath.site/author/nicole-carpenter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath‚Äôs newest regular contributor</a>, former Polygon senior reporter Nicole Carpenter to discuss her tenure at <a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-vox-media-valnet-layoffs-staff-goodbye" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the freshly gutted games media institution</a>, as well as how she got into journalism in the first place. She also tells us about the time she <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23776996/barbie-fashion-designer-retro-game-untold-story-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got to speak to the voice of Barbie for a story</a>, and she started speaking in character without even being asked. You love to hear it.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we delve into the news of the week: First, the community around Google Maps-based location guessing game <em>GeoGuessr </em><a href="https://aftermath.site/geoguessr-blackout-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protested the game‚Äôs inclusion in the Saudi-backed Esports World Cup</a> by blacking out most of the game‚Äôs most popular maps‚Ä¶ and it worked? Despite the prevailing mentality that corporate interests and oil money will overcome all, <em>GeoGuessr</em>‚Äôs developers relented and pulled out of the event. We talk about the ways in which this situation was unique, but conclude that it can still serve as an inspiration to other gaming communities unnerved by the sudden presence of a&nbsp; sportswashing festival on their annual calendars.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we move on to <em>Grow A Garden</em>, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/grow-a-garden-roblox-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a <em>Roblox </em>game Nicole wrote about</a> that has more concurrent players than anything on Steam. Why is it so popular? And what is <em>Roblox </em>offering young people that more traditional games don‚Äôt? Lastly, we accept an offer from the King Of All Cosmos and transform Aftermath into a giant ball company.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can roll up the first giant ball with a second, giant-er ball.&nbsp;</p><p>Here‚Äôs an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nicole: </strong>It really is just‚Ä¶ you grow a garden. It has the typical <em>Roblox </em>look: It kinda looks like Legos. You‚Äôre buying seeds and planting the seeds. You‚Äôre waiting a little bit for the seeds to grow; you don‚Äôt actually have to wait very long. And then you‚Äôre selling those so you can go buy more seeds and then plant them in your garden and sell them. You do that over and over and over and over.&nbsp;</p><p>The thing that I think draws people to it is that there‚Äôs an RNG element. Your crops can mutate. They can become really rare, so you can get a lot of money. But basically, at its core, it‚Äôs watching a number go up, which, you know, universal game activity that draws people back.</p><p>There is a social aspect to it: You can have five people per server, all in what is not dissimilar to a community garden. You each have your own plots, and you‚Äôre hanging out. There‚Äôs events that happen there. The developer has his global commands; he can make stuff happen in the game. They do dance parties. They‚Äôre doing one this weekend: the Monster Mash. And they do lightning bolts, mutate your crops ‚Äì special stuff like that.&nbsp;</p><p>When I first started playing it for this story, I was baffled. It‚Äôs so simple. It‚Äôs so heavily monetized. You can play it without buying anything, but if you want to steal from another person, you have to pay. It‚Äôs less than a dollar, which I think can be pretty insidious. That‚Äôs a <em>Roblox </em>thing in general: Everything is so cheap that you don‚Äôt really realize how it adds up. But as I kept playing, I was like ‚ÄúIs this good?‚Äù It‚Äôs really satisfying and built around viral moments on short-form platforms like YouTube Shorts or TikTok. There are older people, like people my age, playing it, but it‚Äôs a lot of gen alpha.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> What about it lends itself especially well to viral moments? When somebody goes viral playing this game, what is happening?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nicole:</strong> What I‚Äôve seen is people stealing from each other. If you‚Äôve been playing this a lot, you can get really rare stuff ‚Äì stuff that for me as a beginner player is totally not accessible. So stealing it, you‚Äôre literally picking their plant or whatever and selling it for your own money. There are ways to protect yourself, but it‚Äôs funny when someone accidentally forgets to protect that thing, and they get their prize crop stolen. And these videos also have a lot of screaming. Typical TikTok things. That‚Äôs largely where I‚Äôm seeing the viral moments.</p><p>When I interviewed the dev, he was saying that all those five million people aren‚Äôt necessarily playing the game; they‚Äôre joining this low-stakes thing for these events to be part of the thing. It‚Äôs so easy to plant a few crops. It‚Äôs so low stakes and low investment that it‚Äôs easy for people to be like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna try that out‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll play it‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis will become my new social space.‚Äù</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Luke, you were talking about this <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3lppoyvczec2z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Bluesky</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Yeah, it‚Äôs funny watching this game blow up, because they‚Äôre all largely the same thing. If you‚Äôre not familiar with <em>Roblox</em> ‚Äì and I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs most of you, and you‚Äôre better for it ‚Äì my son spends all of his time on <em>Roblox</em>, so I‚Äôve developed an unnatural understanding of how it all works and operates and what the appeal is. Like Nicole was saying, these are barely games. What‚Äôs important to understand here is, they are social experiences that these large groups of similar-aged kids log onto, and they‚Äôre kinda doing it in the background, and a number‚Äôs going up, and something is happening that‚Äôs making them feel good, but at the same time, nine of their friends from school are in chat, and it‚Äôs a space where they‚Äôre hanging out.&nbsp;</p><p>The game is happening, but there‚Äôs actually not much game. It‚Äôs like guys watching football. The game‚Äôs on, but there‚Äôs really seven people having a beer and catching up. It‚Äôs that, but for 12 year-olds ‚Äì with some deeply problematic structures built into the platform. Although I guess sports have that too with sports gambling and alcoholism. [<em>Roblox</em>] has crippling monetization and the normalization of gambling and stuff built into it.</p><p>But yeah, it‚Äôs been funny watching people grapple with this game‚Äôs popularity, because it shows that they don‚Äôt deal with <em>Roblox </em>on a daily basis. This game blew up, but it kinda only blew up a little more than any other game that is blowing up on a given day in <em>Roblox</em>. Next week, <em>Grow A Garden </em>might have disappeared completely and be replaced with <em>Weightlifting Guy Simulator</em> or‚Äì</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> <em>Sisyphus Simulator 4</em>.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> It‚Äôs just so funny watching people [try to figure out why these games get big]. And I‚Äôm guilty of this myself; I used to write about <em>Roblox </em>at Kotaku, and I used to grossly misrepresent it because honestly, it was very difficult to understand as a normal adult who didn‚Äôt have to experience it on a regular basis. But now that I‚Äôve had to spend time with it, it‚Äôs so funny watching people grapple with it, because it‚Äôs so foreign to how so many of us understand how video games operate ‚Äì how we operate within them and what we get out of them. <em>Roblox </em>is just on such a completely different level.&nbsp;</p><p>‚ÄúWhy are they playing this terrible game?‚Äù Dude, they‚Äôre barely playing it. Stop thinking of this as a video game. It‚Äôs social lubricant. My 12-year-old son‚Ä¶ the pandemic fucked my kids up badly, because they had to spend two or three years doing school work from home on and off and having all their social events curtailed and missing important events. Those were formative years of their life, and so suddenly kids of that age ‚Äì I‚Äôve got a 14 year-old and a 12 year-old ‚Äì have just learned to be online during some of their most formative social years in ways that go well beyond what any of us would associate with that. They‚Äôll have friends that live in this suburb that they could go and visit, and they don‚Äôt. They sit on <em>Roblox </em>or Snapchat with them, because that‚Äôs been normalized to them.&nbsp;</p><p>While there are deeply problematic aspects to <em>Roblox</em>, we let him keep playing because a) we control the spend, and b) he‚Äôs getting a lot out of it. It‚Äôs not a bad video game for him. It‚Äôs just the place where he hangs out with his friends. I think that‚Äôs way better than him just sort of lying in his room watching TV or whatever. He‚Äôs always actively talking to them and communicating, and they‚Äôre always plotting strategies and doing stuff we would associate with gaming; you‚Äôd do that playing <em>Halo </em>on a couch or playing <em>FIFA</em>. But they‚Äôre all doing it every day in ways that are really healthy.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/doom-bathroom-renovation-something-awful-for-sale"><h3>Please Know That The House With The Doom Bathroom Is For Sale</h3></a><p>Calling it a 'uniquely remodeled home' seems like an understatement</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hockey-stickhandling-video-game-dangleverse"><h3>This Video Game Is Also a Hockey Training Tool</h3></a><p>Dangleverse, which I've been using to practice hockey off the rink, is in beta right now</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/geoguessr-blackout-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia"><h3>GeoGuessr Map Makers Make Most Popular Maps Unplayable In Protest Of Saudi-Backed Esports World Cup [Update]</h3></a><p>"The GeoGuessr community is diverse and includes many members of groups that would be harshly persecuted were they to live in Saudi Arabia"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/midea-u-shape-ac-gone"><h3>The Most Popular Window Air Conditioner Has Disappeared From Store Shelves</h3></a><p>The Midea U-Shaped air conditioner is universally beloved.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/confirmed-mortal-kombat-1-wont-get-any-more-dlc-characters-or-story-chapters-as-netherrealm-needs-to-shift-focus-to-the-next-project<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. has confirmed what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> fans feared after the recent launch of the Definitive Edition: no new DLC characters or story chapters will be released for the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat 1 has sold 5 million copies, with the franchise now up to 100 million. Mortal Kombat 11 became the best-selling game in the franchise by passing Mortal Kombat X's nearly 11 million units sold worldwide soon after launch. By 2022, Mortal Kombat 11 had sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. Clearly, Mortal Kombat 1 has underperformed compared to previous games in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020816879206810" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a> on the official Mortal Kombat social media account, Warner Bros. acknowledged the disappointment the news will cause players, "but our team at NetherRealm needs to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. failed to say what this new project is, but current speculation points to Injustice 3, a continuation of NetherRealm‚Äôs DC fighting game series.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here‚Äôs the statement in full:</p><blockquote>We are hearing players‚Äô requests for continued game support of Mortal Kombat 1, and, while we will continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes, there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released from this point on.</blockquote><blockquote>We understand this will be disappointing for fans, but our team at NetherRealm needs to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">March 2025's release of the T-1000 guest character, which came a year-and-a-half after the release of Mortal Kombat 1 itself, now goes down as the game‚Äôs final major content drop. For context, in July 2021, NetherRealm announced it had started work on its next project (Mortal Kombat 1) and, as a result, there would be no further DLC for Mortal Kombat 11. That announcement came two years and three months after the release of the game. Today‚Äôs announcement comes one year and eight months after the release of Mortal Kombat 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are already bringing up prior comments from NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon, who had promised fans years of support. Indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago"><u>many are now pointing to a September 2024 tweet from Boon</u></a>, who at the time moved to reassure fans already concerned that the studio had moved onto its next game by saying: ‚ÄúNetherRealm is still fully committed to supporting Mortal Kombat 1 for a long time to come.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-mortal-kombat-1-community-is-working-together-to-try-to-figure-out-how-to-fight-floyd-but-the-exact-process-remains-a-mystery-for-now"><u>Mortal Kombat 1 enjoyed something of a resurgence in January with the secret fight with Floyd</u></a>, the pink ninja developer Boon had been teasing for years. That sparked a fun community-wide effort that breathed new life into the game. But that was a rare bright spot for what has, overall, been a disappointing release for many core Mortal Kombat fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What now for Mortal Kombat? Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated that it still believes the gory fighting game franchise has a future. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady"><u>the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which was Mortal Kombat</u></a>. Movie adaptation Mortal Kombat 2 is due out later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

                <p>We're only a few weeks into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s Star Wars season, but since the season is only five weeks long, that means we're already getting close to the end. Once Star Wars season wraps up, things will be back to normal in Battle Royale and Zero Build--or maybe there's nothing normal at all about what's coming up next season.</p><p>Right now we've got a lot more questions (about 7,000) than we do answers (about 0) regarding what's in store for the Fortnite island once all these Star Wars people leave, but let's go through the rumors and guesswork we've got so far.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Is_the_upcoming_Fortnite_season_Chapter_6_Season_3_or_Chapter_6_Season_4_">Is the upcoming Fortnite season Chapter 6 Season 3 or Chapter 6 Season 4?</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_start_date">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 start date</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Star_Wars_season_s_live_finale_event">Fortnite Star Wars season's live finale event</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_season_theme">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 season theme</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_battle_pass_skins">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 battle pass skins</a></li><li><a href="#Gameplay_changes_in_Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3">Gameplay changes in Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_OG_Season_4">Fortnite OG Season 4</a></li><li><a href="#New_Lego_Fortnite_Pass">New Lego Fortnite Pass</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Is_the_upcoming_Fortnite_season_Chapter_6_Season_3_or_Chapter_6_Season_4_">Is the upcoming Fortnite season Chapter 6 Season 3 or Chapter 6 Season 4?</h2><p dir="ltr">We don't have a confirmed answer for this question right now, but since the Star Wars season is designated in the game's metadata as Chapter 6 MS1 (mini-season 1), it stands to reason that next season will be called Season 3. It also implies, but <em>does not confirm,</em> plans for an additional mini-seasons in the future.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_start_date">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 start date</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortnite: Galactic Battle is currently scheduled to come to a close on June 7, with the new season slated to begin on the morning of June 8. But this season won't end in the middle of the night, as most Fortnite seasons do.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Star_Wars_season_s_live_finale_event">Fortnite Star Wars season's live finale event</h2><p dir="ltr">As promised by Epic when the season began, the Star Wars Galactic Battle season will conclude with a live event in which players will storm the Death Star and confront Emperor Palpatine in order to end the Empire's invasion of the island. This will be a true live event, like the ones that come at the end of each chapter, and it'll take place on Saturday, June 7 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_season_theme">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 season theme</h2><p dir="ltr">It's rumored that the upcoming season of Battle Royale <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920308377025941969" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will be superhero themed</a>, but in the more traditional capes-and-tights sort of way--with Midas running a school for superheroes, apparently. Word is that the new season will have a DC Comics bent, which makes sense with a new Superman film landing in July. And since Fortnite's only existing Superman skin is permanently locked behind the Chapter 2 Season 7 battle pass from 2021, the rumors about <a href="https://x.com/FNBRintel/status/1918704607083282696" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new item shop Superman</a> make perfect sense.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4499942-4499937-locker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499942" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4499942-4499937-locker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499942"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4499942-4499937-locker.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3_battle_pass_skins">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3 battle pass skins</h2><p dir="ltr">It's expected that the new season will have a normal battle pass that includes several Fortnite-original characters and one or two collab skins. It's very likely that a new corrupted version of Daigo will be on the pass, since the cinematic at the end of Season 2 showed Daigo entering the magic portal in the northeasern part of the island and transforming into a very different body. Beyond that, the only rumored collab skin for the battle pass <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920308377025941969" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">is Robin</a>--yes, we're talking about Batman's pal here.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Gameplay_changes_in_Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_3">Gameplay changes in Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 3</h2><p dir="ltr">All the rumors and leaks about the upcoming season being superhero-themed also mention that <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1921999441885577714" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">superpowers will be a</a> key part <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920524099136467202" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">of your arsenal</a> in the new season. Not gadgets like we had in last year's Marvel season, but rather actual super-powered abilities--stuff like the mythic Jujutsu Kaisen and Dragon Ball items, or Avatar's elemental abilities.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Season_4">Fortnite OG Season 4</h2><p dir="ltr">Season 4 of Fortnite OG will also begin on June 8, and that may be because the original Season 4 also had a superhero theme. While Fortnite OG will certainly stick with the loot pool and map that the original Season 4 had, we can't help but wonder if there will be story connections between OG and standard Battle Royale given the simultaneous start dates.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Epic has seemingly been teasing the return of The Visitor, whose arrival with the meteor in the original Season 4 kicked off Fortnite's plot, with <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1920631430188568835" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this remix of an old Seven-related music track</a> that appears to have a modified version of The Visitor's head and shoulders on the cover art. The Visitor would have been a prime candidate for a remix even without that tease, so no one would be surprised if he appeared on the new OG Pass.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="New_Lego_Fortnite_Pass">New Lego Fortnite Pass</h2><p dir="ltr">The new Lego Pass will <em>also</em> begin on June 8, and we have no rumors or anything about what's in store. But given the date, we have every reason to expect it will tie in with this hypothetical superhero theme. Given DC's close relationship with Lego, it wouldn't be surprising at all for one of that brand's heroes to pop up here.</p>
