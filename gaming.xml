            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-could-be-mere-days-from-launch-according-to-leaker/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new rumor suggests that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake could be mere days from its announcement and launch. New leaker Detective Seeds <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1906165593016799478" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> (two days ago, so it's not an April Fools' joke) that the launch could come as soon as Thursday, April 3, or maybe next week, according to his source. Detective Seeds doesn't have a long track record, but he did get a couple of things right: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-out-on-april-17-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 release date of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM previews dropped yesterday</a>. He also <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1906086027665490373" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that Ghost of Yotei might launch in July, by the way. We'll see if he's right about either of them.</p>
<p>As for the Oblivion remake, though, there are other sources pointing in that direction. Both proven insider NatetheHate and VideoGamesChronicle <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-unreal-engine-5-oblivion-remake-could-be-revealed-and-launched-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the game would launch in April, with the former also adding that it could be shadow-dropped, meaning the announcement and launch would happen at the same time. It would, however, be a little surprising since Xbox has South of Midnight (out next week) and then the aforementioned PS5 debut of the Indiana Jones game.</p>
<p>The Oblivion remake is said to be powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology and developed by Virtuos. According to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous report from MP1st,</a> the remake will deliver enhancements in six main gameplay areas (other than the obvious visuals): Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, Hit Reaction, and HUD.</p>
<p>Blocking has reportedly been inspired by the Soulslike genre and other modern action games. Sneak has also been overhauled and its damage formula has been reworked. The stamina system was tweaked to make it less frustrating for players; for example, the knockdown that used to happen when you ran out of stamina should occur less often.</p>
<p>The HUD (Heads-Up Display) has been modified to make it more accessible and visually interesting. In combat, hit reactions have been introduced to improve the response to damage inflicted on both the player character and non-player characters (NPCs). Last but not least, Virtuos has improved archery so that it feels smoother whether the user is playing with the third or first person camera.</p>
<p>The Oblivion remake comes in the same year as <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skyblivion</a>, the long-awaited fan-made total conversion of The Elder Scrolls IV into the engine of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. There should be enough adventures in Cyrodiil for everyone in 2025.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The developers of <em>Palworld</em> and <em>PUBG</em>: <em>Battlegrounds</em> have announced details of dating simulators set in the universes of their respective games.</p><p>The <em>Palworld</em> dating sim, technically called <em>Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~</em>, was actually announced ahead of April Fools’ Day <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/1/24118022/doki-doki-palworld-club">last year</a>. But yesterday, developer Pocketpair released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUpilXM6638">second trailer for the game</a> and published <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3620480%2FPalworld_More_Than_Just_Pals%2F" rel="sponsored">an official Steam listing</a>, so it seems like it’s a bit closer to actually releasing.</p><p>According to the Steam page, “You, the protagonist, enroll as a transfer student in the prestigious Palpagos Private Academy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/faker-biggest-esports-star-50-million-won-donation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-Hyeok is a rockstar in the esports world. He’s one of the most decorated competitors in history with multiple world championship titles under his belt, and he’s known as one of the most consistent players in the business. As a League of Legends star, Faker has racked up millions of dollars in earnings, and he’s using that fortune to remain charitable.</p>



<p>Recently, it was revealed that Faker joined a few other players in donating stacks of cash to support the Hope Bridge National Disaster Relief Association in South Korea.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-the-first-time">Not The First Time</h2>



<p>Faker is a philanthropist as well as a gifted esports competitor.</p>



<p>In 2020, he donated 30 million Korean Won ($25,000) to COVID-19 charities, and in 2022, he followed that up with another 50 million KRW to similar agencies. In 2023, he donated $25,000 to the Community Chest of Korea, releasing the following statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I delivered donations to Community Chest of Korea again this year, to mark the year-end and New Year’s season, when warm helping hands are most needed. This was a meaningful year and I know my fans have done good deeds before me. I hope my donation can contribute to warming up the holiday season.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, Faker has <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/en/en-society/2025/04/01/H3IPM6MFRFDJ3N57XY7JW2QRE4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">extended a donation again</a>, giving 50 million KRW ($34,000) to support the delivery of emergency relief supplies in wildfire-affected areas in South Korea. His donation will be used to set up temporary shelters and help affected residents get back to their daily lives.</p>



<p>He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I hope this can help those affected by the wildfire. I wanted to lend support so that everyone can return to a stable daily life as soon as possible. I pray that no further damage occurs and that a swift recovery is achieved.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In his many years as an active League of Legends competitor, Faker has earned almost $2 million through esports tournaments, and once upon a time, it was rumoured that his salary exceeded $5 million. It’s heartwarming to see the superstar player giving back to his community in South Korea, where he’s respected as an athlete and gaming personality.</p>

<p>Starbreeze, the developer of the Payday series, has announced the appointment of a new CEO – Adolf Kristjansson. He’s an industry veteran who comes across from a role as senior director of global commercial strategy at Electronic Arts. In a statement, Kristjansson revealed his intentions to turn Starbreeze into a ‘multi-title studio’.</p>



<p>Last year, Tobias Sjögren, the former CEO of Starbreeze, stepped down following the paltry launch of Payday 3, a game that was plagued with issues.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-great-enthusiasm">‘Great Enthusiasm’</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/adolf-kristjansson-appointed-as-new-ceo-of-starbreeze/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement</a> following his appointment, former EA veteran Adolf Kristjansson said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>I join Starbreeze with great enthusiasm for the company’s current and future projects, not the least the upcoming Dungeons &amp; Dragons title. I look forward to continuing the work of expanding the Payday franchise further and building Starbreeze into a true multi-title studio.</em></p>



<p><em>Most of all, I look forward to working closely with our talented teams and engaging with our passionate player community as we build the next chapter of Starbreeze together</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Chariman of the Board, Jürgen Goeldner said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>On behalf of the board I want to welcome Adolf to Starbreeze and I look forward to a long and fruitful cooperation. I also want to take the opportunity to thank Mats Juhl for his great contribution during his period as interim CEO</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The last couple of years have been nothing short of rocky for Starbreeze, which reported a full-year loss of almost $20 million in December 2024. Things have picked up since reparations were made in the game, and now that Payday 3 has been available for a stint on PS Plus, the player count has climbed a bit.</p>



<p>Could things be looking up for Starbreeze? Let me know your thoughts in the comments or over on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-creepy-lewd-mode-feature/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been confirmed via a recent ESRB filing that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will feature the Peep Demo Theatre that was deeply hidden in the original 2004 release. This super-secret feature was unlocked after viewing every possible cutscene of the game in full, which meant going through several runs and unlocking all possible avenues of content.</p>



<p>With the Peep Demo Theatre, players unlocked an interactive, feature-length cutscene between Naked Snake and Eva ‘behind the waterfall’. It allows players to manipulate the camera at will, focusing on Eva’s breasts, butt, and body in general. It’s a lewd gimmick, and it’s back in Metal Gear Solid Delta.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-wait-and-see">Wait and See</h2>



<p>It seems unlikely that a feature like this will be ‘accepted’ in this day and age, and I can see some folks trying to cancel MGSD over it, but it’s staying true to the original release that dropped when the world was a different place.</p>



<p>The recent filing from <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40362/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ESRB</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-esrb-rating-suggests-its-controversial-sexual-content-is-still-intact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>) states:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is an action game in which players assume the role of an elite soldier trying to stop special forces behind enemy lines. From a third-person perspective, players infiltrate areas, complete missions, and take down enemy soldiers. Players use knives, pistols, machine guns, and explosives to kill enemies. Combat is highlighted by realistic gunfire, cries of pain, and blood-splatter effects. Some close-quarter combat allows players to slit enemies’ throats, resulting in large spurts of blood. </p>



<p>Cutscenes depict further instances of violence/blood: a restrained character beaten and electrocuted; a character shot in the eye; a character on fire shot several times. The game contains some suggestive/sexual content: a man groping a woman’s breasts; close-up cameras angles of deep cleavage; a character briefly groping a man’s crotch; <strong>a Peep Demo Theatre allowing players to view cutscenes of a female character’s body from a first-person perspective</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We knew about the violence, but few players even knew that the Peep Demo Theatre existed. Now that they <strong>do know</strong>, it’ll likely become a conquest for many to see how the new, high-resolution model of Eva looks in the Peep Demo Theatre.</p>



<p>Are you going to strive to unlock the Peep Demo Theatre in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-03-patch-notes">Black Ops 6 Season 03 Patch Notes</h2>



<p><strong>Season 03 will be released in Black Ops 6 on April 2 at 9 AM PT / 5 PM BST.</strong> Here are the key features of this monumental update.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-multiplayer-maps">New Multiplayer Maps</h3>



<figure></figure>







<ul>
<li><strong>Firing Range (6v6)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Firing Range makes its glorious return in Black Ops 6 in a faithful remaster of the fan-favorite map. Watch for crossfire down the long center Road as Operators fight for control of the vantage points in the Tower and the upper levels of the Shoot House and Garage. Shooting targets move back and forth on their tracks behind the Office and several other spots adding a useful diversion while preparing for the next fight. Avoid the center chaos by branching off to the Dirt Road, keeping your guard up against ambush as you pass the Storage unit along the way.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Barrage (6v6)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Revisit 1968 Vietnam as you follow Hudson’s clues surrounding one Summit Watch at the front lines of battle. The trees have been cleared and the landscape flattened to make room for this base housing an artillery battery in active combat. The area has taken hits with large chunks blown off buildings including the Command Center and Barracks, the damage opening new pathways through the map.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Nomad (6v6, 2v2)</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Pantheon moles were in Afghanistan, too, when Woods fought there in 1986. Fight in the ruins of a fortified settlement commandeered for the ensuing battle, a parked missile carrier facing out over the valley where a convoy lies in ruins on the narrow road leading up to the map.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-multiplayer-modes">New Multiplayer Modes</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Sharpshooter</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Flex your skills in this classic Black Ops free for all party mode where every Operator is assigned the same Loadout which changes every 45 seconds. Each cycle introduces a new Primary and Secondary Weapon from scoped Sniper Rifles to akimbo Pistols, plus a new Dedicated Melee weapon and Tactical and Lethal Equipment.</li>



<li>Use everything at your disposal to eliminate enemies while unlocking bonus abilities for going on a streak:
<ul>
<li>1st Elimination: Increased movement speed.</li>



<li>2nd Elimination: Increased reload speed.</li>



<li>3rd Elimination: Increased sprint recovery speed.</li>



<li>4th Elimination: Increased ADS speed.</li>



<li>5th Elimination: Earn double score for eliminating enemies.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Keep the streak going to unlock double score and make a run for the top three. When you’re taken out, respawn and build up those bonuses again. A short countdown precedes each weapon swap. Adapt and win.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Demolition</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Alternate between attacking and defending two bomb sites. The attacking team must destroy both bomb sites to win the round, gaining a time bonus after detonating the first site. All attacking Operators spawn with a bomb and respawns are active for both teams throughout the match.</li>



<li>Defense is all about running down the clock. Defuse planted bombs right away, as the match timer pauses whenever a bomb site is in active countdown. If one of the sites is destroyed, regroup and throw everything you have into defending the last one.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-weapons-in-black-ops-6-and-cod-zombies">New Weapons in Black Ops 6 and COD Zombies</h3>



<figure></figure>







<ul>
<li><strong>Kilo 141 – Assault Rifle (Call of Duty: Warzone Login Reward)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fully automatic assault rifle with an ergonomic design that improves handling, and a steady fire rate helps stay on target.</li>



<li>The Kilo 141 is back and ready to tear it up across Multiplayer and Call of Duty: Warzone. The weapon’s smooth handling, manageable recoil, and steady fire rate give it room to shine in a variety of combat situations, leaving no doubt as to why the Kilo 141 was a favorite in Verdansk. Now that the location is back, it’s time to relive the glory days with this hard-hitting Primary Weapon.</li>



<li>Players will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-kilo-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/">automatically unlock the Kilo 141</a> for use in Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone after logging in to Call of Duty: Warzone at the launch of Season 03.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>CR-56 – Assault Rifle (Battle Pass)</strong>
<ul>
<li>This lightweight 7.62 x 39mm full-auto assault rifle is compact and powerful. Built exclusively for military use, the standard issue rifle is deadly at mid-range combat and easily configured for a variety of assault tactics.</li>



<li>Combining high-damage hits with a fast fire rate and good handling, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-amax-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/">the CR-56 AMAX</a> is the perfect mid-range weapon for downing targets fast. Eliminate enemies in three to four shots up to 25 meters out, leaving plenty left over to chew through equipped armor. Quick reloads get you back into the action fast, a helpful trait no matter how you choose to customize the weapon via Gunsmith.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>HDR – Sniper Rifle (Battle Pass)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Anti-material bolt action sniper rifle chambered in 12.7 x 108mm ammunition. Bullets have a lower muzzle velocity but remain devastating even at very long ranges.</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-hdr-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/">Veterans of Verdansk know the power</a> of the HDR and the havoc a sniper can inflict with it when stationed in high vantage points like the infamous Airport Control Tower. The weapon’s long reach and heavy damage make it a favorite of sharpshooters, its distinctive firing sound sending squads running. Add the Reinforced Barrel attachment to further extend your damage range and bullet velocity, and don’t forget to hold your breath for difficult shots.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Kali Sticks – Melee (Event Reward)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Two-hit kill. Extremely fast attack speed. Short range.</li>



<li>The infamous Kali Sticks return, dealing out damage with rapid swings that’ll take down your target in a flash. Smack them with fast follow-up hits using the weapon’s light attack or take them out in a more dramatic fashion by unleashing the heavy attack. Use Kali Sticks in Multiplayer with the new Close Shave Perk to deploy a quick whack against enemies without having to manually swap to your Dedicated Melee slot first.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Nail Gun – Special (In-Season)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Full-auto Nail Gun. High damage at close range with fast handling speeds and very low muzzle velocity.</li>



<li>Stick it to them with this handy tool configured with a magazine of 15 nails that fires at full auto. The damage drops off quickly after 25 meters and performs best up close. The Nail Gun’s low muzzle velocity can make it difficult to land shots against fast moving targets, so get them in your sights and unload before they know what hit them. This armament is a reward earned during the Black Ops Tribute Event.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-attachments-in-black-ops-6">New Attachments in Black Ops 6</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Monolithic Suppressor (Battle Pass)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Monolithic Core provides superior sound suppression and increased range. Moderate weight increase affects agility.</li>



<li>Available for Assault Rifles (except AS VAL), SMGs, Shotguns, LMGs, Marksman Rifles, Sniper Rifles, and Pistols.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>SWAT 5.56 Grau Conversion (Battle Pass)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Convert the SWAT 5.56 into a fully automatic weapon with lower damage and range but improved accuracy, mobility, and handling. Equips a new default Barrel and Magazine and unlocks an exclusive 50-round extended Magazine. Blocks Barrel attachments.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>C9 10mm Auto 30-Round Mags (In-Season)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Conversion kit to use higher caliber 10mm Auto ammunition for increased stopping power. Though the conversion results in some increased recoil and a slightly lower fire rate, the extra damage, range, and velocity make this attachment a worthy consideration when approaching enemies on bigger maps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>There will also be <strong>one </strong>new multiplayer perk released at the launch of Season 03 – Close Shave. Another perk will follow – Vendetta – later in the season.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-scorestreak">New Scorestreak</h3>



<figure></figure>







<ul>
<li><strong>Death Machine (In-Season)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Heavy minigun with a fast fire rate, high penetration, and a large ammunition capacity.</li>



<li>Wield the infamous Death Machine, a powerful weapon with a single large magazine that fires high-impact rounds at a blistering rate of fire. Score earned while using the Death Machine contributes to your current Scorestreak progress, making this a great tool for bumping up to the next streak.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="h-new-zombies-map-shattered-veil">New Zombies Map – Shattered Veil</h3>



<p>With the Sentinel Artifact in hand, the crew heads to the remote wooded hills above Liberty Falls to meet with S.A.M. at an old mansion in the forest, which has been retrofitted to [[REDACTED]]. Only with the aid of S.A.M.’s synthetic mind can the team hope to unlock the ancient artifact’s mysteries and bring back Agent Maxis. What could possibly go wrong?</p>



<p>Here’s the latest trailer for the new COD Zombies map:</p>

<ul>
<li>The classic rapid-fire Perk returns for the first time in nearly a decade, dramatically increasing your weapon’s fire rate to chew through enemy hordes in record time. Research the iconic Perk for powerful enhancements like an even faster fire rate and the chance to inflict double damage.</li>



<li>Double Tap is available in Shattered Veil along with the other previously accessible Zombies Perks. Note that some of these Perk-a-Colas are only available via the Der Wunderfizz machine.</li>



<li>Double Tap is available on The Tomb, Citadelle des Morts, Liberty Falls and Terminus maps via the Der Wunderfizz machine.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Normal zombies at low health have a chance to die immediately when shot.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h3 id="h-new-zombies-wonder-weapons">New Zombies Wonder Weapons</h3>



<figure></figure>







<ul>
<li><strong>Ray Gun&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark II (+ 3 Variants)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Drop multiple zombies at once with the upgraded and modestly unstable Ray Gun Mark II. Recovered from the Dark Aether by Project Janus, this powerful laser armament delivers three-round bursts of energy, can be Pack-a-Punched, and doubles as a bludgeoning instrument if you’re running low on ammunition.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Then there’s the three new variants.
<ul>
<li>Provided you’ve [[REDACTED]], you can experiment with an additional three variants of the Ray Gun Mark II:
<ul>
<li>Ray Gun Mark II-W: Offering similar bullet patterns to a submachine gun, this also has a random chance to ignite enemies.</li>



<li>Ray Gun Mark II-P: Shooting ammunition like a shotgun, with a chance to spawn a sigil with the ability to grant invulnerability to the player standing on it for a limited time.</li>



<li>Ray Gun Mark II-R: Dropping zombies with a Marksman Rifle-like discharge, expect a chance to spread a plague infection that can inflict area-of-effect damage.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Wunderwaffe DG-2</strong>
<ul>
<li>Capable of striking down hordes with chain-lightning blasts, this has the bonus effect of stunning crowds of zombies, usually resulting in additional, and eventually terminal damage.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-zombies-enemies">New Zombies Enemies</h3>



<figure></figure>







<ul>
<li><strong>Elder Disciple</strong>
<ul>
<li>Strange, floating apparitions have been seen flitting about the sprawling gardens and rambling mansion estate. Known to some as Elder Disciples, these powerful enemies likely spell trouble for the crew.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Elder Disciples gain strength as they empower the zombies around them while summoning more undead to join the battle. Using their dark magic, these fetid, floating carcasses can force their allies to evolve more quickly, allowing a lowly zombie to more rapidly transform into a Doppelghast or some other sinister form.</li>



<li>Eliminate the Elder Disciple before their forces grow too powerful, keeping it at a distance to avoid the scream it lets loose against players who draw too close. The deadly enemy grows more agitated as it takes damage, so try to get the job done fast.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Toxic Zombies</strong>
<ul>
<li>As a sickly yellow fog descends across the mansion, expect the inhabitants to take on an even-more revolting pallor. Easily identifiable due to their greenish hue and more skeletal exterior, Toxic Zombies seem to have lost all but their base perambulatory functions and seem intent on sprinting toward their prey before exploding, leaving a damaging pool of acid in their wake. Listen for their telltale shriek and get the jump on them before they can close the distance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-new-gobblegums">New GobbleGums</h3>



<figure></figure>







<ul>
<li><strong>Tactical Diffusion (Rare)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Disables the next Nuke Power-Up explosion you activate and gives everyone 2,000 Essence instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Support Group (Legendary)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gobble up this tasty GobbleGum to acquire the ARC-XD, Mangler Cannon, Sentry Gun and Mutant Injection Support items.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Die Pitched (Whimsical)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Zombies have high-pitched voices. Lasts three minutes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-new-feature-camo-hub">New Feature – Camo Hub</h2>



<figure></figure>







<ul>
<li><strong>Camo Hub</strong>

<h2 id="h-global-updates-in-season-03">Global Updates in Season 03</h2>



<h3 id="h-console-cross-play-update">Console Cross-Play Update</h3>



<p>In Season 03, we’re giving console players more granular options by separating the MP Ranked Play and Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play settings and adding a new Multiplayer-only setting for Quickplay, Featured, and Party Games matches.</p>



<p>Each of these three settings (Multiplayer Ranked Play, Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play, and Multiplayer Unranked) will include the following options:</p>



<ul>
<li>On: Enables matchmaking with all gaming platforms when playing in the selected playlists.</li>



<li>On (Consoles Only): Enables matchmaking only with other consoles when playing in selected playlists.
<ul>
<li><em>May negatively impact matchmaking queue times.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Off: Restricts matchmaking to your current gaming platform only in selected playlists.
<ul>
<li><em>Will negatively impact matchmaking queue times.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Additional details on how these settings interact with party members who are on different platforms.</p>



<ul>
<li>Players in a party who all belong to the same console platform will matchmake with the party leader’s preferred cross-play settings.</li>



<li>Players who have selected “Cross-Play Off” and create a mixed platform party that includes a different console platform will have their cross-play settings temporarily adjusted to “Cross-Play On (Consoles Only)” to enable matchmaking. This temporary adjustment enables matchmaking for the duration of the mixed platform party, and disbanding this party will result in preferred matchmaking settings being restored.</li>



<li>Players who have selected “Cross-Play Off” and create a mixed platform party with a PC player will have their cross-play settings temporarily adjusted to “Cross-Play On.” This enables matchmaking for the duration of the mixed platform party, and disbanding this party will result in preferred matchmaking settings being restored.</li>



<li>Reminder: Adjusting Cross-Play settings may negatively impact matchmaking queue times.</li>
</ul>

<li>Below is a recap of some of the improvements made to Verdansk that players can expect to see – as outlined in the Return to Verdansk blog:
<ul>
<li>Trees slightly repositioned from the original map.</li>



<li>Non-drivable vehicles clearly marked as smoldering wreckage.</li>



<li>Swimming now possible – southern coastline expanded into Kastovian Sea (not critical to gameplay).</li>



<li>Improved traversal in steep areas – new “goat trails” added.</li>

<li>Added detail enhancements, such as extra debris and scenery around Fire Stations and riverbanks.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Gulag Showers</strong>
<ul>
<li>The original Gulag from 2020 is back, with all three variants included.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Gulag Overtime: Capture the Flag (CTF)</strong>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Rebirth Island Resurgence will remain in the map pool in Season 03.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-mode-battle-royale-casual">New Mode – Battle Royale Casual</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Battle Royale Casual&nbsp;</strong><em>At Launch</em>
<ul>
<li>The Battle Royale experience is branching out with the introduction of a new mode featuring bot players. This is designed as a stepping stone for players to go from the Warzone Bootcamp tutorial mode to an experience closer to our traditional, player-only, experience. Players can learn the game and hone their skills in a lower-stress environment while still embracing the core survival challenge of being the last squad standing among 148 players.</li>

<h3 id="h-full-verdansk-refresh-details">Full Verdansk Refresh Details</h3>



<div><p>The return to Verdansk comes with some refinements to Battle Royale’s loot philosophy that brings us back to its roots: life is valuable, adaptability is key, great loot must be earned, and contracts are central to earning cash.</p><p>In order to create more intentionality around looting, the various sources of loot have been adjusted to be more reminiscent of the classic Verdansk days, with some improvements.</p></div>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ground Loot Refresh</strong>
<ul>
<li>Common to Epic weapons now sport a selection of random attachments that align with the weapon’s natural strengths.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Legendary weapons come with a variety of fixed builds tailored to specific roles, that are randomly selected match over match.&nbsp;</li>



<li>This change aims to maintain the excitement of random loot while preserving the reliability of weapon performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>High Value Loot Zones</strong>
<ul>
<li>This season, HVLZs remain consistent every match, allowing players to reliably identify Hospital, Military Base, and Superstore as Points of Interest (POIs) with enhanced ground loot and an increased number of Supply Boxes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Further enhancements to this feature will be added in future updates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Supply Boxes</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic</strong>
<ul>
<li>These boxes provide consistent cash rewards and average to high-quality weapons, occasionally offering premium equipment such as legendary weapons, killstreaks, and gas masks.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Legendary</strong>
<ul>
<li>Legendary Supply Boxes have received significant upgrades for a more rewarding experience. These boxes guarantee top-tier weapons and some of the best loot available, with increased chances of obtaining substantial cash.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Reusable</strong>
<ul>
<li>These boxes replenish every 90 seconds, serving as an ideal means for players to regain strength in the mid-to-late stages of a match, particularly after returning from the Gulag or redeployment. They supply players with a viable weapon, an armor plate, and some cash to return to combat readiness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Duffel Bags, Medical Cabinets, &amp; Weapon Lockers</strong>
<ul>
<li>These sources of loot have been removed to better service the classic feeling of Verdansk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Second Chance Mechanics</strong>
<ul>
<li>The following items have been removed from loot:
<ul>
<li>Gulag Tokens</li>



<li>Reinforcement Flares</li>



<li>Redeploy Tokens</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>The only available methods to return after death are:
<ul>
<li>Gulag Victories</li>



<li>Buy Station Buybacks</li>



<li>Jail Break Public Events</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Self-Revive Kit</strong>
<ul>
<li>Self-revives can only be acquired via the following sources:
<ul>
<li>Legendary Supply Boxes → Random drop</li>



<li>Scavenger Contract → Random drop</li>



<li>Buy Station → $4,000</li>



<li>Fire Sale → Free</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Loot Angle</strong>
<ul>
<li>Interactions now require more precise aiming to reduce accidental item pickups, resolving most unintended looting situations, such as inadvertently picking up items during reloads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rarity Outlines</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rarity outlines now gradually fade into view only when players are within a logical proximity rather than remaining visible at all distances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="h-new-movement-mechanics-in-verdansk">New Movement Mechanics in Verdansk</h3>



<div><p>The introduction of Black Ops 6’s omni-movement system revolutionized gameplay and has become the foundation of player movement in Call of Duty: Warzone. While the system launched with multiplayer-inspired values, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-3-returns-to-verdansk-with-new-movement-changes/">we’ve recognized the need for adjustments</a> to better align movement dynamics with the unique demands of Call of Duty: Warzone’s limited-life modes.</p><p>Season 03 focuses on fine-tuning the Black Ops 6 player movement by ensuring a balance between fluidity and responsiveness. The adjustments to the movement mechanics are as follows:</p></div>



<ul>
<li><strong>Movement Speed</strong>
<ul>
<li>Crouch Movement Speed reduced by 10%</li>



<li>Crouch-to-Stand Speed increased by 15%</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Omni-sprint Side &amp; Back Speed Scaling&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reduced by 8.5%, to better balance strafe movement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Slide Friction</strong>
<ul>
<li>Increased by 4% to reduce overly slippery engagements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-warzone-contracts-in-verdansk">Warzone Contracts in Verdansk</h3>

<h2 id="h-warzone-ranked-play-season-03-update">Warzone Ranked Play Season 03 Update</h2>



<p>Now that Season 02 has officially wrapped up, Ranked Play will be temporarily offline during the first half of Season 03. This downtime will give players a much-awaited opportunity to rediscover and relearn Verdansk before diving back into the competition.</p>



<p>We plan to bring Ranked Play back online with the Season 03 Reloaded update. Upon its return, all player ranks will undergo a full reset to Bronze, offering everyone equal footing and the excitement to climb back up through the ranks. When Season 04 arrives, we’ll resume the standard soft reset, pulling players back by only a few ranks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you for your patience during this transition period – now go drop into Verdansk and have fun!</p>



<p><strong>That’s everything you could ever want to know about the Season 03 patch notes! Happy hunting.</strong></p>

<p>When it peaked, Warzone was the most popular battle royale game in the world. In the years that followed, the genre wavered slightly, and Warzone took a bit of a nosedive in terms of the overall player count. Verdansk might be back, but players are still concerned it won’t be enough, prompting them to ask, ‘When is Warzone going offline?’</p>



<p>It’s a fair question – if the game isn’t successful for long enough, it’ll be dropped by Activision as it’ll become a bit of a money sink. If you’ve been wondering when Warzone is going offline, read on.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-why-is-warzone-offline">Why is Warzone Offline?</h2>



<p>Let’s clear something up straight off the bat.</p>



<p><strong>Warzone is going offline between 9 AM PT on April 2 and 9 AM PT on April 3.</strong> If you try to access Warzone in that 24-hour window, you’ll be unsuccessful. This is because Activision’s teams will be busy altering the game immeasurably and bringing back Verdansk.</p>



<p>If you’ve tried to log in and have found that Warzone is down <strong>right now</strong>, it’s probably because of that.</p>



<p>Are you looking for a PST to BST conversion, British Call of Duty fans?</p>



<p><strong>Warzone will be offline between 5 PM BST on April 2 and 5 PM BST on April 3</strong>. Aren’t I considerate?</p>



<h2 id="h-are-warzone-servers-offline">Are Warzone Servers Offline?</h2>



<p>If you want to check whether the Warzone servers are down, you can check the <a href="https://support.activision.com/onlineservices">Call of Duty status page</a> hosted by Activision. This is the quickest way to check the Warzone server status.</p>



<p>Failing that, you can check social media. If there’s a problem, it’ll surface on platforms like Reddit and Twitter (X) quickly enough.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-play-when-warzone-is-offline">What to Play When Warzone is Offline</h2>



<p>If you’re hurting for some Call of Duty action while Warzone is offline between April 2 – 3, you can jump onto Black Ops 6, which will be undergoing a 24-hour freeplay window.</p>



<p>In this 24-hour window, you’ll be able to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-kilo-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/">unlock the Kilo 141</a>, one of the most popular Warzone weapons <strong>ever</strong>, and from there, you’ll be free to grind it to level it up in the game’s multiplayer playlists.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-new-warzone-map-come-out">When Does The New Warzone Map Come Out?</h2>



<p>The ‘new’ Warzone map, which is a re-release of Verdansk, will come out on April 3 at 9 AM PT / 5 PM BST.</p>



<p>Verdansk hasn’t been seen in Warzone since December 2021, and fans have been eager to get back to it since it was removed from the map rotation. It has been recreated from the ground up by Activision’s teams, and it looks fantastic at first blush.</p>



<p>Movement mechanics have been adjusted, retro weapons have been added into the pool, and some of the most popular contracts and other features have been brought back <strong>just for Verdansk</strong>.</p>



<p>What a time to be a Call of Duty: Warzone fan.</p>



<p>Let me know what you’re looking forward to most about Verdansk in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-console-players-switch-off-crossplay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warzone-console-players-can-finally-switch-off-crossplay.1150617/</guid>

<p>One of the most asked-for changes to Call of Duty Warzone arrives with Season 03, which drops tomorrow, April 2. In this long-awaited update, console-based Warzone players will <strong>finally </strong>be able to switch off crossplay functionality in regular multiplayer matchmaking.</p>



<p>That means that they can remove any chance of connecting with PC players, which eradicates a fair portion of the user base that engages in nefarious practices like <strong>cheating</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-long-time-coming">Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-03-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> breaking down the Season 03 patch notes, it was confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In Season 03, we’re giving console players more granular options by separating the MP Ranked Play and Call of Duty: Warzone Ranked Play settings and adding a new Multiplayer-only setting for Quickplay, Featured, and Party Games matches.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This means that console players will be able to <strong>switch off crossplay in Warzone </strong>for regular multiplayer matches.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-turn-off-crossplay-in-warzone">How to Turn Off Crossplay in Warzone</h3>



<p>To switch off crossplay in Warzone on console, you’ll need to navigate to the network settings menu and select ‘Cross-Play Off’. This will lock your selection unless the following happens:</p>



<ul>
<li>If you play with a mixed-platform party, your settings will be temporarily adjusted to ‘Cross-Play On’</li>



<li>If you play with at least <strong>one </strong>PC player, your settings will be temporarily adjusted to ‘Cross-Play On’</li>
</ul>



<p>Once your party returns to a single platform, your settings will automatically update to reflect your original choice.</p>



<p>Activision has warned that locking your matchmaking mechanics to a single platform might negatively impact your queue times, but that’s a small price to pay for feeling a little safer while playing Warzone on console.</p>



<h3 id="h-when-does-the-new-warzone-map-come-out">When Does The New Warzone Map Come Out?</h3>



<p>If you’re eager to switch off crossplay and dive into Verdansk, the new Warzone map, you don’t have long to wait. It’ll drop in Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3 at 9 am PST / 5 pm BST.</p>



<p>It has been several years since Verdansk was last in Warzone, and it’s expected to be a resurgence of sorts (no pun intended) for the popular battle royale map.</p>



<p>Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> how much of a W this crossplay decision is.</p>

<p>It was recently discovered that one of the most popular Warzone emotes is returning with the Season 03 update. It’ll be tucked into the battle pass, so you’re guaranteed to unlock it if you play enough. If you were around during the peak of Warzone when Verdansk first existed, you’ll recognise how humorous this emote can be.</p>



<p>That’s right – <strong>the middle finger emote is coming back to Warzone</strong>.</p>



<p>But there’s a catch.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-crank-job">Crank Job</h2>



<p>The ‘Crank Job’ middle finger emote was a fan-favourite when it first emerged in Warzone. It allowed players to rebel against their opponents one last time as they lay bleeding out on the floor. It was great fun when fused with killcams, which is why it rapidly became one of the most popular emotes in the game.</p>



<p>It was recently revealed that the middle finger emote will return to Warzone in the Season 03 battle pass.</p>



<p>There’s a catch, unfortunately. </p>



<p>It has been mentioned that it’s a third-person variant of the Crank Job emote, which might eradicate any sense of whimsy attached to popping it once you’ve downed an enemy. I’m willing to hold out hope that it’ll be as funny as ever, but the third-person aspect might have ruined it a bit.</p>



<p>Here’s what everyone’s favourite Warzone emote used to look like:</p>



<div><article><p><span>A 3rd Person Version of the ‘Middle Finger’ Emote is RETURNING in the </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BlackOps6</a><span> Warzone Season 3 Battlepass 😭 </span></p></article></div>







<p>There will be plenty more to unlock in the Season 03 battle pass in Black Ops 6 and Warzone, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/r0-z3-skin-call-of-duty-controversial-paywall/">a new Roze skin</a>, the AMAX, and the HDR sniper rifle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/coyote-vs-acme-fuck-david-zaslav<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/coyote-vs-acme-update-offers-warner-bros/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> an excellent report on The Wrap revealed that</a>, despite initially walking back its decision, Warner Bros. is indeed intent on throwing <em>Coyote vs Acme</em>--a funded, shot and completed motion picture--in the trash. Not because it sucks, but to save some money on taxes.</p><p>It's not the first time this has happened recently--"content" ranging<a href="https://gizmodo.com/disney-streaming-cuts-tax-writeoffs-1850502594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> from Disney TV shows</a> to a <em>Batgirl </em>movie has met with the same fate--but this one stung a little more. Disney and HBO removing TV shows that people had already had a chance to see was one thing, and <em>Batgirl</em><a href="https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/film/batgirl-movie-so-bad-not-releasable-says-dc-studios-3390857#:~:text='Batgirl'%20movie%20was%20so%20bad%20it%20was%20%E2%80%9Cnot,releasable%E2%80%9D%2C%20says%20DC%20Studios%20boss&amp;text=Leslie%20Grace%20as%20'Batgirl'%20CREDIT,Grace%2C%20Brandon%20Fraser%20and%20J.K." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em> </em>was reportedly also very bad</a>, which was another.</p><p>But <em>Coyote vs Acme</em> has been seen by <em>nobody</em>. The movie--directed by Dave Green, written by <em>May December's</em> Samy Burch, produced by (among others) James Gunn and starring characters that define Warner Bros.' entire existence--was paid for, is finished, is ready to be seen, and now it stands a very real chance of being deleted forever, just to save a company some money.</p><p>It's an incredibly dystopian situation we all find ourselves in, where art is only made to be fed into a woodchipper to serve shareholders, and it's one<a href="https://www.looper.com/1161829/hollywood-creatives-are-breathing-fire-over-the-current-trend-of-tv-tax-write-offs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> that's been covered extensively elsewhere</a>, so I'm not going to get into the reeds over the politics and economics of the decision here.</p><p>What I am going to say, though, is that if you work at Warner Bros., or anywhere related to Warner Bros., and you have any access to this movie whatsoever, it's your moral imperative to leak it to the world before it's too late.

<p>It’s no April Fool’s Day joke: Valve has dropped their latest Counter-Strike 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/529842339955343453" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update</a> on March 31st, featuring a handful of new weapon skins and a “clean up” Inferno and Train. It’s no brand new operation, but it’s a pretty sizable update to CS2 compared to others.</p>



<h2 id="h-counter-strike-2-march-31st-update-new-changes">Counter-Strike 2 March 31st Update – New Changes</h2>



<p>The CS2 weekly care package feature now includes three new weapon collections added to the drop list: Ascent, Boreal, and Radiant. The new collections have added “over 70 new [weapon] finishes,” featuring a wide variety of styles. It doesn’t appear that players will get to choose which weapon collection their weekly care package skin comes from, but it does increase the variety of skins that appear.</p>



<p>New skins aren’t exclusive to just the weekly care package for this update. A new case and a new weapon skin collection have been added to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-the-armory-update-charms-battle-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Armory</a>. Players can acquire the Fever case from the Armory page for two credits. By purchasing a Fever case key, players can open their case for a chance at the AWP Printstream or get extremely lucky and open one of several Shattered Web knives in Chroma finishes. Players can also spend four Armory credits to get one random skin from the new Train collection. The “limited edition” item has also been swapped out, and players can save 15 credits for one of the XM1014 Solitude variants. This items will be removed from the Armory on Sunday, July 13.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As for gameplay changes, Inferno and Train and have been hit with some “spring cleaning.” Both maps now feature some “cleaner surfaces, less clutter,” and a noticeably wider Banana section (B Main area) on Inferno specifically.</p>

According to the post, the layoffs are due to the fact that the company has completed one of its "mandates," and presumably has no other work to reassign the employees to.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>"Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members, as one of our mandates is coming to an end," the statement reads. "It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>"These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market, and we are working to support them through this transition."</span></span></p>

<p>Fable, set for release in 2026.</p>

</article><p><span><span>The statement goes on to mention that, despite laying off people related to that former, unnamed mandate, "Eidos-Montréal stays committed to deliver its other projects currently in development." The only public project the developer is currently working on is Fable, which it's assisting the main team at Playground on, but it's unclear whether that's a project Eidos-Montréal will continue to work on or the mandate it recently completed.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Over the past few years, layoffs have decimated the gaming workforce, affecting tens of thousands of people. The last news story posted on </span></span><span><span>Game Informer</span></span><span><span> before our closure last year was about </span></span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/31/bungie-lays-off-over-200-employees-announces-plans-for-deeper-integration-with-sony"><span><span><span><span>200 people losing their jobs at Bungie</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>.

Although he, unsurprisingly, doesn’t spill the beans on the release date, Zelnick provided some insight into Take-Two and Rockstar’s reasoning for keeping fans waiting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of the interview, Zelnick was asked the million-dollar question: when is GTA VI launching and why is Take-Two/Rockstar keeping it such a big secret? Zelnick responded:</p>

<p>“The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I’ve ever seen for an entertainment property. And I’ve been around the block a few times, and I’ve been in every entertainment business there is. We want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement. And we do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance, and we’ve found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement, on the one hand, and balance the excitement on that anticipation. And we don’t always get it exactly right, but that’s what we’re trying to do.”</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0M53-LKlECk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Earlier in the interview, Zelnick was asked to explain the 12-year wait between GTA V, released in 2013, and GTA VI, providing additional context for Rockstar’s release cadence:</p>

<p>“Well, there are really two reasons,” says Zelnick. “We set an intention to rest our intellectual properties. So some of our competitors come to market very regularly, maybe even annually, with their titles. We only annualize our sports entertainment titles. For our non-sports titles, we think you need to create enormous anticipation, on the one hand. And of course on the other hand, it takes a long time to develop these big robust experiences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rockstar Games seeks perfection in what they do, and perfection’s a pretty high bar. It takes a long time. And the reflection of that approach is in the success of Grand Theft Auto V, which has actually excelled in three console generations, which is extraordinary…so think of the high bar that that creates for us, of course, but much more so for the consumer.”</p>

</article><p>Grand Theft Auto VI was announced in December 2023. Set in a modern-day Vice City (which is modeled after Miami and South Florida), it appears to star two protagonists, including the series' first female lead, although Rockstar has not yet divulged details on these characters or their relationship with each other. The reveal trailer became a massive success, <a href="https://gameinformer.dev.anyforsoft.com/news/2023/12/06/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-surpasses-100-million-views-breaks-record-for-most">garnering over 100 million views</a> in just a few days and setting a YouTube record for most views within a 24-hour period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is slated to release sometime this year on consoles. A PC version has yet to be confirmed, though if it does launch on the platform, it will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025?utm_source=threads,twitter">likely arrive later</a>.

                <p>Henk Rogers isn't a household name, but he should be.

Whether it's programming his first big game in Japan, creating the Tetris Company, or negotiating with other creators and brands, there's never a dull moment. You'll also get a glimpse at how he's pushing for the use of renewable energy and the many international awards he's accrued over the years.</p><p>Of course, Tetris is a big focus of the book, so there's no shortage of wild stories for you to unravel. This includes tense negotiations with a Soviet Union company before finding a way to market the puzzle game to the masses.

Both take a closer look at Alexey Pajitnov, the original creator of Tetris, and the winding road it took to bring the puzzle game to a wider audience.</p><p>Consider filling up your bookcase with other gaming stories, as there are a bunch of great options up for grabs. Whether you want to learn more about CliffyB and the creation of Gears of War, how Reggie helped guide Nintendo of America during his tenure as president, or explore the complex history of Doom, you'll find plenty of great options at Amazon.</p><p>Best of all, many of these are currently on sale for great low prices.</p><h2>More Video Game Books</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Control-Freak-Adventure-Jackrabbit-Fortnite/dp/1982149159?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Control Freak: Cliff "CliffyB" Bleszinski</a> -- $13.29 (<del>$19</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1400226678?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Disrupting the Game: Reggie Fils-Aime</a> -- $17 (<del>$28</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/141975811X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Doom Guy: Life in First Person</a> -- $18.81 (<del>$30</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812972155?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire</a> -- $16.79 (<del>$20</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1324005874?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sid Meier's Memoir: A Life in Computer Games</a> -- $23 (<del>$28</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Prince-Persia-Journals-1985-1993-Illustrated/dp/0578627310?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Making of Prince of Persia</a> -- $14.21 (<del>$23</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Karateka-Journals-1982-1985/dp/1480297232?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Making of Karateka</a> -- $17</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Replay-Memoir-Uprooted-Jordan-Mechner/dp/1250873754?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Replay: Memoir of an Uprooted Family</a> -- $15.80 (<del>$30</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Significant-Zero-Heroes-Villains-Fight/dp/1501129953?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Significant Zero: Heroes, Villains, and the Fight for Art and Soul in Video Games</a> -- $6.77</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062276700?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Console Wars: Sega, Nintendo, and the Battle that Defined a Generation</a> -- $12.50 (<del>$20</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062651234?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blood, Sweat, and Pixels: Stories Behind How Games Are Made</a> -- $10.53 (<del>$19</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538735490?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Press Reset: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry</a> -- $11.79 (<del>$20</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1538725428?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment</a> -- $15.59 (<del>$30</del>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-sci-fi-and-fantasy-spring-book-sale-save-big-on-popular-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon Sci-Fi And Fantasy Spring Book Sale - Save Big On Popular Box Sets</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-sean-connery-4k-steelbook-collection-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6530389/">James Bond Sean Connery 4K Steelbook Collection Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-skywalker-saga-4k-box-set-featured-in-amazons-spring-sale/1100-6530379/">Star Wars Skywalker Saga 4K Box Set Featured In Amazon's Spring Sale</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp;

            <p>
Eidos-Montréal, the Embracer-owned studio currently providing support on Microsoft's Fable reboot, is laying off "up to" 75 members of staff, saying it doesn't "have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services."
</p>
<p>
News of the layoffs - which follows 97 job cuts at Eidos-Montréal last year - was confirmed in a <a href="https://x.com/EidosMontreal/status/1906728993061020142">statement shared on social media</a>. "Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members," the studio wrote, "as one of our mandates is coming to an end. It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don't have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services.
</p>
<p>
"These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market," the statement continued, "and we are working to support them through this transition. Eidos-Montréal stays committed to deliver its other projects currently in development."
</p>
<p>
Eidos-Montréal's most recent game, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, released in 2021 when the studio was still owned by publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>. Following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sells-off-western-studios-and-ip-including-tomb-raider-and-deus-ex">purchase by Embracer Group in 2022</a>, however, it was reportedly set to work creating a new game in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> series - a project that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-cancels-deus-ex-game-in-development-for-two-years">canned last year amid a devastating programme of "restructuring" and cost cutting at Embracer Group</a> that resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">over 4500 job losses across the company</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, it's been confirmed Eidos-Montréal is assisting Microsoft's Playground Games as the Xbox studio attempts to get its long-awaited - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-fable-reboot-delayed-into-next-year">recently delayed</a> - Fable reboot over the finish line. Today's statement suggests Fable isn't Eidos-Montréal's only project, but it's unclear what else the studio may be working on at present.
</p>
<p>
Layoffs have continued to blight the games industry in 2025 following an already devastating few years which have seen over 25,000 employees lose their jobs since the start of 2023. So far this year, <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">1200 layoffs have been recorded</a>, affecting workers across the likes of Unity, PlayStation, Ubisoft, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a>, Sumo Digital, Splash Damage, Bossa Studios, Night School, and Cyan, Inc. Results of a GDC State of the Games Industry survey shared earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gdcs-state-of-the-games-industry-survey-says-one-in-ten-respondents-laid-off-in-2024">revealed one in 10 of the 3000 developers canvassed were laid off in 2024</a>.

                <p>ROG has released a brand new teaser trailer for a seemingly new handheld device that it's working on. Though this announcement is exciting as is, the official Xbox X account offered a cheeky response to the trailer, fueling rumors that a collaboration between the two companies could be in the works.</p><p>Originally shown on Twitter, ROG's trailer shows a the company's mascot, Omni, messing with some sort of technological chamber. When it goes inside, the machine's shaking causes a ROG Ally and a controller to fly into the chamber with it. Unable to stop the process, Omni then emerges from the chamber, merged with the handheld and controller, hinting at some sort of new handheld in production.</p><p>Xbox then <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1906769447341510708" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded to the trailer with a meme,</a> seemingly confirming that it's involved somehow.</p><p>There have been reports of an Xbox handheld in the works, and that Microsoft would be working with third-party vendors in order to make them. This initiative is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-planned-for-later-this-year-report/1100-6530020/" data-ref-id="1100-6530020">reportedly called Project Kennan,</a> could very well be the same handheld device ROG is teasing in its latest trailer.</p><p>In other Xbox news, Microsoft is also reportedly developing its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">next generation console already</a>. According to current rumors, the system will reportedly be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-might-not-be-a-traditional-console-may-launch-in-2027-per-insider/1100-6529996/" data-ref-id="1100-6529996">more like a PC than a traditional console</a> and is scheduled for a 2027 launch. It's also possible that this handheld could be a stepping stone to see if Microsoft could create a first-party handheld for the next Xbox like Valve with the Steam Deck or Sony with the PlayStation Portal.</p>

With the launch of Season 3 and return of Verdansk, Activision is looking to crack down on cheaters and provide a hacker-free experience for players. Part of this change will finally give console players the ability to turn off cross-play in standard Black Ops 6 multiplayer matches, as this feature was previously only available to disable in Ranked Play mode.</p>

            <p>
Following recent claims Microsoft's much-rumoured handheld Xbox will arrive later this year in collaboration with an unspecified "PC gaming OEM", hardware manufacturer ASUS has shared a teaser trailer suggesting the machine is real and set to be revealed soon.
</p>
<p>
Word that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">Microsoft was partnering with a third-party company to release an Xbox-branded handheld this year</a> first surfaced via Windows Central, which reported the device was being developed under the codename Keenan and would look "unmistakably 'Xbox'", sporting familiar design sensibilities and even an Xbox guide button.
</p>
<p>
Skip ahead a couple of weeks and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXzXhezpSF4">ASUS has now shared a teaser</a> for what appears to be its next-generation ASUS ROG Ally gaming handheld - a video that doesn't perhaps <em>immediately</em> scream Xbox with its magenta hues and weird dabbing robot. However, at one point during its brisk runtime, a ROG Ally and Xbox-style controller are seen hurtling through the air before disappearing into a machine where some sort of fusing process unfolds.

<p>
The inference is clear enough, but Microsoft's involvement in the project was seemingly all but confirmed when Xbox's official social media account <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1906769447341510708">replied to ASUS' teaser post</a> with the side-eye monkey meme. Obviously, all this stays in the 'speculation' bucket until either party is ready to go beyond memes and teases, but the pieces are undoubtedly starting to fall into place.
</p>
<p>
According to Windows Central's previous report, this year's Xbox-branded handheld will be something of a stop gap while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">Microsoft continues developing its own Xbox gaming handheld</a> internally. The company's said to be targeting a 2027 launch for this other machine, which will reportedly arrive alongside an Xbox Series X/S successor and "several new controller options".
</p>
<p>
However things pan out, it's a pretty exciting time in the world of handheld gaming - not least because <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-prepping-playstation-5-portable-plans-to-battle-nintendos-handheld-dominance">Sony is reportedly also working on its own handheld device</a> in the form of portable PS5, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Nintendo's hugely anticipated Switch 2 is just days away from its big reveal</a>.

It’s an enormous wave of tweaks and additions across all of Black Ops 6’s modes, giving players everything they could ever hope to know about how Call of Duty will change when Season 3 launches on Wednesday, April 2, at 9am PT.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Headlines from the Black Ops 6 Season 3 patch notes include crossplay tweaks that allow console players to individually adjust the player pool option in both ranked and non-ranked modes. It’s a change that, as Activision admits, could negatively impact matchmaking queue times for those who turn crossplay off, but it’s at least another option for those looking to tailor their experience to include – or exclude – players on all platforms, all consoles, or only their preferred console of choice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shotguns, meanwhile, are coming out of the Black Ops 6 update as big winners, as the weapon class is receiving a small blanket buff for nearly all weapons’ damage, range, and rate of fire. This is all in addition to brand-new content, including the return of classic Multiplayer map Firing Range, the reintroduction of the Kilo 141 assault rifle, and a familiar Scorestreak in the Death Machine.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zombies players have plenty to chomp down on, too, starting with the biggest highlight with its new map, Shattered Veil. The Raygun Mark II is also here with three new variants to explode zombies with, with fan-favorite Perk-A-Cola Double Tap also back from previous games. Both Multiplayer and Zombies have also been stuffed with a variety of bug fixes and adjustments to ensure the experience stays smooth when launch arrives.</p><div id="black-ops-6-tier-list-best-guns-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Black Ops 6 Tier List: Best Guns Ranked</h3><h3>Black Ops 6 Tier List: Best Guns Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Warzone patch notes get special treatment this time around, as Season 3 will soon usher in the return of one of the most important maps in Call of Duty history: Verdansk. Set to launch one day later, April 3, the Warzone Season 3 update mostly focuses on giving longtime fans a classic coat of paint that reverts some features back to their launch state from 2020.

Buy Stations, for example, now feature that OG, vertical UI design for a more streamlined purchasing process in the heat of battle but also come with added features, including a Redeploy All option. Veteran players will also notice that the Precision Airstrike will be much harder to dodge, as its mini-map notification has been removed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have removed the Precision Airstrike’s approximate path indicator on the mini-map in order to return back to how it worked in 2020, where part of its purpose was to surprise your enemies,” the patch notes explain. “We will monitor feedback, data and sentiment on this as we look to the weeks ahead.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 3 launches in just a few days.

Watch for crossfire down the long center Road as Operators fight for control of the vantage points in the Tower and the upper levels of the Shoot House and Garage. Shooting targets move back and forth on their tracks behind the Office and several other spots adding a useful diversion while preparing for the next fight. Avoid the center chaos by branching off to the Dirt Road, keeping your guard up against ambush as you pass the Storage unit along the way.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Barrage (6v6)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Revisit 1968 Vietnam as you follow Hudson’s clues surrounding one Summit Watch at the front lines of battle. The trees have been cleared and the landscape flattened to make room for this base housing an artillery battery in active combat. The area has taken hits with large chunks blown off buildings including the Command Center and Barracks, the damage opening new pathways through the map.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Nomad (6v6, 2v2)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Pantheon moles were in Afghanistan, too, when Woods fought there in 1986.

Built exclusively for military use, the standard issue rifle is deadly at mid-range combat and easily configured for a variety of assault tactics.</li><li>Combining high-damage hits with a fast fire rate and good handling, the CR-56 AMAX is the perfect mid-range weapon for downing targets fast. Eliminate enemies in three to four shots up to 25 meters out, leaving plenty left over to chew through equipped armor. Quick reloads get you back into the action fast, a helpful trait no matter how you choose to customize the weapon via Gunsmith.</li></ul></li><li><strong>HDR - Sniper Rifle (Battle Pass)</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Anti-material bolt action sniper rifle chambered in 12.7 x 108mm ammunition.

More details on the thinking behind the change can be found below.
