            <p>
A couple of weeks after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">arguing that generative AI shouldn't be considered in videogame reviews</a>, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney is calling for Steam and digital storefronts generally to stop requiring generative AI disclosures. 
</p>
<p>
Sweeney's argument is broadly that all videogames will use generative AI tools at some stage, so you and I might as well stop hearing about it. He thinks tagging things as made with generative AI is only necessary when there's a formal need to prove legal authorship, or help buyers understand whether they have rights to a piece of digital art. There's no sense letting regular old videogame players learn that stuff. It will only make us upset, and possibly less willing to play videogames with generative AI in them, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-voice-actor-union-takes-fortnites-darth-vader-chatbot-to-court">Fortnite</a>.  
</p><!--more-->
<p>
OK, I'm expanding on the material a bit, there. Here's the actual quote from Sweeney, via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/opposing-steams-ai-disclosures-epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-says-game-stores-should-drop-the-ai-tag-because-it-makes-no-sense-when-ai-will-be-involved-in-nearly-all-future-production/">James Radar</a> via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-thinks-stores-like-steam-should-stop-labelling-games-as-being-made-with-ai-it-makes-no-sense-he-says-because-ai-will-be-involved-in-nearly-all-future-production/">Percy Gamer</a> via the endless, crocodilian march of progress. 
</p>
<p>
"The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation," Sweeney wrote on <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312">Xitter</a>, responding to a user who called for Steam and other digital storefronts to eliminate the gen AI labelling. "It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production."
</p><p>
I've already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">ranted at length</a> on these pages about the relationship between the trillion-dollar generative AI industry and layoffs, creative theft, spiking energy consumption, and general misinformation. Sweeney alludes to a couple of these bugbears in his tweet about rights - many of the bigger budget, better-known generative AIs are created by processing vast quantities of human art and discourse without consent, even if you can argue the toss about whether they're actually filching somebody's intellectual property.
</p>
<p>
I do wonder, though, whether I'm most pissed off simply by the fact of some mogul smugly telling me that a certain state of affairs will inevitably come to pass, especially when he stands to benefit as an AI advocate, and especially when he and his fellow farseers at Epic have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-lay-off-830-people-thanks-to-unrealistic-metaverse-ambitions">screwed up their soothsaying catastrophically</a> in recent history.</p>
<p>As with the previous comments about genAI in videogame reviews, the logic here is patently self-serving. Sweeney is telling you not to ask how the sausage was made, because he's got a bunch of them on the barbie. Incidentally, it's estimated that <a href="https://www.farmsanctuary.org/news-stories/2022-ag-census-factory-farms-expanding/">about 99% of livestock in the USA were factory-farmed in 2022</a>, but you shouldn't have to worry your little head about that when you're deciding whether to buy a hot dog. 
</p>
<p>
I do agree that Steam's generative AI policy requires a change, inasmuch as the majority of disclosures <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">are so vague as to be fundamentally useless</a>, revealing neither the exact choice of genAI tools, nor the materials from which they derive their probabilistic outputs, or when, where and how exactly they were used in development. 
</p><p>
The Steam disclosure for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Arc Raiders</a>, for example, explains that "during the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team." It took <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-doesnt-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-embark-clarifies-thats-a-research-project-and-not-something-that-were-using-in-the-game-now">a proper interview</a> with developers Embark to learn that the game makes use of text-to-speech tools for voiced barks, and machine learning procedures for arachnid robot animations. You may not be fussed about those applications for generative AI, but you can't make that call if you don't know about it.

            <title><![CDATA[Apple Sends Millions of MacBook Air to Amazon for Black Friday, M4 Model at Zero-Profit Pricing Defies Logic]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-sends-millions-of-macbook-air-to-amazon-for-black-friday-m4-model-at-zero-profit-pricing-defies-logic-2000648128</link>
            <guid>1366681</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple releases new MacBook iterations almost annually with more powerful custom silicon that pushes performance boundaries forward. <strong>March brought the MacBook Air with M4 chip</strong>, succeeding the previous M3 generation through enhanced efficiency and AI capabilities.</p>
<p>Each year follows the same pattern where Apple maintains strict full pricing across official channels to preserve premium brand positioning. But today, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/">at $749, down from $999, this marks the first time Apple has authorized Amazon to sell the 256GB MacBook Air M4</a> at razor-thin or potentially zero profit margins for Black Friday. The <strong>25% discount</strong> represents unprecedented accessibility to current-generation MacBooks that typically resist price reductions for years after launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultra-Portable Computing</h2>
<p>The <strong>M4 processor has an 8-core CPU and an 8-core GPU</strong> architecture that can handle professional workflows while being fanless and weighing less than 3 pounds. The improved Neural Engine processes Apple Intelligence features on the device which keeps data private because it doesn’t send it to cloud servers where third parties could get to sensitive information. The fanless cooling works well enough because the processor doesn’t get too hot even when it’s under a lot of stress: This makes it quiet, which professionals like when they’re working with clients or in the library.</p>



<p>The <strong>16GB unified memory is a big improvement</strong> over the old 8GB base configurations which made it hard for users to run more than one program at a time. This memory architecture lets<strong> the CPU and GPU share RAM</strong> which gets rid of the performance problems that happen when separate components copy data between different memory pools. The memory bandwidth sends data to processors quickly enough to keep them running at their best, instead of waiting for slow memory access that slows down less powerful systems.</p>
<p>The <strong>13.6-inch Liquid Retina display has great picture quality thanks to mini-LED backlighting</strong> that lets it reach 500 nits brightness and supports the P3 wide color gamut. This level of brightness makes it easy to see outside in direct sunlight, where regular laptop screens wash out completely. The color accuracy is also good enough for professional photo and video editing without needing extra monitors<strong>. True Tone technology changes the white balance based on the light around you</strong> to make it easier on your eyes when you use it for a long time.</p>



<p>The <strong>M4 chip and optimized macOS power management</strong> that changes performance based on workload demands make the battery last 15 to 18 hours during normal mixed use. <strong>Video playback can last up to 20 hours</strong> but tasks that use a lot of power, like rendering video, drain batteries faster but still give you a lot of time to use them without plugging them in. This long battery life lets you work on the go instead of just using a laptop that is tethered to a power source and covers full workdays and evenings without having to worry about running out of battery.</p>
<p>The <strong>integration of the ecosystem with the iPhone</strong> makes workflows easier with features like Universal Clipboard, which lets you copy text or images from your iPhone and paste them directly into your Mac. Handoff lets you switch between devices in the middle of a task, and FaceTime and Messages keep conversations going no matter which device you pick up. And AirDrop lets you send files between Apple devices right away.</p>
<p>For $749, the MacBook Air M4 with 256GB has the latest Apple Silicon, a 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display and a battery that lasts all day. This Black Friday, it’s 25% off the regular price. Apple’s authorization for Amazon to sell at minimal margins creates exceptional value that rarely occurs on current MacBooks. If you want Apple’s latest ultra-portable without paying full premium pricing, <strong>this record-low deal is the best MacBook value available</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/googles-newest-and-best-pixel-watch-is-100-off-for-the-first-time-this-black-friday-at-amazon-2000647344</link>
            <guid>1366678</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of 2025’s best Android smartwatches has just become one of the best Black Friday deals of the week. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/">The 41mm version of the outstanding Google Pixel Watch 4 is 22% off at Amazon, bringing it to an all-time low price of just $350.</a> The best-in-class display jumps out at you immediately, being 50% brighter than the previous model of the Pixel Watch, and its Gemini AI integration comes into play early and often to enhance the user experience.</p>
<p>As a fitness watch, the Pixel Watch 4 is among the very best, with amazing accuracy in measuring and evaluating your exercise. It’s also an elite-level health and sleep tracker, easily in the same class as the best Apple Watches and Samsung Galaxy Watches. All of its features are bolstered by the outstanding battery life of the Pixel Watch 4 — 40 hours per charge in standard mode and 72 hours in low-power mode, with the ability to get back to 50% strength after just 15 minutes on Google’s new side charger, and all the way from 0 to 100% in roughly 45 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy on the Eyes</h2>
<p>It’s impossible to look past the face of the Google Pixel Watch 4, which is an enormous upgrade from previous models. The first-of-its-kind Actua 360 display lives beneath a dome of sturdy scratch-resistant 3D Corning Gorilla Glass 5, and is 10% larger and 50% brighter than the Pixel Watch 3 — up to 3,000 brilliant nits, which can be lowered to as little as a single nit when you need to keep things dark. It’s a 320 ppi AMOLED screen that’s remarkably easy to see even in bright sun, and highly reactive as a touchscreen for ease of control.</p>
<p>Beneath the Actua 360 display lives the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 processor and Cortex M55 co-processor, which drives all of the Pixel Watch 4’s many features and keeps them moving with smooth, seamless, pro-level speed. That’s handy whether you’re using any of the 40+ exercise modes for a workout, the dual-frequency GPS for accurate location, or the Gemini AI as a hands-free assistant for pretty much anything you ask of it.</p>



<h2>An Actual Fixable Smartwatch</h2>
<p>What do you do when your smartwatch’s battery fails, or when its display gets cracked or damaged? Most likely you shop for a new one while hoping against hope for a semi-reasonable trade-in deal to lessen the blow. The Google Pixel Watch 4’s battery is replaceable, as it its display. You can’t do it yourself at home, but it can be shipped to Google or taken to a certified Google repair technician for a fix. Of course, with its robust battery and Gorilla Glass-encased display combined with IP68 water and dust resistance, the odds are low you’ll need to seek service, but it does provide peace of mind.</p>
<p>Need a Cliff’s Notes rundown of the Pixel Watch 4’s many fitness features? How about Daily Readiness score, real-time run guidance, Morning Brief, Heart Zone Training, Cardio fitness score, Calorie Tracking, and Floors Climbed? That’s maybe a third of them, just to give you an idea of how impressive the Pixel Watch 4 is if you’re thinking about a new workout watch. And now’s the time to make that upgrade, thanks to the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/">22% off Black Friday sale at Amazon that makes the Google Pixel Watch 4 a total steal at just $350.</a></p>

<p>Battlefield 6 developers have stated that in-game audio issues will receive a “full pass” to solve them. </p>



<p>EA’s Battlefield 6 has been out for close to two months now, and the game has already received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-drops-to-half-price-for-black-friday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive discount</a> due to a Black Friday mega sale on one platform. However, as sales and marketing for the title progress, the developers are also constantly working to resolve issues, and now they have set their sights on BF6’s in-game audio problems. </p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-in-game-audio-issues-will-receive-a-full-pass-for-fixes">Battlefield 6 In-Game Audio Issues Will Receive a ‘Full Pass’ for Fixes</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/some-battlefield-6-players-still-cant-hear-enemies-creeping-up-on-them-so-devs-are-doing-a-full-pass-to-fix-niggling-sound-issues-for-good-hoping-we-can-share-more-details-on-that-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Florian Le Bihan, principal game designer, recently responded to a comment on <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1993685559462527420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) about fixing footstep audio issues in Battlefield 6. Le Bihan stated that “the entire in-game audio is receiving a full pass to solve those issues, including fixing some issues that caused some sounds to completely cut.” The principal designer added that they are still working on the problems and verifying the changes, and they hope to share more details soon. </p>



<p>Florian Le Bihan also spoke about Battlefield 6’s mouse-and-keyboard issues in the same thread. He first confirmed that fine-tuning mouse sensitivity “broke with the last update” and will be fixed in the upcoming patch. For keyboards, he was asked whether Class-related keybinds can be removed, and Le Bihan confirmed that those buttons will be removed from the keyboard after the next patch. </p>

            <guid>1366645</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Niko Partners, the analytics firm covering the video game industry in Asia and MENA markets, published <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-news/">its latest weekly report</a>, which points to a potential source of problems for the Japanese video game market. As geopolitical tensions between Japan and China continue to rise, China might be inclined to take retaliatory actions, like starting to deny approval of Japanese games.</p>



<p>According to Niko Partners, "<em>Japan is the single largest source of import game approvals to China</em>, <em>accounting for roughly 30% of all licensed foreign titles over the past two years</em>." We know that China is a massive market that any publisher would want to be able to crack, since that would be millions of potential players. </p>



<p>Though the firm clarifies that there's been no indication China would stop approving games from Japan, it's definitely a possibility, and would be a huge blow to Japanese developers and publishers who have much of their business tied to Chinese players.</p>



<p>Issues between the two nations are currently rising due to comments from Japan's Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, who recently suggested, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-diplomat-dissatisfied-japan-talks-000859056.html?guccounter=1">per Bloomberg</a>, that Japan could interfere with China attempting to reunify Taiwan.</p>



<p>China has now called on Japan to retract the comments, and has already begun taking actions such as having flights cancelled and travel advisories issued on travel to Japan, suspending the importing of Japanese seafood, and pausing the approval of Japanese films.</p>



<p>With film approvals already getting paused, it's not a huge leap to imagine video games are next. We'll see how the rest of it continues to unfold, but if their relationship continues to decline, then it'll likely be quite some time <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">before we see the Nintendo Switch 2 make it over to China.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> hasn't sold as well as publishers Paradox predicted. As such, the company have announced plans to write-down 355 million Swedish Krona (approximately £28 million/$37 million) of the game's development costs - essentially the financial way of saying something along the lines of 'oops, this isn't worth as much as we thought it was'.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a <a href="https://news.cision.com/paradox-interactive-ab/r/paradox-interactive-ab-writes-down-msek-355-of-capitalised-development-costs-for-vampire--the-masque,c4273262">notice</a> announcing this write-down Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester said the game's a "strong vampire fantasy" and that Paradox are pleased with the work that's gone into it from developers The Chinese Room. As such, the finger of blame's being pointed at Paradox themselves for having overtly high expectations regarding how well Bloodlines 2 would do financially.</p>
<p>"A month after release we can sadly see that sales do not match our projections, which necessitates the write-down," Wester said. "The responsibility lies fully with us as the publisher. The game is outside of our core areas, in hindsight it is clear that this has made it difficult for us to gauge sales."</p>
<p>Here are the bits which are relevant to those of us who aren't here to look at Paradox's money numbers. In light of this, Wester said the publisher will "evaluate how we best develop" World of Darkness games going forwards, but stressed that Bloodlines 2 will still be getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2s-latest-patch-offers-up-fixes-as-a-roadmap-promises-more-improvements">the additions</a> which have already been set in stone for it. "Our post-release plan remains firm; we will deliver updates and the promised expansions to the game in the coming year," Wester confirmed. So, if you bought the premium edition, you'll still get the two expansions you paid for.</p><p>Paradox's admission here follows departed Chinese Room co-founder Dan Pinchbeck <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-should-have-been-called-something-else-agrees-former-creative-director">recently revealing</a> that the studio started trying to convince the publishers to call the game something other than Bloodlines 2 was a priority for him almost as soon as he became involved in the project, which bumped from studio to studio during development. "I came in and went, 'we can't make Bloodlines 2, we can't make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, but we can make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>," Pinchbeck recalled.</p>
<p>The name didn't change, leaving Bloodlines 2 as a game that in the eyes of many is defined as much by what it isn't as what it is. "The overall problem here is that in a year packed with absolutely amazing games of all shapes and sizes, Bloodlines 2 is merely okay," wrote Dominic Tarason in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">our review</a>. "An entertaining mid-budget way to pass a few evenings in a familiar setting."</p>

But it was actually the obligatory <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em> performance that stole the show. And if you see the Labubu float break containment, well, please call 911. Meanwhile, I’m jealously checking in on everyone else’s <a href="https://x.com/i/lists/1460694648381448196">Black Friday gaming haul</a>. Now let me go check on my candied yams before they burn.</p>

 <h2><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em> is a $37 million flop</h2> <p>Paradox Interactive announced the write-down <a href="https://news.cision.com/paradox-interactive-ab/r/paradox-interactive-ab-writes-down-msek-355-of-capitalised-development-costs-for-vampire--the-masque,c4273262">to investors yesterday</a>. It takes full responsibility for the game’s troubled reception following years of development hell and multiple studios at the helm. The RPG is currently sitting below a 60 percent positive rating on Steam.</p>

 <p><em>“</em>A month after release we can sadly see that sales do not match our projections, which necessitates the write-down. The responsibility lies fully with us as the publisher. The game is outside of our core areas, in hindsight it is clear that this has made it difficult for us to gauge sales. Going forward, we focus our capital to our core segments and, at the same time, we’ll evaluate how we best develop World of Darkness’ strong brand catalogue in the future,” CEO Fredrik Wester said.</p>

 <h2><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> won’t get a second expansion</h2> <p>“As of now at this moment for Year Two there is no expansion on the size of Awaji that is planned currently,” associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois recently told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iijrbz8XBc&amp;t=559s">YouTuber JorRaptor</a>. “We’re still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but it’s not a full-on DLC the way a Season Pass would have had in the previous years. And whether or not this is the the right way to go, I think it’s more an experience we’re trying, to keep things small and reactive and see how the community feels about it.”</p>

 <p>He suggests that the game’s original delay and resources spent on improving the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> engine are the reason a second big DLC felt out of <em>Shadows</em> post-launch roadmap, rather than soft sales or a lack of player interest.</p>

 <h2><em>The Witcher 4</em> won’t be at The Game Awards 2025</h2> <p>“I’m very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards,” CD Projekt Red co-CEO Michał Nowakowski wrote <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1993732049044128043">on X</a>. “Thanks to everyone who has already voted – your support means a lot of to us. We won’t be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we’re, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry’s great night alongside all of you.”</p>

 <h2>The backlash to OpenAI’s war on anime continues</h2> <p>The Japan Commercial Broadcasters’ Association released a new statement pushing back on AI plagiarism machines. The group is “strongly urging generative AI developers,” <a href="https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASTCV2RG1TCVUCVL06NM.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link"><u>Asahi Shimbun</u></a> reports (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/openai-and-sora-2s-use-of-anime-ips-could-destroy-japans-content-production-culture-and-ecosystem-says-japans-biggest-broadcasting-association"><em>IGN</em></a>). The association also called on OpenAI to “respond sincerely to claims made by member companies in regard to copyright infringement caused by generative AI.” I’m sure that will happen any day now.</p> <h2>The great <em>Pokémon</em> vs <em>Digimon</em> debate</h2> <p>“Digimon and Pokémon are fundamentally different in their core concepts and appeal,”&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> producer Ryosuke Hara said in a <a href="https://mcvuk.com/business-news/issue-1005-of-mcv-develop-is-online-now-inside-ryosuke-hara-on-digimon-story-time-stranger-paul-sulyok-on-the-disappearing-public-gaming-sector-the-game-kitchen-on-ninja-gaiden-ragebound-and-mor/">recent interview</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/digimon-story-time-stranger-producer-says-he-hopes-it-shows-players-the-difference-between-digimon-and-pokemon/"><em>VGC</em></a>). “Each has its own unique strengths. We believe that these differences will naturally become apparent as players experience this title.” He doesn’t go into detail about what those differences are, though they’ll be obvious to anyone who has played both <em>Time Stranger</em> and <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> this fall.</p> <p>He said <em>Time Stranger</em> is trying to be less insular than past Digimon games by easing players into the world. “Simply delving into the appeal of powerful Digimon like the Olympos XII would only resonate with existing Digimon fans, so we made sure to introduce several mysteries at the beginning of the narrative—designed to spark curiosity and encourage all players to move forward with interest,” Hara explaioned.</p>

 <h2><em>Splitgate 2</em> will re-launch next month</h2> <p>The portal shooter came and went in the blink of an eye earlier this year is headed back to a soft launch beta on December 4. CEO Ian Proulx is confident things will be different this time, and no, he wont’ be back at the Game Award <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-apology-video-maga-hat-ranked-battle-royale-1851784272">with a new hat</a>.</p> <p>“The thing that has me most optimistic is the results from the playtests,” he wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1p5pwa5/comment/nqm368w/">on Reddit</a>. “Even though the numbers aren’t crazy big, we have seen them grow every time both in terms of player count and in terms of Net Promoter Score (NPS). Our NPS score is the highest it has ever been by far (which basically in the survey measures how likely people are to recommend<em> Splitgate</em> to a friend). This has been our most important metric to improve, and we have done just that.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-pc-port-sony-ps5-kojima-2000647534">The wait for <em>Death Stranding 2</em> on PC might not be as long as we think&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/another-long-time-game-studio-is-on-the-chopping-block-2000647684">Splash Damage faces studio-wide layoffs after a private equity buyout&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/nhl26-ai-ea-college-football-madden-card-packs-2000646229">EA explores AI that can upsell players on sports game card packs&nbsp;</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>How big does a computer need to be? Custom PC towers can be enormous. Heck, we even call them “towers” after all to really call attention to how much space they take up. But do you really need that? I mean, our phones are pretty small and they can provide a shocking amount of processing power. Maybe a mini PC is all you need. You can save some cash going that route too. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/">Take for instance this KAMRUI Essenx E2 Mini PC. It’s normally priced affordably at just $230. However, right now it’s part of a limited time Black Friday deal taking the price down even further.</a> You’ll saving nearly 20%, paying only $190 for this tiny computer.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Can It Game?</h2>
<p>Now, is this a replacement for a custom-built PC tower? No. How do the graphics stack up against an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090? Like ass. Of course, this is not for those with unlimited budget trying to play<em> Grand Theft Auto VI</em> at the highest settings when it eventually (probably) releases on PC. This is the gaming PC for someone who has neither much cash nor space to spare who is looking to start a new file in <em>Stardew Valley</em><em>.&nbsp;</em>This is the gaming PC for those who want to be able to access&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em> from every TV from every room in their house. It’s for running ROMs of all your favorite NES and SNES-era games (so long as you own the games outright. Emulation is naughty otherwise).</p>



<p>Let’s talk specs. What we’re actually working with is pretty surprising given the KAMRUI Essenx E2 Mini’s size. This thing packs a 12th generation Alder Lake N95 processor capable of boosting up to a max of 3.4GHz. Memory-wise, we have 16GB of RAM. It’s got built-in storage in the form of its 512GB solid state drive. Plus, you can expand the storage up to 2TB with separately-purchased SSDs. It supports 4K graphics at 60Hz and with its two HDMI slots and VGA connector, you can feasibly display on up to three monitors at once.</p>
<p>The real show here is just how small this PC is. It measures in at roughly five by five inches long and wide. Comes in at two inches high. This little square computer can practically fit in your pocket.</p>
<p>In actuality, it’s unlikely this will be you end-all, be-all place to play games. Really this PC is designed for those who have basic computer needs like web browsing, word processing, and streaming TV shows, but it can do it in a tight form factor without taking up any space on your desk.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Hellcase a Scam or Legit? Separating Facts from Myth]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hellcase/</link>
            <guid>1366630</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Some people may wonder, “Is Hellcase a scam or legit?” The answer is clear: Hellcase is completely legit, as it not only offers fair and transparent terms of use, for example, its Provably Fair algorithms, but also has an excellent security system that prevents attackers from getting hold of any information about you or your account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The real question isn’t “is Hellcase a legit site,” but “how do I spot the fake sites that impersonate Hellcase?”</p>



<h2 id="h-hellcase-impersonating-scam-alerts"><strong>Hellcase Impersonating Scam Alerts</strong></h2>



<p>Users sometimes encounter information suggesting that Hellcase might be a scam. In reality, any large brand or website often faces this problem. Because of their popularity, they attract the attention of not only honest players but also scammers. The “Hellcase is a scam” myth you see online is almost always fueled by people who, unfortunately, got tricked by one of these fake sites.</p>



<p>Scammers often create various fraudulent methods to get hold of information. They create various bots, fake websites that may look similar to a Hellcase page, or anything else that can help them steal your personal or account information. These scammers are counting on you to be in a hurry. They want you to click a link from a fake email, a shady Discord message, or a random Steam friend without checking the address bar. Therefore, before entering any personal or account details, always double-check the website and be attentive to the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-hellcase-impersonators-on-steam"><strong>Hellcase impersonators on Steam</strong></h2>



<p>In addition to fake websites, scammers also frequently use Steam to deceive users. They often create lookalike accounts, using names such as “Hellcase Admin,” “Hellcase Support,” or “Hellcase Bot.” All of this can confuse users, and scammers exploit that trust to deceive them.</p>



<p>Their method is simple: they add players as friends or send a direct message, posing as employees. They might send you a link or directly ask for access to your account, often claiming it’s for security purposes. The message might mention fake winnings, payment issues, fraudulent transactions, or various other topics. However, remember that Hellcase never asks its customers for this type of information, nor does it communicate with them via Steam accounts. This is 100% of the time, always, a scam. So, stay vigilant and be careful.</p>



<p>How do you avoid this? It’s simple:</p>



<ul>
<li>Do not accept the friend request.</li>



<li>Do not click any links they send you.</li>



<li>Never give them any information.</li>



<li>Block the user.</li>



<li>Report the profile to Steam for impersonation.</li>
</ul>



<p>And remember: all official communication takes place EXCLUSIVELY through the support system on the official <a href="https://hellcase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellcase</a> website.</p>



<h2 id="h-real-life-scenarios-of-scam-victims"><strong>Real-Life Scenarios of Scam Victims</strong></h2>



<p>Picture this: you’ve just finished a game, and as you’re closing Steam, you see a friend request from an account named “Hellcase_Moderator” or something similar, complete with the official Hellcase logo. Without suspecting anything, you add the account as a friend. A little while later, you get a message claiming you’ve won a giveaway. To get your skin, you just need to click a link.</p>



<p>After clicking the link, you land on a site that looks just like Hellcase. You enter your details, but nothing happens. When you go back to Steam and message the account to ask why it’s not working, you get no reply. That’s because the scammers created a phishing site to steal your data and, ultimately, your skins.</p>



<p>Let us be 100% clear: OUR STAFF WILL NEVER DM YOU ON STEAM. EVER.</p>



<p>This is one of the real cases that, unfortunately, happen to users simply due to inattention.</p>



<h2 id="h-hellcase-impersonator-scam-examples"><strong>Hellcase Impersonator Scam Examples</strong></h2>



<p>Scammers register dozens of domains hoping to catch you off guard. Here are just a few examples of fake, scammer-owned domains that are<strong> NOT Hellcase</strong>. If you see any of these, stay away:</p>

<p>This is the most crucial part of this message, so please pay attention.</p>



<p>There are <strong>ONLY TWO</strong> official, legitimate, and safe Hellcase domains. They are:</p>



<ul>
<li>https://hellcase.com</li>



<li>https://hellcase.org</li>

<p>You will also sometimes encounter hellcs2.com, which is also one of the official websites, but it is more often used for advertising purposes.</p>



<p>That’s it. No dashes. No extra letters. No “.shop,” “.space,” or “.de.”</p>



<p>Just .com and .org.</p>



<p>Please, before you log in, before you deposit, before you do anything, look at your browser’s address bar. If you’re ever asking yourself, “is Hellcase a legit site?”, the first thing you must do is check that URL. If you are on hellcase.com or hellcase.org, then yes, Hellcase is a legit site.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/save-over-100-on-the-14-in-1-160w-anker-prime-docking-station-with-black-friday-today-2000647671</link>
            <guid>1366603</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Organized workstations don’t just look better, they make you more productive too. If you use a bunch of devices to get your busy work and play days (multiple monitors, laptop, keyboard, mouse, external storage), you need something that ties the entire setup together with a single unit. A docking station does that job well, and if you’ve been on the lookout for one, we just spotted a great deal to pick a highly-rated option for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">Thanks to Black Friday, Amazon is offering the 14-in-1 160W Anker Prime docking station for $161.</a> That’s after a nice 40% discount on the retail price of $270. It’s the lowest we have seen it drop to in 90 days, which means it didn’t even go this low during the October Prime Day. It’s selling out fast, though, so it’s best to snap it up as soon as you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ports to Connect and Charge</h2>
<p>The dock gets you 14 ports in total. The front panel offers you two USB-C (10Gbps), two USB-C (100W Max), one USB-A (10Gbps), one USB-A (12W Max), and one 3.5mm audio jack. On the back, there’s an Ethernet (1Gbps), three USB-A (480Mbps), one HDMI 2.0 (4K@60Hz), one USB-C upstream port, and an LED indicator. The three USB-C ports at 100W max each and one USB-A port at 12W max are capable of juicing your essentials up with 160W of total output. It’s great to power your laptop as you work without looking for another outlet, and even quickly top your smartphone or headphones up. Four charging ports mean you can charge multiple devices at the same time. The station even makes custom power allocation possible with its dedicated app, so you can always prioritize important devices. Need to head out for a meeting in a few minutes? Prioritize your laptop while still keeping your AirPods topped up.</p>
<p>Support for bigger workstations comes from the dual HDMI ports that let you stream or mirror across two additional displays at the same time, but only on Windows. You’ll get up to 2K@60Hz on a DP 1.4 laptop or 1080p@60Hz with a DP 1.2 machine. Those using macOS will only be able to mirror their main display. It’s not ideal, but can come in handy when you need to share your screen with others. Otherwise, compatibility is impressive. The station works nicely with Windows 10 and 11, ChromeOS, and laptops that support DP Alt Mode and Power Delivery. It’s not made for Linux, though.</p>



<p>You will always be kept in the loop with the smart display, which shows total wattage and interface status, plus gives visuals and overheat alerts when needed. And finally, despite all the power, the docking station remains portable and lightweight; enough to carry around easily with you on the go. Just toss it in your laptop bag, and you’ll be able to create an efficient workstation anywhere you want. Overheating won’t be a concern either, thanks to the built-in airflow system, paired with ActiveSheild temperature monitoring. The latter monitors the temperature of the docking station 3,000,000 times per day, and instantly notifies you if something feels off.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been wanting to make your workstation cleaner, Anker Prime does a great job at that. You’ll still be able to use all your devices, just in a more efficient, smartly-managed way.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/"> It’s now down to $161, so you’re saving a nice $109 on it right now. Grab the deal fast before it expires for good, or the stock runs out.</a></p>

            <p>The Game Awards are nearly here, your annual fix for celebrating the best this year had to offer and checking out cool reveals. However, while the show is sure to be packed with all sorts of exciting new trailers to gaze upon, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> will not be among them.</p>
<p>This harsh truth comes from none other than CD Projekt Red co-CEO Michał Nowakowski, who took to X to express his pleasure at the upcoming RPG's presence on the Most Anticipated Games list, as well as snuff out hopes of a coinciding trailer.</p>
<p>Nowakowski wrote: "I'm very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards. Thanks to everyone who has already voted - your support means a lot to us. We won't be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we're, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry's great night alongside all of you."</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord">Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</a>'s War Sails naval expansion had its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reschedule-those-sailing-lessons-as-mount-blade-2-bannerlords-war-sails-dlc-has-been-delayed">release pushed back</a> from June 17th to November 26th. You can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marauding-medieval-masses-mash-together-beneath-the-mainsail-in-mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails">give it a go</a> right now if you fancy, so it obviously made that second date. Prior to the DLC dropping, I chatted with Bannerlord senior producer Falk Engel about what went into the decision to ditch the initial summer date, and why custom naval battles were <a href="https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?threads/war-sails-q-a-4.467565/">only confirmed</a> to be arriving with its launch quite late in the day.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Asked whether the delay was down to specific issues which needed to be overcome, or just a general desire to spend more time polishing the massive overhaul up, Engel told me it was a "bit of both". There's always this technical challenge to optimise it as much as possible," he said. "Especially as you add more content and features, because everything that you add can also break stuff that you thought was already done with.</p>
<p>"Then on the other hand, there was a conscious conversation, conscious discussion that the title was not yet at the level of quality and the amount of content and features that we wanted. So, it was just the sensible choice for us to take additional time and that time as well allowed us to push out the base game changes for player feedback and react to that player feedback."</p>
<p>So, Taleworlds spent time refining War Sails and patch v1.3.4, as well as answering questions from players in regular developer blog posts to keep interest in the DLC boiling away. In the <a href="https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?threads/war-sails-q-a-4.467565/">fourth of these posts</a>, the team answered a question about whether War Sails would include custom naval battles - standalone fights players can set up to their liking from the main menu in the base game - at launch. Surprise: the post revealed, following previous feedback, that those custom ship battles would be coming at launch.</p><p>When I asked Engel what went into the original decision not to have these custom naval battles right away, and how those plans changed, he conceded that it's a "bit more of a technical question", so he'd need to go out on a limb. "The way that I understand it, our custom battle is a separate module from sandbox, from campaign, etc," he explained. "With the way that we've set up our base game, it can function like that. The way that the DLC is set up, the ships and so forth are set up, it’s more complex to access the relevant elements of the game. One of the things that I believe we still don't have in naval custom battles, for example, are the [ship] figureheads. That is because of this sort of modular or module approach to different elements of the game."</p>
<p>He added that, natually, this modular approach is a boon for modding, revealing that "essentially, War Sails is a large mod". While he didn't get into specifics, Engel did add that developing War Sails has "resulted in changes to the way that modding is supported", which have had a "positive impact" overall.</p>
<p>As someone who's always a bit more comfortable watching an assault I know won't leave me having to lick my wounds and start rebuilding my army from scratch after a few painful nights in chains, I'm certainly glad Taleworlds were able to make custom battles work from the get-go.

            <title><![CDATA[WD 14TB External Hard Drive Restocks at $0.01 per GB, Proving Margin Isn’t the Plan for Storage Deals This Black Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-takes-23-off-the-massive-20tb-wd-external-hard-drive-but-not-for-long-2000646687</link>
            <guid>1366582</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is there anything more annoying than the dreaded “low storage” warning that forces you to delete your old stuff just to save something new?</p>
<p>It’s more common than you think, but you don’t have to deal with the issue. Adding an external hard drive can give you both the space and peace of mind you need. There are plenty of options out there across all sizes and ranges. Capacities start from 16GB and go all the way up to multi-terabyte options, which are ideal for gamers and creatives. If you are looking to store an unusually large number of files and content, we’ve found a deal that lets you do that without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5989/">Amazon is currently being generous with a 39% discount on the 14TB external hard drive by WD.</a> It normally retails for $280, but you can bag it for $170 today if you act fast. This drive is massive enough to take care of all your storage needs for years to come, so $270 is a solid price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5989/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Storage, Impressive Compatibility</h2>
<p>You’re getting a mind-boggling 14TB of storage here. That’s enough to throw in a huge number of high-resolution photos, thousands of videos, hundreds of movies, all your favorite games (both new and old), multiple backups, and still have a lot of space left for your future downloads. You can use it to store literally everything you own, and offload a good chunk of files that you don’t need on a regular basis to free some space on your main device.</p>
<p>It’s ideal for whoever wants to never run out of storage. Work professionals can use it to house their presentations, years’ worth of documents, and spreadsheets that never seem to end. If you’re a creative, you can store all your old and new projects, no matter how insanely large they are. Similarly, gamers will be able to keep all their favorite titles close, plus keep adding new releases as they come out, without a second storage-related thought.</p>
<p>Transferring data will be quick, too, with USB 3.2 Gen support. Of course, speeds won’t match that of SSDs, but it’s still fast enough for large backups and heavy files. The drive works with Windows 10 plus macOS, but Apple users will need to reformat it to proceed. You get compatibility with the latest USB 3.2 devices and backward compatibility with USB 3.0 devices as well, meaning it’ll play nice with pretty much anything, even if it’s older laptops or consoles. The plug-and-play setup helps you get started in no time without any complicated installation procedures.</p>



<p>Despite all the capacity and power it offers, it’s quite lightweight and easy to carry around. It looks like a mini PC, and doesn’t take a lot of desk space. When working remotely, you can just toss it in your laptop bag and get going.</p>
<p>All in all, this hard drive by Western Digital is designed to take care of all your current and upcoming storage needs. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5989/">The 14TB capacity is truly massive, while the plug-and-play setup makes getting started fairly straightforward. It’s now down to just $170, but won’t be for long. Get it before the price shoots back up.</a></p>
<p>If 14TB is a bit too much for you, there are other capacities available, too. Almost all options are discounted, so you can pick what you need without paying the full price.</p>
<p>Prime members will also enjoy free shipping with their purchase. That said, if you’ve been wanting to subscribe, now is a good time to do it. You will enjoy perks like free shipping with exclusive discounts, which can help you save even more during the main Black Friday and Cyber Monday event.</p>

<p>It’s been a big year for Nintendo with the release of the Switch 2 and a host of games from some of the biggest IPs, giving you plenty of options when deciding which Nintendo Switch games to consider gifting this holiday season.</p>



<p>Below, Insider Gaming has highlighted some of the best Switch and Switch 3 games to gift in 2025, including major recent releases and must-haves from Nintendo’s extensive catalogue.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-nintendo-switch-games-to-gift">Best Nintendo Switch Games to Gift</h2>







<figure></figure>



<p>The newest entry in the long-standing Pokémon franchise, Legends: Z-A brings players back to Kalos’ Lumiose City and features the return of Mega Evolutions, including favorites from the past and new additions. With open-world exploration and real-time balance mechanics, Legends: Z-A breaks off from the standard Pokémon script, yet impresses as one of the best games in the franchise’s history.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mario Kart 8 seemed to go on forever, but, after many years of waiting, 2025 finally saw the arrival of Mario Kart World on Nintendo Switch 2. While it’s not available on the original Switch console, Mario Kart World is a must-have for any Switch 2 owner, providing plenty of enjoyment solo or against other players.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-hades-2">Hades 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>After an extended stint in early access, Hades 2 fully released a 1.0 version this year and Switch players are the first to be able to jump in as the title is a timed console exclusive. The roguelike game is great to play on Switch, with the ability to play on the go, and the biggest challenge you’ll likely face is putting it down.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Although now five years old, Animal Crossing: New Horizons continues to be a must-play title, standing as one of the best available on the Switch, and there’s even more content right around the corner. The big 3.0 update next year brings Switch 2 improvements to the game, but there’s also a bunch of new free additions for players across both generations of console.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another title that stands as a must-have for any Switch player, Tears of the Kingdom is widely regarded to be one of the greatest games of all time. There’s so much to do that you’ll lose hours and hours in the game, with a gripping story to complete and a near-endless amount of side quests and exploration to tick off.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-super-smash-bros-ultimate">Super Smash Bros Ultimate</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though it celebrates a seventh birthday this year, and is likely due to be replaced by a successor in the coming years, Super Smash Bros Ultimate remains the best in show in the brawler scene, and has a stacked roster like no other. Unlocking everyone is quite an undertaking, but it’s worth it and provides a fun challenge to the single-player push.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>This two-in-one bundle has hours of entertainment through arguably the best Mario titles ever created, and the fact it’s at an affordable price makes it even more enticing. Super Mario Galaxy paved the way for the modern generation of titles and, while they may be old news by now, they’re worth picking up if you haven’t already.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it. On paper, PowerWash Simulator 2 may not sound like the most thrilling adventure, and you’d be right, but what it does offer is relaxing gameplay that hits the spot every time you boot it up. There’s nothing else quite as satisfying as finally finishing a big job in PowerWash Simulator 2, and it’s well worth trying out.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree is the latest instalment in the beloved franchise that has been testing friendships for generations, and it’s another must-have title for any Switch owner. With an array of mini games, plenty of boards to work through in matches, and unrivalled multiplayer, Super Mario Party Jamboree needs to be near the top of your wishlist.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion</link>
            <guid>1366576</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has confirmed it no longer plans to launch a second major <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> expansion, something that previously would have formed part of the game's now-abandoned season pass. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows' first — and now, it seems, only — major expansion launched in September. The 10-hour <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-review">Claws of Awaji</a> had previously been described as the "first expansion" included in Shadows' season pass, an offer that was formally scrapped a year ago when Ubisoft delayed the game's launch from November 2024 to February 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As an apology to fans for the game's delay, Ubisoft said it instead would gift Claws of Awaji for free to all pre-order customers. But fans still assumed a second expansion would follow at some point, as has become custom for every other major Assassin's Creed title over the past decade. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"As of now, at this moment for Year Two, there is no expansion on the size of Awaji that is planned," associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois said in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iijrbz8XBc&amp;t=559s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JorRaptor</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lemay-Comtois caveated his answer by noting some exceptional examples in the past where Ubisoft had changed its plans to make more add-on content than it had originally envisioned (such as with the recent Saudi-funded DLC that arrived two years post-launch for Assassin's Creed Mirage). But, currently, it seems clear that no second expansion is on the cards, and there's no suggestion that Shadows' post-launch plans will extend into a Year Three.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an extremely surprising decision by Ubisoft, which followed up the launch of 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins with two expansions (The Hidden Ones and The Curse of the Pharaohs), 2018's Assassin's Creed Odyssey with two expansions (Legacy of the First Blade and The Fate of Atlantis), and 2020's Assassin's Creed Odyssey with three expansions (Wrath of the Druids, The Siege of Paris, Dawn of Ragnarök) alongside numerous other smaller DLC drops. 2023's smaller-scale Assassin's Creed Mirage was itself originally planned as yet another Valhalla expansion, before it was ultimately released as a standalone game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but it's not a full-on DLC the way a season pass would have had in the previous years," Lemay-Comtois said, confirming at least that Ubisoft still had plans for smaller additions to Shadows within 2026. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're trying to re-adjust for Year Two a little bit," he continued. "There's learning from Year One we can apply to Year Two. Any content we want to do in Year Two will probably be more sparse, not a drip-feed... but chunkier updates that shake things up a little more. I'm not announcing anything at this point but our strategy for Year One was to be quick and reactive, so it means smaller drops often, but for Year Two we don't need to put fires out or anything, so it's more what good, chunky little piece of meat... we can drop and have people come back and enjoy it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Digging into Lemay-Comtois' comment, the suggestion here is that Ubisoft's decision to change course on Shadows following its pre-release reception impacted the company's plans for post-launch support, with priority placed on fighting immediate "fires." And indeed, Shadows has enjoyed a series of recent patches that have added numerous fan-requested features, in a clear bid to turn sentiment around. Going into further detail, Lemay-Comtois also suggested Shadows had been a tougher game to develop technologically, further complicating plans to get post-launch content ready.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think with Shadows, we had a big jump in generations," he continued. "The engine work that we had to do on Shadows took a lot of time and a lot of our resources. So the planning for the post launch was not really clear as soon as it would have been on another [game] where the technology was more stable and well known. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We started fairly late on Shadows... because I remember during pre-launch we had the Season Pass," he admitted. "And the situation changed when we pushed back on the release date. That plan changed quite a bit and then we had to kind of adapt to the situation. So because of the new tech, because of the new generation, because of the pushes we had in production, we chose an approach that was way more, let's put our ear to the ground when the game launches... and react."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For 2026, Lemay-Comtois suggested Shadows would receive updates "not to the size of a DLC or expansion, but like yesterday's update plus," referencing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-defends-assassins-creed-shadows-microtransactions-and-sets-expectations-for-the-games-long-awaited-arrival-of-isu-content">the free update that arrived this week that added a new story quest, the game's Attack on Titan crossover, as well as a significant Isu Easter egg</a>. "At minimum this size," he emphasized, without stating whether these updates would continue to be provided for free or not.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"And whether or not this is the right way to go, or a good learning, I think it's more of an experience we're trying with Shadows, to keep things small and reactive and see how the community feels about it and reacts to it," he concluded. "And the learnings that come out of that will be applied to whatever other projects we do next."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it's to be expected that Shadows' lead developer Ubisoft Quebec is already planning its next major Assassin's Creed project (and indeed, it was previously reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-set-during-post-civil-war-period-canceled-last-year-due-to-increasing-concerns-over-us-political-climate-report">the studio had begun early pre-production work last year on a now-scrapped entry set in the post-U.S. Civil War period</a>). But the mention here of those projects is interesting, alongside confirmation of what sounds like smaller plans for Shadows in 2026 than fans have seen this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there's what else fans expect is coming: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-release-date-reportedly-leaked">a remake of Assassin's Creed: Black Flag reportedly waiting in the wings</a>, as well as numerous other Assassin's Creed projects that Ubisoft has already confirmed, including a multiplayer spin-off and the witchcraft-themed Assassin's Creed: Hexe. Amongst all that, and coupled with Shadows' delay drama,  Ubisoft seems to have simply decided a second Shadows expansion isn't necessary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/open-thread-thanksgiving/</link>
            <guid>1366564</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>It’s Thanksgiving, one of <a href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game/"><u>the more fraught holidays on America’s calendar</u></a>, which we nonetheless celebrate by partaking of a bird that’s not very good. Most of us – minus Luke, who lives in a country with much more interesting birds – are off for the day, but we still wanted to give you all a place to chat.</p><p>If you’re in the mood to discuss recipes or juicy family drama or what have you, go for it, but here’s a more gaming-related prompt for those who aren’t feeling the festivities:&nbsp;</p><p>As temperatures cool and skies gray, we all feel some desire to disappear into our caves, homes, or too-expensive apartments and hibernate for the remainder of the year. Alas, capitalism does not accommodate or even really acknowledge this distant echo of humankind’s humble beginnings, but there’s at least something to be said for curling up with a suitable game during the season’s long evenings. What kinds of games do you feel yourself drawn to this time of year?&nbsp;</p><p>For me, it’s JRPGs. Like clockwork, I always start a new one sometime around October or November. I rarely finish them, but I enjoy settling into games that tend to be both intimidatingly colossal and comfortingly formulaic. The holidays have a sort of drawn-out rhythm to them, and so do JRPGs. Their casts of characters similarly come to feel almost like a sort of family over the course of dozens of hours. JRPGs, implicitly if not explicitly, are Christmas movies.&nbsp;</p><p>This year I’m playing <em>Trails In The Sky 1st Chapter</em>, the new remake of the first entry in the beloved <em>Trails </em>series, and it’s really hitting the spot. Its opening hours adhere to a pace that I would call slow, bordering on sleepy, but in a small-town sense rather than one that has me saying “OK, let’s move things along.” I feel like I’ve really gotten to know my main characters and the place that raised them. The final side quest of the prologue sees you bid farewell to the town of Rolent by helping a childhood friend come up with a new recipe for her family’s tavern by enlisting the aid of another childhood friend who works on an idyllic farm, and that kind of sums up the whole vibe: Everyone is very caring, considerate, and hardworking. The game believes in people and the enduring power of our bonds. It’s an extremely welcome change of pace after a day of bleak headlines and doomscrolling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But <em>Trails In The Sky</em> does not strike me as saccharine. Estelle, the main character, is a surprisingly nuanced take on the shonen archetype of a battle-hungry idiot with a tragic backstory, and now, at the outset of the game’s first real chapter, the world’s larger political machinations are starting to seep (back) into her life. I’m excited to see where it all goes. Maybe I’ll even finish a JRPG, for once.&nbsp;</p><p>How about you? What kinds of games do you play during the fall and winter?</p>

            <p>Original TimeSplitters and GoldenEye developers David Doak and Steve Ellis have reunited to make - oh, those scalliwags, you're going to love this - a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> word puzzler called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-words">Beyond Words</a>, which is being billed as "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> meets Scrabble".</p>
<p>That quote is actually from <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/11/balatro-and-scrabble-just-had-a-baby-thanks-to-two-of-the-legends-behind-goldeneye-and-timesplitters">Time Extension</a>, but publishers PQube have reprinted it ecstatically in the announcement release, and well, come on, look at it. Watch the trailer below. If this game wasn't inspired by Balatro, I will eat an actual Scrabble board, mossy green bags and all. Then I will shit a match-winning seven-letter word of mild approval, like "quality". I do like Scrabble, even when it has 300+ modifiers in it and some possibly AI-generated polar bears.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3823370/Beyond_Words/">a demo for Beyond Words on Steam</a>. If you click through and play that demo, I will not have to explain the game any further, and can save my precious high-scoring words for other breaking news stories, like whatever the hell Tim Sweeney has said now. But no, I see that you are still reading, because you are too much in thrall to words. Friend, I can only salute your lexophilia. Here is another paragraph, specially for you.</p><p>As in Scrabble, the goal in Beyond Words is to form your hand of letter tiles into high-scoring words. But this ain't the traditional Scrabble layout, with those wily triple-word bonus squares in the far corners. There's a selection of boards, aka "living puzzles". Some of them look like Zelda dungeons after a pinch of nose candy, sprinkled with gold coins and barricades and power-up signs.</p>
<p>This isn't the traditional Scrabble scoring system, either: you can change letter scores, duplicate them and destroy them. You can "bend the rules past breaking point with modifiers, stickers, and enhancements where every choice shapes your journey". There are also time attack challenges, boss battles, seeded runs and "the brain-melting flipside of negative scoring". If you play the demo, please get back to us to confirm whether your brain has melted - I'm quite attached to my brain and would rather not risk it.</p>
<p>Beyond Words is due in early access in early 2026. The Steam page carries the disclosure that "generative AI was one of many tools used by professional artists to assist in the creation of the artwork for the game". I have to write up Sweeney's latest next so I'll save today's torch-waving excoriations about generative AI usage for that post.</p>
<p>The court dutifully acknowledges that this is not the first time somebody's spilled Balatro over Scrabble - there's also <a href="https://playletterlike.com/">Letterlike</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3586660/Word_Play/">Word Play</a>, at the very least. If you'd rather play some kind of first-person shooter with N64 or PS2 graphics, maybe check out loving fangame <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/timesplitters-rewind-the-fanmade-sort-of-remake-project-finally-makes-it-into-early-access-13-years-on">TimeSplitters: Rewind</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-leverages-amazon-to-clear-supersonic-nural-stock-premium-hair-dryer-hits-all-time-low-2000648096</link>
            <guid>1366555</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson has established itself as the definitive innovator in air management technology and it revolutionized everything from vacuum cleaners to air purifiers through engineering approaches that competitors struggle to replicate. Their <strong>hair dryer line applies this same obsessive attention to airflow physics</strong> and creates tools that fundamentally differ from traditional blow dryers in both function and results.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6000/">At $399, down from $549</a>, the Supersonic Nural represents Dyson’s<strong> most advanced hair drying technology</strong> available at a record-low price on Amazon for Black Friday. The package includes <strong>multiple styling attachments</strong> and <strong>premium presentation packaging</strong> that justifies both personal use and gift-giving applications during the holiday season.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6000/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Intelligent Heat Control That Protects Hair Health</h2>
<p>The Nural designation references advanced sensor technology that <strong>measures air temperature 40 times per second</strong>, adjusting heating elements to maintain optimal temperature ranges that prevent heat damage. Traditional hair dryers blast constant high heat that dries hair quickly but causes cumulative damage through protein denaturation and moisture loss that leaves hair brittle and prone to breakage.</p>
<p>The intelligent regulation keeps effectiveness while preserving hair structure, and creates the paradox where faster drying causes less damage than slower methods. The system learns your drying patterns and adjusts automatically and reduces heat when you pause or change angles and ramping up when resuming active drying. This adaptive intelligence transforms the dryer from passive tool into active partner that protects hair health during every use.</p>



<p>The <strong>digital motor V9 spins at 110,000 RPM while weighing just 27 grams</strong> through miniaturization that defies conventional motor engineering. This extreme rotation speed generates the high-velocity airflow that enables fast drying without excessive heat and fundamentally changes the drying equation. The motor positions in the handle rather than the head and creates unprecedented balance that reduces wrist strain during extended styling sessions. Professional stylists and home users both appreciate how the weight distribution enables precise control without arm fatigue that plagues top-heavy conventional dryers.</p>
<p>Air multiplier technology<strong> amplifies the motor’s airflow by 3x through aerodynamic engineering</strong> borrowed from jet engine development, creating focused high-velocity streams that penetrate through hair to the scalp. This concentrated airflow dries from roots to tips efficiently rather than just moving surface moisture around, reducing total drying time substantially. <strong>Thick, long hair that requires 20-30 minutes with conventional dryers often completes in 10-15 minutes</strong>.</p>



<p>The included styling attachments address various hair types and desired outcomes through engineered airflow patterns rather than just changing nozzle shapes: The smoothing nozzle creates a wide, flat airflow perfect for straightening while drying, the styling concentrator provides precision for detailed work and the diffuser distributes air evenly for enhancing natural curls without frizz. The magnetic attachment system enables instant swapping without fumbling with clips or threads, maintaining workflow during styling routines.</p>
<p><strong>Negative ion generation reduces static electricity</strong> that creates flyaway hair and frizz and produces smoother results that require less finishing product. The ions work at the molecular level by neutralizing positive charges that develop during drying, creating hair that lays naturally rather than repelling itself. This chemistry creates visibly different results compared to non-ionic dryers and reduces the styling product dependence that many users accept as necessary for polished appearance.</p>
<p>The<strong> premium packaging and presentation elevate the Supersonic Nural beyond typical appliances into gift-worthy territory</strong> appropriate for milestone occasions. The included storage case protects the dryer and attachments during travel while maintaining organization at home. The build quality through materials selection and assembly precision creates an appliance that feels substantial and durable rather than disposable.</p>
<p>At $399, the Dyson Supersonic Nural is going for 27% below retail this Black Friday. Dyson’s hair dryer represents the company’s air management expertise applied to personal care with results that justify premium pricing through tangible performance and health benefits.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsungs-cleaning-house-on-curved-gaming-monitors-for-black-friday-save-39-2000647717</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung’s Black Friday blowout sale has spread into their top-level gaming monitor section, with a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4560/">39% Amazon steal of a deal on the 32-inch Odyssey G55C Series QHD 1000R curved gaming monitor</a>. Ultra-low 1ms motion blur, 165Hz of speed, and dazzling QHD resolution of 2560 x 1440 on a high-quality curved screen will make your gaming setup more immersive and realistic for just $200.</p>
<p>This Black Friday deal brings the 27-inch and 32-inch Odyssey G55C Series monitors to the same $200, but the 39%-off deal on the larger model beats the 33%-off deal on the smaller version. Just $200 for a large curved monitor with QHD resolution that has 1.7 times the pixel density of Full HD is a steal, particularly considering how much razor-sharp detail it brings to your gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4560/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Play Longer, Play Better</h2>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G55C’s huge, sharp screen will make it hard to tear yourself away from your gaming grind, but that’s ok — you can put it into Eye Saver Mode to minimize blue light and reduce eye strain, and it has far less screen flicker, so there’s less irritation and tiring for your eyes.</p>
<p>With that in mind, feel free to take a nice long immersive gaming dive into the Odyssey G55C, and bring the fastest and most detailed console or PC games you can find. The greasy-fast 165Hz refresh rate keeps up with shooters, eSports, role-players, racers, and any other kind of game. The 1ms response time mean minimal blur, and you getting the jump on the rest of the field in the battle royal game.</p>
<p>AMD Radeon FreeSync is built into the Samsung Odyssey G55C, quietly ensuring the monitor and graphics card keep their refresh rates in perfect sync. That’s how the G55C virtually eliminates image tearing and keeps evey the fastest games looking ultra smooth.</p>



<h2>The Curve Has Verve</h2>
<p>Curved monitors have exploded in popularity with gamers in recent years for the added realism they bring to games. The curved monitor brings the action into your peripheral vision with outstanding detail and great speed, so when you get lost in the game, you&nbsp;<em>really</em> get lost in the game.</p>
<p>What sucks you in is the combination of the flawlessly smooth action and peerless color performance, with millions of colors all popping, and deep blacks and bright whites providing outstanding contrast to go with the pixel density and create a superior overall picture. If you’re usig the Odyssey G55C with a PC, it’s an outstanding everyday monitor in addition to being a top-level gaming monitor.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G55C 32-inch curved monitor was already an Amazon’s Choice before this Black Friday sale, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4560/">now that it’s 39% off to drop the price by over $100 to just $200</a>, it’s one of the best Black Friday gaming deals so far.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Epic Games CEO recently commented on AI disclosure for game stores, stating it makes no sense as it will be involved in almost all future production. </p>



<p>The gaming industry has conflicting views about AI use in development at the moment. Some seem to be for it, with companies like Ubisoft pushing for full-scale AI-driven <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-ai-teammates-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research projects</a>. The Witcher 3 director also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-3-director-calls-dispatch-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke about</a> AI in development, stating he doesn’t feel “that games created with only AI will have soul.” Now Tim Sweeney has shared his two cents on AI in game development and store disclosure. </p>







<h2 id="h-epic-games-ceo-says-ai-will-be-involved-in-nearly-all-future-production">Epic Games CEO Says AI Will Be Involved in Nearly All Future Production</h2>



<p>The CEO of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney, recently responded to a comment on <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that said Steam and other digital marketplaces “need to drop the ‘Made with AI’ label.” Sweeney said that he agrees with that comment, adding that the AI tag is “relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation.”</p>



<p>Sweeney added that AI disclosure “makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production.” When another user spoke about customers deserving to know, Sweeney poked fun at those statements, <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993890431462166818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stating</a>, “Why stop at AI use? We could have mandatory disclosures for what shampoo brand the developer uses. Customers deserve to know lol.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why stop at AI use? We could have mandatory disclosures for what shampoo brand the developer uses.

<p>Talking about AI in game development, Activision was recently under fire by the community for using generative AI <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to create their calling cards</a> for Black Ops 7. The controversy received so much attention that it prompted a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ai-controversy-catches-attention-of-us-congressman-we-need-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">response from US Congressman Ro Khanna</a>. He stated that “we need regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits.”</p>
