              <p>Budget soundbars that cost between $100 and $200 make bad TV speakers sound better by adding basic audio enhancements. However, they are still limited by cheap drivers, low processing power and simple audio architectures that make sound louder without actually improving quality. Premium soundbars like the <strong>Sonos Arc Ultra</strong> cost more because they use acoustic engineering that rivals dedicated home theater systems, and they have advanced driver arrays, proprietary technologies like Sound Motion that change the way speakers work, and processing that can make real spatial audio instead of just fake effects.</p>
<p>Right now,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6065/"> the Sonos Arc Ultra is on sale for $879 on Amazon on Black Friday, down from $1,099</a> and it is a record-low 20% discount that makes Sonos’s flagship soundbar available at prices close to those of mid-range options that don’t perform as well. The <strong>9.1.4 channel Dolby Atmos</strong> makes soundscapes that sound like they’re coming from above, beside and behind you. No matter what the marketing says, budget bars can’t do this.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6065/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Sound Motion Technology</h2>
<p>The proprietary Sound Motion transducers use new architecture to move air more efficiently in much smaller sizes, getting rid of the need for traditional cone-based speaker design. This new technology makes it possible to fit more powerful drivers into slim soundbar profiles without the big boxes that physics usually requires for good bass reproduction. The end result is a small unit that sits quietly under TVs and fills the room with sound, unlike bulky alternatives that need their own furniture to be placed in front of them.</p>



<p>The 9.1.4 channel setup with 14 carefully placed drivers makes real overhead sound effects that put helicopters, rain, and other sounds above the listener instead of just pretending to do so with psychoacoustic tricks. Dolby Atmos content mixed for height channels shows details and immersion that stereo soundbars can’t reproduce. This changes action scenes, nature documentaries, and atmospheric thrillers by using directional audio that matches what you see. The spatial accuracy lets you hear exactly where sounds are coming from in three-dimensional space, as opposed to the vague left-center-right positioning that flat soundbars give you.</p>
<p>AI-powered Speech Enhancement looks at conversations in real time to make voices clearer without making everything sound fake or compressed, like basic “voice mode” settings on cheap soundbars. The processing finds the frequencies of human voices and boosts them while leaving music and effects alone. This keeps the audio balanced instead of making everything sound like talk radio. This is very helpful during movies when mumbled dialogue or strong accents make sense without needing subtitles or having to change the volume all the time.</p>
<p>The Sonos app uses Trueplay room calibration to look at the acoustics of your room and find the best EQ settings for it by measuring how sound bounces off of walls, furniture, and other surfaces. Trueplay will record sound from different places while you walk around with your phone. Then, you’ll see how automatic adjustments fix problems in the room that would make static settings sound bad. To keep the sound from being too harsh, hard-surfaced rooms get treble reduction. To make up for this, carpeted rooms get boosts. This makes sure that the sound is always the best it can be, no matter what kind of interior design choices you make that affect acoustics.</p>
<p>The HDMI eARC connection lets you listen to lossless audio formats like Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio, which streaming services compress into lossy formats. This means you can hear the full quality of Blu-ray collections or high-bitrate streaming sources. The single cable makes setup easier than optical connections with limited bandwidth, and the fact that it works with TV remotes means you don’t have to learn new controls or deal with multiple remotes, which can make setting up a budget soundbar more difficult.</p>
<p>Adding a Sonos Sub for deep bass and Era 300 rear speakers for true surround sound makes systems that are as good as home theater systems that cost $5,000 or more, but are much cheaper and easier to set up. You can start with just the Arc Ultra and then add more pieces as your budget allows, instead of having to buy the whole system all at once. Because the components connect wirelessly, you don’t have to run speaker wires across rooms, which makes installing traditional surround systems a nightmare.</p>
<p>The soundbar is more than just a TV sound enhancer because it can stream music over WiFi, Bluetooth, AirPlay 2, and Spotify Connect. The sound quality when playing music is as good as that of dedicated wireless speakers, which makes systems that combine TV sound and music into one platform. With multi-room audio, you can add Sonos speakers to different rooms in your home so that they all play the same thing or you can control each room separately.</p>
<p>The sleek design, with clean lines, high-quality materials, and little branding, fits in with entertainment centers instead of standing out with loud colors. The slim design fits under most wall-mounted TVs without blocking the screen or looking out of place. It also works well on a tabletop with built-in feet.</p>
<p>At $879, the lowest price ever for Black Friday, Sonos’s flagship soundbar with real 9.1.4 Dolby Atmos, Sound Motion technology, and AI-powered dialogue enhancement is hundreds of dollars cheaper than when it first came out, and it sounds better than any other budget option. The combination of spatial audio, room calibration, an expandable ecosystem, and music streaming at 20% off retail price makes this a great deal. This deal makes Sonos engineering available at prices that have never been seen before, so you can get home theater audio that justifies its high price through actual performance instead of just specs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[LG 48″ OLED evo C4 Series Gets “Hidden Price” on Amazon, 45% Off Price Violates LG’s Display Rules]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/lg-48-oled-evo-c4-series-gets-hidden-price-on-amazon-45-off-price-violates-lgs-display-rules-2000648469</link>
            <guid>1367797</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LG is the leader in the OLED TV market because of decades of experience with display panels that competitors can’t match. They stay on top even though Samsung, Sony, and Chinese manufacturers are always trying to take them down. Every year, the company comes out with new generations of TVs but some models become bestsellers that last longer than the yearly refresh cycles because they offer great value by balancing performance and price.</p>
<p>Right now, a 48-inch OLED C4 TV is currently on sale <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6064/">for $876 on Amazon on Black Friday, and it is a 45% drop from its original price of $1,599</a> which makes flagship OLED technology available at mid-tier LED prices. The pricing proves so aggressive that Amazon displays it as <em>“hidden price”</em> requiring cart addition before revealing the actual cost. Amazon explains this policy through manufacturer agreements: “<em>Because our price on this item is lower than the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, the manufacturer does not allow us to show you our price until you place the item in your shopping cart.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6064/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>OLED pixels that light themselves up to make perfect blacks</h2>
<p>The main benefit of OLED is that the self-emissive pixels can turn completely off to make true blacks: This gives <strong>OLED TVs infinite contrast that LED TVs with backlights bleeding through LCD panels can’t match</strong>. LED TVs with local dimming come close to this with backlight zones but blooming and haloing around bright objects on dark backgrounds show the compromise that OLED gets rid of completely with per-pixel control.</p>



<p>The <strong>Gen7 α9 AI processor looks at each frame of content to improve picture quality</strong> by recognizing scenes, reducing noise and upscaling lower-resolution content to near-4K quality. Firmware updates keep the processor learning and getting better which means that picture quality will always be better than what the hardware can do at the time of purchase.</p>
<p>With <strong>VRR and HDMI 2.1 on all four ports and a 120Hz refresh rate</strong>, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles can take full advantage of next-gen features and perform at their best. The near-instantaneous response time stops ghosting during fast motion, the high refresh rate lets you play competitive games at 120 frames per second, and variable refresh rate synchronization stops screen tearing that breaks immersion.</p>



<p><strong>Dolby Vision IQ automatically changes the brightness of HDR</strong> based on the amount of light in the room which is measured by built-in sensors. This keeps the picture quality at its best no matter what time of day or how bright it is. Different tone mapping is used for bright daytime viewing and dark evening viewing and makes sure that content looks the way it was meant to, not washed out by sunlight or too dim in the dark.<strong> Dolby Atmos audio processing makes three-dimensional soundscapes</strong> through the TV’s built-in speakers which act like overhead and surround channels.</p>
<p>The <strong>webOS smart platform</strong> makes it easy to navigate through thousands of streaming services such as Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, Prime Video, and more, all from one interface that doesn’t lag. Using the <em>Magic Remote</em> with pointer control is like using a mouse instead of having to deal with directional buttons that make typing hard. You can use voice commands to search for content, control your smart home, and ask questions through the built-in Google Assistant and Alexa.</p>
<p>The record-low Black Friday pricing at $876 versus $1,599 launch makes LG’s OLED technology cost approach premium LED TVs delivering fraction of the picture quality through inferior backlight-based contrast. If you want OLED picture quality without waiting years for depreciation or accepting smaller sizes, this hidden price deal makes flagship display technology accessible at unprecedented Black Friday costs.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-will-be-reworking-monster-hunter-secret-lair-superdrop</link>
            <guid>1367779</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has listened to feedback regarding the Monster Hunter Secret Lair superdrop. The drop, which promised to bring characters from Capcom's action RPG to Magic: The Gathering, was underwhelming. So the company is delaying the release.</p>

<h2>The <em>Monster Hunter</em> Secret Lair Superdrop Delay Announcement</h2>

<p>In a straightforward <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/back-to-the-drawing-board-with-secret-lair-x-monster-hunter" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast announced that they will be going back to the drawing board on the <em>Monster Hunter</em> Secret Lair superdrop. In their assessment, the drop, which was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-magic-gathering-monster-hunter-secret-lair-superdrop" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">last week</a>, fell short of expectations. The studio stated that they can do better.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-secret-lair-superdrop-select-monster-cards.jpg?itok=6mymrqUa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-secret-lair-superdrop-select-monster-cards.jpg?itok=wfO8Rf1G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The big issue cited in the superdrop was card selection and failing to integrate&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter'</em>s world and mechanics into <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. With the publisher's consent, Capcom and Wizards of the Coast will delay the release to take another crack at this collaboration. More details will be released in 2026.</p>

<p>The fact that the <em>Monster Hunter</em> Secret Lair superdrop has been delayed is exceedingly rare for Wizards of the Coast. Most of the time, the studio is spot on with adapting various characters from different properties into their popular card game. That history includes bringing characters from <em>The Walking Dead</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-magic-gathering-sonic-hedgehog-secret-lair-is-gonna-go-fast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Sonic The Hedgehog</em></a>, after all.</p>

<p>If you're a dedicated Monster Hunter fan, some of the creative choices made were head-scratching. Why does Brachydios, a monster known for punching and leaving large globs of explosive slime everywhere, have a card effect that clones instant spells? Why does Zinogre, an extremely fast, lightning-channeling beast, have an exile effect? Why does Nargacuga spawn cat tokens?</p>

<p>But probably the biggest oversight in the eyes of the fandom can be summed up in one word: equipment. In <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Monster Hunter</em></a>, your gear is key to your power and progression. It is the part of the core loop of the franchise. So why weren't there any artifact cards in the superdrop?</p>

<p>Hopefully, Wizards of the Coast's second attempt is a bit closer to the level of quality they usually reach with such collaborative projects.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Dead Rising Game Possibly in Development]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-dead-rising-hollywood-possible-capcom-report/</link>
            <guid>1367776</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new entry in the <strong>Dead Rising</strong> series is <strong>potentially in development</strong>. Furthermore, a report details much of the game’s story and Hollywood setting.</p>



<p>The zombie genre has become quite dramatic over the years, with Telltale’s The Walking Dead and The Last of Us. However, one franchise saw the fun in the bloody mayhem of it all: Capcom’s Dead Rising. Released in 2006, the series has multiple spinoffs and sequels, upping the carnage with weapon building and bigger open worlds. A remake/remaster of the first game, titled <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-guides-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a>, launched last year to much acclaim. Now, almost a decade since the last main entry, Dead Rising 4, it seems fans should gear up for a trip back to the zombie apocalypse with some familiar faces. </p>







<h2 id="h-hollywood-set-dead-rising-sequel-in-the-works-claims-report">Hollywood-Set Dead Rising Sequel in the Works, Claims Report</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a report from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-dead-rising-game-development-set-in-hollywood" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, the outlet mentioned that a source shared information that <strong>Capcom is actively working on a new Dead Rising</strong>. The title, which has <strong>reportedly been in the works since 2023</strong>, would <strong>reunite players</strong> with <strong>Frank West </strong>and company in a new setting: <strong>Hollywood</strong>. The game’s setting would actually be <strong>in a large Hollywood set</strong> where the crazed director, the villain, traps everyone in to create the perfect movie. </p>



<p>In terms of the timeline, the report mentions it <strong>being a direct sequel to Dead Rising</strong>. If true, it would be set before Dead Rising 4. Many elements from the original title, like <strong>the camera and time limit</strong>, would <strong>make a return</strong>. The <strong>survivor system</strong>, used in most franchise games, would also be present, even taking a <strong>bigger role in the narrative</strong>. Unfortunately, the report does not provide any information on release or actual gameplay.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that <strong>no confirmation from Capcom regarding a new Dead Rising has been made</strong>, so <strong>take the news with a big grain of salt</strong>. Given how long it’s been since a fully new entry, it does feel like the perfect time to bring it back. Seeing as Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster did quite well, perhaps it served as a segue to the new title. Either way, it’ll be exciting to see whether we’ll see the wartime journalist anytime soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valve Accused of Removing Solitaire Game with LGBTQ+ Art From Steam In Russia At the Request of Russian Government]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/valve-accused-of-removing-games-from-steam-at-russia-request-flick-solitaire/</link>
            <guid>1367770</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Valve is stuck in yet another content-related controversy <a href="https://wccftech.com/santa-ragione-new-horror-game-horses-might-be-its-last-steam-ban/">regarding which games make it onto Steam and which ones get to stay there.</a> This time, the controversy centers around a free solitaire game called Flick Solitaire, with Valve accused of removing the game from Steam in Russia over its LGBTQ+ themed card decks at the request of the Russian government, while other digital platforms ignored the government's request.</p>



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.videogamesindustrymemo.com/p/how-steam-censors-lgbtq-content-on">Video Games Industry Memo</a>, Flick Solitaire had been available in Russia on the iOS store and the Google Play Store since 2020. However, shortly after it was released on Steam in October 2025, Russia's censorship body, the Roskomnadzor, sent messages to Valve, Apple, and Google, all requesting that the game be removed from their platforms for "<em>promoting non-traditional sexualities</em>."</p>



<p>While Apple and Google both ignored the request, Valve succumbed to it, not only removing the game from Steam in Russia, but also pointing its finger at developer Flick Games for not following "<em>applicable laws</em>" in a country in which it was publishing its game. Flick Games points out that Russia is not the only country that has laws criminalizing LGBTQ+ people, in which Flick Solitaire is available, and in all of those scenarios, Flick Games has never dialled down or censored the LGBTQ+ content included in the game.</p>



<p>"<em>Since launching Flick Solitaire, it has been available in 40+ countries that criminalize LGBTQ+ people. Russia is only one of these,</em>" said Ian Masters, Flick Games founder. "<em>As we started adding decks that celebrated Pride, or were created by out queer artists, we did not self-censor in any of these countries. It's incredibly important that LGBTQ+ people in these countries can see that other LGBTQ+ people exist, that it's 100% normal and should even be celebrated</em>."</p>



<p>According to the report, Google didn't respond to Roskomnadzor's notice at all. Apple sent a note to Masters acknowledging that it had received the notice from the Roskomnadzor, but affirmed to Masters that the notice had not impacted the studio's standing with Apple and on the App Store. Flick Solitaire is still, at the time of this writing, available on both the Google Play Store and the App Store in Russia.</p>



<p>Valve is the only platform that buckled under the pressure applied by Roskomnadzor, which, as Video Games Industry Memo points out, isn't exactly a huge amount of pressure. That said, Flick Solitaire is allegedly not the first game Valve has removed at the request of the Russian government. A <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/steam-has-taken-down-over-260-materials-containing-illegal-content-from-its-russian-store-brags-the-countrys-media-censorship-agency/">report from PC Gamer claims</a> that Valve removed 260+ games from Steam at the request of the Roskomnadzor.</p>



<p>"<em>This isn't 'wokeness', it's basic human rights and equality and nothing more</em>," said Masters on the importance of protecting LGBTQ+ content on platforms like Valve. "<em>If Steam can't support free speech of LGBTQ+ people, then at the very least they should be transparent about this</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Team Cherry is almost three months removed from finally releasing Hollow Knight Silksong, one of the most anticipated games ever and one of 2025's best releases. It's <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/">sold millions of copies</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">earned five nominations at The Game Awards</a>, including Game of the Year. After seven years of development and such a roaring success, you might think Team Cherry is taking a bit of a break to reap its rewards. Not so, it would seem, as the small studio is already working on DLC for Silksong, and has begun thinking about games outside of the world of Hollow Knight.</p>



<p>All this comes from a new interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDM0NzQzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzY0OTUyMjM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNkczNjFLR0NUSDAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.nHDv04b3quPAcWKT5nBOeCqr1KCS01wBn_nMscKzzng&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, which includes a solid chunk of spoilers for Hollow Knight Silksong, so if you've not finished Silksong yet, but want to hear how Team Cherry is reacting to how the game was received, be prepared for spoilers. </p>



<p>On the topic of non-spoiler territory and on DLCs, when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier asked about Steel Assassin Sharpe, Ari Gibson said, "<em>Just waiting in the wings. Waiting to arrive is probably the best way to say it. One of those enemies, a little suite of Sharpe and their companions, they got tucked away for a while because the game had so much in it. And all of these pieces need polish, and polish takes time. We're excited to reintroduce Sharpe. We just have to get to them</em>."</p>



<p>Schreier immediately followed up by asking if the Village of Lions was part of its DLC plans that were tucked away and are now waiting in the wings, to which Gibson responded, "<em>We will make sure to deliver on all of our obligations. One, because they're going</em> <em>to be very fun to do. But even alongside those tasks we had our own ideas for extra things that could be added to the world. We're trying to juggle when that could potentially be</em>."</p>



<p>As far as when these extra bits of content and DLC updates are coming, the truth is that Team Cherry is not sure. "<em>We didn’t plan seven years for </em><em>Silksong</em>," said Gibson. "<em>Not that we expect to take an excessive amount of time, but we still are pursuing the same development philosophy, which sometimes can expand our timeframe</em>."</p>



<p>Regarding what Team Cherry will do after Silksong, Gibson and William Pellen, the other half of Team Cherry's core, both admitted that they have ideas for what would be next. The question is how much longer they have in this life to get to them.</p>



<p>"<em>We haven't thought that much about the time, but we've thought about the ideas that we have, the stuff we want to make and put in there</em>," said Pellen. "<em>And then we do have other games that we plan to make</em>," Gibson continued. </p>



<p>"<em>The only time concern really is - and we've talked about this before - death. It's not that far off if you spend seven years per project, and potentially add another two. So it'd be nice to do a few more games. Apparently our timeframe still allows us to fit a few more in. Short of an unexpected tragedy.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We have said we'll go elsewhere,</em>" Gibson added. "<em>Although we've also said those experiences will still be about exploring big worlds full of weird characters and giant bosses and whatnot. So there would be a through line there that people will be familiar with. That's not to say we won't return to these Hollow Knight worlds. We do have ideas around what forms those would take. But we also don't want to be exclusively people that make Hollow Knight</em>."</p>



<p>That said, Gibson was quick to clarify that he and Pellen aren't sick of making Hollow Knight. Gibson said that if they were forced to make another Hollow Knight game right now, "<em>it'd be a joy.</em>" The drive to go beyond the games that made Team Cherry a household name in the industry is rooted in their own creative endeavours to try something new. </p>



<p>"<em>It'd be interesting for us to explore the same things we're interested in but maybe in a slightly different genre, slightly different theme, and how that affects the stories we come up with. We're interested to see what would happen ourselves</em>."</p>

			<p>Today, Digital Extremes announced that Warframe is getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-to-get-the-old-peace-in-2025-tau-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Old Peace update</a> on December 10 across all platforms. The Old Peace represents the next Narrative Chapter for the ongoing Warframe storyline, but it also introduces two brand new game modes to shake up the gameplay experience.</p>



<p>The first one, called Descendia, is a roguelite-style, weekly-rotating Tower mode where players descend through increasingly challenging levels in pursuit of rewards. Progression allows for deeper starting floors and varied loot each week, keeping things fresh. </p>



<p>The second is Perita Rebellion, a time-limited '12-minute war' mode that challenges players or squads to complete as many randomized objectives as possible on the moon Parita before facing a bespoke boss fight. Players will face intense time pressure and must therefore make robust use of the new movement options, such as the enhanced grappling. Perita Rebellion's bosses are randomly assigned and include encounters with the Prime Vanguard and other unique enemies. This mode will also have players fending off the Anarchs, the newest enemy faction added to the game.</p>



<p>Another big new addition brought by The Old Peace is the introduction of the Tauron Strikes into Warframe. This is a set of five all-new Focus School Ultimates, unlocking legendary artifact weapons (e.g., sword, hammer, staff), which can then be modded and enhanced through a bespoke interface. These are the Naramon Strike (Vexoric), the Unairu Strike (Cogron), and the final three that have been shown in today's devstream: Madurai's Thara, Vazarin's Nidri, and Zenurik's Lorak. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Warframe | The Old Peace Official Teaser - Coming December 10 To All Platforms!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F2a4_rkcbyM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Players will use the new Perita Rebellion resources and Focus to unlock and upgrade each Tauron Strike. These powers drastically enhance Operator/Drifter gameplay, with artifact acquisition and empowerment tightly integrated into the new game modes and narrative content, as planned by the studio.</p>



<p>A new limited-time Operation, Blood of Perita, will be available between December 16 and January 6. Players must gather Marks of Valiance from the Perita Rebellion and other Alert mission completions, found via the Star Chart map, then take these spoils to Roathe of the Devil's Triad in exchange for time-limited rewards, including the new, evolving Loyaus Chest Armour cosmetic item and an exclusive Honoria player title. This new Operation will only be accessible to players who have completed The Old Peace narrative quest.</p>



<p>Just like with most big Warframe updates, The Old Peace comes with a new playable Warframe, Uriel, who's thematically inspired by World War I and trench warfare. Uriel, the game's 63rd Warframe, introduces the bayonet class Vinquibus, a hybrid weapon that functions as both a semi-automatic primary firearm and a melee weapon, featuring fluid auto-switching between stances. Uriel's kit centers around direct, frontline aggressive combat, summoning demon minions, and activating powerful comet-style movement abilities. Urile's build paths allow for deep customization, as both the primary and melee forms can be independently modded for varied combat approaches.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TheOldPeace_Screenshot_UrielAltHelm_4K_NoLogo-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Lore-wise, Uriel originated as the Protoframe Roathe of The Devil’s Triad. This demon commander embodies the rage of a thwarted imperial takeover and temporal banishment thanks to the meddling of Dr. Entrati. Uriel can be unlocked for free by collecting the required Blueprints and resources via The Descendia. Alternatively, if you have Platinum currency to spare, you can unlock the Warframe right away from the Marketplace.</p>



<p>The Old Peace makes Warframe prettier, too. A significant visual overhaul is coming for Operators and Drifters; all their faces and hairstyles have been remastered for improved fidelity. There are even additional options for character customization. The update also features improved lighting, material fidelity, and entirely new environmental tile sets, especially for Perita, the focal moon of new lore and battlefields. The user interface and map have also been overhauled for clarity, featuring new icons and improved navigation.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, the Android Closed Beta Test is out today, nearly two years after <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-finally-makes-its-way-into-ios-release-expected-by-20th-februrary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe launched on iOS</a>. You can try your luck at being selected <a href="https://www.warframe.com/android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the official website</a>. There's more, as Digital Extremes already confirmed the dates for TennoCon 2026. The annual convention will take place in London, Ontario, Canada, on the weekend of July 10-11, 2026, and it will also feature a reimagined TennoConcert.</p>



<p>Lastly, the studio teased that Warframe fans eager for a glimpse at the next narrative chapter coming after The Old Peace should tune into The Game Awards 2025 on December 11.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Indie games can be more fun than big-budget AAA titles. 2025’s indie catalog ranges from intense ball-bouncing affairs to the chance to become a dealer of rather sus substances. This Holiday 2025 guide covers hit indie games across console and PC.</p>



<p>Ben Starr said it best when he was accepting Balatro’s award for Debut Game at the BAFTA Games Awards 2025: “Play more independent games like Animal Well, they are the lifeblood of this industry.” It’s true, with the industry as reluctant as ever to splash millions on a AAA title, it’s the ‘smaller’ games that love to grab the headlines.</p>



<p>Check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Holiday 2025 hub</a>&nbsp;for the best deals available across all platforms, gifts, and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-indie-games-you-should-buy-for-holiday-2025">Best Indie Games You Should Buy For Holiday 2025 </h2>



<h3 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Stay between the waves. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>It happened, it finally happened in 2025! Hollow Knight: Silksong was released, and Team Cherry can stop being pestered about the game’s existence…until Hollow Knight 3. The brutally difficult Metroidvania title is up for Game of the Year, and rightly so. It’s a masterclass in platforming, exploring, and nuanced combat.</p>







<h3 id="h-hades-2">Hades 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>You could argue Hades 2 is teetering on the edge of being a AA game or more, but the fact is that Supergiant Games is still an indie developer, and an incredibly gifted one. The first Hades was a breath of fresh air, and Hades 2 builds on the success of the first game with great aplomb. The roguelike sequel delves into the depths of the Underworld to pull out an absolute indie winner in 2025.</p>







<h3 id="h-peak">Peak</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to landcrab</figcaption></figure>



<p>Now we’re getting <em>really </em>into indie territory. Peak adopted the successful formula from recent years of putting multiple players in a group, where they must work together to win. Peak asks you to climb a mountain, and that’s the game’s task in a nutshell. But getting there is no mean feat, and you have to use all the tools at your disposal as you dice with danger and death.</p>







<h3 id="h-escape-from-duckov">Escape From Duckov</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Soda</figcaption></figure>



<p>Escape From Duckov leans dangerously close to Escape From Tasrkov’s territory, but the fact is that they are both very different games. Yes, Escape From Duckov is an extraction shooter, but one with a huge player base, as the community has become enamored by super-soldier ducks. Don’t be put off by its name; this is an excellent game with its own identity.</p>







<h3 id="h-schedule-1">Schedule 1</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<p>The indie breakout hit of the year: Schedule 1. The narcotic-creating and selling RPG quickly amassed a wide audience, with over half a million players hopping in concurrently at one point. It’s had a consistent stream of new content since, and will go down as one of the biggest indie successes of 2025.</p>







<h3 id="h-dispatch">Dispatch</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to AdHoc Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>An episodic game about a superhero workplace and its cast of heroes sounds good on paper, and works even better in reality. Developer AdHoc Studio includes employees from the now-defunct Telltale Games, and the themes and design choices have carried over seamlessly into Dispatch.</p>







<h3 id="h-repo">REPO</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p>It was halfway through the year that we learned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/repo-is-the-best-selling-steam-game-of-2025/">REPO was the best-selling Steam game of 2025</a>. REPO borrows the odd multiplayer ingredient from Content Warning and Lethal Company to create an entertaining and terrifying time. This is for people who love wacky multiplayer games they can play with their friends—and Insider Gaming has made REPO even cheaper to grab!</p>







<h3 id="h-ball-x-pit">Ball X Pit</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Kenny Sun</figcaption></figure>



<p>Making a semi-on-rails ball-launching and bouncing game with roguelike elements and quickfire runs sounds like it has too much going on to work. Ball X Pit has metaphorically kicked that notion in the aforementioned ball pit, and unique is probably the most apt adjective, as there are few games like it. Each run is different; there are many characters with different abilities to use, and it requires you to think on your toes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[No Thoughts, Just Fish]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/tiny-aquarium-impressions/</link>
            <guid>1367698</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>My desktop is very busy. This is largely by my own design. I use a laptop, but I split my screen into two. At any given moment, I've got two browser windows open—the Google Doc where I'm writing this draft is open on the right side of the screen, with my email open in the browser window next to it. Sometimes, I'll swap the email out for Discord, Slack, or a spreadsheet I use to keep track of my freelance work. Unfortunately for my attention span, I also often have a little game running at the bottom of my screen: something like <em>Rusty's Retirement</em>, <em>Nanomon: Virtual Pet</em>, or <em>Cornerpond</em>.</p><p>These are all semi-idle games,which require some attention every so often. Plant eggplants, feed my virtual pet, reel in a fish. I usually find these sorts of minor distractions helpful; they're little breaks but aren't as distracting as picking up my phone and scrolling.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p><em>Tiny Aquarium</em> is the latest idle game I've added to my desktop. From developer Lunheim, <em>Tiny Aquarium</em> is literally an aquarium that runs on the bottom of your desktop screen. It just requires a little bit of setup before you can watch your little fishes thrive.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're familiar with Facebook's <em>Happy Aquarium</em>, <a href="https://www.sfweekly.com/archives/happy-aquarium-facebook-game-spurs-not-so-happy-lawsuit/article_bf1a30ab-9031-5c4c-8277-ab9ee3978b38.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the super popular aquarium game played by 7 million people daily in its heyday</u></a>, <em>Tiny Aquarium</em> will look familiar. But <em>Tiny Aquarium</em>, despite the name, is actually part fishing game, too, which sets it apart from the likes of <em>Happy Aquarium</em>. You've got to catch the fish that swim around in your aquarium by heading out onto the water in a boat. Pop some corn on the end of your line (or some other bait) and drop your bobber in the water. The fishing minigame is a familiar one: You click to keep a moving bar following a little fish. If you are successful in the minigame, you'll catch the fish.&nbsp;</p><p>There's also a social element to it all, in that you can fish with other players—up to 100 per online ocean or swamp. It gets pretty crowded, which makes it hard to find a space to cast off, which is why I prefer a smaller fishing lobby. I don't find that people fishing in <em>Tiny Aquarium</em> chat all too much (there's chat functionality on the left-hand corner while fishing) but I still like the companionship. A pop-up shows what fish the other players have caught, and you can visit other aquariums from this screen.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Lunheim Studios/Future Friends Games, Gamersky Games</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like any game, there's a grindy element. You've got to unlock items to help care for and grow your aquarium, as well as better bait. It's slow. Fish generate income just by existing, so that's how you earn money to unlock stuff. Customization options are gated off, as are more tanks. Then there's the breeding program. It's all fine—I don't spend a ton of time making active progress toward unlocking any of that stuff. I'm not really concerned with collecting all sorts of different fishes. (Though there are certain fish I do covet, like a collection of carp, my namesake.)&nbsp;</p><p>What I do like, especially, is enjoying the tiny aquarium I've built on the bottom of my screen. The fish do their own thing. Every so often, I fullscreen the game and feed the fish. Then, back to whatever I was doing. Getting to this spot—where you're satisfied with the amount of fish in a particular tank—is reaching that no thoughts, all fish state.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Lunheim Studios/Future Friends Games, Gamersky Games</span></figcaption></figure><p>Fishes hatch, grow, and change, even when the game isn't up-and-running. That's one thing that I've learned the hard way—you can't just abandon the game, but there's a way around keeping your fish alive. You see, I left <em>Tiny Aquarium</em> alone for about a week or so, and when I returned, all my fish were dead. Yikes! My aquarium was all green and slimy, too. Unfortunately for me, I didn't read the fine print, which is the thing about the game running while offline. You can, however, freeze your aquarium if you're not able to pay much attention to it, so your fish won't die.</p><p>Then, you're able to revel in the chilled out aquarium and its exceptionally cute pixel fishes.</p>

It's single Energy cost without having to recycle Runes is an extremely valuable rate both on turn one and in the late game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's going for around $5-$6, so as an uncommon it's a bit pricey. </p></div><p id="tasty-faefolk"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tasty Faefolk">Tasty Faefolk</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230460"><div id="230460" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tasty Faefolk</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Tasty Faefolk sees play in most Calm (green) decks. It's a great late-game finisher on a budget, currently sitting at around $7. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I might not play three of these due to its high cost, but it depends on the deck it's slotted in. </p></div><p id="darius-trifarian"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Darius Trifarian">Darius Trifarian</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230461"><div id="230461" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Darius Trifarian</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Darius is a considerably good mid-game drop in Fury (red) decks. Midrange strategies like Sett the Boss will often play a copy or two, and you'll likely see him taking up space in the top-tier <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmOgRq?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kai'sa, Daughter of the Void</a> decks as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At $10, it's reasonably priced for a powerful effect. </p></div><p id="falling-star"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Falling Star">Falling Star</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230462"><div id="230462" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Falling Star</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Kai'sa, Falling Star is another card this deck typically considers including three copies of. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two Power, two Energy cost disrupts your tempo a bit, but it can be an extremely efficient boardwipe in a pinch. I'd also consider playing this in any other red deck like <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8Ard?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jinx, Loose Cannon</a>, especially at the reasonably-priced $13. </p></div><p id="baited-hook"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Baited Hook">Baited Hook</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230463"><div id="230463" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Baited Hook</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Veteran Magic: The Gathering players will recognize this as Riftbound's answer to <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDrx2X?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Birthing Pod</a>.

That is, of course, if you're able to get your hands on three copies.

That might mean larger things like Godmaster. Certainly, we’ve noticed that people would like an expansion in that way, being able to enter pantheon spaces and refight bosses. And there is already a huge number of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pellen:</strong> We were talking about the next project in general. We’re not thinking about the size.

We’re still in this world, thinking about stuff to present to people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gibson:</strong> It is interesting working out how you expand an already huge game, to make sure you don’t completely overwhelm new players, because obviously new players will be experiencing the new stuff, very naturally integrated. It’ll just seem like the base experience.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-early-access-release-date</link>
            <guid>1367668</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Voxel sandbox game&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>has been given a January Early Access release date, just over a week after its original creators announced its revival.</p>

<p>Hypixel Studios confirmed the news earlier today via the official&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, on which it was revealed that the game will be launching into Early Access on PC on January 13th. Pre-orders will begin on December 13th.</p>

<p>Despite that, Hypixel says you shouldn't pre-order the game "if you don't feel comfortable" doing so. The studio is clear on the fact that&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>will very much be an Early Access release, which means it'll be "unfinished" and "buggy for a while". Caveat emptor, and all that.</p>

<p>As such, "some parts of the game will feel behind" when it launches in January, but despite that, Hypixel says "momentum is strong", so you can expect plenty of updates and communication from the developer throughout the Early Access period.</p>

<p>If you're the kind of person who wants to mod&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>to make it your own, then you'll be pleased to know modding and creative tools will be available on day one of Early Access, even though they're "not where [Hypixel wants] them long term".</p>

<p>Hypixel closes by warning players that the Early Access build of&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>will be "rough", but promises that "the path ahead matters more". It seems like it really is important to set your expectations accordingly here.</p>




<p><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>began life as a custom&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>server before being spun off into its own entity in 2018, with&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>'s Riot Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-hytale-acqusition-adds-blocky-adventure-to-roster" rel="nofollow">stepping in to purchase Hypixel</a> in 2020.</p>

<p>However, the partnership between Hypixel and Riot ended earlier this year when the latter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-canceled-dev-shuts-down" rel="nofollow">shut down the former</a> and seemingly canceled&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>, although the game has since risen from the ashes under the stewardship of some of the original server's co-founders.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>when it launches on PC via Early Access on January 13th next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/turn-your-living-room-into-a-playground-with-the-nex-playground-while-its-discounted-by-20-2000648449</link>

              <p>Black Friday is a great time to stock up on essentials, plus treat yourself to purchases that are a little hard to justify during the rest of the year. We’re spotting hundreds of discounts across almost every single category you could think of, including games. Titles have dropped in prices, and so have the consoles.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to surprise your little ones with something that gets them moving in your living room, we might have just found the best gaming deal of the season. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/">Nex Playground — a cube-like console — is currently sitting at $199 on Amazon, after a 20% discount on its close to $250 price tag</a>. You’ll also get $25 back in Amazon credit with your purchase, which brings the total down even further. Note that both discounts are only valid till supplies last, and that might not be long. To avoid any last-minute disappointments, it’s best to get your orders in fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Interactive Motion Games</h2>
<p>Nex Playground looks quite like a mini projector, but in a fun way. It connects to your TV and lets you play interactive motion games using just your body. There are no controllers needed, as the built-in wide-angle camera uses AI to scan your movements to register them in games on its own.</p>
<p>Multiplayer setup is supported. Up to four people can hop in at the same time to get some workout in. Five games are packed for free, including Fruit Ninja, Starri, Whac-a-Mole, Go Keeper, and Party Fowl; showcase your chopping skills with the fast movement of arms, or put that adrenaline to good use by nailing down as many moles as you can. For a bit more variety, you can purchase a 3-Month or 12-Month Play Pass, both of which cost $49 and $89, respectively. These get you instant access to a full catalog of games, plus enjoy new games each month. Games include Barbie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, How to Train Your Dragon, Peppa Pig, Care Bears, Elmo, Miraculous Ladybug, Gabby’s Dollhouse, Kung Fu Panda, and more, so there’s going to be something for everyone. It encourages kids to move around, and is perfect for playdates or family game nights. Honestly, we won’t judge if you want to get a solo session in after putting the little ones to sleep. It’s also appropriate for kids of all ages, since it doesn’t support ads or in-app purchases. They can play their favorite games without needing you around!</p>



<p>Getting started couldn’t be simpler. Nex Playground connects to your TV using a single HDMI cable. Plug the power supply cord into the console and then plug the adapter into an outlet. Switch the thing on, and manage it using your TV remote; simple as that.</p>
<p>All things considered, this console offers a fun way to get your family moving together. Your living room is going to turn into a mini playground (or a battlefield) without a console or tons of other accessories. Just connect it to your TV, and get the party started. You’re getting five games included for free, but will need to purchase the Play Pass to unlock more.&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/">The current Black Friday deal drops the price down to $199, letting you save a nice $50 on it. Additionally, you can get $25 back in Amazon credit, which brings the price down even further.</a> Just note that the promotional credit is added automatically to your account 30 days after shipment, so you might not be able to access it right away.</p>

Whether it's his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/random-takaya-imamura-wants-to-see-star-fox-assault-on-switch-2">wishes for a Star Fox revitalisation</a> or his dreams of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/random-takaya-imamura-ponders-the-possibility-of-star-fox-zero-on-switch-2">future movie adaptations</a>, the former Nintendo dev is always on hand to give us something to think about. But today, all that's on our minds is how inadequate our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> design capabilities are.</p>
<p>You see, in the past 24 hours, Imamura-san has shared a couple of pictures from his New Horizons pad, flexing the iconic movie posters that he has recreated in staggering detail via the in-game Custom Designs app. To start, there were just three. Now, there are seven. And, simply put, they put our best efforts to shame.</p><div><figure data-videoid="HpG4hedNmz8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytHpG4hedNmz8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0b5lgrymz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>At the time of writing, we've seen recreations of <strong>E.T.</strong>, <strong>Back to the Future</strong>, <strong>Star Wars</strong>, <strong>The Terminator</strong>, and more, and every one of them is more accurate than we could ever hope to muster with our humble skills. What's more, Imamura-san claims that he "rushed" the second batch — now come on, that's just showing off.</p>

<p>Of course, this is the man behind some of Nintendo's most iconic artwork, having designed for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/star_fox">Star Fox</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">Majora's Mask</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/f-zero">F-Zero</a>. We really shouldn't be all that surprised that he's a dab hand at Animal Crossing custom designs too, but here we are. So, when's he dropping the patterns, eh?</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/kindle-paperwhite-drops-to-record-low-e-reader-now-cheaper-than-buying-a-few-physical-books-2000648434</link>
            <guid>1367629</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kindle e-readers have evolved into reading experiences that rival physical books through <strong>e-ink displays mimicking printed paper and provides instant access to over 15 million titles that would fill entire libraries</strong>. The convenience proves transformative through lightweight portability replacing heavy books in bags, immediate downloads eliminating bookstore trips, and adjustable lighting enabling reading anywhere regardless of ambient conditions.</p>
<p>The newest <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6054/">Kindle Paperwhite with 16GB storage (and ads) costs $124 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $159</a>, and hits a record-low price where Amazon removes profit margins completely on their own hardware. The ad-supported version saves money through occasional lock-screen advertisements, though <strong>spending an extra $20 for the ad-free model proves worthwhile</strong> if promotional content bothers you.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6054/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The fastest page turns that are like real books</h2>
<p>The next-generation processor makes <strong>page turns 25% faster than older Paperwhite models</strong>: This gets rid of the short lag that made earlier e-readers feel slow compared to flipping through real pages. The speed boost is especially noticeable in scenes with a lot of dialogue or action, where quick page turning keeps the story moving instead of making fake pauses that break the immersion.</p>



<p>The <strong>7-inch glare-free screen gives you a lot of reading space</strong> in a small package: It can fit more text on the screen while still being portable which is something that bigger tablets give up. The anti-glare coating makes it possible to read in direct sunlight where phone and tablet screens wash out completely which means that you can read at the beach, in an outdoor cafe, or at a sunny window seat without having to squint or move around like you would with reflective screens.</p>
<p>The <strong>adjustable color temperature changes from bright white light for reading during the day to warm amber tones for reading at night</strong>: This lowers blue light exposure, which can affect sleep quality. The warm light lets you read before bed without the blue light that phone and tablet screens give off, which keeps your natural sleep patterns going instead of messing them up.</p>



<p>The<strong> IPX8 waterproof rating</strong> means that the device can be submerged in water for up to two meters for 60 minutes. This means you can read by the pool, relax in the bathtub, or spend time at the beach without worrying about your electronics getting wet. The device won’t break if it falls into a pool, gets splashed by waves, or gets rained on, so you don’t have to be as careful with it when it’s wet, like you do with most expensive electronics.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery lasts for 12 weeks on a single charge</strong> so you don’t have to charge your phone or tablet every night, which can make them feel like they need constant care. Read every day for months without needing to charge, take vacations without bringing chargers, or keep reading without worrying about the battery running out like you do with devices that need daily power. The USB-C charging makes it easier to charge when needed because it doesn’t need special cables like older Kindles did.</p>
<p>The<strong> 16GB of storage can hold thousands of books</strong> which is much more than what most readers read before they upgrade their devices. The storage is especially useful when traveling internationally, when buying books can be difficult.</p>
<p>If you’ve thought about getting an e-reader but were put off by the usual prices, this is the perfect time to make the switch from physical books.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lenovo Idea Tab Hits an All-Time Low, Now the Cheapest Android Tablet With Pencil and Case Included]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/get-a-headstart-on-your-2025-holiday-tech-shopping-with-the-ai-powered-lenovo-idea-tab-2000636961</link>
            <guid>1367626</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The digital device in pretty much every student’s backpack doesn’t absolutely have to be an expensive laptop computer. The apps and tech that make digital note-taking, research, and AI-assisted writing and coursework has filtered down not just to high-end tablets, but also some of the more affordable models as well. That’s where the Lenovo Idea Tab sits — an 11-inch Android tablet armed with everything a student needs, including Lenovo AI Notes, but without the hefty price tag that comes with a laptop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">It’s on Black Friday sale right now at Amazon for just $180 (-25%).</a></p>
<p>Odds are the Lenovo Idea Tab is going to outperform most if not all other $180 tablets for academic and productivity purposes. It comes with the Lenovo Tab Pen and a folio case, both of which are almost always added expenses with tablets. Google’s Circle to Search feature is built in as well, along with Lenovo’s AI Notes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Clear Picture</h2>
<p>The Lenovo Idea Tab comes with four apps that are tailor-made for academic performance: Squid, the powerful paper-replacing Android app for handwritten notes, PDF markups, and other tasks; MyScript Notes (formerly Nebo), a great freehand-sketching app; MyScript Calculator, which can solve your handwritten numerical equations; and Lenovo AI Note, which transforms your handwritten notes into AI-generated quizzes, and can also use AI to expand on your notes with greater insight.</p>
<p>Whether you’re working or playing, the 11-inch 2.5K screen on the Lenovo Idea Pad isn’t going to let you down. The MediaTek Dimensity 6300 octa-core processor ensures that the images on that screen come through smoothly, and the seemingly inexhaustible battery is good for up to 12 hours of video playback.</p>



<h2>All the Tablet, Without the Price</h2>
<p>Everything else you would ask of the tablets in the higher price brackets — fast internet, smooth streaming, quality built-in camera and Dolby Atmos quad speakers for video calls, and total portability (just 6.5 x 10 x 0.28 inches in size and 1.05 pounds in weight) — are here with the Lenovo Idea Pad, and don’t forget the included-in-price Lenovo Tab Pen and folio case.</p>
<p>The Lenovo Idea Pad might be considered to be an “entry-level” tablet by some, and to be fair, we wouldn’t throw it in the ring against the latest iPad Pro or Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra. But you’re certainly not getting anywhere near either of those heavyweights for $210, and the differences between them and the Lenovo Idea Pad probably don’t quantify the $1,000-plus price difference. Long story short, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">you’re getting far more tablet than you would expect for $180 from the Lenovo Idea Pad, so this Amazon Black Friday deal is a solid thumbs-up.</a></p>

<p>Build a rocket, boy</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/little_rocket_lab">Little Rocket Lab</a> is a sweet pixel art automation game from No More Robots and Teenage Astronauts. It arrived on Steam and Xbox last month, and we have been wondering when a Switch release would follow ever since. Well, it's coming real soon. What's more, there's a Switch 2 Edition in tow.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-rocket-lab-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Little Rocket Lab - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, and its Switch 1 counterpart, will be available on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Little-Rocket-Lab-2955324.html">eShop</a> from 10th December for <strong>£15.99 / $19.99</strong> (or as a free upgrade for those who make the jump between systems down the road), and it boasts some pretty slick performance on the new hardware. Alongside the promise of boosted resolution, Teenage Astronauts have also got things running at a sweet 120fps — so you know those conveyor belts are going to be looking smooth as anything.</p>
<p>It's not necessarily the kind of game that we can imagine being drastically impacted by a triple-figure frame rate, but S2 Editions hitting those upper reaches are always a welcome sight.</p>
<p>For those curious, this is a chilled little factory-building game, where you set out to transform your rundown family home into a prime site for rocket construction. To do so, you'll have to lay down transport, delegate machinery, and make the most of your surrounding resources, all while keeping the locals happy.</p>
<p>You'll find a brief rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Clever Contraptions:</strong> Use drills, furnaces, automated bots, cranes, complex assemblers and far more to help the town’s struggling locals!<br>
<strong>The Heart of Community:</strong> Build lifelong friendships with townsfolk, learn the depths of their lives, and become the heart of the community<br>
<strong>Invent, Invent, Invent!:</strong> Devise and formulate new machinery, energy sources and mechanical pals to help you on your journey to the stars<br>
<strong>Cozy Organisation:</strong> Lose yourself in the comforting hum of well-oiled machines, made by your hands, and working just as intended<br>
<strong>Build a Rocket Ship:</strong> Support a struggling town while building a rocket ship!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first half of December is looking particularly rammed at the moment, but if you're after something to kick back with between the stresses of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, this might just end up fitting the bill.</p>
