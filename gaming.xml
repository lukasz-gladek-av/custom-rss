                <p>Naughty Dog has updated its remaster of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-460201" data-mce-href="/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/">The Last of Us Part II</a> to feature an entirely new mode for fans to check out. Dubbed Chronological Mode, this new way to experience the game's story arranges the sprawling campaign into an organized timeline, allowing players to see it and its characters in a brand-new light.</p><p>A post to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a> reads, "Through the new Chronological mode, we believe players will gain even deeper insight into Part II’s narrative. Players will be able to see how Ellie being gifted a guitar flows so neatly into her learning to play, for example, while the journey through Seattle will showcase the fascinating parallels between Ellie and Abby’s crisscrossing journeys."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1942599934399701261?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Experience The Last of Us Part II in a whole new way with Chronological mode, a rearranged version of the game that lets you play the story in chronological order. 🕙<br>Available now with The Last of Us Part II Remastered via Patch v2.1.0 (PS5)*† and Patch v1.5 (PC)*. Learn more… <a href="https://t.co/wVoMSUo5SW" rel="nofollow " data-mce-href="https://t.co/wVoMSUo5SW">pic.twitter.com/wVoMSUo5SW</a></p>— Naughty Dog (@Naughty_Dog) <a href="https://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1942599934399701261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-mce-href="https://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1942599934399701261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The changes introduced via this Chronological Mode will now chart their journeys at about the same time, darting between their perspectives from their early adolescence to their similarly harrowing odysseys in Seattle. The notion of experiencing both Ellie and Abby's final days in Seattle back to back with nothing to break up the onslaught of violence is already overwhelming.</p><p>Depending on who you ask, this move could be inspired or downright heretical. The Last of Us Part II was released back in 2020 to no shortage of acclaim <em>and </em>controversy over its story and non-linear structure. Infamously, a contingent of players at the time panned the decision to break from the perspective of Ellie, one of the franchises main characters, about halfway through the game in order to drop players into the shoes of Abby, an entirely new character that players had become familiar with as one of the sequel's villains. This change in perspective is also being applied to the ongoing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-it-cant-be-for-nothing/1900-6418351/" data-ref-id="1900-6418351" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-it-cant-be-for-nothing/1900-6418351/">TV adaptation of The Last of Us</a> on HBO, whose upcoming third season will center Abby just like the second half of the sequel game.</p><p>In addition to Chronological Mode, the new update for The Last of Us Part II Remastered will feature new trophies and skins for players to unlock. The remaster, which was released just last year, also features a roguelike mode called No Return, where players can pick from among the game's cast and brawl through brutal, randomized encounters across the game's different backdrops.</p><p>With this latest update, Naughty Dog has added two new skins for players to pick from, and both are nods to Naughty Dog's other major franchise, Uncharted. As long as players complete the game's story in Chronological Mode, they should be able to unlock Joel dressed as Nathan Drake, as well as Joel's brother Tommy dressed as Nathan's brother, Sam, from Uncharted 4.</p><p>This update is available as of today on PS5 and PC.</p>

It's taken two forms: the excitement over successful games made by developers who draw deep from cultural or national influences, and the multi-pronged effort to reach new audiences in regions like South Korea, Brazil, China, Kenya, and beyond.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Games like Game Science's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Black Myth: Wukong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Sandfall Interactive's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and Shift Up's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stellar Blade</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have dominated professional discourse as successful versions of this phenomenon. There isn't any one way to capture the same lightning in a bottle that those three games did, but Virtuos CEO Gilles Langourieux has an interesting proposal for developers who want to branch out beyond their borders: consider developing "region-specific" versions of your games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Langourieux shared the idea with us in a conversation at DICE 2025, where we'd been discussing the outsourcing company's purchase of Umanaïa, Pipeworks, and Abstraction. There was obviously something self-serving about the pitch: his idea was that developers could tap into Virtuos' network of global studios to let local developers create variants of a game that would appeal to their friends and neighbors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Does the idea have any merit beyond filling the coffers of Virtuos and competitors like Keywords or Pole To Win? Maybe—but only if developers can avoid pandering to players </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>and</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> not make compromises that favor authoritarian regimes.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/five-takeaways-for-game-developers-from-matthew-ball-s-state-of-gaming-data" target="_self" data-discover="true">Five takeaways from Matthew Ball's 2025 State of Gaming data</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Game studios have been making regional changes for decades">Game studios have been making regional changes for decades</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Preparing different versions of games for different regions is anything but new. In 1989 developers like Dynamix prepared different versions of the PC game MechWarrior for MS-DOS in the United States and for the PC-98 and Sharp X68000. Just compare the two "mission completed" screenshots below:</span></p><p>Image via MobyGames.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The two versions have similar foundations—a profile picture of the pilot, relevant statistics, some flavor text, and a clan logo—but there are wide gaps in the UI and art direction between the two images.</span></p><p>Image via MobyGames.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile in 2025, companies like Krafton have released regional variants of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>PUBG Mobile </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/pubg-corp-is-bringing-a-new-version-of-banned-i-pubg-mobile-i-to-india">places like India</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">—sometimes after the original version of a game was banned by local governments. Localized versions of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/56203-the-chinese-version-of-maldraxxus-is-a-little-weird/">World of Warcraft</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-encore-switch/">Tokyo Mirage Sessions™ #FE</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might see (sometimes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/sensitive/memes/vagina-bones">infamous</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) tweaks to character costumes or dialogue based on local cultural standards. And there've been times when developers experimented with story and characters changes with games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thegamer.com/nier-replicant-gestalt-games-comparison/">Nier Replicant</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thegamer.com/nier-replicant-gestalt-games-comparison/">'s</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> international version </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nier Gestalt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During our conversation, Langourieux's vision of "region-specific" game version went a little further than the more familiar approach those past examples represent.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Regional versions of games go beyond localization">Regional versions of games go beyond localization</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If you compare us to the movie industry, it's like we've not taken the good and we've kept the bad," Langourieux explained. He'd been in the middle of proclaiming that game developers needed to pursue shorter production timelines to match other entertainment businesses like film and television.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That industry is extremely agile and flexible with how movies are made...we can surely [create] more flexibility with how games are made, because we all know you need fewer people at the beginning of a game, a lot more in the middle, and fewer at the end."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If you try to do that with a fixed team, you end up with waste or layoffs—usually both." He added that remote and distributed development driven by the COVID-19 pandemic makes it easier for teams to build flexibility (that is, if they don't </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/paradox-interactive-s-return-to-office-policy-is-driving-dissent-at-the-studio">implement</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> strict </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/paradox-interactive-s-return-to-office-policy-is-driving-dissent-at-the-studio">RTO policies</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His appeal for agility and flexibility led to the discussion of regional game variants. "The bad thing about the movie industry is that...you can only make one movie that's the same movie for everybody. In games, we have the luxury to make different games for different people, and too few studios and publishers are fully leveraging that." He said he's seen more developers in Asia like Garena and Nexon take advantage of this practice than in the West.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At first it sounded as though he was saying studios should operate like say, Asobo Studio, which makes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Microsoft Flight Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and the Plague Tale series. The two series target very different audiences. "My thought is that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Plague Tale: Innocence</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> does not have to be the exact same game for people in the US, in Europe, or in Asia," Langourieux said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He quickly followed up that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Plague Tale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might not be a great example here, and that he was mainly thinking of big budget live service games—but there are plenty of live service practices creeping back into the world of single-player offline games. You have the Early Access model which turns games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>9 Kings</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Schedule I</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> into regularly updated games with new features. You have premium games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vampire Survivors</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> doing brand crossovers with series like Castlevania.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's hypothetically possible that with the right team, a developer could release content better catered to a local audience's needs.</span></p><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You have the growing PC install and mobile install base in newer economies like Southeast Asia and South America," he said. "And that creates opportunities to customize content in order to increase the likelihood of success of the game and earn overseas market share."</span></p></blockquote></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This isn't a risk-free proposition. Make a regional change without anyone from the area on the development team could lead to inadvertently offensive content or come off as pandering. And the question of how far developers are willing to go in regions where LGBTQ individuals, women, and ethnic minorities are restricted could create unexpected ethical quandaries similar to those we've already seen through regional changes to games in places where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamerant.com/spider-man-2-lgbtq-pride-flags-removed-saudi-arabia/">depictions of homosexuality</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are banned or restricted.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Langourieux has a point. The flexibility of digital assets and downloadable updates means the game industry has more agency in globalization than other popular mediums. The main remaining question: can this practice benefit developers not chasing recurring revenue in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-the-heck-is-happening-with-live-service-games-">the live service business</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">?</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

With few games at release and no backwards compatibility, each new critically acclaimed gem that got ported felt like a special event. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748">That’s not the case with Switch 2</a></span>. Instead, new owners have access to a wealth of back catalog riches from the jump, including years of the best indie games just waiting to become their next handheld obsession. Here are the ones I think everyone should have.</p><p>Odds are, if you’re a veteran Switch owner who recently upgraded to Switch 2, you already have a few of these in your library. If you’re a hardcore indie fan, you might even have all of them. This isn’t a list of the <em>best</em> games available for Nintendo’s platform, or the best<em> indie</em> games, or even a list of my personal favorites. Think of it more as an indie starter pack: a set of timeless stalwarts with immense replayability that remain perfect for diving into on any occasion.</p><p>While many of these games have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-21-best-games-for-the-nintendo-switch-1794881447/slides/30?_gl=1*12r7g6s*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTE5ODk1NjckbzY1JGcxJHQxNzUxOTk0NjAwJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-21-best-games-for-the-nintendo-switch-1794881447/slides/30?_gl=1*12r7g6s*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTE5ODk1NjckbzY1JGcxJHQxNzUxOTk0NjAwJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">filtered through <em>Kotaku</em>’s best Switch games list</a></span> over the years, it’s more of my own personal take on the canonical best all-around indie games to play either on the go, sitting by the pool, or late at night in bed. I hope it’s especially useful for anyone who has exhausted the Switch 2's initial launch lineup but wants a solid reason to keep playing their fancy new premium-feeling console. Wait until they’re on sale and you can also get almost all of them for the price of a single copy of <em>Mario Kart World</em>. </p></div></div><div><p>The last 10 years have been great for mashups of old and new. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-the-kotaku-review-1827367425&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-the-kotaku-review-1827367425"><em>Hollow Knight</em></a></span> was one of the first to take the classic 2D exploration of a Metroidvania and infuse it with the punishing combat and memorable boss fights of a Soulslike.

In my opinion, it’s the “one of those” that best nails the balance of exploration, combat, and loot that makes the genre so compelling, and the art and animation are equally top-notch. It feels great, too, with the dodge and reload mechanics giving it a rewarding tactile quality you don’t always get in this type of arcade mashup.

		<p>As of right about now you should be able to access every currently available expansion for Destiny 2, for free. As the base game is also free so that means you can play any campaign you have missed, plus the most recent three Episodes.</p>
<p>Bungie are clearly hoping to lure back players before the launch of The Edge of Fate, the start of a brand-new story within the game that will take players to the planetoid of Kepler.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate | Launch Trailer [UK]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fxfJCP21Qw8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Edge of Fate will take place on Kepler, a new destination inspired by the puzzle-solving and pathfinding challenges of Destiny 2’s dungeons and destination design which encourages deep exploration, mystery, and player-driven discovery,” say Bungie. “New enemies, weapons, gear, and destination-specific abilities await those brave enough to dive into its secrets.”</p>
<p>“A key feature of Kepler is the abundant dark matter energy, which powers the destination’s abilities. The new Matterspark ability allows Guardians to bind to dark matter to change forms, enabling them to squeeze through tight spaces, jump and dash across terrain, and become a rolling force of destruction. Additional abilities include the new Relocator Cannon, which uses Fallen dark matter tech to teleport players across the environment, and Mattermorph, which lets Guardians manipulate their surroundings using the combined forces of dark matter and Strand.”</p>

<p>The launch of The Edge of Fate will also see a huge – and I mean huge – number of changes to the game itself.&nbsp; UI, armor, vendors, infusion, currencies, even your power level is changing as everyone will be reset back to what you started in Destiny. Yes, Destiny, not Destiny 2, you’re going back to power level 10.</p>
<p>There will also be a new Raid launching on July 19th and as usual there will be a contest mode to begin with which will be extra difficult and only for the most seasoned fireteams.</p>

<p>Sow much fun</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> North American</p>
</section></header><section><p>When I reviewed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> for Switch before its release, I said the newest entry was a "must-play for Rune Factory fans and would be well-enjoyed by newcomers to the series as well".</p>
<p>Now, having played the game on Switch 2, I can safely say that Guardians of Azuma is still an inventive twist on a beloved series, but there are a few upgrades that make this killer entry in the Rune Factory series even more compelling on the newest Nintendo console.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182553 @ 1752001225 -->
<p>For anyone who already owns the game on Switch, you can purchase a $10 upgrade for Switch 2 that adds mouse functionality for easier building placement and improved graphics which includes a resolution bump and higher frame rate, which now aims for 60fps and largely stays consistent.</p>
<p>For comparison's sake, I played the base version of the game on the newer console for a few hours, and it still felt like a slight improvement over playing it before, likely thanks to playing it on a better machine. The larger screen in particular made everything feel more cinematic. If you don’t feel like purchasing the upgrade separately, you’ll still have a great time with the game without it.</p>
<p>That being said, the Switch 2 Edition improvements to the experience are definitely noticeable. Everything is a bit sharper and faster, which I found particularly nice in busier combat situations and as my villages began to grow in size and complexity. And, while I didn’t personally have many distracting performance issues playing the game originally, it feels like it was made specifically for the more-powerful console. The upgrade takes what was already a thoughtful and beautiful gameplay experience to the next, pristine level.</p>
<p>The only mechanical difference is the new mouse functionality, which automatically kicks in when using the Joy-Con 2 mouse in build mode. When building your town, the mouse controls are undoubtedly helpful in creating interesting town designs, but it can be accessed using a regular controller as well. As a result, building is slightly faster, but I generally play in either handheld mode or docked mode with a controller and found removing the Joy-Con 2 just to build somewhat tedious. I’d call the mouse mode a cool addition but not necessary for a rich play experience.</p>
<p>On the whole, Guardians of Azuma is a stellar experience on any platform, with the Switch 2 offering that extra touch of greatness. Those who are particularly sensitive to performance issues will find themselves in safer hands with the upgrade, so long as you're willing to pay an upcharge for the privilege.</p></section></article><div><p>Jess is a writer and game designer based in Chicago.

			<p>11 Bit Studios' latest title, The Alters, has been out for nearly a month at the time of this writing, and in that time, the game has surpassed 280,000 copies sold across all platforms, the studio announced. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>280K copies of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheAlters?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheAlters</a> sold across all platforms and 1M wishlists on Steam! It’s hard to put into words what that means to us.</p><p>The fact that so many of you chose to step into Jan’s world - feel it, reflect on it, share it- means everything. Thank you for playing 🙏💜 <a href="https://t.co/W6402YUkWS">pic.twitter.com/W6402YUkWS</a></p></div>— The Alters | OUT NOW 🐑 (@altersgame) <a href="https://twitter.com/altersgame/status/1942589836801503341?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>On the game's<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601570/view/502828986443763626?l=english"> Steam page</a>, the studio added, "<em>It's hard to express just how much this means to us. Creating The Alters was a deeply personal journey, and seeing so many of you step into Jan's world, experiencing his choices, reflecting on his struggles, and connecting with his story, has been incredibly moving.</em> <em>Your support, curiosity, and passion make all the difference. Whether you've finished the game or are just beginning, thank you for being part of this adventure.</em>"</p>



<p>The team also ended off on a note that sounds like a tease for more content to come in the future, saying "<em>If you already finished the game, you can be sure that this is only the beginning</em>. <em>Stay tuned and thank you for being with us</em>."</p>



<p>While The Alters launched to critical and consumer praise, a significant portion of the goodwill 11 Bit Studios established with the game vanished when it was uncovered that the team had<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-generative-ai-assets/"> used generative AI tools to fill in certain elements of the game</a>, and seemingly intended to patch them out of the game without saying anything.</p>



<p>Players first noted what appeared to be AI-generated text as part of the background in certain scenes, and then non-English-speaking players noticed that the translations for some of the films the game's protagonist Jan is able to watch on the ship were quite poor and also appeared to be AI-generated. </p>



<p>A few days after players began to notice these aspects, 11 Bit Studios admitted to using generative AI tools as part of its process. In the first instance, where AI-generated text appeared in the background of a scene in the game, it was first put there just as a placeholder, and was never supposed to make it into the final version of the game.</p>



<p>Regarding the film translations, however, 11 Bit Studios made the choice to use AI-generated translations in order to include them in the game for launch. "<em>Due to extreme time constraints,</em>" the studio said in its <a href="https://x.com/altersgame/status/1939707458152448118">statement</a>, "<em>we chose not to involve our translation partners and had these videos localized using AI to have them ready on launch. It was always our intention to involve our trusted translation agencies after release as part of our localization hotfix, to ensure those texts would be handled with the same care and quality as the rest of the game</em>."</p>



<p>Even as the studio couches its use of generative AI by stating how little of the game's text was localized in this way, it still admits, "<em>In hindsight, we acknowledge this was the wrong call. Even more so, no matter what we decided, we should have simply let you know</em>."</p>

However, unless you were too busy watching Nintendo Directs or haven’t looked at the in-game manual on the main menu, you’ve probably been sleeping on a really neat tool that <em>Mario Kart World </em>added to your driving repertoire. In light of this, let’s take a look at what the new Rewind command does, as well as how to use it to significantly improve the single player experience.</p><figure id="" data-id="eaead72ae983b42cb1e32cb8b9746ab4" data-recommend-id="image://eaead72ae983b42cb1e32cb8b9746ab4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Mario Kart World.

A circular arrow is in the middle of the screen, indicating that the Rewind command is in use." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h86166"><a id=""></a>What does Rewind do?</h2><p>On the surface, Rewind sounds pretty simple. <strong>As long as you’re playing single-player in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, you can tap the down button on the D-Pad and reset your driver’s position to where they were a couple seconds ago.</strong> Hold down the button and your driver will Rewind even further back in time. Straightforward, right?</p><p>Well, there are a <em>few </em>nuances to how exactly Rewind works—The Dry Bones is in the details, as they say. For instance, <strong>Rewind doesn’t rewind the entire game when it’s used, just your driver’s position</strong>. So if you’re first in a race and you get hit by a red shell that knocks you into 24th place, you’ll still be in 24th even after using Rewind. In fact, you’ll be even <em>worse </em>off, as Rewind will just make your opponents’ leads even greater. </p><p>Rewind will also generally maintain your driver’s momentum from the moment you pressed Rewind, as opposed to resetting it to whatever state your driver was in at the point you Rewind to. To put that in simple terms, if you were going top speed and got hit with a red shell, you’ll still have to accelerate to reach top speed again even if you go back to the moment before you were hit with the shell. Conversely, if you <em>were </em>at your driver’s top speed at the time you press Rewind, you’ll be going just as fast as you were before hitting the Rewind button.</p><p><strong>Just keep in mind that Rewind is <em>completely incompatible </em>with Drifting.</strong> You can’t initiate a Rewind during a Drift, and you can’t rewind into a Drift either. If you’re in the middle of a race, make sure to think twice about using Rewind if you just finished turning a sharp corner.</p><h2 id="h86167"><a id=""></a>How to best use Rewind in<em> Mario Kart World</em></h2><p>This is starting to sound like a list of inconveniences. You might be wondering exactly <em>how </em>Rewind can realistically help you out in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. While this isn’t all-inclusive, there are two use cases where using Rewind can save you a lot of time and frustration.</p><p><strong>The first and most obvious use of Rewind is in Free Roam mode</strong>. There are several “?” Panels and Peach Medallions that require tricky jumps to reach, and setting those maneuvers up can take time. Normally, failing a huge leap means repeating all that driving around to return to your original vantage point. <strong>By using Rewind, you can easily undo your mistake and give it another shot in seconds.</strong> Rewind is equally helpful when you accidentally fall from a high place in a map that’d normally take a handful of minutes to return to!</p><figure id="" data-id="c0de6d67cf9f0078494bfaf71ee026a5" data-recommend-id="image://c0de6d67cf9f0078494bfaf71ee026a5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gif of Mario Kart World gameplay.

Waluigi is shown getting rewound to avoid the impact of a Blue Shell." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0de6d67cf9f0078494bfaf71ee026a5" data-recommend-id="image://c0de6d67cf9f0078494bfaf71ee026a5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gif of Mario Kart World gameplay. Waluigi is shown getting rewound to avoid the impact of a Blue Shell." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The second reason you might want to Rewind is that <strong>it can make you impervious to Blue Shells</strong>. That’s right, as long as you’re in the middle of the Rewind animation, items and other racers can’t hurt you until it’s over. So when a Blue Shell is hanging over your head, a well-timed Rewind will completely circumvent the blast and preserve whatever item you were holding onto at the time.</p><p>You of course will still lose ground because of the way Rewind inherently works, and a Rewind <em>after </em>you get hit won’t do anything for you. Still, if you’ve hit your top speed and you’re on a straightaway, a quick Rewind won’t set you back as much as letting a shell smack you.</p><p>This isn’t all-inclusive of how Rewind can help, but once you realize these tricks exist, you’ll learn to really love this button.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-path-traced-global-illumination-frame-generation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/war-thunder-to-get-path-traced-global-illumination-frame-generation-and-omm-ser-support.1238559/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Gaijin Games has outlined a series of major technical improvements coming to War Thunder with the Leviathan update. Chief among them is easily the addition of Path Traced Global Illumination, or PTGI, an update to the existing ray tracing implementation <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-adds-raytracing-and-hdr-on-pc-and-xbox-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally introduced several years ago</a>.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://warthunder.com/en/news/9596-development-graphics-improvements-in-the-leviathans-update-en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly published blog article</a>, the studio explained:</p>



<p><em>It’s important to keep the game visuals improving. Ray tracing already improves shadows, reflections and ambient occlusion. But now it is time to improve global illumination. There’s a new option now, which when enabled, replaces ambient occlusion. We call it Path Traced Global Illumination or PTGI. Back in 2018 (time flies), when we introduced Global Illumination (GI) to War Thunder, it was a big visual leap, but technology keeps improving, and now we can do it even better.</em></p>



<p><em>PTGI is simulating light, bouncing around in the scene, and calculates the lighting on surfaces which are indirectly lit. For example, in shadows, indoors or valleys. The old GI does a great job with this very topic, but it has its limitations. It works on a much more simple and inaccurate representation of the world, and it has a limited range.</em></p>



<p><em>The first usually shows as light leaking. This is when light appears where it should not be. PTGI cleans all of these leaks up and makes the lighting in interior areas much more consistent with the rest of the scene. Also, PTGI embraces light more as it can simulate its bounces on a larger scale.</em> <em>Another very notable difference is that as the old GI is working on a simplified scene, many times it thinks the surface should be lit by the sky, when it shouldn’t. As a result, the indirectly lit areas having a blue tint on them — more than there should be.</em></p>




<figure></figure>





<figure></figure>




<p>PTGI is surely more costly in terms of performance than the previous implementation, but War Thunder users will also get frame generation support from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel: </p>



<ul>
<li>NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, working on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series and above GPUs when DLSS is enabled</li>



<li>AMD FSR Frame Generation, working on AMD Radeon RX 5000 Series and above, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20 Series and above, and Intel Arc, when FSR is enabled</li>



<li>Intel XeSS Frame Generation, working on Intel Arc GPUs when XeSS is enabled</li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond these additions, Gaijin is also working on optimizing the game further, both on the CPU side and the GPU side, especially with ray tracing or path tracing enabled. Additionally, the developer announced that it will add support for Opacity Micro-Maps (OMM) and Shader Execution Reordering (SER), two features currently available to developers via the DirectX Preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-agility-sdk-directx-shader-execution-reordering-opacity-micromaps-support-huge-ray-tracing-improvements-on-nvidia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a month ago</a>. Of course, you'll need hardware that supports OMM and/or SER to actually benefit from these features; NVIDIA graphics cards have supported both since the RTX 40 Series.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/magic-the-gathering-edge-of-eternities-preview.1238547/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been a month since Magic players were able to dive into the realms of Final Fantasy and its cast of memorable characters, but now it is time to look at the stars and prepare to blast off with the trading card game’s next set, Edge of Eternities. IGN recently had a chance to check out some new cards and get a breakdown of the set’s new mechanics players will get to play around with when the set launches on August 1 (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/444201D0-E247-4164-B254-C36E737E7C06?" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>preorders are available now</u></a>). </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Edge of Eternities Important Dates:</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>July 18: Full Card Image Gallery</strong></li><li><strong>July 25-31: Edge of Eternities Prerelease Events</strong></li><li><strong>July 29: MTG Arena Release Date</strong></li><li><strong>Aug. 1: Worldwide Tabletop Release</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">From spaceships to alien races, this new release marks a drastic departure from the more high-fantasy aesthetic that Magic is known for, but at its core, this is still very much a Magic: The Gathering set. One thing the team wants to make very clear is that Edge of Eternities is science fantasy, not science fiction, which means you can expect to see both flying space whales and spaceships. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As it is still early days in the spoiler cycle, Wizards is still keeping a vast majority of the set’s contents under wraps, but we do have confirmations that some of Magic’s scariest creatures will be making their appearance around the Blind Eternities. Once again, Eldrazi, residents of the Blind Eternities, will be causing havoc for players with the reveal of ‘Anticausal Vestige’. For six mana reads “When this card leaves the battlefield, draw a card, then you may put a permanent card with mana value less than or equal to the number of lands you control from your hand onto the battlefield tapped” with Warp 4 (more on Warp in a moment). More exciting, however (and I admit I am partially biased towards this next one because I love them and have decks of them), it looks like Slivers are making their return! We got to see a new alternate showcase art version of the Sliver Overlord, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GloP4xJhkUU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>narrative that Wizards has been releasing</u></a> for the set also implies the return of these fury-enducing creatures, which I can’t wait for. After all, being a hivemind and all, what good would only a single Sliver do?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Edge of Eternities also sees reprints of the highly requested and sought-after Shock Lands - special dual-colored lands. These lands will allow you to tap for one of two colors of mana, and while similar cards normally come in tapped, by taking a little damage, Shock Lands will enter untapped, meaning you can use them right away!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to some of the more recent sets, Edge of Eternities takes it easy with only four new mechanics -<em> Void, Warp, Station,</em> and <em>Lander Tokens</em>. Station was first revealed during <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/collecting-edge-of-eternities" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>MagicCon Vegas</u></a> and is similar to Crewing vehicles, whereby tapping creatures grants a benefit; however, Station has some important differences. Firstly, tapping creatures to Station something can only be done on your turn at sorcery speed, doing so will put a counter on that card based on the total power of the creatures you tapped, and once a threshold is met, the card will gain access to new abilities. While we have seen examples of Starships that include the Station mechanic,  Wizards has now revealed a new land type, planets, that will also benefit from this mechanic. Each of the five main colors will feature their own speciality planet that when stationed will have some pretty powerful effects, such as blue’s ‘Uthros, Titanic Godcore’ that by default will tap for a single blue but when its Station 12+ requirement is met, for a Blue and tapping Uthros will add a blue mana for each artifact you control.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering - Edge of Eternities Preview</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up is Warp, an alternate casting option for the cards with it. By casting a card for its Warp cost, which looks to be less than its normal casting cost, it will enter the battlefield and then get exiled on the next end step. The twist with these cards is that they can then be cast at a later time for their normal cost from exile. From what it looks like, many of these cards with Warp will have “when they enter” trigger effects, allowing you to take advantage of that effect twice. However, being able to play these cards from exile is only available if they are sent to exile due to paying the Warp effect, so if another card exiles them instead, they are gone for good and can’t be played.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paired with Warp, Void provides players with new options to enhance the effects of the cards it appears on. By playing a card with Void after a non-land permanent has left the battlefield or a card has been played for its Warp cost (referred to as spell warped), then the Void card’s effect will be strengthened. I’m intrigued by the sort of synergistic opportunities that may arise between various Warp and Void cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, there are the Lander tokens that are being introduced in this latest set. By paying two colorless mana and sacrificing the token, you can search your library for a basic land and put it into play tapped. Right off the bat, I can already see how cards that generate these Lander tokens will prove to be powerful additions to any Landfall deck, and coming off of Final Fantasy, cards like ‘Tifa Lockhart’ whose power doubles whenever a land comes into play will be able to easily take advantage of the additional lands dropping in. For even more utility, if you are playing a deck with ‘Wandering Minstrel’, this would make the lands that the Lander tokens bring out, come out untapped instead of tapped, letting you use them right away! Talk about mana ramp!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering - Edge of Eternities - Card Preview</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of the mechanic like Warp, with cards like the newly revealed Cosmogoyf (“This creature’s power is equal to the number of cards you own in exile and its toughness is equal to that number plus 1”) and Sothera, The Supervoid (“Whenever a creature you control dies, each opponent chooses a creature they control and exiles it. At the beginning of your end step, if a player controls no creatures, sacrifice Sothera, then put a creature card exiled with it onto the battlefield under your control with two additional +1/+1 counters on it”) gives me the sense that Wizards is aiming to make your exile zone into a resource all of its own. If that ends up being the case, cards with Flashback or something like Agatha’s Soul Cauldron that let you exile cards from graveyards could easily make a card like Cosmogoyf super scary. We will have to see how much they lean into messing around with exile (hopefully, there won’t be too many “exiled this way” cards so you have to keep track of what cards get exiled with what). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Edge of Eternities continues to push Magic: The Gathering into new dimensions with this space fantasy adventure.

                <p dir="ltr"><a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ready-or-not/news/">Ready or Not</a> developer VOID Interactive faced backlash in June for "censoring" the game to comply with the console certification process. The developer has defended its choices as not fundamentally altering Ready or Not's violence or its grim tone, but instead making minimal alterations to <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ready-or-not-censoring-content-to-get-certified-for-console-release-upsetting-fans/1100-6532917/">ensure compliance with the requirements of other platforms</a>. In the wake of the backlash, VOID Interactive has released a new statement that clarifies exactly what content has been altered, going as far as to include "before" and "after" images to illustrate changes.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/526472884483263337?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> emphasizes that no major changes have come to Ready or Not's shootouts. Players can still sever the limbs of foes with gunfire and it still includes plenty of blood and guts. However, players can no longer dismember the dead bodies of enemies. Elsewhere, the update removes nudity, softens an allusion to child sexual-abuse material, and replaces a convulsing NPC with a sleeping one. The statement elaborates, "The effects of gore and violence -- key to the game’s immersive realism -- have not been toned down...we’ve only made changes where absolutely required, and only to the letter of the regulations -- no further."</p><p dir="ltr">The statement has not halted the backlash. Portions of the game's community has continued to review bomb Ready or Not. While the overall rating is steady at "very positive," recent reviews have plummeted to "mostly negative." Multiple reviewers claim the changes have had a dramatic effect on the game's tone. One says, "It now feels like just another generic tactical shooter, weighed down by clunky AI and stripped of the atmosphere that set it apart." Other reviews find the controversy incredibly silly, with one reviewer advising the aggrieved to "touch grass."</p><p dir="ltr"><a dir="ltr" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">Ready or Not</a> is still on discount as part of the Steam Summer Sale.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/islanders-new-shores-review-desire-lines</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/islanders-new-shores-review-desire-lines.1238532/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Islanders</em>! Very much an underseen gem of a game when you consider the amount of cozy, pastel, pseudo-wholesome games you can come across in one sitting. Still, its addictive, albeit temperamental gameplay loop is enough to feast on for a while, and that’s in spite of its sneaky scoring mechanics. Seems like UK-based developers Coatsink think so as well, which is why <em>Islanders: New Shores</em> is here to build bridges to new worlds.</p>

<p>In tandem with Thunderful Publishing, <em>Islanders: New Shores</em> ups the ante with new islands and reinforced mechanics. It’s still the same minimalist city builder that became a hit to begin with, but Coatsink and new developer The Station have paid attention to how it all fares in magnification, as opposed to the quick bursts that the original <em>Islanders </em>relished in so thoroughly. The result is a game looking to the future, as <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/islanders-new-shores-launches-july-10" rel="nofollow">a hefty roadmap was published pre-release to show what's in store for <em>New Shores</em>.</a></p>

<p>Gameplay is as follows: you are presented with small, deserted islands, and a choice between what is essentially two booster packs. Pick one, and you’re given a handful of resources and buildings you can place around the island, ranging from houses and facilities to nature generation and manipulation. If you’re able to reach a score threshold before you exhaust the booster pack, you unlock another pack, and if you do it enough times on one island, you’re able to travel to the next island to do it over again.</p>



<p>Despite the game saying you can travel to the next island as soon as you reach said threshold, there’s no worthwhile reason to do so. The main objective of the game is to accrue as many points as possible, and there’s no bonus for simply dipping – on the contrary, in fact, as those numbers add up into fairly hefty chunks in the aftermath. It’s also where most of <em>Islanders</em>’ magic is shown off, and in <em>New Shores</em>, that’s only been exemplified even more.</p>

<p>Once the final possible piece is laid down, there’s a chance for the HUD to remove itself, and the game simply orbits around your current island, lights coming on as the day dims, and it soothes. Compared to the original <em>Islanders</em>, <em>New Shores</em> is much warmer and moodier, bringing with it a photo mode which, while heavily restrictive in opportunities present at time of writing, extracts enough of what’s possible in-game.</p>

<p>It’s quite an achievement to let macrocosms hit so thoroughly, but <em>New Shores</em> manages to do it every time, even as the islands get bigger and more robust. While citing inspirations like <em>SimCity </em>and <em>Bad North</em> for the original <em>Islanders </em>release in 2019, part of me believes that 2021’s <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/loop-hero" rel="nofollow"><em>Loop Hero</em></a> may have played a hand in how <em>New Shores</em> presents itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early on in your adventure, you’ll have to unlearn the possibility of letting aesthetics and efficiency share the limelight, a harsh lesson that may make or break how you perceive the game’s flow sometimes. Despite many of the pieces in <em>New Shores</em> having the potential to stack into each other like it’s <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tetris-effect" rel="nofollow"><em>Tetris</em></a>, a lot of the time, the game will not allow it without wasting precious space.</p>

<p>The other trick you’ll have to learn is how houses and mansions differentiate from each other, as in what is incidentally an ingenious little nugget of class commentary, the two do not intermix well at all. The mansions yearn for diamonds, markets, and monuments, while the houses need distractions, taverns, and circuses. You’ll need to frame this into muscle memory, as in a rather horrific oversight, the game doesn’t present a glossary or index of items and bonuses you can come across.</p>

<p>One could argue that it would impede on <em>Islanders</em>’ minimalist nature as a whole, but <em>New Shores</em> clearly wants to strike bigger and bolder strokes, especially as time goes on in its “Endless” mode. Each new island brings a new biome, that new biome bringing a new building alongside it, as well as potential bonuses to build around. These can range from ancient rocks, which provide hefty point bonuses when broken, to the biome literally rising from the ground with each new point threshold.</p>



<p>With that said, that last prospect of the biome rising from the ground? That has a chance to just kill your run completely. It's a very,&nbsp;<em>very&nbsp;</em>rare occurrence, but it's possible for the game to simply not give you the space or choice of resources to move on to the next threshold, which is utterly deflating. Despite the rarity of this anomaly, it's worth keeping in mind how little&nbsp;<em>Islanders&nbsp;</em>focuses on the next step, instead how it all stands. It's like the&nbsp;<em>Wallace &amp; Gromit&nbsp;</em>sketch with the train-tracks, only I'm not laughing.</p>

<p>It’s a mechanically mesmerizing experience, even if its pacing and progression lets it down by awkwardly heaving it in front of you. The amount of time you can spend on some of these islands trying fruitlessly to slam buildings into tricky spots like groceries in bags, and knowing that the next island presented is going to double that time in one go. Endless mode, despite those bursts of magic, is an endurance test that will turn your God-given powers into sloppy slaps of building placement that are ruined by fatigue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other big miss is the sound design, lacking a real aural achievement to go alongside its little touches. The music never felt like it fit in with whatever you were planning to create, the plodding and plonking of fake glockenspiel and kalimba sticking out like a sore thumb, when the ambience does so much more to add to the aesthetic than it ever could. Plop a few houses down and listen to the bustle, how it dances with the wind, and that’s <em>New Shores</em> right there.</p>

<h2><em>Islanders: New Shores&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>It’s easy to call <em>Islanders </em>addictive, and <em>New Shores</em> even more so. Coatsink and The Station clearly have what’s necessary to make its mechanics a lock-on for long stretches of mucking about, but this exercise of expertise is hamstrung by the extra weight. As it stands, <em>New Shores</em> is going to move to fresh lands, as the roadmap promises, and honestly, given what’s shown so far? It’s worth it to jump on the boat now. The future's a bonus.</p>

The mode takes Abby and Ellie’s stories and interleaves them in chronological order rather than the nonlinear story of the original version of the game, which used timeskips and flashbacks. </p><p>In addition to Chronological Mode, the patch also includes new achievements and skins to use in <em>Part II Remastered’s</em> roguelike game mode No Return. Now you can dress up Joel and his brother Tommy like Naughty Dog’s other pair of visually indistinct, emotionally constipated brothers; Nathan and Sam Drake. Naughty Dog does still recommend that first timers play <em>TLOU Part II</em> normally before tackling Chronological Mode but that, “the team’s hard work has paid off with a fascinating new way to enjoy this chapter.” Chronological Mode will give players a new reason to pick up the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645923/the-last-of-us-renewed-for-season-3-just-ahead-of-hbo-return">while awaiting the next season of the show</a> which will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hbo/673868/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-hbo">dive into events from Abby’s perspective</a>. Season 3 though, will proceed without Neil Druckmann as co-lead. Druckmann, co-director of both <em>The Last of Us</em> games and creative director at Naughty Dog, recently announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696939/the-last-of-us-co-creator-neil-druckmann-is-stepping-back">that he’s taking a break from the show</a> to focus efforts on the studio’s games including the recently announced, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24320197/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-trailer-game-awards-2024"><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/701060/the-last-of-us-part-ii-chronological-mode-season-three-hbo]]></content:encoded>

We’ve got new <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dandadan-season-2s-new-opening-puts-you-right-in-the-stylish-action-2000623859" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opening and ending theme songs</a> to obsess over, a quietly released <a href="https://t.co/mIndqg9998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bare-bones beat ‘em up mobile game</a> to poke at, and the return of the weekly ritual of delegating Mondays and Thursdays as<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Dandadan/comments/1glqu2p/best_day_of_the_week_again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> DanDaDan Day</a>, with new manga chapters and anime episodes dropping like clockwork. But what’s got me the most jazzed about the second season isn’t just watching my adopted anime children <em>Scooby-Doo</em> their way out of an <em>X-Files</em> jam; it's poring over its animator’s rough draft key animations on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>While it isn’t rare for animators for shows like <a href="https://aftermath.site/gquuuuuux-finale-gundam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em></a> to <a href="https://x.com/gojooni/status/1937541488973643806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post illustrations on social media</a> following the release of a new episode to drum up excitement (and marketing) for their anime and <a href="https://x.com/HideMatsubara/status/1937543228494102568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bid farewell to their co-workers</a>, the folks at Science Saru have made it a tradition to have its animators post snippets of the production materials they worked on in new episodes.&nbsp;</p><p>These key animation production materials—whose rough versions are called <a href="https://sakuga.fandom.com/wiki/Genga" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genga </a>and cleaned-up versions are called <a href="https://sakuga.fandom.com/wiki/Nigen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nigen</a>—are essentially a behind-the-scenes look at how the anime sausage is made. It’s similar to looking at the version history Google Doc of a stellar review with all the <a href="https://x.com/SHUTOENOMOTO/status/1857189960685949072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strikethroughs, moved graphs, and editor comments</a>. Only with ningen do you get to see what the chiseled granite of animation looked like in its final stages before <a href="https://gizmodo.com/netflix-animation-anime-interview-power-house-sam-deats-adam-deats-david-how-2000517324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">color shading and compositing</a> come into play making the fluid animation (<a href="https://sakuga.fandom.com/wiki/Sakuga_Wiki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sakuga</a>) of anime episode what it looks like upon release.</p><p>What’s interesting about Science Saru animators posting various keyframes—whether they’re simple running cycles, head turns, <a href="https://x.com/dancing_stew/status/1940847223060983966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">character acting</a>, or action scenes—is that many of them last no longer than four to eight seconds. Still, each keyframe plays a crucial role in making every part of <em>Dan Da Dan</em>’s animation shine—whether it's in its opening theme or within the episodes. Essentially, looking at Science Saru’s team's piecemeal work on new episodes is like watching a street artist sign their name on a giant mural. Plus, by checking out their keyframes in isolation, I get to geek out over small animation details I might not notice in the chaos of the final episodes, like when Momo (my favorite character) makes a goofy face in the middle of a fight.&nbsp;</p><p>While I’ve meticulously set my Twitter algorithm to show me posts from Science Saru animators whenever a new episode drops, folks who also love behind-the-scenes animation details can visit websites like <a href="https://sakugabooru.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sakugabooru.</a> This site not only functions as a database for a wide range of anime shows, tagging various techniques and styles, but also links back to the animator’s Twitter accounts if people want to follow a creator’s work. I find this especially helpful in avoiding the trend where anime fans credit streaming platforms like Netflix and Crunchyroll for the animation quality, rather than recognizing the studios and animators who put in the effort to give those shows their shine and just desserts.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks"><h3>Xbox’s ‘Golden Handcuffs’ Are Screwing Over Laid Off Workers</h3></a><p>'Unvested shares' are something I didn't even understand last week but this week have been floored by</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hideaki-anno-is-animes-ultimate-wife-guy"><h3>Hideaki Anno Is Anime’s Ultimate Wife Guy</h3></a><p>Moyoco and Hideaki Anno might dethrone Sailor Moon and Hunter X Hunter’s creators as anime’s it couple.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-sakuga-science-saru]]></content:encoded>

However, Fletcher recently had this to say on social media following Blizzard's recent Diablo 4 Season 9 Campfire Chat livestream.</p><p dir="ltr">"Just know, your warcries of wanting more change aren't going unnoticed," Fletcher <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1938720086338216264" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>. "The team has been cooking on some of the biggest changes that really hit home on things people have been asking for and more. We will share more as we get closer."</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9 started July 1 and will run through September 23. Blizzard has not yet outlined more concrete plans for Season 10, but players can hope that some of the bigger changes Fletcher is alluding to will arrive around then.</p><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, players have recently discovered an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-now-has-a-very-easy-to-replicate-infinite-damage-bug/1100-6533026/" data-ref-id="1100-6533026">easy Diablo 4 infinite-damagebug</a> for the Sorcerer that will likely be fixed soon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Time Flies has a simple and humorous premise. Players control a fly and must complete a long bucket list over a short life span. The game has been buzzing around since its reveal in 2022, but it’s finally landing later this month.</p><p>Developed by Playables designers Michael Frei and Raphaël Munoz, creators of similarly sparse abstract games such as <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/kids/standing-out-by-blending-in">Kids</a> and Plug &amp; Play, this hand-drawn black-and-white adventure tasks players with buzzing around a house to complete a checklist. This includes learning an instrument, becoming wealthy, or getting drunk. Goals are both explicit and obscure, and the challenge comes in figuring out how to accomplish them as a tiny fly before its brief life expires.</p><p url="https://youtu.be/FzAwgAIXn28?si=njDmdSiVMyocZEPZ" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FzAwgAIXn28" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The fly's average life expectancy ranges around 60 seconds, though this varies based on your physical location (which you’ll enter at the game’s start). Dying means starting the whole game anew, though your progress hastens as you learn how to complete tasks more quickly. Time Flies’ description succinctly sums up the thematic core of the experience: “Make the best of the time you have left, because we’re all going to die.”</p><p>“Flies are pretty annoying, and we’ve been listening to one every day for the past four years of game development,” says Michael Frei in a press release. “Please do your part and Wishlist the game now, I really need therapy.”</p><p>We played Time Flies during Summer Game Fest 2022, and were amused and engrossed during our short time with it.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/08/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-patch-adds-a-chronological-story-mode/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-patch-adds-a-chronological-story-mode.1238487/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a new update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a>, which adds a new way to play through the game’s story with the chronological mode.</p>
<p>The new feature is added today in patch 2.1.0 for PS5 and patch 1.5 for the game on PC via Steam and Epic.</p>


<p>The Last of Us Part 2 was released with a story that plays out non-linearly, showing Ellie and Abby’s stories in a jumbled up order that also blends in flashbacks alongside the present-day story.</p>
<p>“Through the new Chronological mode,” Naughty Dog’s Jonathan Dornbush writes, “we believe players will gain even deeper insight into Part II’s narrative. Players will be able to see how Ellie being gifted a guitar flows so neatly into her learning to play, for example, while the journey through Seattle will showcase the fascinating parallels between Ellie and Abby’s crisscrossing journeys. You’ll see just how close they come into running into each other, how their actions impact each other, and more.”</p>
<p>The studio still recommends playing the game as it was originally put together, but this gives a potentially fresh perspective. If you do play this way, however, you will be able to unlock two new skins that dress Joel up as Nathan Drake and Tommy up as Sam Drake, made available for the No Return roguelike survival mode.</p>

<p>That this update even exists is an unusual one, coming half a decade after the game’s original launch on PS4, and in some ways it feels like this echoes <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/12/04/going-back-to-beyond-two-souls-on-ps4/">the chronological story mode added to Beyond: Two Souls</a> for its PS4 remaster. It’s also strangely timed to release this after Season 2 of HBO’s The Last of Us adaptation, which inherited the non-linear story of the game. Surely if there was a time to reconsider how the tale was to be unspooled, it would have been through the TV series? Certainly, this could have helped with some of the most…. disliked narrative points in both game and TV show.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered Review –&nbsp;Is it worth upgrading?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s7rBjOlu5NQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looking back at The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered’s release for PS5, Gamoc said, “The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered refines and improves a much misunderstood masterpiece. It’s hard not to be amazed at how good this game still looks, and it comes with a new mode and some behind the scenes stuff to enjoy. It’s not as big a step from the original release as TLOU Part 1 was, and so feels like a less noteworthy release, but the price for upgrading from PS4 is reasonable for what you get. For those who haven’t played it, this will be the best version to play, even if it’s just for No Return to add some more longevity without all the incredibly intense emotional stress of the main story.”</p>

<p>Say hello to 'Ninsight'</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Ninsight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/602666d8c3dbf/ninsight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ninty Media</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ninty Media, the team behind magazines such as The Vita Lounge, Switch Player, and Ninty Fresh, has launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nintymedia/ninsight-the-new-nintendo-switch-2-magazine">Kickstarter campaign</a> for a new venture called 'Ninsight'.</p>
<p>With the first issue shipping globally in August, Ninsight aims to provide the latest Nintendo-themed news, reviews, and talking points in a premium, 80-100 page magazine with zero adverts. At the time of writing, over half of the Kickstarter's £5,000 goal has been achieved with 16 days remaining.</p>
<p>According to the overview, the move over to Ninsight was due to rising costs in maintaining production for Switch Player. Moving over to a new model which focuses on fewer releases and higher-quality content will hopefully result in a more viable business long-term.</p>

<p>You can offer up a pledge right now if you wish, with digital copies of the magazine costing £4 and physical versions costing £7. A premium edition at £20 will also include an art print of the cover art and a poster. Backers of the premium edition will also get an enamel pin badge and their names in the mag.</p>
<p>So if you miss the days of NGamer and ONM, then this might well be worth a punt. We'll certainly be keeping a close eye on it!</p>

			<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-digital-showcase-returns-on-august-1st/">THQ Nordic Showcase</a> that will take place at the beginning of next month, developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-qa-alkimia-talks-about-expanding-the-classic-rpg/">Alkimia Interactive</a> has published its latest 'Making Of' video going behind the scenes on the development of the Gothic Remake, this time focusing on the studio's approach to the game's art style.</p>



<p>"<em>We also decided very early on, we are not making an HD version of the art style of the original, that's not our goal</em>," says the game director and studio head at Alkimia Interactive, Reinhard Pollice, at the top of the video. Pollice and the studio's art director, Daniel Candil, continue to elaborate on how they were working with opposing forces in developing this remake, as they wanted to make it look grounded and realistic, while also properly displaying the more fantastical and magical elements of Gothic.</p>

<p>The Gothic 1 Remake was first announced all the way back in 2019 with a surprise teaser demo being released for players to check out. It wasn't until <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-gothic-remake-is-happening-after-all-and-itll-be-grittier-than-the-demo/">2020, however,</a> that we knew for sure that the remake was in development, and it has been in the works ever since. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-killing-floor-3-and-titan-quest-ii-to-launch-by-march-2025-alongside-three-unannounced-games/">May 2024</a>, we learned that the remake was meant to be out by March 2025, though all we've received so far this year is a new demo that debuted during the year's first Steam Next Fest event in February 2025. Alkimia Interactive has even taken <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-gets-demo-update-following-communitys-feedback/">feedback from players who checked out the demo</a> and committed to making several significant changes. </p>



<p>Currently, there's still no proper release date set for the Gothic Remake, though it's entirely possible that we'll finally learn of when it'll be on store shelves during the upcoming THQ Nordic Showcase in August.</p>
