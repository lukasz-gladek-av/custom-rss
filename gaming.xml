<p>
Stare into an abyss for long enough and, as Nietzsche wrote, a mostly naked man will wobble out of the abyss and try to murder you with a mattock. Inasmuch as can be told in the absence of dialogue or a text preamble, the naked man wants to murder you because you, and not he, are in possession of a hat. The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It's the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman's too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you're trying to fend him off with.
</p>
<p>
There are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword/">the Half Sword demo</a> - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.

You begin the demo slumped over in a flat void that stretches away forever. You wander to the nearest weaponisable object - if you're lucky, a nice, solid pitchfork - then wander a bit further in search of people to stick that object into. Or at least, flail it at. In Half Sword, weapons are swung by jolting the cursor around or yanking the analog sticks. As such, it's rare even with practice that you land what feels like a clean blow. Instead, you sort of stroke and tickle each other with your implements of bloodshed until one of the participants ragdolls, screeching and blasting blood everywhere. People certainly do <em>yell</em> in Half Sword, though it's partly, again, that the controls and handling don't lend themselves to swift and merciful KOs. Knock somebody over and you're obliged to stand over them sort of massaging your weapon into them until they stop bellowing and cop it out of sheer irritation. 
</p>
<p>
It's possible, as you'd expect, that all this reflects my own ineptness, though the blundering and absurd inhumanity of it all is a fair representation of the IRL fights I have been involved in. Regardless, it's very funny. "Proper" physics-based melee combat systems have been a thing in games for years, but they never fail to make me cackle. There are some Gang Beasts-worthy moments in Half Sword, albeit with a lot more gore. At one point I managed to knock a guy down while dropping my axe, which clattered to a halt a few metres away. Rather than give the downed opponent time to get up while I fetched it, I seized his ankle and dragged him kicking and screaming towards the axe. Then I stepped on the axe and hurt myself, and he stood up and beat my head in with a footstool. Touché, good sir knight. I'll see you at the next Roundtable.
</p>
<p>
The full version of Half Sword promises to be "an immersive, physically simulated medieval combat game that offers players a unique experience of becoming a commoner-turned-knight, fighting brutal tournaments in 15th-century Europe". It'll feature a "meticulously crafted collection of historically accurate arms and armor", NPCs with quests, and many flourishes based on "the expertise and feedback of Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) practitioners and sword fencers". Sounds decent, but I'd also love to play an expanded version of the demo that abstracts the rags-to-riches theme into a bunch of random, ignoble fights in the dark for possession of some truly awful hats.

<p id="pNnZaa"><strong>Slakoth </strong>and its evolutions are also getting special costumed versions for this event — they’re wearing little blue visors! Catch experience throughout the event is also doubled.</p>

                <p>A hypothetical Bloodborne 2 is arguably one of the most-requested gaming sequels of our current era, and Sony and From Software have left fans out in the cold for years. Now, the upcoming 3D platformer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-preorder-guide/1100-6523846/" data-ref-id="1100-6523846">Astro Bot</a> will offer a Bloodborne-themed skin in its digital deluxe edition, which is a bit cruel for those who have been waiting almost a decade for a sequel.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4314775-astrobotdigital.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314775" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4314775-astrobotdigital.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314775"></a><figcaption>The digital deluxe contents for Astro Bot</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1596/15969599/4314775-astrobotdigital.jpg"></figure><p>As shown over at <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/astro-bot-pre-order-begins-june-7-features-parappa-lovestruck-lyricist-outfit-and-more/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, the digital deluxe edition of Astro Bot will include three outfits, including the shiny Golden, the PaRappa Lovestruck Lyricist, and the gothic-looking Yharnam Hunter. Bloodborne fans will no doubt recognize the iconic hat and cowl that is closely associated with the aesthetic of one of Sony's most beloved exclusives.</p>

<p dir="ltr">While it's nice to see an overt reference to Bloodborne, the fact that it comes alongside a skin for a "legacy" character that hasn't starred in a new game since 2002 doesn't exactly instill confidence. Still, it's a reminder that Sony is well-aware of the large contingent of Yharnamite fans out there, even if the company is content to leave those fans disappointed for now.</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors of a Bloodborne remake from Bluepoint (which co-developed the PS5 Demon's Souls remake) have swirled for years, but they've never been officially confirmed or denied. Earlier this year, game director Hidetaka Miyazaki told Eurogamer that any such remake or sequel would be up to Sony, and said that it's possible that Sony may wait until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/theoretical-bloodborne-remake-could-receive-value-from-new-hardware-miyazaki-says/1100-6521268/">it releases new hardware</a> to remake the game.</p>

            <link>https://www.destructoid.com/top-5-teams-ea-fc-24-euro-2024-mode/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=top-5-teams-ea-fc-24-euro-2024-mode</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/top-5-teams-to-pick-in-ea-fc-24-euro-2024-mode.892710/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/top-5-teams-ea-fc-24-euro-2024-mode/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-5-teams-ea-fc-24-euro-2024-mode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="151" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Euro 2024 mode is a must-play for all <em>EA FC 24</em> players, and EA Sports has ensured that it can attract the interest of beginners and veterans alike.</p> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">Like the World Cup 2022 mode in <em>FIFA 23</em>, the Euro content is exclusive and unlikely to appear in the next four games. The entire UEFA Euro mode is fully licensed, translating into authentic squads, historic moments, and many other things. Ultimately, the objective is to rewrite your history, and here are five teams that can help you do that.</p> <h2 id="h-5-best-teams-in-ea-fc-24-euro-2024-mode" data-injectable="false">5 best teams in EA FC 24 Euro 2024 mode</h2> <h2 id="h-france" data-injectable="false">France</h2> <figure data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="598" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">The French national side has a wealth of talents all over the pitch. Kylian Mbappe alone is a handful for any defense in <em>EA FC 24</em>. He’s arguably the most meta attacker you can control in any game mode, including the Euro 2024 mode. He’s well supported by the likes of Griezmann, Coman, and company, all of whom are viable attackers in their own rights. The defense has stars like Upamecano, Kounde, and Theo Hernandez, while the midfield is well marshaled by the Real Madrid duo Camavinga and Tchouameni. Youngsters like Zaire-Emery and Bradley Barcola add an X-factor on top of it all.</p>
 <h2 id="h-netherlands" data-injectable="false">Netherlands</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="507" data-current-count="807" data-injectable="true">Whether the Netherlands is among the top five teams in the real-life tournament can be up for debate. However, the team is exceptionally strong in terms of the <em>EA FC 24</em> Euro 2024 mode. The defense has Virgil Van Dijk, the best defender in the game. Matthijs De Ligt and Nathan Ake have also proven themselves at club level. The midfield has the star power of Frenkie De Jong, and the duo of Koopmeiners and Simmons have had fantastic seasons. In attack, you get the services of Cody Gakpo and Memphis Depay.</p>
 <h2 id="h-portugal" data-injectable="false">Portugal</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="574" data-current-count="874" data-injectable="true">Portugal is full of players who perform well in the game’s meta. They’re led by <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-do-siuu-in-ea-fc-24/">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, who, despite all the nerfs, continues to be a dominant performer in front of the goal. The duo of Joao Felix and Rafael Leao are efficient dribblers. The midfield offers you the duo of Bernardo Silva and Bruno Fernandes. They have their limitations, but you can’t find better football passers. The defense might appear weak initially, but Joao Cancelo, Nuno Mendes, and Ruben Dias are there. Portugal is a solid squad to pick in the <em>EA FC 24</em> Euro 2024 mode.</p>
 <h2 id="h-italy" data-injectable="false">Italy</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="800" data-injectable="true">This new generation of Italians has a lot of strong performers in its ranks. Donnarumma is one of the best keepers in the game if not the best, and the defense has players like Di Lorenzo and Bastoni. Nicolo Barella can control the midfield well, while Chiesa is an excellent wide attacker. The squad also includes utility options like Lorenzo Pellegrini, Gianluca Mancini, and Giacomo Raspadori. This team might not have big stars, but there’s a solid defensive foundation and overall balance.</p>
 <h2 id="h-england" data-injectable="false">England</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="581" data-current-count="881" data-injectable="false">Both Spain and Germany are hard to turn down, but the latter lacks a solid striker, while the former could fit better in the game’s meta. This English side, present in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-perform-the-griddy-ea-fc-24/">EA FC 24</a></em> Euro 2024 tournament mode, has some unique talents. Who better than Jude Bellingham to boss your midfield? Bukayo Saka and Phil Foden offer a lot of creativity, while Declan Rice is a great defensive screen. Harry Kane might not be quick, but he has precise finishing skills. The defense has great wing backs and defensively robust center-backs, making England an excellent choice in the Euro mode.</p>

<p data-characters="133" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the impending release of Euro 2024 tournament mode in <em>FC Mobile</em>, EA Sports has ensured that mobile games will be well-supported.</p> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false"><em>EA FC 24</em> players can already dive into an exclusive tournament mode packed with plenty of content on their PC, Nintendo Switch, and consoles. Mobile players will need to wait as of writing, but that won’t be for long. In an official blog post, EA Sports has announced that Euro 2024 tournament mode will also be released for mobile devices, albeit with some changes.</p> <h2 id="h-fc-mobile-euro-2024-tournament-mode-release-date" data-injectable="false">FC Mobile Euro 2024 tournament mode release date</h2> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">First comes the release date, as the community will be anxious to try this new mode. In many ways, the upcoming tournament will resemble the FIFA World Cup mode, released in 2022. The Euro 2024 tournament is coming to mobile devices on June 11, 2024.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-how-to-play-fc-mobile-euro-2024-tournament-mode" data-injectable="false">How to play FC Mobile Euro 2024 tournament mode</h2> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="627" data-injectable="true">The upcoming mode will feature all 24 qualified nations with authentic kits (Switzerland and Austria being the exceptions) and squads. Matches can be played at six different difficulties (you’ll have to select at first). You will also be able to edit the selected lineup, and change tactics as required to get more wins. </p>
 <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="269" data-injectable="false">The group stages are based on real-life fixtures, but knockouts depend on your in-game progression. Once you win the tournament, you can share it with the rest of the world on social media. EA Sports will also introduce two new stadiums inspired by real-life locations:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false"> <li>Olympiastadion Berlin</li> <li>BVB Stadion Dortmund</li> </ul> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="707" data-injectable="false">You’ll also earn different rewards after completing the tournament, but EA Sports has yet to share all the details. More information is expected to arrive in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-ultimate-tots-upgrade-sbc-solutions/">Ultimate Team</a> once the release date comes closer. With so many additional promo items coming soon, playing the <em>FC Mobile</em> Euro 2024 tournament mode should be on the priority list for many players</p>

<p data-characters="284" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We’re moving towards the fifth expansion of <em>Final Fantasy XIV,</em> and players are chomping at the bit for more information about the <em>Dawntrail</em> debut. The MMO’s expansion and patch schedule maintains a rather predictable beat, but we’ve seen a few curveballs along the way. </p> <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="218" data-injectable="false">With that in mind, here’s a timeline of previous <em>FFXIV </em>expansions in order by release date, along with the official release date for Version 7.0, <em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail </em>on July 2, and its early access details. </p> <h2 id="h-a-realm-reborn" data-injectable="false">A Realm Reborn</h2> <figure data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">When the original <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> 1.0 launched on September 30, 2010, it was immediately dubbed a failure. At least, that was until Yoshi P and his team stepped up to drag the game back from the dead, making it the incredibly successful MMO that we know today.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="116" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false"><strong><em>A Realm Reborn</em> was released on August 27, 2013, for PlayStation<strong> 3 and Windows</strong></strong>, replacing the previous version.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-heavensward" data-injectable="false">Heavensward</h2> <figure data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="198" data-injectable="false"><em>Heavensward</em>, the first expansion of <em>Final Fantasy XIV,</em> was announced in October 2014 and was set to release in the Spring of 2015, though it saw a small delay.

Here’s the full timeline for the<em> Shadowbringers</em>:</p>

It was teased in a post on the Lodestone and officially announced during a showcase on February 5, 2021. Here’s the full rundown of dates for <em>Endwalker</em>:</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong><strong>Release Date Revealed: </strong></strong></td><td>May, 2021</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Was it delayed?</strong></td><td>Yes, by two weeks from November 23, 2021</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pre-order began</strong></td><td>May 14, 2021</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Early Access Weekend began</strong></td><td>December 3, 2021&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Official launch date</strong></td><td>December 7, 2021</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h2 id="h-dawntrail" data-injectable="false">Dawntrail</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true"><strong>Update:</strong> On March 23, Square Enix officially revealed that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-dawntrail-lauches-july-reveals/"><em>FFXIV</em> will release its fifth expansion</a> of summer 2024, on July 2. As usual, <em>Dawntrail </em>will see an early access period beginning on June 28, but you’ll need to pre-order the expansion to register. As for what to expect, you can check out our preview from the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-dawntrail-media-tour-previews-new-zones-jobs-and-dungeon/">2024<em> Dawntrail </em>preview now</a> — including a peak at zones, Job changes, and more. </p>
 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">The announcement for <em>FFXIV’s</em> next adventure was made at PAX East, breaking the game’s typical cycle of Fan Fest-related announcements. It’s no surprise after the <em>Shadowbringers</em> COVID delays, and the domino effect that had into future development with <em>Endwalker</em>. </p> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true"><strong>Original Guide:</strong> From everything above and the speculative release date of Summer 2024, we can hazard a guess that <em>Dawntrail</em> could possibly be released during June 2024, but that is not confirmed as of yet.&nbsp;Plus, Yoshi-P already stressed during the Las Vegas Fanfest that it’s just a window, and summer goes on until August. </p>
 <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, all of the <em>Dawntrail </em>community events have wrapped up with no release date for the next <em>FFXIV</em> expansion. According to Yoshi-P, the summer timing is still <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-tokyo-fan-fest-reveals-include-pictomancer-6-55-date-and-dawntrail-timing/">part of the plan</a>, but they aren’t ready to nail down the exact date just yet. Part of that decision comes after the two-week Endwalker delay, which the team is still clearly frustrated by. On the subject, during his Tokyo Fan Fest presentation, Yoshida noted: </p>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">“We will not be releasing on Square Enix time; we will be releasing on [Final Fantasy] XIV time, which means properly in summer. So we will work very hard to get you that info as soon as possible and will have it for you next time, so thank you for your patience.”</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-player-count-gta-5-sales</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablos-100m-players-cant-get-close-to-minecraft-or-gta-vs-sales.892680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-player-count-gta-5-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard has revealed a new and rather impressive player count milestone for the&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>franchise as a whole, but it still pales in comparison to the sales figures for a single&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Diablo/status/1798837275813691506" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>X (formerly Twitter) account, Blizzard reveals that the&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>franchise has hit more than 100 million players, with that figure counting across all four mainline&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>installments and mobile entry&nbsp;<em>Diablo Immortal</em>.</p>
<p>By contrast, however,&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 5&nbsp;</em>alone has sold <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-5-surpasses-200-million-units-sold" rel="noopener" target="_blank">over 200 million copies</a> at last count, which is double the entire&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>franchise's players. Even that number pales in comparison to the mighty&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, which is sitting at a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67105983" rel="noopener" target="_blank">jaw-dropping 300 million sales</a> at time of writing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-series-player-count-gta-5-combat.jpg?itok=qt1kmDmm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-series-player-count-gta-5-combat.jpg?itok=wnVBTjUP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The whole&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>series can't hold a candle to&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>alone in terms of sales.</figcaption></figure><p>Things get even more dire for&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>when you realize that the 100 million figure isn't sales, but player counts.</p>
<p>That's fine for games like the first three&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>&nbsp;entries, but&nbsp;<em>Diablo Immortal&nbsp;</em>is a free-to-play mobile game, which presumably means that the many players who tried it for five minutes and then gave up to go do something else are included in that 100 million count.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>is available on Xbox Game Pass; in fact, it was the first Activision Blizzard game to be added to the service following Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">record-breaking acquisition</a> of the publisher.</p>
<p>Again, that means that presumably, anyone who gave&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>a try on Game Pass is also included in the 100 million figure. As a reminder, the&nbsp;<em>GTA&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>figures are cold, hard sales, not player counts, and the&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>figure is for an entire series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-player-count-gta-5-michael.jpg?itok=9FlH5qoi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-player-count-gta-5-michael.jpg?itok=-tHryDwC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"Hello, Take-Two? Yeah, I'd like to buy another gold-plated yacht, please."</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting here that the&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>series is still phenomenally successful. Within its first year of release,&nbsp;<em>Diablo Immortal&nbsp;</em>reportedly made Blizzard <a href="https://www.data.ai/en/insights/market-data/diablo-immortal-500-million/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">half a billion dollars</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>is apparently Blizzard's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-iv-is-blizzards-fastest-selling-game-ever-likely-surprising-no-one">fastest-selling game ever</a>.</p>
<p>This comparison simply proves the absolutely colossal presence that&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>still have in the gaming industry. When a series as popular and influential as&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>can't even hold a candle to the sales of a single game in a franchise, you know that franchise has taken over the world.</p>
<p>Rockstar is currently working on&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025">set for release next year</a>.

            <p>Slitterhead will release on 8th November 2024 for PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, PlayStation 4, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, according to a leaked gameplay trailer.</p>
<p>The two-minute teaser - which has since been pulled (but not before someone managed to download and re-share it, of course; you don't have to look very hard to it) - shows a mysterious, supernatural parasite jumping from host to host across a neon-soaked city.</p>
<p>It's likely the trailer leaked ahead of a formal reveal of Bokeh Game Studio's inaugural offering at this evening's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">Summer Game Fest 2024</a> presentation.</p>

<p>Interestingly, we get our first peek at the horror's combat, too. While it looks like not all characters can fight back, those that can take on the enemies in a way not too dissimilar from that of Stellar Blade. Expect a range of weapons, including some supernatural touches, such as the ability to grow Krueger-esque claws from your own hands. Nice.</p>
<p>As you may well expect from famed composer Akira Yamaoka, the soundtrack is pretty impressive, and the transitions from everyday citizen to murderous hellbeast are suitably grim given Keiichiro Toyama's glorious - or should that be gory-ious? - pedigree, which includes creating celebrated horror franchises like Siren and Silent Hill.</p>

<p>It's been some time since we've seen anything from Slitterhead. Our last official look was this time last year, when a developer diary posted revealed new details about its inaugural title, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterheads-unique-mechanics-include-a-playable-dog">including a sneaky peek at some of the game's enemies, abilities</a>, and - surprise! - the ability to play as a dog... something reprised in today's surprise footage, too.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Access-Ability Summer Showcase featured the latest in accessible games]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/24172897/access-ability-showcase-best-games-trailers-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-access-ability-summer-showcase-featured-the-latest-in-accessible-games.892674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24172897/access-ability-showcase-best-games-trailers-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Running concurrently with Summer Game Fest, the <a href="https://access-ability.uk/">Access-Ability Summer Showcase</a> redresses what gaming events leave out. Organized by accessibility consultant and critic Laura Kate Dale, it’s a reaction to events designed to build hype and how disabled gamers too often have to temper excitement with caution over whether revealed games will be accessible. A frustration, Dale told <em>The Verge</em>, driven by “the industry’s unwillingness to be open and transparent about gaming accessibility.”&nbsp;</p><p>Now in its second year, the showcase continues to push back against a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754562/summer-game-fest-women-diversity-geoff-keighley">lack of inclusive gaming events</a> as it grows — it includes <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fcurator%2F45010171%2Fsale%2FAccess-AbilitySummerShowcase2024">a dedicated Steam page</a> this year. Already, developers are not only viewing it as an opportunity to show off their games, Dale said, but also as encouragement to implement accessibility earlier in development to be ready for the event. “The idea that a place to proudly promote their accessibility would help push developers to have more features ready at earlier milestones makes me feel like the show is having a tangible impact,” Dale added.</p><p>The showcase aired on Twitch and YouTube (with the latter including ASL, BSL, and audio description) on June 7th, which is available to watch <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DxU5mgSRVmH8">right here</a> if you missed it live. A rundown of everything we saw can be found below.</p><p><h4>Roguelikes continue to embrace accessibility</h4></p><p>The showcase began with a look at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1515570%2FElsie%2F"><em>Elsie</em></a>, a “retro-inspired, bullet hell, action-platforming roguelike shooter” from Knight Shift Games. Despite its many categories, it will release in a crowded genre, where <em>Elsie </em>carries on the good work of <em>Dead Cells </em>in creating a roguelike that’s approachable for as many players as possible. <em>Elsie </em>includes a range of features to help parse fast-paced combat, like the ability to customize how the player character is highlighted, as well as ways to make combat more user-friendly.</p><p><h4>Increased accessibility for blind and visually impaired gamers </h4></p><p>At least half of the games highlighted at the showcase also demonstrated significant considerations for blind and visually impaired players.</p><p>The most unique of these was <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2121790%2FPeriphery_Synthetic%2F"><em>Periphery Synthetic</em></a>, a nonviolent, first-person Metroidvania from shiftBacktick that’s designed to be played entirely through audio cues. A startlingly robust soundscape supports this, and though it can be played completely unsighted, it includes curiously beguiling voxel visuals and is one of the most interesting blind-friendly games I’ve encountered. <em>Periphery Synthetic </em>is one to watch leading up to its release this summer.&nbsp;</p><p>Text-to-speech and narration are two features vital to blind and visually impaired accessibility, and two citybuilders were among the most prominent to include them at this year’s showcase. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2308630%2FDawnfolk%2F"><em>Dawnfolk</em></a>, from Darren Keller, is envisioned as an entry point to the genre and driven by simplicity in both gameplay and visuals. <a href="https://cfdj.itch.io/cellular-city"><em>Cellular City</em></a>, introduced by Callum Deery, is a similarly interesting take on the genre that challenges the player to think about the relationship between certain structures and which can and cannot coexist. Both feature robust text-to-speech and narration systems.</p><p><h4>Accessibility that extends to narrative games</h4></p><p>As part of a wider showcase of Fiction Factory Games’ accessibility considerations, we had a brief look at <em>The Shadow over Cyberspace</em>, in which the Cthulhu mythos meets Y2K. As a text-driven game, it’s made playable by blind and visually impaired players through audio description, closed captions, and text-to-speech, while visual considerations make complex, moving imagery customizable for players who need it.</p><p>A love letter to the old internet, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2079180%2FVIDEOVERSE%2F"><em>Videoverse</em></a> builds on similar ideas with its varied soundscape but also includes clear, high-contrast, and readable interfaces, which, as Alex Leone’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2253300%2FUpheaval%2F"><em>Upheaval</em></a> demonstrated, is vital to text-based gameplay. <em>Upheaval</em> is a “text-based open-world” adventure and, along with <em>Videoverse</em>, eschews the current trend of absurdly small UI text with clear, customizable interfaces and large text. Something that stuck out in <em>Upheaval</em>’s showcase was its inclusion of text-to-speech functions <em>and </em>the ability to integrate existing, and preferred, external text-to-speech software.</p><p><h4>It’s not all 2D</h4></p><p>Whitethorn Games is a publisher that has established itself as an industry leader in accessibility. Its upcoming <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1511880%2FSlime_Heroes%2F"><em>Slime Heroes</em></a>, developed by Pancake Games, is another soulslike embracing making this genre more user-friendly. More akin to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24139208/another-crabs-treasure-review-xbox-switch-ps5"><em>Another Crab’s Treasure</em></a><em> </em>than <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Slime Heroes </em>offers welcome mitigations for movement — including a toggleable double-jump — and its soulslike combat. This is great for players who struggle with reaction times (like me) and mobility. But one of the most interesting features on display was the ability to toggle on visual representations of hitboxes, making it easier to avoid those soulslike whiffs.</p><p>Two other 3D third-person adventures followed. Siro Games’ <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1682290%2FWko_The_Mask_Gatherer%2F"><em>Wéko the Mask Gatherer</em></a><em> </em>bears a resemblance to <em>The Legend of Zelda, </em>and its major features appear to revolve around navigation, both in-world and in its menus. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1106830%2FRainbow_Billy_The_Curse_of_the_Leviathan%2F"><em>Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan</em></a><em> </em>is an action-platformer about recoloring the world, which makes its focus on visual accessibility apt. It particularly focuses on colorblind accessibility, using multiple visual cues to clarify interactable elements, including colors, icons, and animation. It also deploys navigational features, including automatically focusing on objectives when returning to Billy’s ship, a major boon for those with cognitive disabilities.&nbsp;</p><p><h4>Mobility in focus</h4></p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2231190%2FMagical_Delicacy%2F"><em>Magical Delicacy</em></a><em> </em>is another Whitethorn joint: a 2D adventure that feels like a mix of <em>Treasures of the Aegean </em>and <em>Howl’s Moving Castle</em>. For players with reduced mobility or who need to use one hand, <em>Magical Delicacy </em>can be played with no buttons at all. That’s a focus for detective narrative game <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1534720%2FSpace_Boat%2F"><em>Space Boat</em></a>, too, which has been designed from the ground up to be entirely playable with one hand.</p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2058730%2FThe_Darkest_Files%2F"><em>The</em> <em>Darkest Files</em></a>, from Paintbucket Games, is another investigative game, this time based on true crime. Its first-person narrative loop can be controlled with a mouse alone — though it also allows for switching between input devices on the fly, which is great for adaptive controller users — and includes surprisingly discreet difficulty customizations outside of the usual presets to aid its detective gameplay.</p><p><h4>Taking your time is the most welcome trend of the year</h4></p><p>The most appreciated theme of the showcase was just how many games removed time constraints and fail states to better accommodate players’ ability to move at their own pace. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2407830%2FTrash_Goblin%2F"><em>Trash Goblin</em></a> is a medieval <em>American Pickers</em>. You take trash, chip away the dirt, and upsell it as treasure. It’s another game with no fail states or time limits, and this works in concert with ways to mitigate the game’s repeated inputs — a bane for players with chronic pain — to the point you can even make them automated.</p><p>One of the standouts of the entire showcase for me was <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1638070%2FFishbowl%2F"><em>Fishbowl</em></a>. Rhea Gupte walked us through this cozy slice-of-life sim from a two-person development team from India. While its non-stressful puzzles and chill story are emblematic of the value of designing an experience that’s accessible at its core, Gupte also highlighted <em>Fishbowl</em>’s accessibility options. There wasn’t a wide range on show, but it was heartening to see a host of features planned for the immediate future and the duo’s dedication to adding more. With how often well-resourced studios erroneously claim adding accessibility is impossible, it’s great to see a studio doing everything it can to make its game approachable.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-omnidirectional-movement/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-6-to-feature-%E2%80%98omnidirectional%E2%80%99-sliding-diving-and-sprinting.892668/</guid>

<p>Movement maniacs, fall in – Black Ops 6 is raising the bar regarding fast-paced mechanics that get you around the map in a rapid fashion. It was just reported by a leaker and corroborated by Insider Gaming that Black Ops 6 will feature a slew of fluid movement mechanics, including sliding, diving, and sprinting, all of which have been dubbed ‘Omnidirectional Movement’.</p>



<p>Could this be the most versatile and agile Call of Duty title in years?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-don-t-slow-down">Don’t Slow Down</h2>



<p>In a post on Twitter by BobNetworkUK, a reliable Call of Duty Leaker, it was explained that Black Ops 6 will allow players to dive, slide, and sprint in all directions. It was noted as being similar to Max Payne, in which players can press buttons to dive forward, backwards, or sideways, all while shooting their weapons. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>EXCLUSIVE:<br>Black Ops 6 will reportedly allow players to dive in all directions, similar to Max Payne. The game will also allow players to sprint in all directions. This combined functionality has been referred to several times as "Omnidirectional Movement."</p><p>Sliding returns too. <a href="https://t.co/JZ6s46rkyJ">pic.twitter.com/JZ6s46rkyJ</a></p></div>— bob. (@BobNetworkUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1799099632645206091?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Traditionally, slide cancelling and diving in Call of Duty are ‘forward motion mechanics’ that allow players to dive into or behind cover at the press of a button. You can get pretty creative with these mechanics, but they’ve remained relatively unchanged for years. This latest claim suggests that Black Ops 6 will have more fluid movement mechanics than ever before in series history, allowing movement kings to truly take advantage of the versatility on offer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-unrealized-potential-of-cooking-in-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Cooking is probably one of the last leisure activities that we can do for its own sake; firstly, cooking is something that most of us kind of need to do in order to, you know, eat, so it is kind of a necessity. But it can also be a creative exercise, and one that, exceeding the eventual domestic disaster, will always give a satisfying result; a result that will improve your skills and knowledge for the next round.</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">Once you know the basics, cooking can be a sandbox of experimentation, as you learn new methods, ingredients, spices, and so, it is not unlike a game. Maybe that’s why so many games use cooking systems in the first place, either as subsystems that give texture and flavor (heh) to a digital world, or transforming the act of cooking into a dextrous challenge of skill.</span></p></div><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Cooking in videogames usually come in two forms; one is simply by combining the ingredients the player acquired while exploring the game world, which can then grant specific bonuses for the actual gameplay portions, like in Breath of the Wild and the Monster Hunter series; or can later be used for other gameplay purposes, like giving gifts based on specific characters tastes. like in Stardew Valley and its wholesome brethren of similars.</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">The other form is more involved, and is featured in games in which cooking is the main course (heh), and it is abstracted into a series of micro-interactions of timing and skill. The best example of this is the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_Mama">Cooking Mama</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> series, in which the preparations of each dish consists of a series of simple control motions, with some generous grading at the end.</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Often this involves the micro-management of several tasks at once, like in friendship-tester Overcooked or the OG casual king Dinner Dash; there is a almost neurotic zen to be found in keeping as the lots of plates spinning at once, hence is why the DD formula still spawns very successful clones in the mobile market to this day.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other games are more involved in gamifying nitty-gritty of food preparation; the wonderful series </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/32041/The_Cook_Serve_Series_Bundle/">Cook, Serve, Delicious</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> combines strict time management with a large variety of micro-interactions to learn, and can be quite a challenge in the higher levels play; meanwhile </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/452570/Battle_Chef_Brigade_Deluxe/">Battle Chef Brigade</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> combines different genres into a stew (heh), like action platformer and match-3 puzzler, in order to abstract its core experience of anime Iron Chef, tough its individual mechanics falter due an excess of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbMQ7XrHp4s">complexity and jank</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(I should also mention </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/641320/Cooking_Simulator/">Cooking Simulator</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> hyper-detailed facsimile of a professional cook experience, though like most of those PlayWay published sims, the game mechanics feel less abstract and “gamey” to be interesting to a design discussion; it's still pretty fun though, and can be even educational for people who don’t know their pots from pans)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a sucker for a videogame cooking system, I think I get the appeal of both approaches; while just combining ingredient to assemble a predetermined recipe can be tedious, I once did </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://starbounder.org/Food">every single available recipe</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2D sci-fi minecrafter Starbound, mainly because the gathering of ingredients complemented so well the game loop of exploration, even though that game had no end goal for that system beside the requisite stat buffs and rather easy achievement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In fact, a lot of cooking games tend to be repetitive; the Cooking Mama series lack of challenge and more concrete goals than cooking for its own sake feels like a waste of some rather intricate systems, which eventually doomed the series and tragically led to Mama getting in some </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cooking-mama-cookstar-cryptocurrency-mining-blockchain-bitcoin-nintendo-cryptomining-explained-2020-4">shady bitcoin business</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. And as much as I love Cook Serve Delicious, doing the same micro-tasks over and over again is more like a light simulation of a taxing service job than lovingly elaborating a home meal.

Cooking is Venba feels more like a puzzle than a challenge, with little of the time pressure similar games have, but the act of following or diverging from a recipe highlight the cultural aspect of food in a way pretty much no other game does.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile classic PS1 RPG Suikoden 2 had a notorious </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KmVtU--qr8">cooking contest sidequest</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, one that made use of its large cast as judges; each with different, unique tastes that had to be accounted for when choosing the recipe. The gameplay consists of just selecting a recipe and mashing Circle, but this sidequest </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/198844-suikoden-ii/faqs/6289">arcane ruleset</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and surprisingly emotional twist and turns made it a fan favorite.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiabcFlVPV4">Order Up!</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a game for the Wii which made perhaps one of my favorite spins on the genre. It combines simple Mama-esque motions with the Wii Remote&nbsp; with DD-style time management; but the fun part is that you eventually get clients that have special tastes, like overdone, raw or spicy food. Cooking in that way only adds a bonus, so it's not obligatory,and integrates with the cooking mechanics in an interesting manner; for instance, an overdone dish needs to be removed just on the cusp of burning, which adds interesting wrinkles to the gameplay.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This last example highlights what I feel most cooking games lack; the creative element of preparing food. It’s rare that cooking games allow for the improvisation that is so satisfying when preparing food in real life, like swapping ingredients, improving the taste of a dish by choosing the right spices, or trying unusual ingredient combinations, like a pinch of salt in a dessert. In most of the examples we went through, the path to the final dish is usually a straight line with a binary win state; you either prepare or fail your dish, with no nuance in between.</span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Several games could be spiced up (heh) by having different sorts of goals, and allowing for player creativity in the same satisfying way as choosing the right build in an action game or RPG can be; what would be a dish that could satisfy the palates of a vegan and a meat-lover? Can you combine elements of dishes of different cultures without losing their essences? Where is the game that simulates the experience of making an accidental masterpiece with leftovers and gumption at 4AM?</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">Cooking is such an universal activity that it is no wonder why it is featured into so many games, and there is no shortage of interest in that intersection, considering the amounts of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLopY4n17t8RAQsF0jWSTVQI0sGPicQSQg">recipe videos</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and even </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://pixelatedprovisions.com/the-ultimate-final-fantasy-xiv-official-cookbook/">the</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://stardewvalleycookbook.com/">many</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bungiestore.com/destiny-the-official-cookbook">cookbooks</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> dedicated to video game food; but&nbsp; it still feels like unexplored territory in many ways.&nbsp; Successful games like Diner Dash and Overcooked perfected influential yet very particular mechanical interpretations, but I feel that we still lack THE cooking videogame, one that could launch an entire new genre by itself, and even get some people off DoorDash by enticing their curiosity about real food.

What interested you about doing a cafe-style game set during this time period?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sipsop, creator of Cacao Cafe</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I had always wanted to make a game to honor the main Mesoamerican cultures: Maya and Aztec. For one reason or the other, I had previously had no time or even inspiration to make it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cacao Cafe</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, many factors came together. There was a gamejam called "A Game By Its Cover" in 2020. We were in the middle of the pandemic and I had already participated in a previous version. This jam was about choosing a fictitious cartridge created by some artist somewhere in the world for "My Famicase Exhibition" and turn it into a real videogame. Among all the great creations, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://creativags.itch.io/cacaocafe">this one</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> appeared and caught my attention: a cover made by Raia that seemed like the perfect pretext to finally create a game about Mesoamerican culture.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The player will use very old cooking techniques and tools while making the food for their café. What thoughts went into turning traditional Mexica cooking techniques and tools into gameplay mechanics?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For me, the very basic part of a simulation game is that it is based on real situations, objects, and events that could exist in that period of time, although obviously, some creative license has been taken.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Initially, I wanted to make a simple game of setting up a coffee shop somewhere in pre-Hispanic Mexico, making products, improving the store, adding more furniture, decorating, etc. But in reality, those places didn't exist and I didn't want to go too far out of the real and cultural context. Plus, there were already many games like that, so it didn't seem to me that it added anything new. It just changed the aesthetics of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I thought: if I were a food merchant at that time, what would have been the actual process in that business? Fundamentally, it's the same way that actual people do food business in some traditional markets: they prepare their food at home, put it in baskets and go out to sell it in the streets around markets.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The objects still exist, the techniques are still valid... now the main question was: how do I turn it into a video game? That's when I thought the nicest way to show the techniques was to simulate the creation of the food, leaving the sales part like in the old games: where a random NPC comes and buys things based on your available stuff.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Can you walk us through the creation of one of the specific cooking techniques, from conception to completion, as a gameplay mechanic and how you took the various steps of the recipe and turned them into player interactions?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In principle, you must obtain the seeds, as there was no currency in ancient Mesoamerica. Everything was done based on a bartering system, so you must trade with what was considered a kind of currency at that time: the dry cocoa seeds. The barter part is the simplest, just exchanging values between variables in a basic store interface.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Later, with your seeds, you must return to your land and sow them. In this case, I decided to use a system like in a farm game: you take the seed, you plant it, you obtain the product, the growth lasts just a few seconds and you can collect the product, leaving the chinampa (the area you grow your crops) free again but unusable for this cycle and renewable the following cycle.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I wanted the player to have control of his raw material, so I created a permanent interface at the top indicating the cycle and day, in the upper right corner the cocoa beans that you are carrying, and at the bottom the cocoa seeds, corn, the product of cocoa and corn; and cocoa and corn powder.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The steps are as follows to create a drinkable product, for example chocolatl or atolli. The first step, once the product is obtained, is to pulverize it using the metlapilli, which the players already have in their inventory. The other tools must be purchased. Next, to create the flour, in real life the product seeds are placed on the metate and the metlapilli is passed numerous times until the grains are pulverized.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This part is where I wanted the player to have an experience closer to a real simulation of the preparation and not just clicking the buttons, so I decided to simulate the process: the player must take the seed, put it on the metate and then move the metlapilli back and forth (up and down in game) with the mouse or touch. With each movement, the metlapilli passes over the grains and grinds them until you obtain flour, whether cocoa or corn.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I also wanted that, if the user had a large inventory of grains, they could continue the process, so when they touched the gourd, the flour would go into the inventory and they could restart the process, just like in real life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, for hot chocolate, you need a pot. Then you need to turn on the heat and then the powder, but you also need to stir constantly so that it has a pleasant texture (it’s the same process for atole). This is how I wanted the player to continue moving with the game, so the first thing was to blow on the fire to light the embers. I decided to emulate the process by shaking the fan horizontally until the fire was lit. Then, the water in the pot would begin to boil. Now, the player must add the corn or cocoa powder to the water, which is done with a simple click</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, you must stir the pot using the grinder. In real life, this process produces foam in the chocolate or atole and is a slow process. To simulate it, I decided, as in the previous cases, to force the player to perform the stirring movement through the touch or the mouse vertically using the grinder right at the mouth of the pot.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In each process I had to make adjustments to the friction so that it felt more real. The fan, for example, moves with great agility, while the metatlapilli is difficult to control, I wanted the user to feel the weight of it. On the other hand, the grinder is lighter, however its collision is less precise, just as it should be in real life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Perhaps the mechanic that I liked the least was that of creating the tortilla or the chocolate bar, which on the one hand requires passing the dough from one side to the other, but after trying several solutions it ended up like this moving the dough object from one hand to the other.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into choosing the recipes that you implemented into the game? Why were those recipes important to include?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At first I thought about making chocolate only since the game should be about cocoa, but in real life, people ate corn products more than chocolate, so I thought about integrating corn products, but because of the lack of time in a jam, I had to think about mechanics that could be shared by both grains to get more content with less programming. That's how I started selecting recipes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Grinding is a common process, and since it was the first part of all processes and the base of the raw material, it had to be chosen obligatorily. Additionally, as it is a traditional process, I approved of it immediately.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After that, traditionally, both tortillas and chocolate bars are created in much the same way, by kneading and heating. I did not think of this process immediately, but rather I had to research what the traditional way of creating chocolate bars was. Upon discovering that it was very similar, I decided to also add this recipe. In this case, the cultural part also had to do with it, since the tortilla is the basis of many stews in traditional and even modern Mexican cuisine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the particular case of drinks, the process is also similar, as atole and chocolate differ very little in their preparation. So, I could add this process and it's funny to think that the first thing I should have selected for a coffee shop where they sell hot chocolate should be this one, but it was practically the last thing I chose and, in this case, it was definitely chosen because it had to be integrated, as it was implicit in the name of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For all these examples, the techniques and tools are the same, so you could have twice as many products, using the same techniques and only changing the seeds and images.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unlike chocolate, there are an infinite number of recipes that can be prepared with corn. I made a big list of dishes, however their preparation is more sophisticated or even unique, so adding these mechanics required creating many more interfaces, graphics, objects, ingredients, systems and processes, just to add one or perhaps two more products.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You also capture several different elements of Mexica culture in the farming techniques, stories, music, calendar dates, and language of the game. What design ideas went into creating such a comprehensive snapshot of ancient Mexica culture?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My intention was to transport the players, at least in their imagination, to that era. For the initial images, I decided to use a style similar to that of the codices, including some iconography from them. You see this, for example, in the text balloons.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the scenarios, I was inspired by artistic conceptions from museums, especially archaeological zones. In the case of the characters, I looked for the most common typical costumes: not the most sophisticated ones, but those that could be seen on any morning at the flea market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I wanted the game to have these cultural connotations. I wanted the players, through the game, to learn more about this culture. As I said before, I did not simply want to change the images of a café-running game, but make it an immersive experience. I think about the possibility that someone who plays it either already feels attracted to the Mexican culture or ends up wanting to know more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To integrate this cultural part, I added the small tips that appear randomly and give the player some information about interesting facts related to culture, food, or both in each scene change. Researching and selecting these texts was a long process, but I really felt very happy to be able to include them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And since the game has a time cycle, I wanted to base it on the actual dates that were used at that time. What was celebrated? How was it done? How could that interfere with the game character's life? What was the process for a pochteca to become a successful merchant recognized even in the emperor's court?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last but not least: music. I was looking for and selecting music that worked for me, both because of the simplicity of the instruments and the roots. I also added some background sounds, frequent and random drumming, bustle of people, some flutes, and many birds. The main idea was to integrate all of these elements so that the game, no matter how simple it was, would take the player by the hand and show them what things could be like on a nice, sunny day at that time, all cohesive through the manufacturing and marketing of cocoa and corn products, which was the premise of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into creating the visual style for the game? How did you work ancient Mexica culture into the game's art style alongside the various other mechanics and elements?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mainly I wanted to capture the feel of an early console game, so I elected to pixelate and reduce the palette of the game. I really wanted the game to have that retro feel. I worked on experimenting with a reduced palette of colors, selecting the ones that best suited the experience. The game needed to have landscapes, blue skies, very green areas, and tones that would lend themselves to simulating corn and chocolate.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the same time, I wanted to help the player to perceive the different textures in the materials, in the recipes, in the people, and in the landscapes I had all drawn in pixel art because I love it. It feels so retro, and I made a lot of changes from conception to the end product. For the decorations between scenes, my initial intention was to put the staggered fretwork that represents water or air for the Mesoamerican people, but in the sketch, they did not look very good, so I reduced the patterns until I found the concentric squares of the different color schemes that adorn most of the changes of scene.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the characters, I wanted to keep the main aesthetics of the original Famicase image, with the anime-style girl, but I also wanted to do it more in the style of early Mexican comic artists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did it feel to explore your own culture so deeply with a game you created? What did it feel like to delve into the old cooking techniques of your culture?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I was just a kid, we went to visit a town that still had many pre-Hispanic customs ingrained. For us kids from the city, it was very exciting to observe how our great-grandmother cooked. She had us shell the corn, and we all watched how she made the tortillas. It was a spectacle of color, heat, joy, and applause. Each tortilla must be kneaded between the hands by gently clapping and this produces a sound of applause. Taking one of those freshly made tortillas on a comal to your mouth was quite an experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creating this game allowed me to remember those moments and by researching the holidays, the social classes, and the type of commerce, it made me feel great pride, but at the same time a desire to share with others, just like when you eat something delicious and you tell someone else: come try it, you'll like it!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's how it was for me to make this game. It was to say, "Look what a wonderful thing this culture was, how much richness it contains. Let me show you through my game some of the things that I loved."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regarding the techniques, well, it is something traditional here that you could observe in any visit to a rural market. The utensils and the techniques are the same. I knew the name of some objects in Spanish and it was very enriching to learn their name in Nahuatl.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is an experience that I would recommend to any developer: promoting their own culture in a world that is increasingly open to sharing and knowing how to share this treasure that enriches all of humanity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What do you hope the player takes away from steeping themselves in this culture and time period? From seeing the past and history of the Mexica culture, whether they already knew about it or not?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I would like it to be a mainly fun, relaxing experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A plus would be if the player could take away some curiosity to investigate or learn more about the culture and traditions of Mexico, not only from the past but current regional cultures all over the country. I hope that there is more curiosity to know those customs, social structures, religions, art, and, obviously, food. It is always a source of pride when other people are interested in your culture.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And perhaps, now that we have the almost free chance of seeing videos and images of archaeological and tourist sites without moving from your home, players can observe and have the possibility of marveling not only at the Mexica culture but at the richness that all the original peoples around the world have.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="241" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There are endless choices you’ll need to make when you journey through the adventure that is <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. Who to fight, where to go, and what party to keep with you are just some of the decisions that you’ll be making. </p> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false">You’ll also need to decide what characters you want to save from terrible fates. One of these characters is Duke Ravengard, Wyll’s father, who you’ll be given the quest to save in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/baldurs-gate-3-act-1-checklist-and-all-main-quests-explained/">Act 1</a>. However, it will be a while before you’re actually able to save him. If you’re wondering whether it’s worth it to save him, we’re here to let you know.</p> <h2 id="h-is-it-worth-saving-duke-ravengard-in-bg3" data-injectable="false">Is it worth saving Duke Ravengard in BG3?</h2> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="736" data-injectable="true">If you’re interested in following Wyll’s story, then <strong>yes</strong>, you should save Duke Ulder Ravengard. This rescue won’t actually score you any useful items or anything, as it’s more for sentimentality and story. Reuniting Wyll with his father is a sweet moment, and if you want to get the best story you can, it’s worth the trouble.</p>
 <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">That being said, if you’re only in it for the rewards, you’ll be disappointed. You’ll get nothing like the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/where-to-get-the-intransigent-warhammer-in-baldurs-gate-3/">Intransigent Warhammer</a>. Saving Duke Ravengard is also not an easy task, and it won’t be until <em>BG3’s </em>Act 3 that you’re able to rescue him. </p> <figure data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-save-duke-ravengard-in-bg3-act-3" data-injectable="false">How to save Duke Ravengard in BG3, Act 3</h2> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">In Act 3, you’ll be given the ability to save the Grand Duke in the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-save-the-iron-throne-prisoners-in-baldurs-gate-3-bg3/">Iron Throne Prison</a>. After Gortash’s coronation, he’ll disappear, and you’ll meet up with Mizora at your camp. She’ll offer Wyll a new contract: Wyll can break the contract immediately, but she won’t tell him where his father is. Or, he can forge an eternal contract with Mizora, and she’ll tell you where the Grand Duke is. </p>
 <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">Regardless of what you choose, head to The Iron Throne by using the submersible, and Duke Ravengard is in the cell directly to the East of the ladder. You’ll only get six combat rounds to save him and others, so use your turns wisely.</p> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="true">If you choose not to learn Duke Ravengard’s location from Mizora, she’ll appear when you get him out of his cell. She’ll try to kill him by summoning Combustion Belly Spiderlings. The Grand Duke will only have 35 HP when you find him, so before taking him out of his cell, heal him to have a better chance of saving him.</p>
 <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">Try using Telekinesis to move Duke Ravengard out of the way, or use the Dimension Door spell to teleport him out of the way. Whatever you decide to do, you need to move quickly since you only have six turns to save him. Once Duke Ravengard is in the submersible, he can’t be harmed. </p> <p data-characters="127" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve done it successfully, you can meet up with Duke Ravengard at the camp where he and Wyll have a nice reunion. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173179/adata-xpg-gaming-handheld-modded-lpcamm2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Adata has become the latest company to join the hype surrounding PC gaming handhelds — but the <a href="https://www.adata.com/us/news/1136/">XPG Nia prototype it revealed</a> during Computex 2024 is completely different from what we’ve seen so far. The handheld is the first to come <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24151369/lpcamm2-laptop-memory-ram-lenovo-ifixit">with LPCAMM2 memory</a>, making it far easier to swap out and upgrade RAM. </p><p>As <a href="https://liliputing.com/adata-xpg-nia-handheld-gaming-pc-will-have-upgradeable-lpcamm2-memory-a-display-that-tilts-upward-and-a-focus-on-the-modding-community/">reported by <em>Liliputing</em></a>, you’ll be able to access the device’s storage beneath the kickstand on the back of the device. You can also remove and replace the device’s M.2 2230 SSD. These aren’t the only things you’ll be able to mod, either.</p><p>During an interview <a href="https://youtu.be/-wmj02v4I_8?si=q-90IrPlrs9w12t8&amp;t=440">with YouTuber GGF Events</a>, XPG product head Luca Di Fiore said the company is building the handheld for the “modding market” and will use a “circular computing platform.” This means that Adata will release 3D files and pinout information for the device so users can mod the device, 3D print their own accessories, or even repurpose its parts.</p><p>The XPG Nia features a seven-inch display that lifts up and away from the handheld’s chassis, along with four rear buttons, a USB-C port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It will also have a front-facing camera that enables real-time eye and head tracking for foveated rendering, <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21432/xpg-demos-nia-handheld-gaming-pc-foveated-rendering-swappable-dram">as pointed out by <em>AnandTech</em></a>. We’ve seen foveated rendering <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23609901/gran-turismo-7-psvr-2-hands-on">used in some VR headsets</a>, which uses eye-tracking to determine where you’re looking, allowing it to display that area in full resolution while displaying the rest in a lower resolution.</p><p>XPG still hasn’t confirmed the chip that will power its handheld, but Di Fiore tells GGF Events that it has multiple prototypes based on <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/amds-hardware-ai-ryzen-phoenix-cpus-set-to-soar-in-razers-blade-14-laptop">AMD’s line of Phoenix chips</a>. The company is also shooting for a price between $500 and $600 but may launch the device through a Kickstarter campaign. Even though the XPG Nia is just a prototype for now, it holds a lot of promise and could be a refreshing addition to the growing handheld gaming market, which already has the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">Steam Deck</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review">Asus Rog Ally,</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review">the MSI Claw</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Update, June 7th: </strong>Added details on foveated rendering.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/what-does-ttk-mean-in-warzone-answered/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=what-does-ttk-mean-in-warzone-answered<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="268" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re new to <em>Warzone</em> or first-person shooter games in general, there can be a lot of phrases and acronyms that won’t make sense to you at first. One of those is TTK, but don’t worry if you’re lost, as I’m here to give you the answer. </p> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">FPS games have dominated the gaming world for years, and <em>Call of Duty</em> is without question one of, if not the biggest of them all. It’s no surprise then that it has a huge community of players, and has essentially created its own language among those who regularly play it. </p> <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">If you’re new to the scene and see people talking about TTK, but just can’t figure out what it means, then I’ve got you covered. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>TTK is super important. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-what-does-ttk-stand" data-injectable="false">What does TTK stand?</h2> <p data-characters="80" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"><strong>TTK in <em>Warzone</em> and other FPS games simply stands for “Time To Kill.”</strong></p> <h2 id="h-ttk-in-warzone-explained" data-injectable="false">TTK in <em>Warzone</em> explained</h2> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="702" data-injectable="true">Knowing what it stands for is all well and good, but what does it actually mean? Well, Time To Kill is exactly what it sounds like—how long it takes to kill an enemy from the moment you fire your weapon. Therefore, you want to use guns that have a low TTK as they’ll be the quickest at eliminating your opponents. </p>
 <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">Now, it’s worth remembering that having the fastest fire rate doesn’t automatically mean it has a low TTK. You could use a gun with a high fire rate that deals very little damage, and its TTK would actually be slower than a gun with a low fire rate but high damage. Both fire rate and damage factor are included in the calculation. </p> <h2 id="h-what-gun-has-the-fastest-ttk-in-warzone-right-now" data-injectable="false">What gun has the fastest TTK in <em>Warzone</em> right now?</h2> <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="false">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fastest-time-to-kill-weapons-in-warzone-season-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Warzone</em> gun with the fastest TTK</a> right now is the SOA Subverter at 688 milliseconds. This battle rifle does pack quite the punch, but if you can control the recoil, you’ll kill your enemies very quickly. </p>

<p data-characters="388" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Destiny 2’s The Final Shape</em> expansion will take you quite some time to work through. Given the price of the expansion, this makes sense since you’re paying the premium of a lot of bigger games. However, this also might leave you wondering just how far you have left until the main campaign is complete. Here are all the missions in <em>Destiny 2’s The Final Shape</em> expansion.</p> <h2 id="h-every-mission-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape-expansion" data-injectable="false">Every mission in Destiny 2: The Final Shape expansion</h2> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false">In total, there are <strong>eight main missions</strong> you must complete before completing the <em>Final Shape</em> campaign. There’s more to it than that, however, which we’ll discuss further below. For now, here’s every mission in order:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true"> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-transmigration-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Transmigration</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-temptation-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Temptation</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-exegesis-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Exegesis</a></li> <li>Requiem</li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-ascent-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Ascent</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-dissent-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Dissent</a></li> <li>Iconoclasm</li> <li>Final Mission (locked behind <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-salvations-edge-raid-schedule-and-details-for-the-final-shape-race/">the Salvation’s Edge raid</a>)</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">The final mission is a little confusing since we’re currently unsure if this is referring to the World First clear of the raid, or if you’re required to complete the raid yourself to experience the final chapter in the story. Once we have more details on it, we’ll update this guide to reflect that.</p> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="737" data-injectable="false">All in all, this <strong>should take around 10 hours</strong> for the average player to complete. Weaved in between each of the above missions are some added side activities, such as speaking with your Ghost, conversing with your fireteam, or completing open-world content like Lost Sectors and Strikes. If you’re playing in Normal mode, this may go by a little faster. It can also go a bit faster with a fire team of three people.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Week in Gaming Business - Gone but Not Forgotten]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-7th</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-week-in-gaming-business-gone-but-not-forgotten.892608/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-7th<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's time for another roundup of what's been happening this week on the business side of the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Sadly, this week saw more studios laying off employees, including the somewhat bizarre closure of a studio purchased by its parent company just a few months ago.</p>
<p>We also saw a damning report regarding Warner Bros' management of&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>emerging, as well as a touching billboard message from New Blood. Let's see what's been happening this week!</p>
<h2>Behaviour Interactive lays off employees, calls layoffs "strategic changes"</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-behaviour-interactive-gaming-business.jpg?itok=p5VqVO5x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-behaviour-interactive-gaming-business.jpg?itok=J-X1utdm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>may be going strong, but Behaviour Interactive has still been hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>developer Behaviour Interactive <a href="https://media.bhvr.com/behaviour-interactive-implements-strategic-changes-for-future-growth" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced this week</a> that it would lay off "up to 95 employees", most of whom are based in the company's Montreal studio.</p>
<p>A rather ghoulishly-worded press release describes these layoffs as "strategic changes for future growth", calling them a part of "improving the distinction between [Behaviour's] product, production, business development, and marketing resources".</p>
<p>The timing of this announcement seems a little unfortunate given that Behaviour revealed a round of new spinoff games and partnerships for&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-crossovers-spinoffs">just a few scant weeks ago</a>.</p>
<h2><em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>developer Avalanche closes an eight-month-old studio</h2>
<p>Another studio hit by layoffs this week is&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rage 2&nbsp;</em>developer Avalanche, which <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/statement-nymr" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced the closure of two of its locations</a>&nbsp;a few days ago.</p>
<p>Avalanche's New York and Montreal locations will be shut down, resulting in around 50 employees losing their jobs.</p>
<p>The closure of the Montreal location is particularly remarkable given that Avalanche <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/avalanche-studios-group-expands-to-montreal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">only opened the studio in October last year</a>&nbsp;after acquiring Montreal-based developer Monster Closet back in 2021.</p>
<h2><em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>developer's Kharkiv studio apparently hit by layoffs</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-dreamlight-valley-gameloft-kharkiv-gaming-business.jpg?itok=F2zYqxTn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-dreamlight-valley-gameloft-kharkiv-gaming-business.jpg?itok=8_95TRhW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>studio Gameloft has apparently been hit by layoffs too.</figcaption></figure><p>Reports emerged this week that&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>developer Gameloft has been hit by layoffs, concentrated in its Kharkiv location.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://gamedev.dou.ua/news/layoffs-in-gameloft-kharkiv/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ukrainian news platform GameDev DOU</a>, the layoffs affected more employees than were laid off at Gameloft's Lviv location earlier this year, which means that over 38 employees were let go from the Kharkiv studio.</p>
<p>GameDev DOU says that affected employees weren't compensated, and that studio manager Artem Nabatov was one of the employees let go. No official confirmation of these layoffs has been released, however.</p>
<h2>Summer Game Fest trailers are reportedly very expensive indeed</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a61006534/summer-game-fest-explained/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an Esquire article</a> that appeared earlier this week, if you're a developer looking to have your trailer showcased at Summer Game Fest, you're going to be paying a very heavy toll.</p>
<p>Esquire cites an "insider" who describes Summer Game Fest and Geoff Keighley's other show, The Game Awards, as "really ***ing expensive". Reportedly, trailers cost $250k for a single minute, with prices rising to an eye-watering $550k for two and a half minutes.</p>
<p>If those prices are accurate, the work of <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-games-fest-website-geoff-keighley-taco" rel="noopener" target="_blank">whoever's still holding onto the summergamesfest.com domain</a> seems even more important.</p>
<h2>Inside the troubled development of&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-gaming-business.jpg?itok=HgtfDA-e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-gaming-business.jpg?itok=0RY5xFU_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>'s development was reportedly fraught with trouble.</figcaption></figure><p>This week, Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report">published an article</a> detailing the fraught story of how Warner Bros'&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>became the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win">very expensive flop</a> that it was.</p>
<p>Schreier's report talks of a constantly-changing development focus, a culture of "toxic positivity" that discouraged honest internal criticism, and an insistence that last-minute magic would save the project. Where have we <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964" rel="noopener" target="_blank">heard</a> that one <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-story-behind-mass-effect-andromedas-troubled-five-1795886428" rel="noopener" target="_blank">before</a>?</p>
<p>That same report also claimed that&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady is helping out with a director's cut version of&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and that the studio is pitching a new single-player project. Here's hoping you succeed, Rocksteady.</p>
<h2>New Blood's poignant billboard eulogy</h2>
<p>We're ending today on what I suppose cannot be called a "positive" note, but it is a rather sweet one, albeit a poignant one as well.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1798905939497738456" rel="noopener" target="_blank">spotted by reporter Stephen Totilo</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dusk&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill&nbsp;</em>publisher New Blood hired an electronic billboard in downtown Los Angeles to eulogize <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks</a>, and several other studios that were (in some cases allegedly) shut down this year, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure">Roll7</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition">Volition</a>.</p>
<p>The billboard features the messages "gone but not forgotten", "thank you for great games from your friends at New Blood", and, perhaps most pointedly, "we love you, we miss you, we hate money". Amen.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Slitterhead Release Date Accidentally Leaked by Developer]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slitterhead-release-date-apparently-leaked</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/slitterhead-release-date-accidentally-leaked-by-developer.892605/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slitterhead-release-date-apparently-leaked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>release date appears to have been leaked ahead of the long-awaited horror project's gameplay reveal during the Summer Game Fest showcase later today.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, SGF host Geoff Keighley <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slitterhead-gameplay-reveal-sgf-2024">confirmed</a> that&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>would feature during the showcase, but thanks to developer Bokeh Game Studio (seemingly) mistakenly uploading a trailer earlier today, we now know when it's launching.</p>
<p>If that trailer is to be believed, then the&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>release date is November 8th. The game will arrive on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox Series X|S, but an Xbox One release doesn't seem to be lined up.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/slitterhead-release-date-leaked-standoff.jpg?itok=IWdrheaT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/slitterhead-release-date-leaked-standoff.jpg?itok=xu6ae0Jh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>is coming your way in November, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer, which you can <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/06/slitterhead-launches-november-8-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-and-pc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">still see right here via Gematsu</a>, shows off some of&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead</em>'s hack-and-slash-inspired gameplay, which looks to blend survival horror-style atmosphere with a more action-oriented combat focus.</p>
<p>As befits a project led by&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>creator Keiichiro Toyama, we get to see some pretty horrific imagery in the trailer, including characters with caved-in eye sockets and horrific spindly monsters.</p>
<p><em>Slitterhead</em>'s core gameplay conceit appears to be the ability to possess any number of people walking around the game's city environment, with those characters subsequently gaining the ability to fight against monsters using weapons apparently conjured from blood.</p>
<p>It also looks like multiple characters will be able to fight together, although whether this represents a multiplayer component or simply an AI companion system remains to be seen.</p>

<p><em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>is the newest project from&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>creator Keiichiro Toyama. It's being developed under the auspices of his <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-creator-keiichiro-toyama-founds-bokeh-game-studio">new company Bokeh Game Studio</a>.</p>
<p>Officially revealed back in 2021,&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>also boasts the involvement of&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>alumnus Akira Toriyama, who's working on music for the game. Other Bokeh staffers with industry history include&nbsp;<em>The Last Guardian&nbsp;</em>producer Kazunobu Sato and <i>Gravity Rush</i>&nbsp;producer Junya Okura.</p>
<p>Assuming the aforementioned trailer is accurate,&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>launches on November 8th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
Steam is home to some absolutely brilliant games - everything from psychological horrors to adorable pet sims. It is also home to a game simply called Banana. 
</p>
<p>
"What exactly is Banana?" I hear you ask. Well, it's a free game where you do nothing more than click on the image of a banana, as a counter keeps a tally of how many times you have clicked it.
</p>
<p>
And yet, despite this simple concept, there are over 100,000 people currently playing Banana.

<p>
At the time of writing, 137,817 Steam users are clicking away at a banana on a screen (or at least have the game open). 
</p>
<p>
To put that into comparison, there are currently 42,521 people playing Helldivers 2, Ghost of Tsushima has 23,511 current players and Hellblade 2 has 199. Even with Banana being a free game to download, it is still quite something to see these figures... so, of course I had to give it a go. 
</p>
<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, Banana became the first game I ever managed to get all of the achievements for.  I thought this was because I'd clicked the banana 100 times, which awarded me with the 'Click' accolade, but after looking further  you unlock this achievement after having the game open for one minute, so maybe I happened to click beyond 100 after 60 seconds. 
</p>
<p>
Surely there must be more to Banana than that? Even though I had my achievement, I kept on clicking. I had a hunch that something would happen when I hit 1000 clicks. 
</p>
<p>
997, 998, 999... the moment of truth was here. I clicked again and... nothing happened. The banana on my screen remained as it had been from the very beginning.

<p>
Despite this seemingly benign gameplay, further digging has led me to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1225691328998936576/1236959941097558056">Banana Discord</a>, and the revelation that this game is not simply an idle pastime. It is actually a game that lets players collect bananas to sell in Steam's marketplace, which tops up their Steam wallet.
</p>
<p>
Some bananas on the marketplace are going for mere pennies (the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/2923300/Pandanana">Pandanana banana</a> is currently on there for 3p), but others are being sold at a much higher price. There is a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/2923300/Crypticnana">Crypticnana banana</a> currently on there with a starting price of £254.52. Apparently there are only 25 of these bananas in existence.
</p>
<p>
As far as I can tell, there isn't any shady blockchain situation going on with the whole Banana movement, but it is certainly not what I was expecting to come across this afternoon. To each their own, I guess.

  <p id="K4Pi0C"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/honkai-star-rail/40897"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a> just closed out its <strong>version 2.3 livestream</strong>, teasing what’s to come in the next update, which launches the evening of June 18 EDT. Alongside new characters and events, Hoyoverse uses the stream to distribute <strong>codes</strong> that reward free Stellar Jade and other upgrade materials.</p>
<p id="AghpTw">This update brings some highly anticipated characters: the fire Destruction-user Firefly and the quantum Erudition character Jade. Both of these characters played large roles in the Penacony story (whether it’s directly or by helping some more familiar faces from off-screen) and it makes sense that they’re getting their praise, since the main story on Penacony is wrapping up.</p>
<p id="2xwFN7">The stream also showed a new spin-off of Simulated Universe, a <em>Bejeweled</em>-like origami bird minigame, and new relic and planar ornament sets to equip your characters with.</p>
<hr id="QnPN8o">

<p id="oAC8SV">These codes are only active until the day ends, so you’ll want to make sure to use them quickly.</p>
<p id="FWwhcK">The <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> reward codes from the version 2.3 livestream are:</p>
<ul>
<li id="BKIIiC"><a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/gift?code=3AJUD36P766B">3AJUD36P766B</a></li>

</ul>
<p id="xdLCVT">These codes will expire on <strong>June 8 at 11:59 a.m. EDT / 8:59 a.m. PDT</strong>, so use them quickly or you’ll miss out on the free loot.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24172471/chime-how-to-watch-best-horror-movie-2024-kiyoshi-kurosawa<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Nk4WcM">The release date on a new Kiyoshi Kurosawa movie should be an internationally recognized holiday for film fans, particularly for horror die-hards. <em>Chime</em>, the latest from the Japanese director of <em>Cure </em>and <em>Pulse</em>,<em> </em>warrants that kind of celebration. It’s terrifying, beautifully made, and one of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24064917/best-movies-2024">the highlights of 2024</a> so far, no matter the genre. The only problem is that most people don’t know the movie exists, or don’t know they can watch it, because it’s only available through a somewhat complicated, NFT-inflected process. </p>
<p id="fGhgqz"><em>Chime </em>is currently rentable through the Japanese digital video trading platform Roadstead.io. Digital video trading, or DVT, as Roadstead’s site calls it, is sort of an evolution of NFTs. A certain number of copies of a movie are made available to purchase, and then the purchasers can do whatever they want with them, including renting them out to other users at whatever price point they decide on. </p>
<p id="iFVmhT"><em>Chime </em>seems to be Roadstead’s only movie so far, and thankfully, it’s easy enough to rent, though you’ll have to jump through a few hoops, starting with making an account on Roadstead’s site. From there, you head to <em>Chime</em>’s rental page — which I can’t actually figure out how to access without a <a href="https://roadstead.io/asset/rental/8d2e6759582dec0f5f35fa5a91ca0000">direct link</a> or a Google search. </p>
<p id="8USQSX">Once you click the “Rental” button, you can select which user’s copy of the movie you’d like to rent. The prices vary from copy to copy, and they’re available for a variable number of days as well. For example, one copy might cost $4.50 for a one-day rental, while another owner offers a $10 rental that lasts a week. Once you’ve selected a price and length, you can rent the movie, so long as you have a card that can be used internationally, as the site currently only accepts payment in yen. But after all that, the movie’s right there in your “assets” tab to watch for as long as you’ve got it rented. </p>
<p id="cvLcjs">The good news is that <em>Chime </em>is more than worth jumping through all these hoops for. </p>

<p id="0S7NI0">The movie follows a former chef named Matsuoka who is teaching cooking classes while he waits to find another job. One day, a student starts complaining about a strange sound he can’t stop hearing, which seems to be changing him from the inside out, causing him to lose control of his behavior and even become violent. What makes the noise especially terrifying, though, is that it seems to spread from person to person with no warning or signs at all, leaving every moment of the movie unpredictable and tense. Kurosawa hasn’t made a horror film since 2016, but he’s sharper than he’s ever been. </p>
<p id="0mB2gX">Kurosawa has always been a master of creating tense, terrifying atmospheres, and he seems to take the idea of building this mood within <em>Chime</em>’s short run time as a personal challenge. He pulls out every trick in his very deep bag and manages to create a creepier, more intense movie in just a couple of scenes than most movies this year have managed in their entirety. </p>
<p id="iERl6z">From its earliest moments, set in Matsuoka’s kitchen classroom, everything about <em>Chime </em>feels perfectly calibrated to unsettle viewers. Kurosawa’s camera sweeps by students innocently cooking, but lingers on knives and burners. It sits sedately while people chop onions, like it’s just waiting for them to have an accident. When people walk through the space, it feels like a threat. They move quickly and with purpose, sometimes even with a knife pointing out in front of them, though only to cut more vegetables back at their station. It’s agonizing and brilliant. </p>
<p id="os27SX">In minutes, before any of the plot has been introduced, there’s an inescapable pull, a sense that something is going to go horribly wrong. All that’s left is to wait and see what. Kurosawa makes this whole sequence feel like a magic trick, a movie’s worth of tone-setting, handled in minutes through nothing but framing and blocking. But Kurosawa’s most impressive element in <em>Chime </em>is the movie’s brilliant sound design, which makes every noise feel cacophonous and inescapable. </p>

<p id="tiGnu3">The audience never officially hears “the sound,” which the student first describes as a kind of “chime.” But there’s a recurring motif in the movie’s sparse score that seems to stand in for it instead. Around that, though, every part of the movie’s sound design is ratcheted up. Noises are distinct and clear, played with a loud crispness that feels designed to worm its way into viewers’ heads and infuriate them. Inside the sparse kitchen classroom where much of the movie’s action takes place, the sounds of knives hitting cutting boards feels like an echo that can’t be escaped, and the spatulas on frying pans sound like nails on a chalkboard.</p>
<p id="3OHsyC">Each sound presses down around the audience and the characters until the chime cuts through and turns the scene on its head, providing both relief from the encroaching shroud of other noises and unease in the sudden silence — and often violence — that follows it. </p>
<p id="3ajxxq">With all these elements working in dreadful harmony, Kurosawa has made far and away one of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24090384/best-horror-movies-2024-how-scary">best horror movies of the year so far</a>, and he sets a more complete and frightening tone in less than half the run time of most of those movies. Like all Kurosawa’s movies, <em>Chime </em>isn’t necessarily the kind of scary that’s going to make you jump in the moment. It’s the kind of scary that might wake you up a few days later with an uneasy feeling, with a scene from the movie stuck uncomfortably in your head. In fact, the noise at the center of <em>Chime </em>feels like an almost perfect metaphor for the way its director treats his horror movies. They start quiet and strange, and they echo in your head until it’s all you can think about. </p>

Thanks to a new teaser from Netflix, we now have roughly 15 seconds more footage than we did before. It’s not a lot, but it’s enough to get fans excited again.</p><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/arcaneshow/status/1798833731442217130&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/arcaneshow/status/1798833731442217130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new footage</a></span> appears in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knuUMiHzfK8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knuUMiHzfK8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">promotional video from Netflix</a></span> highlighting the streaming platform’s upcoming animation projects. The video itself is around three minutes and has a couple of clips from <em>Arcane </em>but the new footage appears at the 2:39 mark. The highlight of the short teaser is our first look at what the protagonist duo of Caitlyn and Vi will look like in the second season. The footage shows the two in a lineup of other characters, all of whom are enforcers (the name given to the city of Piltover’s police department).</p><p>Caitlyn’s new look is only a slight twist on her season one appearance, which makes sense given she was also an enforcer then—how much can a uniform really change? The highlights of her new appearance are a white beret, a red ribbon around her neck, and a pair of black pants. She looks much more in charge than the young enforcer we saw previously, so she may be leading some special task force.</p><p>Vi is sporting a whole new look, also donning an enforcer uniform, complete with her signature gauntlets as well as a more armored shoulder section of the jacket. Vi becoming an enforcer makes sense, given that’s what she is in <em>League of Legends</em>, but in the context of <em>Arcane</em>, it still feels weird to see. Overall, she looks so uncomfortable in the clothes of a cop, and who can blame her given how she grew up in the undercity under their cruel, authoritarian rule, the very thing that led her to distrust Caitlyn at the beginning of season one. Who knows if she’ll be able to stand the new threads for long?</p><p>As for the other three characters we see in the new footage, they both appear to be original characters to <em>Arcane</em>,<em> </em>not taken directly from <em>League of Legends</em>. That might spell trouble for them as it gives the show more room to make their fates less than good. The full lineup does appear to support the idea of a special enforcer task force led by Caitlyn. Given the cliffhanger ending of season one—in which we see Jinx launching a rocket directly at the Piltover council—the gang will surely have a lot of new problems to tackle.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We miss you. We hate money.”</p><p>Folks from around the industry are reacting warmly to the solidarity, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/studioanisa/status/1799021086321111077&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/studioanisa/status/1799021086321111077" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developers who worked at the studios mentioned</a></span>. Some criticism was directed at New Blood for putting its name on the billboard as that could be read as an advertisement for its own games, but I’d argue that anonymous support isn’t what anyone needs right now. The video game industry is at a crisis point and visibly speaking out against corporate greed is a big part of how any of this gets better in the future.</p><p>The billboard uses the glitch aesthetic, which almost gives it the vibe of someone hacking into an ad space to cut through the usual promotional noise that goes on at these things to say something of substance. New Blood CEO and co-founder Dave Oshry <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DaveOshry/status/1798907381356875900&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DaveOshry/status/1798907381356875900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> that he is “always trying to find new and creative ways to waste money,” and said he hopes that those affected by the swath of layoffs in the past two years land on their feet in the aftermath. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/8-ways-final-fantasy-14-is-unlike-other-mmorpgs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/8-ways-final-fantasy-14-is-unlike-other-mmorpgs.892575/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/8-ways-final-fantasy-14-is-unlike-other-mmorpgs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Over the last decade, Final Fantasy 14 has transformed from a failure to one of the most-played multiplayer games in the entire world. A huge part of that success is how FF14 has broken the mold of MMOs, striking out in new ways that have clearly attracted millions of players. Over a decade after the relaunch of A Realm Reborn, FF14 shows no signs of stopping, and if you find yourself tired of the usual MMO fare, it might be the right choice for you. </p><p>With a huge main game and multiple expansions starting FF14<em> </em>might seem like a daunting task, but so much of what the game does differently revolves around attracting new players, or those wholly unfamiliar with the genre. Here are some of the major ways FF14 differs from other MMOs. </p><h2><strong>A Story to Rival the Single-Player Games</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Final Fantasy’s most defining feature has always been its story, and FF14 carries on that tradition with gusto. In fact, it’s fair to say the story is one of the major focuses of the game, which is fairly uncommon in the world of MMOs. </p><p>Set in the land of Eorzea, FF14<em> </em>tells a sweeping tale about the Warrior of Light, a chosen hero with the power to see into other people’s souls using something called “The Echo.” Despite being a multiplayer game, FF14 has a core cast of characters that serve as the party. These characters grow and change in fascinating ways alongside your Warrior of Light, building deep complex relationships with the player. </p><p>While each expansion has a new story, each one is basically the next step in a larger narrative. What makes<em> </em>FF14 so compelling, however, is the deeply human and emotional themes it consistently tackles. Heavensward<em> </em>tackles religious fervor and the cycle of revenge, Stormblood<em> </em>shows rebellion against subjugation, Shadowbringers deconstructs the nature of heroes, and Endwalker asks big questions about the meaning of life itself.</p><p>While these core themes permeate the stories, the grand sweeping tales also do a great job of fleshing out the world with lore and politics, making Eorzea and the rest of the world feel like real places. At the same time, despite being a multiplayer game, FF14 has a core cast of characters that serve as the party. These characters grow and change in fascinating ways alongside your Warrior of Light, building deep complex relationships with the player. Seeing these characters grow and change across each expansion is a delight, especially when coupled with the larger themes present. </p><p>While the main story is riveting on its own, FF14 also has dozens of side stories that tie into that overarching narrative, or help develop side characters even further. Nearly everything in the game has some kind of story or narrative purpose attached, and the tales found within the MMO rival the best you can find in the Final Fantasy series. </p><h2><strong>You Can Play Final Fantasy 14 Solo</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/07/28/finalfantasy14dawntrailerteasertrailer-ign-blogroll-1690572007862.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Despite being a massively multiplayer game, you can play through a surprising amount of FF14 solo. If you want to dive in and experience the story, there is a wealth of systems to let you do that with as little interaction with other players as possible. </p><p>The majority of story-related dungeons can be completed using Trusts, which are NPC characters that act as your party members. Of course, the majority of story quests can be played solo on top of that. This means you have a massive world and riveting story with hundreds of hours of content to experience. Doing dungeons with NPCs means you can also take your time, soak in the story, and even experiment with jobs and train your skills. </p><p>The only times you’ll need to strike out are whenever you do 8-man content, like the boss-fight Trials. But if you don’t know anyone playing FF14<em> </em>you can always use the game’s matchmaking to take these on, and the Roulette system means there are always players looking to help with content. </p><p>Of course, if you find that you want to get more social and engage with more multiplayer content, like Alliance Raids, those options will always be there waiting. </p><h2><strong>You Can Do Everything With One Character</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/16/ffxiv-xbx-obt-promo-dash-9070a617204be30b2073-1705431972894.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One of the major differences between FF14 and other MMOs is that literally everything in the game can be done with a single character: every quest, every job, every dungeon. In FF14 you can learn every battle job and crafting job with just that one character, and swap between wherever and whenever you want. This means you won’t need to craft multiple characters to see every class, or side with different factions. </p><p>On top of that, all of FF14’s content is designed to be as easily accessible as possible. This means if you want to play everything as a DPS job, but avoid Tank and Healer entirely, you can do that. The matchmaking and party systems in FF14<em> </em>are built to make getting through content as easy as possible, and again, that includes if you just want to play the game solo. </p><h2><strong>Jobs/Classes Only Have One Build</strong></h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/06/27/ffxiv-40-mediakit-20170501-010-1498603434810.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Final Fantasy 14 features dozens of different jobs to choose from, and there’s a lot of variety baked into the actual individual roles. However, each job has a specific set of skills that will apply to anyone and everyone who plays it. Unlike other MMOs, there aren’t any alternative builds you can construct, or different ways to play a specific class. So if you’re playing Dragoon there’s one set of skills, you learn those, and that’s it. </p><p>For some players, this might count as a negative, but for anyone who might not be well-versed in MMOs, it means you won’t have to juggle trying to choose different builds or options, but can focus on learning the core ins and outs of each job. It also means you’ll have more opportunities to try out different jobs and find whatever you like best. </p><h2><strong>It Plays Great on a Controller</strong></h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail Official Images</h3></div></output><p>MMORPGs have traditionally been seen as PC-focused experiences, but more and more have started to make their way to consoles over the years. In that regard, FF14 has nearly every other MMO out there beat with its controller support. </p><p>Playing FF14 with a controller is every bit as viable as playing with a mouse and keyboard. Square Enix has put a ton of thought and time into making that a reality, with minimal time and learning required from players. </p><p>By default, you have quick access to 16 different actions when using a controller, by setting actions to the left/right trigger and then D-pad and face buttons. Past that, there are little additions, like the Cross Hotbar, that you can use to add even more actions. Other elements, like cycling through allies for healing, have also been given intuitive button presses that are easy to use. </p><p>You will, of course, need to spend a bit of time learning jobs and getting used to setting up your hotbars on controllers, but the FF14 community has created countless videos and guides to advise new players on setting things up. If you’re hesitant to pick up FF14 on consoles because of having to use a controller, don’t let that be a worry at all. Just keep in mind you still may want a keyboard if you’re planning on chatting in-game a lot. </p><h2><strong>Final Fantasy 14 Respects Your Time</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/10/21/ff14thumb-1697894557689.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>There are hundreds of hours of content to wade through in<em> </em>FF14, and catching up is always going to be an undertaking. That being said, the MMO does a fantastic job of respecting player’s time, making sure that you always feel rewarded or engaged in some way. </p><p>Outside of the main story nothing in<em> </em>FF14 is mandatory, and you can always engage with every piece of side content as much, or as little, as you want. The game liberally makes sure that you don’t have to waste dozens of hours grinding to get to any content unless you’re looking to do the absolute hardest raids available. If you want to follow the main story you’ll gain all the levels you need simply by doing story quests and dungeons, and some of the more “grind-y” side quests are still worth doing because they have unique stories or mechanics attached. On top of this, you can acquire new gear in a multitude of different ways, from new raids to purchasing on the market board. This means anytime a new patch is released you should have an easy time leveling up your jobs to stay relevant. </p><p>Apart from that, the development team has been vocal about how they want players to take breaks, with director Naoki Yoshida previously <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/517ql0/a_player_asks_on_how_to_maintain_motivation_and/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>saying</u></a> it’s “okay” to not play the game every day. </p><p>There’s always new content to play through with a new patch, but<em> </em>FF14<em> </em>isn’t going to soak up your time every day or even every week. You can stop playing, come back months later, and be able to jump right back in. </p><h2><strong>Old Content Stays Relevant</strong></h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/11/19/ffxiv-pub-fanfestival-2018-lasvegas-13-1542667050158.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One of the remarkable things about FF14<em> </em>is that you can go back and play virtually any piece of content released. Any piece of content from when the game relaunched as A Realm Reborn to now, is still accessible, and more often than not changed or enhanced. The only exception to this rule is timed season events or collaborations, like the Fall Guys collaboration or the crossover quests with Final Fantasy 15. More often than not, though, times events tend to come back later down the road. </p><p>Other than that, Square Enix has made a deliberate choice to not block off any old content or make it inaccessible. In fact, the development team has taken liberal steps to update old story quests, raids, and more, so they fall more in line with what you’ll find in current updates for FF14. </p><p>Daily roulette rewards make it easier to find parties for old content, but even if you’re unable to find matchmaking you can take on older content with a tight group of friends, or even solo it after you’ve leveled a bit. </p><h2><strong>The Developers Genuinely Listen to Fan Feedback</strong></h2><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/05/21/yoshida20830131280jpg-dcfa9f.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One of the core reasons FF14 has been so successful over the years is the transparency and dedication the development team has shown. There’s a reason director and producer Naoki Yoshida is lovingly referred to as “Yoshi-P” by the community. There are other MMOs out there that do a great job at addressing feedback, but in many ways FF14 has set the precedent for the last decade.</p><p>Every few months Yoshida holds a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrFWly2wJzL4qSWYxNAVsKqtPIUQCiaJ_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Letter From the Producer</u></a>” livestream that goes in-depth on all the changes or additions coming with each patch. More often than not, during these segments, Yoshida and other members of the team will directly address player feedback. </p><p>There is, of course, always a balance that needs to be struck, as Yoshida and his team simply can’t adapt or change everything players want. But over the years there’s been a meaningful change to player housing, differences between jobs, more solo options, varied content like the cozy building sidequest Island Sanctuary, and more. </p><p>In a 2017 interview with <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/final-fantasy-xiv-final-fantasy-naoki-yoshida-video-games-games-gamers-627047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Newsweek</em></u></a> Yoshida summed up the development team’s philosophy by saying it wants to "make sure that we are growing this game together, and the development team is not the enemy of the players. We all love Final Fantasy 14, and we just want to come together as allies. The communication should be going both ways, not unilaterally."</p><p>FF14 still has problems and things that can be improved upon, but it’s the perfect MMO to pick up if you’re looking for something that has had meaningful change in the past and will likely continue to have even more. </p><p><em>Hayes Madsen is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-avoids-f2p-as-its-live-service-model-takes-shape-opinion<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Concord following Helldivers 2's pricing suggests a non-F2P strategy – which creates difficult challenges, but could lead to a more sustainable business in the end</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sony's decision to devote around a third of the entire runtime of its State of Play event last week to upcoming hero shooter Concord was a fairly clear statement of intent – the company's desire to pivot towards live service games burns unabated, and while the high-quality singleplayer games upon which PlayStation's studios' reputation was built aren't going anywhere for now, they will at least have to share the spotlight with their upstart live service brethren from now on.</p>
<p>Beyond that headline grabbing strategy, though, Sony has also made one further statement of intent with regard to Concord, although this one, for some reason, was made about as quietly as the firm could manage. Concord isn't going to be a free-to-play game; following in the footsteps of Sony's earlier live service success, Helldivers 2, it's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/concord-store-listings-show-sony-maintaining-helldivers-style-lower-price-point-for-live-service-titles">going to launch at a $40 price point</a>.</p>
<p>Two games does not a strategy make, I suppose, but the fact that Sony has chosen to use this pricing for both a co-operative PvE game like Helldivers 2 and now a PvP hero shooter like Concord strongly suggests that this is a model the firm is at least somewhat committed to.</p>
<p>It's certainly not shouting about any such commitment from the rooftops, though. Concord's pricing details were released on its PlayStation Store listings without fanfare or announcement, which actually feels like something of a missed opportunity, since the corollary information that the game's future maps, characters, and story vignettes will all be available for free would probably have gone down very well with the State of Play audience, and might even have shifted the conversation about the game a little more positive.</p>
<p>If this is indeed Sony's emerging 'house style' for live service games, then it's a very interesting one. I'm sure there will be some latitude within the model for games that are more obviously suited to a different monetisation strategy – perhaps Sony will even fully embrace F2P for some titles – but thus far the shape of what Sony is doing with these games involves an up-front payment, albeit a competitively priced one.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sony is making things a bit harder for itself by avoiding free-to-play – but its calculation that this approach will lead to a more sustainable live service business in the medium to long-term may be well founded</p></blockquote>
<p>That runs counter to the prevailing industry logic about live service games, which generally holds that the F2P approach of making the game client itself free to download is required to remove barriers to entry and get the maximum possible number of players into the game, where they can eventually be converted into paying customers. Sony isn't taking that approach, and that's a decision which has far-reaching consequences for the types of live service games it will ultimately launch.</p>
<p>Of course, Sony has one powerful data point on its side in this regard: Helldivers 2, which launched with precisely this model and has become the fastest-selling PlayStation game to date, and the breakout hit of the first half of this year. That's a pretty good counterpoint to anyone raising their eyebrows and pointing at disasters like Warner Bros.' Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, a live service title which launched at full price and which, according to Bloomberg, has performed so badly that its publisher has taken an <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/insiders-blame-suicide-squads-failings-on-changing-vision-and-lack-of-live-service-skills">eye-watering $200 million loss</a> on the game.</p>
<p>Of course, Suicide Squad had deep, deep problems that went far beyond its business model, but the roll-call of premium-priced live service titles that have flopped hard is difficult to ignore; from the likes of Anthem and Marvel's Avengers, via more recent failures like Skull &amp; Bones, to even some attempts at exploring lower price points like Foamstars, the list of failed live service games whose model included an up-front payment is a sobering one.</p>
<p>Not that there haven't been F2P failures, of course; but a model that forces a live service game to convince players to pay for it before they start playing is undoubtedly setting the difficulty on hard for itself. Nonetheless, it's undeniable that Helldivers 2 has managed it thus far.</p>
<p>It's worth setting out clearly what the advantages of F2P for a live service game actually are, because – as many, many companies that have tried to transition premium games to F2P models after the fact have discovered – the basic decision of whether to charge up-front for the game or not has knock-on effects across a huge swathe of the design of the game and its systems.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/concord-gameplay-3.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Concord is following the same model as Helldivers 2 with a $40 price tag. Maps and characters will be added for free</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Removing this financial barrier to entry doesn't just encourage a much wider group of players to try out the game, it also generally improves the experience for paying players by creating a large base of 'free' players who make the game feel much more active and dynamic. Removing the up-front cost barrier helps to avoid speed bumps and plateaus in the growth of the game – points where despite the game having a generally good reception, growth flattens and player numbers fall off because the highly engaged audience is saturated, and the 'next tier down,' casually curious audience is much more sensitive to up-front costs.</p>
<p>The F2P model is also great for encouraging cross-platform play, since players can easily download the client to any of their devices and log into their account to access their paid-for content and upgrades.</p>
<p>All of this is exacerbated greatly by the fact that most of the competition a live service title will face is already F2P – so in essence, you're asking people to pay money for a product your most established competitors offer for 'free.'</p>
<p>This is the factor which ultimately led Blizzard to rework its hero shooter Overwatch, which seems to be the most analogous title on the market to Concord, into an F2P business model – it simply didn't seem like Overwatch could compete with the F2P behemoths in that field while being held back by its own price tag.</p>
<p>Yet the F2P-reworked Overwatch 2 is also a tough lesson in how deeply the difference between a paid-for game and a free client impacts player psychology in their engagement with game systems; the original audience for Overwatch, who paid for the game up-front, reacted incredibly negatively to the more aggressive monetisation strategies of the now-F2P Overwatch 2, forcing Blizzard to roll back several of its more egregious changes to the game.</p>
<blockquote><p>The decision of whether or not to charge up-front for the game has knock-on effects across the design of the game</p></blockquote>
<p>Sony will have to tiptoe carefully around post-launch monetisation of its own live service games for this reason; players who have paid for a game up front have a very different tolerance level for monetisation strategies to those who have downloaded a free client.</p>
<p>So why, given all of this, is Sony not embracing a pure F2P approach with its games? It's tempting to suggest that Sony's focus on the paid-for model is simply down to being a company deeply embedded in traditional game software business models, and wary or nervous of committing itself fully to F2P. That's certainly behaviour we've seen in the past from publishers that just can't bring themselves to 'give away' a game that's taken them tens of millions of dollars to develop, or can't make themselves comfortable with counter-intuitive aspects of the F2P model such as having such a large group of players who don't pay any money at all.</p>
<p>However, I don't think that analysis fits with what we're seeing from Sony. The company may be pretty new to F2P overall, but this is a platform holder that's watching the Hoyoverse cash roll in on PlayStation; it sees and understands how F2P works and what it requires, and has nonetheless made a choice to eschew that approach.</p>
<p>I can see three major reasons why Sony may have decided to avoid F2P and instead push forward with an upfront payment model for its live service games. Firstly, this approach reduces player churn and gives the developers more breathing room in the early stages of the game's operation. Many F2P games are flash in the pan; there is a large group of consumers who try out each new game as it appears but move on rapidly, churning over to the next big release without ever becoming paying customers.</p>
<p>Adding a payment barrier means missing out on those players – who arguably aren't very important to the business anyway – but ensures that the players you do have are quite literally invested in the success of the game, and are encouraged to hang around for long enough to get their money's worth, at least. This is a trade-off; you slow your player acquisition, but those players you do acquire are more likely to stick with the game and give it a fair shot, rather than bouncing at the first sign of friction.</p>
<p>Sony seems to feel that while full-price is too high a barrier, the $40 price point is a sweet spot for this trade-off. Long-term, though, it will still run into issues with trying to engage more casually interested audiences – there's some evidence to suggest that Helldivers 2 has hit a speed bump of this sort in recent weeks, for example.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/suicide-squad-headline-3-postacie.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Suicide Squad, Anthem, Marvel's Avengers - there are plenty of examples of full-priced live service games that failed</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Secondly, creating a cost barrier to entry can also have very positive effects for the community which forms around the game, because it inherently means that efforts to reduce abusive behaviour in the game actually have teeth. Getting banned or suspended from an F2P game generally just means creating a new free email address so you can sign up again; getting banned from a paid-for game can mean having to buy a whole new copy of the game.</p>
<p>This is notably a bigger concern for Sony than for most live service game operators because Sony is also a platform holder; it's conscious of being seen as responsible for player behaviour on its platform and of the importance of protecting the PlayStation image and brand. I don't think this aspect would be enough to prevent Sony from embracing F2P if it really thought that was the best way forward for its games (and notably, it also has enforcement avenues via the PS Plus subscription service), but it's undoubtedly aware of it as a side benefit of its approach.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most notably, there's the PS Plus aspect to this. Sony has an option in its arsenal that is very unusual among live service game operators; it doesn't ever have to overhaul the business model of its live service games to make them F2P (like Overwatch did), because it already has a hugely popular mechanism for making games free for a certain period of time to people who pay a monthly subscription to PlayStation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sony has been watching the Hoyoverse cash roll in on PlayStation; it sees and understands how F2P works and what it requires, and has nonetheless made a choice to eschew that approach</p></blockquote>
<p>This could allow it to overcome plateaus in its games' growth curves, giving an injection of new players at some point down the road from launch, without the stigma of being seen to make the game F2P – a move generally associated with failure in players' minds. Of course, this only works on the PS5 platform, not on PC, so some other strategy may be needed for PC launches, but at least on the console side of things, PS Plus' game catalogue is a powerful weapon for the live service strategy to have in reserve.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Sony is undoubtedly making things a bit harder for itself by avoiding going F2P up front with these titles – but the company's calculation that this approach will lead to a more sustainable live service business in the medium- to long-term may be well founded.</p>
<p>The broader questions of how deep consumers' tolerance for an endless flood of live service games is, and how many of these games can be supported concurrently by the existing market, remain extremely challenging to answer – but in the choice of business model, at least, there may indeed be method to Sony's madness.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/mark-cerny-at-60-i-the-gi-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Mark Cerny has just added something to his growing list of achievements.</p>
<p>I'm not talking about the global success of last year's Spider-Man 2, on which Cerny worked as executive producer. But something, in many ways, just as impressive.</p>
<p>"I just finished playing Animal Well, and before that and I was very heavily into Neon White, which is my first speedrun," he says.</p>
<p>"I actually platinumed that. That was a real challenge. I wasn't sure if I could do it, because reflexes as I head towards 60 are very different from the reflexes I had when I was a teenager and playing in the arcades. But I am glad I went after it. The precision and stamina that you need to get through a game like that is different in the way it feels, compared with these character action games like Spider-Man that I've been working on."</p>
<p>Cerny is explaining to us that despite his current role as the architect behind PlayStation hardware, what he finds interesting about a game isn't necessarily what it's doing technically, but rather what's <em>new</em> about it. In fact, for all the different roles that Cerny has had in his 42-year games industry career, the one he's never stopped doing is that of 'gamer'.</p>
<p>"I continue to be a massive player," he tells us. "I got into this 40-something years ago because I was an arcade addict.</p>
<p>"Back in the day, I was one of the best players in the country at Defender. That's actually how I got my job at Atari. There was a reporter who was writing a book on arcade games strategies. We're talking about an era so distant that there weren't even games magazines. So if you wanted to learn arcade game strategy, you would go to the supermarket and at the checkout there would be a book that you could buy that would tell you how to play whatever game. And he interviewed me for Defender because I was a well-known local player. I bumped into him later, I told him I wanted to get into the business, and he very kindly called Atari Coin-Op and got me an interview, and the rest is history."</p>
<p>Cerny's career has taken him from designing and programming games like Marble Madness and Major Havoc in the 1980s, to producing and developing iconic platform games such as Sonic The Hedgehog 2, Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon in the 1990s, to today, where's he's led the creation of the PlayStation 4 and 5 hardware. There are not a whole lot of game leaders who have been able to stay on top for over four decades, and Cerny believes that variety has been key to this longevity.</p>
<p>"The industry has certainly changed a lot in the last 40-something years, and one thing I've noticed is that the people who are very actively participating after that amount of time tend to have done a lot of things," he says. "[Game developer] Amy Hennig and I talk about this a lot. In her case, she's been a writer, an animator, an artist, a director, and I'm sure a few other things. For me, because I'm much more technical, it’s been programmer, designer, producer, executive producer – which is a bit different – I've run a small publisher, I've been a game director, and then of course there's the hardware work today."</p>
<p>He adds: "One way I look at it, if you want to have an interesting career in games, don't do one thing. You really don't want to be the physics programmer, because then you end up being, after a couple of years, perhaps just the programmer who integrates the physics middleware package. This is nothing against physics programmers, some of whom are incredible. But if you have a very specific niche, my feeling is that, after a few decades, you're probably not doing as interesting a set of things as you would if you had kept evolving your role."</p>
<blockquote><p>"It's not bittersweet at all to say that instead of creating games, I've chosen to support the creation of the games"</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, when Cerny was starting out, games developers didn't really have roles.</p>
<p>"When I joined Atari in 1982 there was one job, and it was a hybrid of programmer, designer and artist," he explains. "You even had to make your own artwork. There were about 15 of us programmer/designer/artists, and so Atari Coin-Op was making 15 games. That was how it was. We didn't see any real specialisation until the 1990s."</p>
<p>Cerny still does multiple things, but to the current generation of gamers, he's probably best known as the lead architect behind PlayStation 4 and 5.</p>
<p>We're roughly at the mid-way point in the PS5's lifecycle, and so we wanted to ask if there's anything developers have been doing with the hardware that has surprised him.</p>
<p>"I have been very surprised by the degree to which developers are using ray-tracing," he begins. "Putting that in, that was a big decision and actually a rather late one. I thought that this is not going to get much use initially, but if we look at generations, and a generation is seven years or so, software is created for ten years, and so later in the lifecycle we will start seeing people using that technology. But instead we had launch titles that were taking advantage of it. I guess, having worked on games for consoles that were a bit difficult to get into, like the PlayStation 3, I can be a little skittish about very deep technology like that. But in this case, my guess as to how things would go was totally wrong. And I am so happy to have seen the early adoption of the technology.</p>
<p>"The other thing that has been surprising is the push to 60 frames per second. Based on previous console lifecycles, I would have expected there to be a lot more games that are 30 frames per second only, just because the artwork can be so much more detailed if you have longer time to render it. Instead, the almost universal rule this time around has been the games run at 60.</p>
<p>"It's great from a play perspective. Gamers overwhelmingly prefer games that are higher frame rates. I just didn't expect such a departure from previous generations."</p>

<p>Cerny says building a console takes about four years, and nowadays that's less time than it takes to make some of the big AAA titles. There is a lot of focus right now on the time it takes to build these games, and Cerny says that, ultimately, it's the developers that have chosen this path.</p>
<p>"With the consoles, one thing I've been trying to do is reduce the amount of time it takes [developers] to get going with their games. I call this 'time to triangle'. All that means is that if I just want to get a triangle up on the screen, how long does it take to build the engine technology that will allow me to do that? That might not sound very difficult. The first PlayStation you could maybe do that in a month, but the consoles got so complex that by PlayStation 3 that was taking probably six months to a year. So I've been working to bring that down. PlayStation 4 and 5 are much quicker. It takes a month or two before you have those fundamental graphics technologies up and running on [those systems].</p>
<p>"I probably shouldn't, but I spend a lot of time on the boards. And I see people asking… if the time to triangle has been greatly reduced, why is it then taking so many years to create a game? And the answer is that is what the teams are choosing to do. They are going after these massive creations that really do need four or six years to put together."</p>
<blockquote><p>"If you want to have an interesting career in games, don't do one thing... After a few decades, you're probably not doing as interesting a set of things as you would if you had kept evolving your role"</p></blockquote>
<p>Another shift in the development landscape is around multiplatform games. Developers are increasingly building their projects for as many platforms as possible. Even PlayStation has been bringing its games to PC (albeit a few years after the console version). The issue is that consoles often have bespoke technologies in them, and if developers use these technologies, it might hinder their ability to port the game elsewhere. Cerny admits his team is aware of this challenge, but actually it's an opportunity for them to lead.</p>
<p>“One of the exciting aspects of console hardware design is that we have freedom with regards to what we put in the console," Cerny begins. "Or to put that differently, we’re not trying to build a low-cost PC, and we aren’t bound by any particular standards. So if we have a brainstorm that audio can become much more immersive and dimensional if there’s a dedicated unit that’s capable of complex math, then we can do that. Or if the future feels like high-speed SSDs rather than HDDs, we can put an end-to-end system in the console – everything from the flash dies to the software interfaces that the game creators use – and get 100% adoption.</p>
<p>"I like to think that occasionally we’re even showing the way for the larger industry, and that our efforts end up benefiting those gaming on PC as well. It’s a tech-heavy example, but on PS4 we had very efficient GPU interfaces, and that may well have spurred DirectX to become more efficient in response. Or to look at something more consumer-focused, I believe that releasing PS5 in 2020 with a very high-performance integrated SSD put pressure on the PC world to get their corresponding DirectStorage API into the hands of their gamers.</p>
<p>"There’s a recent development here, which is console exclusives that were created to run on bespoke PlayStation systems are now making their way to PC. That conversion has been simpler than many thought. The main consequence is that the minimum spec for the PC version of the game gets a bit higher, perhaps more CPUs or more RAM, in order to replace the missing systems.”</p>

<p>Not only can gamers now play PlayStation games on PC, but they can also use PlayStation hardware, including the DualSense and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/psvr-2-pc-adapter-to-launch-on-august-7">PlayStation VR 2</a>. Meanwhile, on the other end, we're increasingly seeing <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/iphone-15-pro-will-run-native-versions-of-aaa-titles">AAA developers getting a version of their games running on mobile</a>. The lines between platforms seem to be blurring, but Cerny feels consoles continue to play a crucial role in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>He points to an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfpXMuMvcWQ">amusing video by Linus Tech Tips</a>, which attempted to 'kill' the PlayStation 5 by building a $500 gaming PC that outperformed the console.</p>
<p>"They had to get a used motherboard," he says. "That was the only way that they could build a PlayStation 5 equivalent for a PlayStation 5 price. And if you're using used parts… well you can get a used PlayStation 5 for eBay for $300-something.</p>
<p>"I think as long as we continue to create that very nice package, the future of consoles is pretty bright."</p>
<p>Cerny turns 60 this year, and it's at moments like this when one might look back on where they've been. He says he tries not to get nostalgic, but if there are days he looks back on with fondness, "it's probably back to the days when a single designer could lay out a third of a game, half of a game or even an entire game."</p>
<blockquote><p>"As long as we continue to create that very nice package, the future of consoles is pretty bright"</p></blockquote>
<p>He explains: "I am not talking about what we would call today an indie game, but what we would have called a AAA game back in those days. Something like Crash Bandicoot 2, where if you are running down the path and there's an apple that you picked up, odds are I was the one that put it there."</p>
<p>Since the days of Atari, Cerny has been – step-by-step – moving away from pure game creation to more of a support role. And although that might be a shame, it does afford him the ability to work with a variety of developers on all sorts of projects.</p>
<p>"I see incredible games getting made," he says. "It's not bittersweet at all to say that instead of creating games, I've chosen to support the creation of the games. Because there is really good work being done."</p>
<p>With a big birthday on the horizon, the question of retirement inevitably comes up.</p>
<p>"It is something that's a bit on my mind," he admits, "but I do believe I have a bit of time left in this industry."</p>
<p>I suspect a few people reading this would have hoped to have heard a definitive: 'Retire? Never!'.</p>
<p>"Well, Clint Eastwood is a pretty good role model," he concludes.</p>
<p>"At least the part where he's still directing movies at age 90-something, not the part where he started a movie with a chimpanzee."</p>
