		<p>Bethesda will reveal the long-rumoured The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake tomorrow, the renovated classic expected to launch for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and available with ‘day one’ tiers of Xbox Game Pass as well. It’s anticipated that this will be a ‘shadow drop’ launch, with the reveal coming alongside the game’s release.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake will be revealed on Tuesday 22nd April at 8am PT / 11am ET / 4pm BST, and you can watch it here on YouTube:</p>
<p><iframe title="All will be revealed...." width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ed_E2crglcw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion has been reported and rumoured to be in the works for close to half a decade, first appearing in unredacted court filings, with further reports in the last few years, and then the slam dunk leak last week coming from the website of developer Virtuos.</p>
<p>A batch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/15/the-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-screenshots-leak-from-developer-website/">Oblivion remake images</a> were found in the backend of the Virtuos website, as enterprising Reddit users started to poke around. They include screenshots of the game, comparison shots between this version of the game and the 2006 original, and more. Having been hosted on the Virtuos servers in a publicly accessible fashion, they were hastily copied across to other hosts before Virtuos could pull their site offline.</p>

<p>Getting our first look at the game, what was immediately clear was the huge jump up in graphical detail on show in the 2025 version of Oblivion, with less of the hazy bloom effect from the early Xbox 360 days, in favour of a late afternoon glow and tons more grass.</p>
<p>Originally founded in Shanghai and now headquartered in Singapore, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuos">Virtuos</a> is a huge company with thousands of employees and teams dotted around the world. The company has often provided co-development support on major projects, such as art for the Horizon series and co-dev for the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, as well as a variety of ports and remaster projects big and small. Oblivion could be their most notable work yet, and with the game so close to being in our hands, it will be fascinating to see how it has come together and how closely it sticks to or diverges from the original.</p>
<p>Not long to go…</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remaster-finally-officially-revealed-probably-launching-tomorrow.1169502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remaster-officially-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bethesda has finally officially revealed the long-mooted&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster, and more information about the game is coming tomorrow, although it's not clear whether the much-discussed shadowdrop will be happening.</p>

<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1914341006188712023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Bethesda X account, the studio simply says "tomorrow, 11am EST", pointing to links to the official Bethesda and Twitch channels. The post is accompanied by an image that includes an "IV" logo and the outline of an armored face.</p>

<p>It's pretty clear the post refers to the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster;&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>is, after all, the fourth&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls&nbsp;</em>game, and the "IV" in the image looks the same as the one included as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-oblivion-remake-images-seemingly-leaked" rel="nofollow">a set of leaked images</a> depicting scenes and artwork from the remaster last week.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remaster-officially-revealed-original.jpg?itok=YSKkSodM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remaster-officially-revealed-original.jpg?itok=O7mf0oLa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>is officially getting a remaster.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've somehow missed out on all of this, Bethesda's upcoming <i>Oblivion&nbsp;</i>remaster-slash-remake is probably one of the gaming industry's worst-kept secrets right now.</p>

<p>Rumors of the remaster have been swirling for some time, and the existence of the project was essentially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remake-reportedly-confirmed" rel="nofollow">confirmed back in January</a>, when reports pointed to a mistakenly-uploaded website that included information about the game, as well as screenshots.</p>

<p>Following that, new images appeared on the website of developer Virtuos, which is widely believed to be the studio handling the project. Those images included pretty conclusive proof that the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster is happening, including the aforementioned artwork that matches Bethesda's latest announcement.</p>

<p>Further leaks appeared earlier today when the file size of the remaster was supposedly <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/04/21/oblivion-remastered-file-size-on-steam-datamined/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">datamined</a>, with reports suggesting the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster will come in at a hefty 120GB. Better clear up some space on that SSD.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remaster-officially-revealed-combat.jpg?itok=3WrDcjB8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remaster-officially-revealed-combat.jpg?itok=DTKbLakt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>120GB will get you a remaster that doesn't look like this.</figcaption></figure><p>Several leakers have suggested that the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster will be shadowdropping (i.e. launching essentially without warning) tomorrow, but the trailer to which Bethesda points is simply titled "All will be revealed...", so we might just be in for an announcement tomorrow.</p>

<p>Either way, it looks like Bethesda's&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster is definitely happening. Stay tuned for more.</p>

This means that an item’s specific price will vary to reflect a user’s local region so that it’s equivalent around the world.</p><p>Right now, in-experience prices are the same globally (the platform is currently available in 180 countries). But if a developer turns on regional pricing for an in-game item like a <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/monetization/game-passes">pass</a> (typically things with a one-time fee like access to a special area in a game or a permanent power-up), Roblox will automatically adjust the price in Robux, Roblox’s in-game currency, as needed.</p><p>Regional pricing will also become an option for avatar items “later this year,” according to <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/04/roblox-launches-regional-pricing-%20for-in-experience-items">a Roblox blog post</a>.</p><p>In an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Enrico D’Angelo, Roblox’s VP of economy, says that the main reason the company waited this long to implement regional pricing was because there was a “real risk” about arbitrage.</p><p>“The moment you have the same item being sold for different prices, and, in some cases, dramatically different prices, you can imagine how crafty some people can get,” he says. Roblox wanted to be “very confident” in the systems that it put in place “to avoid these misuses of the system.” D’Angelo says that in Roblox’s early testing of regional pricing, it’s seen “zero cases” of abuse.</p><p>Paired with Roblox’s <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/opening-up-price-optimization-to-more-experiences/3471832">price optimization tool for developers</a>, which runs tests to recommend the best price for an item in a game, D’Angelo says that the company will be able to help suggest optimized prices for in-game goods <em>and</em> regionally appropriate prices for those goods. In its blog post, Roblox says the company has seen “a median earnings increase of 4 percent for eligible creators who have run a pricing test.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Amid a flurry of leaks and rumors, Bethesda has now announced that it will make some kind of announcement on April 22 pertaining to "IV." Combined with an image of a character with a shielded face, many are taking this to be a reference to the heavily rumored The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster. This seems like a pretty safe bet, especially considering images and details about an apparent Oblivion remaster <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-info-and-screens-leak-apparently-releasing-next-week/1100-6530870/" data-ref-id="1100-6530870">recently leaked on developer Virtuos' website.</a></p><p>Whatever it is, we'll find out on April 22 at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET.</p><p>A remake of Oblivion has been rumored for years, dating back to when it was first mentioned in the court documents that came out of the FTC vs. Microsoft case. It was initially rumored that an Oblivion remaster could have a shadowdrop on April 21, but that's apparently not going to happen.</p><p>In addition to launching on PC, Oblivion was an Xbox exclusive on console when it debuted in 2006, before coming to PS3 in 2007. The open-world RPG is fondly remembered for its story and gameplay--and infamously for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-horse-armor-now-available/1100-6147013/" data-ref-id="1100-6147013">horse armor</a>, which was a prominent early example of DLC. Bethesda boss Todd Howard later reflected on the horse armor, saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-on-elder-scrolls-horse-armor-people-wi/1100-6467386/" data-ref-id="1100-6467386">"people will buy anything."</a></p><p>Bethesda followed up Oblivion with the enormously popular The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim in 2011. Bethesda is now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>, but there is no word yet on when it might be released.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-will-be-officially-showcased-tomorrow-bethesda-announces.1169460/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-will-be-officially-showcased-tomorrow-bethesda-announces/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Finally, after weeks of <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-april-release/">leaks</a> and even official <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/">screenshots appearing online</a>, Bethesda has not only officially acknowledged The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remake but also announced that we'll get a full reveal and showcase of the game tomorrow, <strong>April 22, 2025</strong>, at <strong>8 am PT / 11 am ET / 4 pm BT.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>A short <a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1914341006188712023">post</a> from the studio's official X account tells us when we'll learn more about the long-awaited remake and where to check it out, with the 'where' being either the Bethesda <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Ed_E2crglcw">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda">Twitch</a> channels.</p>
<p>The title of the video on Bethesda's YouTube channel says "<em>All will be revealed...,</em>" hopefully implying that we'll not only learn about what has gone into the remake, the new features available, and the release date.</p>
<p><iframe title="All will be revealed...." width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ed_E2crglcw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The release date could very well be tomorrow, shortly after the reveal. Rumors about the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remake already had their sights set on today, or at least <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-could-be-mere-days-from-launch-according-to-leaker/">sometime</a> in the back half of April, for the game's release.</p>
<p>In hindsight, we know that those rumors claiming an April 21 release had their wires crossed with today's announcement that the reveal would be tomorrow. But now we can expect to play Oblivion on at least Xbox consoles and PCs before the week is out. It's still up in the air whether it'll be available on PS5 right away or if Xbox players will enjoy a short period of exclusivity for the remake before it comes to PS5.</p>

The artwork matches up with some leaked <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> art from last week. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Ed_E2crglcw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Ed_E2crglcw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">If you click on the YouTube link</a></span> you’ll find a stream named “All will be revealed...” So yeah, I think its safe to say Bethesda is about to announce a big new <em>Oblivion </em>remaster. </p><p>Tomorrow’s <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion </em>remastered stream will start at 11 a.m. EST on both Bethesda’s Twitch and YouTube channels. As of this writing, about 24 hours before the stream is set to go live, nearly 7,000 people are waiting for it.</p><p>I expect Tuesday’s <em>Oblivion </em>livestream to not only announce the game’s existence officially, but to also show off gameplay and go over some of the big and small tweaks and changes that have been made to the 2006 open-world RPG. Past leaks and reports indicated that the remake was being built in Unreal Engine and would feature improved combat, stealth, and more. </p><p>There’s also a chance that tomorrow is when Bethesda releases the remastered version of its popular RPG. Multiple leakers, insiders, and reports have suggested that the plan for <em>Oblivion Remastered </em>is to shadow-drop it without a lengthy marketing cycle. We’ll find out tomorrow if that’s still the plan. </p><p>It’s been a long, leaky road to this official livestream. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xfire.com/remake-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-in-development-virtuos-games/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xfire.com/remake-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-in-development-virtuos-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2023, a Reddit user</a></span> posted about an <em>Oblivion </em>remake.

                <p>EA Sports has announced a partnership with the legendary band Metallica. The "For Whom The Band Tolls Competition," as it's called, will see EA Sports and Metallica come together to give one collegiate marching band the chance to record the CFB theme song and a Metallica song for a future CFB title.</p><p>The existence of this competition is pretty much all we know so far. The announcement stated that the winning marching band will get to record a Metallica song for a future version of CFB, and given that this is only just being announced in late April, it would seem the song wouldn't be ready until the inevitable CFB 27 in 2026.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSCollege/status/1914333351755792505" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">CFB + Metallica = The Ultimate Marching Band Competition!<br> <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSCollege?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EASPORTSCollege</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Metallica?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Metallica</a> are joining forces to give one college marching band an opportunity to take the field and get in the game: The Division 1 winner of the For Whom the Band Tolls! competition will not only… <a href="https://t.co/WPzVwawFmb" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/WPzVwawFmb</a></p>  — EASPORTSCollege (@EASPORTSCollege) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSCollege/status/1914333351755792505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>For CFB 25, EA's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-sights-and-sounds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Torsten Staley recorded every team's fight song</a> in Nashville with a group of musicians made up of students and alumni from schools like Oklahoma, North Texas, Vanderbilt, USC, Auburn, and Tennessee.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/renting-a-ps5-is-increasingly-popular-in-japan-with-retailers-selling-out/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While people are still buying plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/">PS5 consoles</a>, renting a PS5 is becoming an increasingly popular option for players in Japan. A new report from <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2504/20/news070_4.html">IT Media News</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/renting-ps5s-proving-extremely-popular-in-japan-with-most-stores-selling-out/">VGC</a>) shows that retail stores in Japan where you can rent a PS5 are selling out of consoles to rent.</p>
<p>You can rent a PS5 in multiple regions worldwide, with the cost of renting a PS5 for either 8 days or 15 days at a time in Japan coming in at ¥980 ($6.62 USD) or ¥1,780 ($12.02 USD), respectively. The service only became available in Japan at the top of the year as a response to the console not being as readily available in the region.</p>
<p>A Japanese retailer, GEO, told IT Media news that the service is "<em>more popular than they expected</em>" and that the majority of its 400 stores are "<em>at capacity</em>" with the consoles available to rent. GEO cites the release of Monster Hunter Wilds as a likely reason why the service has, of late, become extremely popular.</p>
<p>Considering the cost, it's a very low barrier to entry if all you want to do is try a console and a new game before making a bigger investment to buy the whole console and a brand-new game. Other retailers around the world, like Raylo in the UK, allow players to rent a PS5 for much longer periods of time. With the popularity of the service in Japan, it wouldn't be surprising if longer rental periods start to be introduced.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that buying a PS5 to own has only gone up in price since it launched in 2020, rather than down, as the case has been in every previous console generation. If you are someone who wants a PS5 but has been unable to buy one for the last five years, it's no surprise that you would jump at the chance to take one home for a couple of weeks for about $12 instead of buying it for hundreds.</p>
<p>At least then you'd be able to satisfy your curiosity to some degree. It'll also be interesting to see if Sony responds by focusing on making more consoles available in Japan.</p>

Thank you for your service, Pedro Pascal, but Kaitlyn Dever did what Abby does best and killed him with a golf club. Anyone who played <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> knew he’d reach this end, but for those whose only experience is the HBO show, this moment came as quite a shock. There’s a bit to unpack in the delivery of the scene, as fans are divided on the way the show adapts Joel’s final moments, but any fan who liked the old man is grieving him again or for the first time.</p><p>Joel’s death isn’t just sad, it’s meant to enrage the audience as much as it angers Ellie. It seems to have had the intended effect, because Abby is now (once again) public enemy number one in the eyes of fans. What remains to be seen is if show fans can be normal about it in ways <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035">those who played the game weren’t</a></span>. Despite the disdain for the daddy killer, so far everyone is praising Dever’s performance as Abby in this decisive moment.</p><p>Sadness for Joel and anger at Abby are the intended effects of this scene, but now that we’re two episodes into season two, game fans can’t help but compare the show’s approach to the source material. As I said <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661">in my review</a></span>, <em>The Last of Us</em>’ second season<em> </em>loves to overtly explain pretty much every mystery and motivation without an ounce of restraint, and Abby’s villain monologue before she kills Joel is one of the most egregious examples of it. Compared to the quiet, vicious brutality of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s scene, the rambling, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-joel-abby-handsome-hbo-max-season-2-ep-1-1851776479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-joel-abby-handsome-hbo-max-season-2-ep-1-1851776479">banter-filled</a></span> recreation doesn’t hit the same.</p><p>There are still five episodes left in season two, but we know that HBO is stretching the game’s story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708">across multiple seasons</a></span>. So it’s unlikely that new viewers will get the catharsis they’re looking for by the time season two is over. But for now, welcome to the painful reality in which Joel Miller is dead, TV fans. We’ve been waiting for you for two years.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-mobile-revealed-china<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has finally revealed&nbsp;<em>Valorant Mobile</em>, which is, as you'd probably expect, a mobile version of the popular FPS&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>, and you can pre-register for it right now...but only if you're in China.</p>

<p>After a series of teaser trailers, Riot finally unveiled&nbsp;<em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>with an official debut trailer, a gameplay snippet, and an <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1914144559594172591" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, in which the studio also reveals the game is a co-development effort with Tencent's LightSpeed Studios (also the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideaki-itsuno-lightspeed-studios" rel="nofollow">home of&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em>'s Hideaki Itsuno</a>).</p>

<p>Riot and Lightspeed say that although the goal is to bring&nbsp;<em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>"to as many players as possible", the two are "starting in China and taking it from there", with further updates coming "as [their] plans develop further".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valorant-mobile-revealed-china-gameplay.jpg?itok=X3zuMeOZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valorant-mobile-revealed-china-gameplay.jpg?itok=GZZeB2Ma 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>has been officially revealed, but only for China (so far).</figcaption></figure><p>A mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>was actually revealed all the way back <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valorant-mobile" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in 2021</a>, but save for a few teaser trailers showing off some of the Agents coming to the mobile version of the game, things have been pretty quiet on the news front since then.</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>does hit mobile, you can expect it to feature a number of the same weapons, maps, and Agents as the main game, including the likes of Sage, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-killjoy-reveal-brings-bots-to-riots-shooter" rel="nofollow">Killjoy</a>, and Cypher, among others. Of course, it's likely new Agents and other stuff will be added to the game once it's out.</p>

<p>Sadly, there's no release date or window for&nbsp;<em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>yet, but if you want, you can pre-register for the game <a href="https://valm.qq.com/main.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via its official website</a>. Be aware that it's in Chinese, since the game is only intended for Chinese players at the moment.</p>




<p><em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of games getting mobile spinoffs, and many of them are similarly focused on the Chinese market. Others include the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-mobile-spinoff-destiny-rising" rel="nofollow"><em>Destiny</em></a>, to name but a few.</p>

<p><em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>is in development right now and will hit mobile devices in China when it's released. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">worldwide</a>.</p>

The program started just a few months ago and has apparently paid off. People normally rent CDs, DVDs, and Blu-rays from Geo’s 1,000 stores across the country, but the company decided to add PS5s to the menu as the price of the console jumped from 66,980 yen to 79,980 yen due to inflation and weak exchange rates. </p><p> “Rentals are originally meant to allow people to enjoy expensive items at a low price at home,” Geo product manager Yusuke Sakai told <em>IT Media</em>. “PS5 rentals are an extension of that philosophy.” The service sounds cheap indeed. Geo is charging 980 yen to rent a PS5 a week, or about a dollar a day. Plenty of time to beat <em>Astro Bot</em> or even <em>Elden Ring</em> if you’re off from work or school. </p><p>Some companies in the U.S. still provide console rentals as well, though it’s less clear how popular those are. Rent-A-Center will loan out a PS5 for $26 a week, much more than the Geo deal but still not terrible. But other recent trends in gaming have definitely made that proposition less attractive. Party games like <em>Guitar Hero </em>that might get you to rent a console for a weekend get-together or vacation are now nonexistent and many of the most popular releases can be played on a smartphone or older hardware. </p><p>A kid without a PS5 is way more likely to ask for <em>Fortnite </em>skins or<em> </em>Robux<em> </em>than a week-long glimpse of next-gen gaming. Of course, if we ever do get to that long-predicted console-less future, retro hardware rentals will hopefully make a comeback. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> cracked the top 10 list of the most-played games in the US during its launch week, according to Circana's executive director and video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella.</p>
<p>Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lnd7qpxrns27">reported</a> the list of the top 15 games in terms of player engagement for the week of April 12, 2025, which is the week that South of Midnight officially launched. The top 10, even top 15 games regarding player engagement, are usually a very predictable list.</p>
<p>Just think of the most popular live service titles; you'll see most of them on the list. So, for a brand-new single-player game, not based on any existing series, to crack the top 10 is a strong showing.</p>
<p>It didn't crack the top sales list, but with South of Midnight launching into Xbox Game Pass, player engagement was always going to be the more important metric to look at. For Compulsion Games, it's great that so many players were willing to take a chance on South of Midnight and check it out.</p>
<p>The rest of the list includes Marvel Rivals, Call of Duty, Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, Grand Theft Auto V, EA Sports College Football 25, NBA 2K25 and Rainbow Six Siege. All of them are major live service titles you'll commonly see on lists tracking player engagement.</p>
<p>Of the top 15, the only other single-player game included is Assassin's Creed: Shadows, which came in at number 11, while South of Midnight eked into the top 10 at number 9.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Xbox responds now, because Hi-Fi Rush also launched with strong engagement and positive responses from players and critics. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/">Tango Gameworks</a> was still shuttered by Xbox before being brought back to life by <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-lives-again-thanks-to-krafton/">Krafton</a>. Hopefully, Compulsion will continue to get strong support from Xbox instead of suffering the same fate as Tango.</p>

That was just one example of the nightmares <em>Psychonauts—</em>Double Fine’s magnum opus—went through on its path to becoming one of the most beloved games of all time. It’s now 20 years since its official U.S. release, and that deserves celebration.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195891" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="156" data-playlist="195891,196307,196470" data-current="195891"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21406.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>You can immediately see why <em>Psychonauts</em> might have struggled to convince a publisher. This was Double Fine, a company that was only famous for being the place where Tim Schafer—the guy who wrote the adventure game classics <em>Full Throttle</em> and <em>Grim Fandango—</em>worked after leaving LucasArts. Obviously everyone was expecting DF to be an adventure game studio, and somehow their first project was...a third-person platformer? But one where you had to solve puzzles, and it was story-led, and it was also a collectathon, but there were psychic abilities, and missions about dealing with complex trauma, and half the game wasn’t platforming but chatting with other characters...Microsoft, originally intended to be the publisher for an Xbox exclusive, never got it. </p><p>Microsoft’s feedback after focus group testing described the game’s storyline as “unoriginal, childish and overly complicated,” which are quite the most extraordinary descriptions of a game that was defiantly unique and surprisingly mature. The document went on to say, “Humor should be simplified and made immediately apparent.” And then it suggested the game set in a summer camp where hero Raz helps the staff and inhabitants of the summer camp, in a summer-camp-themed story, not be set in a summer camp.</p><p>Later entirely dropped by Microsoft, it was eventually picked up by publisher Majesco, with some stealth funding from <em>SimCity</em> legend Will Wright, and did manage to be completed. (It’s worth adding here that there’s a lot of romanticizing of this period and its triumphant tale of the plucky indie developer making good, but the reality is a swathe of people were fired, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/classic-postmortem-double-fine-s-i-psychonauts-i-&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/classic-postmortem-double-fine-s-i-psychonauts-i-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the remaining employees were crunched for months</a></span>.)</p><p>International publishing was another matter, and entirely lost in these various post-mortems is how THQ screwed things up even further. At the time in the UK, a full-blown advertising campaign was launched, review code sent out to magazines and websites, and then the game pulled at the eleventh hour. As I mentioned at the start, back in 2005 <em>PC Gamer</em> had run a large, very positive review, and had it not been the same issue that reviewed <em>GTA San Andreas</em>, it could have been on the cover. And then...it didn’t come out.</p><p>In fact, it wouldn’t come out for over half a year, then with no advertising or promotion at all, and stores I visited spoke of not being able to get stock. It just couldn’t catch a break. Majesco went on to take a loss in its year of release, and the game didn’t manage to sell 100,000 copies by the end of 2005. It was a flop.</p><figure id="" data-id="02c6ac35a5fb06f81b9763d825444483" data-recommend-id="image://02c6ac35a5fb06f81b9763d825444483" data-format="jpg" data-width="1274" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Raz on the game board in the Napoleon level." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Raz on the game board in the Napoleon level." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Double Fine / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="02c6ac35a5fb06f81b9763d825444483" data-recommend-id="image://02c6ac35a5fb06f81b9763d825444483" data-format="jpg" data-width="1274" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Raz on the game board in the Napoleon level." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Except, it wasn’t. Not after a bit. In 2015, Double Fine pulled out all the stops to celebrate the ten-year anniversary of <em>Psychonauts</em>, releasing yet another documentary, this time just about its development (you can see the first episode above), at which time Schafer revealed that the game had sold 1.7 million copies. More extraordinarily, 1.2 million of those copies were sold after Double Fine had managed to secure back the rights to the game in 2011. It was a game that would see a new burst of sales with each milestone in PC gaming, from the opening up of Steam to external publishers to the phenomenon of Humble Bundles.</p><p>And, importantly, it’s a game that absolutely merits all this attention and love. <em>Psychonauts</em> absolutely captured the wit and personality that had made LucasArts adventure games so great, and applied them to a very different setting. I stood by (and stand by) holding back from giving <em>Psychonauts</em> a 90+ percent score (even when the review was re-printed eight months later when it finally came out in the UK, by which time I received a lot of flak), because its platforming fell short of tipping over into that esteemed territory, but it’s a game that I wish everyone would play.</p><figure id="" data-id="739d28d153ae4d3b3247230151959e66" data-recommend-id="image://739d28d153ae4d3b3247230151959e66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1272" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ford Cruller looks at Raz, his finger on his cheek." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ford Cruller looks at Raz, his finger on his cheek." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Double Fine / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="739d28d153ae4d3b3247230151959e66" data-recommend-id="image://739d28d153ae4d3b3247230151959e66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1272" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ford Cruller looks at Raz, his finger on his cheek." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ask anyone who has, and they’ll immediately want to describe to you their favorite level (which is to say, their favorite brain into which they ventured). Many will say the Milkman Conspiracy level, which explored a character’s psychosis with the most incredible combination of wit and tenderness. Others will bring up the bull running sequence, with its amazing use of paintings and its equally amazing, unique art style. I will tell you it’s the guy with the Napoleon complex, because oh my goodness, there is so much that’s so smart in there.</p><p>But honestly, my favorite parts are between the levels, roaming the camp and talking to the other characters, finding the little secrets, or overhearing the gossip. So much of it is so loving, so respectful of its bonkers little people, and I managed to appreciate all this despite living in a country where summer camps aren’t a thing. Take <em>that</em>, 2003 Microsoft. (It’s certainly of some irony that Microsoft now entirely owns Double Fine.) It’s one of those games where you want to seek out every tiny detail so you can discover every single line written by Schafer and Erik Wolpaw.</p><figure id="" data-id="7faee3e3f47e5ed0654fdbaecfdf930b" data-recommend-id="image://7faee3e3f47e5ed0654fdbaecfdf930b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a little Napoleon, standing on a chair, holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It's a little Napoleon, standing on a chair, holding a sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Double Fine / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7faee3e3f47e5ed0654fdbaecfdf930b" data-recommend-id="image://7faee3e3f47e5ed0654fdbaecfdf930b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a little Napoleon, standing on a chair, holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For the rest of this week, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3830/Psychonauts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3830/Psychonauts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can pick up a copy of <em>Psychonauts</em> on Steam for a wildly tiny 89c</a></span>, and if you never have, or haven’t since you played it on Xbox 20 years ago, I really recommend that you do. Few games have this much heart, and deliver so much fun. (It’s also good to see the massively expensive, four-year-old sequel <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/607080/Psychonauts_2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/607080/Psychonauts_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Psychonauts 2</em> is available this week at a price games that old should be: $15</a></span>.)</p><p>Double Fine seems to have dug its arms far down the backs of its couches to find even more nuggets and unrevealed details about <em>Psychonauts</em> for the rest of the week, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.doublefine.com/news/20-psychedelic-years&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.doublefine.com/news/20-psychedelic-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which will be appearing here</a></span>. I’m just going to sit back and reminisce, trying not to sniffle when I remember that moment of absolute gut-punching horror and sadness hidden within Agent Milla’s memories.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The trailer also shows off some of the story for the game, which serves as a prequel to 2016's Doom.</p><p>One of the fascinating things about Doom is that its protagonist has remained the same throughout the original trilogy of Doom games through to the 2016 game and its sequel, Doom Eternal, but there is a period of his history that has remained unexplored. Doom: The Dark Ages looks like it'll fill in the gaps, as the trailer provides a glimpse of Argent D'Nur and how the Doom Slayer--who was enslaved by the Maykrs after his trip to Hell--becomes a living legend on that world.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1045722872" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-10-2025-steam-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Battlestate Games has announced that its extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>will hit its 1.0 release sometime this year, and that a Steam version of the game is also planned, although we don't know when that's coming.</p>

<p>In a livestream held over the weekend (with a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-2025-roadmap-1-0-steam-release-final-map-and-questline.1168725/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">handy summary</a> by the wonderfully-named ResetEra user Saucycarpdog), Battlestate confirms that&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>1.0 is coming in 2025, and that a Steam version is coming after that release.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-arena-finally-revealed-by-battlestate" rel="nofollow">spinoff game</a>&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov: Arena&nbsp;</em>will also be arriving on Steam, and that one is due to land on Valve's platform before the big 1.0 release of the main game. Again, though, no concrete release dates or windows were announced.</p>

The first, in May, will bring a number of optimizations and improvements, while the second is due in June, bringing more gameplay tweaks and improvements to audio.</p>

<p>July's update will bring revamped gunshots for both players and AI opponents (that's CPU enemies, not generative AI), while August's patch will optimize the Interchange location and bring a new event with it.</p>

<p>All of this means that the 1.0 release probably won't arrive before September at the very earliest, and that's assuming it doesn't get delayed. Hopefully, though, we'll see&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>leave the murky confines of its closed beta before the year is through.</p>

<p>The PvE mode, which was the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-unheard-edition-backlash" rel="nofollow">subject</a> of some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-pve-eod-free" rel="nofollow">controversy</a> back when it was first being discussed, will apparently also be coming to Steam after&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>'s 1.0 release, and it'll be getting just one wipe before launch to level the playing field.</p>

Heck, even <em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and <em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>developer FromSoftware is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow">getting in on the action</a>.</p>

<p>For now, though, you can pick up&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov: Arena&nbsp;</em>on PC via the games' <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa-1851777031<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When <em>Danganronpa </em>creator Kazutaka Kodaka and <em>Zero Escape </em>director Kotaro Uchikoshi joined forces to found Too Kyo Games in 2017, I was curious to see just what the two legends of so-called “death games” would create together. But although the team has put out several games in just under a decade, none of them have quite felt like a collaborative effort bearing the distinct creative fingerprints of both creators, until now. <em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy </em>may not be a death game like the duo’s previous work, but the tactical RPG is still overflowing with both Kodaka and Uchikoshi’s signature twists, turns, over-the-top characters, and bold design elements that have made each of their works memorable.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196572,196411" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I’m about 30 hours into <em>The Hundred Line</em>, and for much of that time its premise is classic Kodaka, to the point where I was curious if it might turn out to be a secret <em>Danganronpa </em>game masquerading as something new. A group of teenagers living in a Tokyo complex are attacked by a strange alien invasion, and to help them face this threat, a weird little ghost-like mascot named Sirei gives each of them a blade that activates a mysterious power within them. Called hemoanima, these powers manifest as different weapon types that are an extension of each character’s personalities. The group is then trapped in the titular Last Defense Academy and told they must defend the school from the invading forces for 100 days. Only then will they be allowed to go home.</p><p>Everything about <em>Hundred Line </em>screams <em>Danganronpa </em>spin-off, even if officially it isn’t. The teenagers locked in a school by a devious mascot premise is one major similarity, but the game also features the same artist and composer as the murder mystery series. So despite its differences, it still has the same vibe. Initially I wasn’t sure what to make of this because Kodaka has made a career out of being self-referential. Each <em>Danganronpa </em>game paid homage to the previous one in ways that went beyond narrative throughlines. 2023’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843"><em>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code</em></a></span> may have told a more noirish supernatural tale, but the underlying murder mystery structure was nearly a 1:1 recreation of <em>Danganronpa</em>, right down to the mechanics you used to solve its crimes. When nearly everything a game developer has done has been a callback to his defining work, you start to wonder if the guy only has, like, two ideas.</p><figure id="" data-id="476ba36a9e2e5701fa8f7363085fbb67" data-recommend-id="image://476ba36a9e2e5701fa8f7363085fbb67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sirei points at something with a cane and says &quot;During your time here, you few, you happy few, you band of brothers, will be molded into the perfect Special Defense Unit&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sirei points at something with a cane and says &quot;During your time here, you few, you happy few, you band of brothers, will be molded into the perfect Special Defense Unit&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="476ba36a9e2e5701fa8f7363085fbb67" data-recommend-id="image://476ba36a9e2e5701fa8f7363085fbb67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sirei points at something with a cane and says &quot;During your time here, you few, you happy few, you band of brothers, will be molded into the perfect Special Defense Unit&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While the derivative nature of <em>Hundred Line </em>was distracting at times, I can’t deny it scratched an itch. Kodaka’s brand of high-stakes drama juxtaposed with zany dark humor is still a winning formula, and although the sci-fi mystery it tells is maybe not as immediately compelling as his previous work, it goes in some wild directions that kept me guessing. However, with all the good comes some of Kodaka’s known quirks that you may or may not find grating if you’ve followed his work. While half the cast of trapped high schoolers meaningfully drive the plot forward, the other half serve mostly to derail serious conversations with obnoxious one-liners. For most of the game I wasn’t able to really get to know them because <em>Hundred Line</em>’s social elements are severely lacking compared to those in Kodaka’s previous work, but more in-depth conversations unlocked later which I’m still chipping away at. Even without those extra conversations, however, the cast is full of standouts like the brute with a heart of gold Takemaruand the unnerving assassin Yugamu. Even the characters who initially seemed like one-note tropes wormed their way into my heart eventually.</p><p>All of those different personalities manifest in different fighting styles for the game’s tactical combat. Invading forces will periodically attack the Last Defense Academy, and over the course of the game you’ll have to convince hesitant classmates to join the war effort. As your party grows, so do the challenges you’ll face. For the most part, <em>Hundred Line</em>’s big story battles are spaced out enough that each feels significant, and there are few enough of them that even the most challenging don’t overstay their welcome. If you’re the type of person who wants a Kodaka or Uchikoshi story but doesn’t consider yourself much of a tactical RPG connoisseur, fear not: <em>Hundred Line</em>’s battles feel more like puzzles than the more demanding combat in something like <em>XCOM </em>or <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="fbe9cd5bf92251a73c1daab90f805dc5" data-recommend-id="image://fbe9cd5bf92251a73c1daab90f805dc5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A battle in The Hundred Line." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A battle in The Hundred Line." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fbe9cd5bf92251a73c1daab90f805dc5" data-recommend-id="image://fbe9cd5bf92251a73c1daab90f805dc5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A battle in The Hundred Line." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The crux of <em>Hundred Line</em>’s tactical battles is its AP system. These action points are what allow you to make someone on your team cast an ability, defend an objective, or even move across the battlefield. You’ll start out with only a few of these per turn, but defeating mid-level or higher-ranking enemies on the field will grant you more. As the battle progresses your team gets access to their ultimate abilities, which typically deal high damage to a large area on the field and can take out several enemies at once. These led to the most rewarding moments of <em>Hundred Line</em>’s battles for me, as I chained different party members’ ultimates together to give the rest of my team more chances to pull off a decisive attack.</p><p>One of my favorite fights came about midway through <em>Hundred Line </em>when the school was being attacked by a powerful Commander unit. They had nearly taken down my defenses and would have won the fight if I didn’t end the battle in one turn. Luckily, when a character reaches a certain low health threshold, they’re able to cast their ultimate as a final sacrifice, dealing devastating damage to the field but taking themselves out of the fight. By this point several of my characters were a light pat from death, but in my ranks I also had Kyoshika, the katana-using samurai with a passive ability that allowed her to do extra damage to enemies who were “alone” on the field and not surrounded by any of their teammates. At this point, I knew I had to take a scorched earth approach to the battle to emerge victorious. I sacrificed several of my teammates, using their self-destructive ultimates to take out several mid-level foes and give my team more AP. After I’d lost several of my crew, I had more than enough actions saved up for Kyoshika to whale on the lone Commander, with each strike more than doubled in power because of her passive ability. Doing this meant I was just barely able to win the fight, all because I was willing to sacrifice pawns and made do with what I had left. That kind of table-turning problem-solving feels great, and it was rewarding to see my understanding of one character’s strengths win me the fight. Those kinds of plays only became more common as the game went on and I unlocked new characters with their own specialties. Sure, it’s not as deep or daunting as some of the genre’s biggest names, but it’s got the juice.</p><figure id="" data-id="6ef1980c5bbf7483a2fa34a364a10a37" data-recommend-id="image://6ef1980c5bbf7483a2fa34a364a10a37" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Takumi holds his sword above his head." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Takumi holds his sword above his head." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ef1980c5bbf7483a2fa34a364a10a37" data-recommend-id="image://6ef1980c5bbf7483a2fa34a364a10a37" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Takumi holds his sword above his head." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ve mentioned that <em>Hundred Line </em>feels like Kodaka’s greatest hits, for good and ill, but I haven’t touched on how <em>Zero Escape</em>’s DNA is clearly running through the game. That’s because the extent of Uchikoshi’s influence is pretty hidden for much of its run, and explaining it would rob you of some of the boldest swings the team takes. It’s why despite hitting the credits, I’m still not quite ready to dive into everything the game has to say and stamp “The <em>Kotaku </em>Review” on this write-up. I’ve been pulled away from <em>Hundred Line </em>by other obligations, but getting back to it is all I’ve been thinking about. If you’re a fan of <em>Danganronpa </em>or <em>Zero Escape</em>, know that even with the switch-up in genre, this is a true marriage of some of the best parts of both games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Bungie has <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/alpha_update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it has updated one of the guidelines for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">Marathon</a>'s upcoming closed alpha test. Bungie is removing the NDA from the alpha and players will be able to talk about their experiences with it when it begins on April 23 to when it ends on May 4.</p><p>"As developers we believe community feedback and dialog is essential to make the best version of Marathon. Up until now, this feedback has come from closed playtest sessions," Bungie said in a statement. "In the spirit of building towards that future, we've decided to remove the NDA from our Closed Alpha Test. Everyone can share their thoughts, feedback, and footage, including streaming starting on April 23."</p><p>Bungie added that the studio is most interested in hearing feedback surrounding Marathon's gunplay, weapons, maps, runners, early-game progression, PvP engagements against other players, and PvE engagements against AI. As this isn't the full game, Bungie also clarified that the alpha will not include aspects such as final visuals, a polished user interface, a complete narrative, and ranked play.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-alpha-requirements-and-minimum-pc-specs-revealed/1100-6530908/" data-ref-id="1100-6530908">alpha test requires all players</a> to have a Bungie.net account, but not a PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live account. However, they will be when Marathon officially launches. Marathon will not have a single-player mode like the Destiny franchise does, due to the PvP experience being the foundation of it, according to its former game director.</p><p>Marathon launches on September 23 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. It'll support both cross-play and cross-save, as well <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-wont-be-full-price-though-bungie-says-it-will-be-a-premium-title/1100-6530835/" data-ref-id="1100-6530835">be a premium paid title</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-will-be-40-report/1100-6526561/" data-ref-id="1100-6526561">reports stating that it costs $40</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokecology-pokemon-behavioral-science-book<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've ever wondered how Pokemon behave out in the wild - and, indeed, why they might behave the way they do - then there's a new book called&nbsp;<em>Pokecology&nbsp;</em>that's just for you.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/new-pokemon-book-by-actual-doctor-of-animal-behavior-and-ecology-academically-explains-and-illustrates-behaviors-of-wild-pokemon/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, <i>Pokecology&nbsp;</i>is landing in June. The book<em>&nbsp;</em>is written by two behavioral scientists, and it's been created with a view to explaining the whys of Pokemon from a scientific and ecological perspective.</p>

<p>Topics, according to Automaton's translation of the official&nbsp;<em>Pokecology&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.shogakukan.co.jp/pr/pokecology/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, include "Pokemon eating and sleeping habits, hibernation periods, and migration patterns", among other things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-pokecology-book.jpg?itok=Gm70sfth 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-pokecology-book.jpg?itok=myJVELcq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ever wondered why Pokemon behave the way they do? This new book is for you.</figcaption></figure><p>The authors of the book are Yoshinari Yonehara and Chihiro Kinoshita, both of whom have PhDs in relevant subjects. Yonehara has worked on&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games before, while Kinoshita has worked as an illustrator for ecology-focused children's books.</p>

<p>Right now, the book has only been confirmed for Japan, and we don't yet know which Pokemon will be featured. If you want to pick it up, you'll have to import it; Automaton says it'll cost the equivalent of around $10, but of course, that doesn't factor in shipping.</p>

<p>It's a pretty busy time for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>right now. In the fall, Nintendo and&nbsp;The Pokemon Company will release&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow">latest game in the long-running franchise</a> (although not technically the next mainline entry in the series).</p>

<p>The game will take place entirely in the Kalos-based city of Lumiose, and will see the player encountering Pokemon across a number of "Wild Zones", while also taking on trainers as part of the titular Z-A Royale competition.</p>




<p>As for the tenth generation of mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, nothing has been revealed so far, but when it does land, we're expecting the games to be available exclusively for the Switch 2, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">which launches in June</a>. Pre-orders for the console <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-canada-april-24th" rel="nofollow">recently opened back up</a> after a tariff-induced delay.</p>
