            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>, the live-action adaptation of Sega’s speedy platformer is entering a new era. With each subsequent movie, the <em>Sonic </em>films have sought to shed the generic “family” movie image for one that was more honest to the anime-inspired twists and turns of the long-running platformer series. And this latest film succeeds. <em>Sonic 3 </em>is a loose adaptation of one of the most beloved stories in all of the series’ 30 years. While the film does tweak some things along the way, it doesn’t shy away from the otherworldly, supercharged melodrama that differentiated <em>Sonic </em>from its contemporaries in the early 2000s. <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>still falls into the occasional trap of talking down to the all-ages audience with low-hanging jokes and some frankly groan-worthy segments, but more than ever, the third film earns the right to delve into the video game excess that made these characters so beloved in the first place.</p><p>While there are a few lapses in judgment, <em>Sonic 3</em>’s greatest strength is that it prioritizes its nonhuman characters, rather than sidelining them in service of the less-interesting humans. After the colossal letdown of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/knuckles-review-paramount-plus-episodes-season-one-1851423404&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/knuckles-review-paramount-plus-episodes-season-one-1851423404"><em>Knuckles </em>series’ human-centric story</a></span>, I was relieved to see <em>Sonic 3</em> not only focus on the anthropomorphic aliens, but also give them some of their best material yet. Keanu Reeves’ Shadow is the heart of the film. Though his backstory differs slightly from the games, the same throughlines of grief and vengeance flows through him. Reeves’ performance in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-keanu-reeves-dlc-tokyo-stage-1851720674&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-keanu-reeves-dlc-tokyo-stage-1851720674"><em>Shadow Generations </em>tie-in DLC</a></span> was rough, but his soulful delivery in the film carries the heavy weight Shadow bears in the darkest stories the movies have told.</p><p>Though the specifics are slightly different, <em>Sonic 3</em> draws heavily from the dueling character perspective of the game it draws most from, <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. The movie takes most of that game’s key components, effectively delineating the movie into two tones depending on which speedy hedgehog is at the center of any given scene. The moments when Shadow is the focus are as contemplative and evocative as the ones in his debut in the Dreamcast game two decades ago. Sonic’s scenes, meanwhile, are cheerful and optimistic, with the angst of Shadow’s darker story bleeding through as the movie attempts to examine both characters’ reactions to loss.</p><figure id="" data-id="a0abe766b2c8392b1145f18c28821450" data-recommend-id="image://a0abe766b2c8392b1145f18c28821450" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles stand in a burning Tokyo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles stand in a burning Tokyo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a0abe766b2c8392b1145f18c28821450" data-recommend-id="image://a0abe766b2c8392b1145f18c28821450" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles stand in a burning Tokyo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The clear duality <em>Sonic 3 </em>draws between Sonic and Shadow is what makes the film a more intentional video game adaptation than the previous films. More than just bringing in familiar characters and lore, <em>Sonic 3</em> actively adapts the structure and symmetry of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em> to great effect. Though the movie sadly is missing a key player, as Rouge the Bat doesn’t appear in <em>Sonic 3</em> as some speculated, the asymmetry between Sonic and Shadow, even as they appear to be equal in strength and skill, is the clearest sign of a directorial intent that was too nebulous before. <em>Sonic 3 </em>sheds most of the cheesy distractions from previous films, like <em>Sonic 2</em>’s wedding subplot or the inane pop culture references that have plagued these movies. Instead, the film is clearly in pursuit of something that feels true to the source material and doesn’t always talk down to the kids in the room. Surprisingly enough, the movie is one of the most poignant explorations of Sonic and Shadow’s contrast, coming off years of Shadow being treated like a bit player. It respects its characters enough to not water down the darkest parts of who they are. Well, it does so for the protagonists, at least.</p><p>While I loved Sonic and Shadow’s rivalry, I didn’t expect to come out of <em>Sonic 3</em> soured on Jim Carrey’s performance as Doctor Ivo “Eggman” Robotnik. Carrey plays two roles in the film, reprising his role as the eccentric mad scientist, and Eggman’s grandfather, Gerald Robotnik. Gerald has had an important but mostly posthumous role throughout the <em>Sonic </em>series, and I was wary of Carrey’s portrayal of him in the trailers as the movie seemed to be taking a more humorous approach to a character notoriously known for some of the most <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtLsYuzCkZo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtLsYuzCkZo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spine-chilling moments</a></span> in the franchise. Gerald is alive and well(?) in <em>Sonic 3</em>, and it gives Carrey the opportunity to mostly riff with himself. While both characters have their moments, most of these films’ greatest sins are on display while the Robotniks are on screen. These moments are where you’ll find the needle drops, an unexpected dance break, and all the unfunny bits that come off like an adult writing for children they don’t believe could grasp something even slightly sophisticated. Almost all of that falls under Carrey’s screen time and feels like a waste of his talents and the mad scientists he plays.</p><figure id="" data-id="29c9fc9b3f352a74af8ebb948bac7eb3" data-recommend-id="image://29c9fc9b3f352a74af8ebb948bac7eb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Robotniks look at something off-screen on a futuristic ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Robotniks look at something off-screen on a futuristic ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="29c9fc9b3f352a74af8ebb948bac7eb3" data-recommend-id="image://29c9fc9b3f352a74af8ebb948bac7eb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Robotniks look at something off-screen on a futuristic ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Paramount’s overreliance on human characters has been one of the most glaring issues of the <em>Sonic </em>films. Capable actors playing Sonic’s human friends were often given the worst material in the script and it made even the shortest scenes feel excruciatingly long. <em>Sonic 3 </em>isn’t innocent of this, as <em>Jessica Jones </em>actor Krysten Ritter joins the cast as GUN agent Director Rockwell who mostly exists as a temporary obstacle for everyone before being quickly shuffled off the board. The <em>Knuckles </em>series might as well have not been named as such, as Idris Elba’s take on the beloved Echnida was barely in the show. For two movies, it felt like Carrey’s unhinged, show-stealing performance as Eggman was immune to this, but the movie does such an otherwise good job of keeping the focus on Sonic and Shadow that those distracting, low-effort propensities funneled into his performance instead of elsewhere.</p><p>The best human interactions in <em>Sonic 3 </em>are the ones that come back to its two leads, such as Alyla Browne’s role as Shadow’s best friend Maria, or Sonic’s father/son relationship with James Marsden’s small-town cop Tom. Lee Majdoub also gives an earnest performance reprising his role as Agent Stone dealing with his toxic relationship with the ol’ Egghead. But so much of the job of distracting children with zany antics falls at Carrey’s feet. It robs him of the wit and comedic timing that he had in the first two films. I’m sure he was having a blast on set, but he deserved better than what he had to work with.</p><figure id="" data-id="934e4a4630f146519f1c1d0690c0678e" data-recommend-id="image://934e4a4630f146519f1c1d0690c0678e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonic and Shadow stare each other down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonic and Shadow stare each other down." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="934e4a4630f146519f1c1d0690c0678e" data-recommend-id="image://934e4a4630f146519f1c1d0690c0678e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonic and Shadow stare each other down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some of that friction only happens because Gerald is alive in this version of the tale, and it’s not the only difference even the most casually engaged <em>Sonic</em> fan will notice. There are a few key changes from game to film that long-time fans will notice, but overall, <em>Sonic 3</em> goes out of its way to preserve the AMV-bait vibes of the series’ early-00s angst, and pulls it off with something that is constantly entertaining, mostly respectful of its characters and audience, and the truest to the spirit of the franchise. Watching Sonic and Shadow clash with an edge and style that feels even more electric than anything the first two movies even attempted is a blast, and its final battle is especially raw, emotionally cathartic, and well-earned after three good, gradually improving movies and a bad TV show.</p><p>I think “earned” is the word my mind keeps wandering to as I think back on <em>Sonic 3</em>. These movies have come so far from when Paramount first revealed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-movie-first-trailer-ugly-design-delay-redesign-1851446390&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-movie-first-trailer-ugly-design-delay-redesign-1851446390">the horrifying gremlin</a></span> that was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ugly-sonic-hedgehog-cameo-chip-dale-rescue-rangers-disn-1848955965&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ugly-sonic-hedgehog-cameo-chip-dale-rescue-rangers-disn-1848955965">Ugly Sonic</a></span> in the first trailer it has since tried to wipe from the internet. Each movie has gradually tried to introduce more of the weird, earnest shit that has kept Sonic and Shadow in the hearts of millions even as the series has hit snags that would have ended most other big franchises. If you’d told me 20 years ago that a live-action adaptation of <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>would one day hit the big screen I don’t think I would have believed you. If you’d told me it would be good, I would have believed you even less. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For example, Heavy has a sister and she eventually falls in love with Soldier! Anyway suddenly, nearly seven years after issue six, Valve has published the seventh installment in the main <em>TF2</em> comic series and finally revealed Spy’s face. </p><p><strong><em>And uh, yeah, minor spoilers below for issue seven. Take this as your last warning.</em></strong><em> </em></p><p>After 17 years of playing <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, it’s very odd to finally be looking at Spy without his mask on.

Will we get more <em>TF2 </em>comics in the future? Maybe, but as for the main overarching plot of the franchise (yes, it eventually developed one), it seems done. And that’s nice. Maybe now, with this wrapped, Valve can bring closure to&nbsp;another franchise and its plotlines, too. I’m talking about<em> Half-Life 3</em>. I want to play <em>Half-Life 3</em>.

<p>So when Sony put out the recent "remaster" of <em>Zero Dawn</em>, I was cautiously optimistic. Any sort of non-half-assed PS5 reworking ought to reduce load times, right?</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>Machines make it hard to enjoy the view.</span>
                </p>
  </div>

<p>I meant to dip into the world of <em>Zero Dawn</em> only for a few hours, but I ended up playing through the whole game and its expansion, <em>The Frozen Wilds, </em>over the last few weeks. The arrow-based gameplay, complex story, and voice acting were still terrific, and the remastered elements were far more than a simple cash-in. Even little things, like the way the adaptive triggers on the PS5 controllers mimic the tension of a bowstring, felt perfect.</p>
<p>I didn't expect to get sucked back into the game's world for so many hours, but I had a great time doing it and wanted to spread the good word for those who might be looking for an engaging single-player experience over the holidays.</p>
<h2>Big changes</h2>
<p>When it comes to major changes, the remaster has three.</p>
<p>First, the game loads fast. It feels like a ground-up PS5 title. Death—and its attendant reloads—no longer makes me want to throw my controller across the room during difficult battles. It's great.</p>
<p>Second, the game looks unbelievable. This is not a case of just upping the resolution to 4K and calling it a day. Sony claims that the game features "over 10 hours of re-recorded conversation, mocap and countless graphical improvements that bring the game to the same visual fidelity as its critically acclaimed sequel." Also, the game's characters have "been upgraded, bringing them in line with current generation advances in character models and rendering."</p>
<p>This is not just marketing fluff. The faces look incredible, even in close-up cinematic interludes, but what really caught my eye was the lighting. From the moment a young Aloy spelunks into a cave and finds an electronic gadget attached to a skeleton lying peacefully in a sunbeam, the revamped lighting engine makes its presence clear. No, it's not "realistic"—everything looks like a postcard shot. But I found myself pausing the game just to look at the sunlight scattered by a snowstorm or dawn breaking over a mountain range. The lighting interacts with a volumetric set of effects that bring fog and dust devils to life like few other games I've seen. When Aloy tramps through a winter squall, leaving footsteps in the mountain snow as she walks, the effect is magical. (Until a Glinthawk swoops in, screaming, and attacks.)</p>

There are many who deserve praise, but to describe their impact, we must stare the flaws of this demographic dead in the eye.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When industry players sing the praises of UGC platforms they struggle to explain </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>why</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> they're so popular. For the most part Roblox Corporation has soaked up all the attention we'd normally heap on developers. It'd be like if we praised the App Store instead of Ustwo Games for the making of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monument Valley</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. There is some difference. Players move more fluidly between games in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> ecosystem than they do on other app stores, but that fluidity leaves many developers making great games on the service on the sidelines.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Praising this wide group of workers comes with complications. A minority of them are under the age of 18, caught in the Robux ecosystem that sells itself both as "baby's first game project" and "the ultimate way to self-monetize." People Make Games and other reporters have </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/_gXlauRB1EQ?si=jOsqy7cmLZIJy9W0">documented</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the stress these young folks have been through, and though the company promises ever-improving protections, they are still a part of the system powering its profits. Some might even say they're exploited.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And then we must turn our gaze further up the age range, because many successful developers on these platforms are the ones doing the exploiting. Some take advantage of young folks to underpay them for popular games; others steal their suddenly successful ideas and clone titles, blurring the line between inspiration and theft. And an absolutely vile lot of them are the ones behind the horrendous experiences like "Escape to Epstein Island" and "Diddy Party" </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">spotted</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Hindenburg research in its blistering report explaining why it is shorting Roblox Corporation.

As </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">UEFN, and other platforms enjoyed notable growth in 2024, we'd like to recognize the positive—and where needed, negative—impact these workers made.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-cyberpunk-2077-update-includes-free-copy-of-cyberpunk-red-easy-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The latest update for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cyberpunk-2077" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> includes a hidden treat for those interested in the tabletop experience. With a bit of digging, players can find a copy of <em>Cyberpunk Red: Easy Mode</em>, giving them a small taste of the latest version of the foundational TTRPG.</p>



<p>In a recent report <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/500301/cyberpunk-2077-red-easy-mode-ttrpg-pdf-how-to-get" rel="nofollow">by Polygon</a>, a spokesperson from R. Talsorian Games stated that anyone who owns a copy <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and can access their Bonus Content folder will find a PDF of <em>Cyberpunk Red: Easy Mode</em>.</p>

For those playing on console, the PDF should be available through the Digital Goodies folder via the GOG account linked to your game.</p>

<p><em>Cyberpunk Red: Easy Mode</em> contains the quickstart rules for the latest version of Mike Pondsmith's iconic TTRPG set in the dark future. It contains an abridged version of the core rules, an introductory mission, and five pre-made characters for players embody: Rockerboy, Solo, Tech, Medtech, and Media. A great entry point for those interested in the hobby.</p>

It's still set in the capitalist dystopia that is Night City, but in The Time of the Red, the literal nuclear fallout of a terrorist attack that devastated Arasaka Tower. Everyone still needs to deal with corpo scum, cyberpsychos, and brutal cops, but they also need to navigate dangerous storms and suffocating radiation.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time that <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> recognized its tabletop foundations. The Bonus Content in the game includes a PDF of the Cyberpunk 2020 Core Rulebook.</p>

<p>This is the second edition of the foundational TTRPG released in 1990. It contains crucial elements of lore such as the aftermath of the Fourth Corporate War, and is a snapshot of the game's design ethos of the era..</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/evil-geniuses-sign-yay-and-icy-to-complete-2025-valorant-roster/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Evil Geniuses has officially signed Jaccob “yay” Whiteaker and Jacob “icy” Lange to its VALORANT roster today. The two players will join the returning trio Derrek “Derrek” Ha, Nicholas “NaturE” Garrison and Phat “Supamen” Le.</p>



<p>While EG took a step back in 2024 after its 2023 world championship, the organization has now brought in a player once recently regarded as VALORANT’s best duelist.</p>



<h2 id="h-someone-cooked-here">Someone Cooked Here</h2>



<p>The addition of icy was announced earlier in the day. icy played for G2 during the 2024 season, helping the roster core that qualified through Ascension reach the playoffs of Champions 2024. Coincidentally, icy was dropped this offseason in favor of the last remaining EG player from their Champions 2023 run, Alexander “jawgemo” Mor. Icy was also on the EG reserve roster in 2023.</p>



<p>Yay competed as a stand-in for Evil Geniuses during this offseason at the Sen City Classic. EG also competed with Tyler “sym” Porter at that event, though he returned to TSM in Challengers. At the Sen City Classic, yay said that things were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/CKpt1TkoC4I?si=tnZdxweO5h2ZVTnh&amp;t=14055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“clicking right away”</a> as soon as he started playing with EG.</p>



<p>With icy arriving alongside him, yay will  not take on the primary duelist role he was once famous for. Following the 2022 season, in which yay established himself as a world-class duelist player for OpTic, yay was highly sought after by all the partnered teams. He would land with Cloud9, but nothing went his way over the next two years. He quickly departed C9, had a dismal run with Disguised in NA Challengers, then found himself in the Pacific league with BLEED in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BLEED was <a href="https://x.com/ValorantEsports/status/1842063072111792589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed</a> from the VALORANT Champions Tour by Riot completely, due to “failure to comply with critical reporting requirements and other key obligations under the TPA.” This was part of a much larger story at BLEED involving <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bleed-esports-rainbow-six-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged missed payments and the CEO’s legal troubles</a>.</p>



<p>Did Evil Geniuses put together a winning lineup with yay and icy? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                                        <p dir="ltr">The Amazon Luna cloud-streaming service is an awesome choice for anyone who wants to game without the need for expensive consoles or gaming PCs. If you've recently joined the service, we've put together this guide filled with tips to optimize your experience, as well as game recommendations to check out.</p><p dir="ltr">Before diving in, if you're new to Amazon Luna or need a refresher on how to sign up, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-luna-cloud-game-streaming-overview-benefits-subscription-cost-compatible-devices/1100-6528079/" data-ref-id="1100-6528079">our previous guide</a> that explains what Amazon Luna is and how to use it. Now, let's explore how to enhance your cloud-gaming sessions and highlight our recommendation of must-play titles on Amazon Luna.</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Tip 1: Invest in a Luna Controller</strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418510-lunacontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418510" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418510-lunacontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418510"></a><figcaption>Luna controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418510-lunacontroller.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Our first and biggest tip is to purchase and use an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Luna-Controller/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign2-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Luna controller</a>. While you can use other controllers or your phone, the Luna Controller is designed for cloud gaming with its direct Wi-Fi connection, making it easy to switch between devices. It also supports Bluetooth and USB, includes Amazon Alexa, and even works with Steam. If you're serious about Luna gaming, the investment is worthwhile. Luckily, you can save big on the Amazon Luna Controller right now. The controller is available by itself for just $45 (was $70), or in discounted bundles that include the controller and an Amazon Fire TV Stick streaming device. Check out all the deals below.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Luna controller deals at Amazon:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Luna-Controller/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign2-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Luna Controller</a> -- $45 (<del>$70</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Bundle-including-streaming-Controller/dp/B0CLPDXQ8Z?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign2-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max and Luna Controller Bundle</a> -- $80 (<del>$130</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stick-Controller-Cloud-gaming-bundle/dp/B0DK64GFKX?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign2-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K and Luna Controller Bundle</a> -- $68 (<del>$120</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Bundle-including-streaming-Controller/dp/B0CLPDXQ8Z?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign2-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Fire TV Stick HD and Luna Controller Bundle</a> -- $60 (<del>$105</del>)</li></ul><hr><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Tip 2: </strong><strong>Connect your Luna Controller to Wi-Fi</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">As mentioned above, the Wi-Fi direct connection on the Luna controller offers lower latency compared to Bluetooth. While the controller supports 2.4 and 5GHz Wi-Fi connections, it's best to connect with 5GHz if possible for the best possible performance.</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Tip 3: Optimize Your Amazon Luna Connection</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">For a smooth 1080p gameplay experience, Amazon recommends an internet speed of at least 10 Mbps, and you can optimize your connection by changing a few settings.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Use a wired Ethernet connection when possible.</li><li dir="ltr">Disable VPNs</li><li dir="ltr">If you're playing via Google Chrome, enable hardware acceleration by typing “<strong>chrome://settings/?search=hardware</strong>” in the address bar and toggling the option on.</li><li dir="ltr">Disable location services while playing on Fire tablets and macOS to avoid performance issues.</li><li dir="ltr">Adjust in-game resolution/graphics settings as needed. Note that some games may not save these settings after exiting, so you may need to tweak them each time to you play.</li><li dir="ltr">If you still experience buffering or lag while playing, reduce the resolution to 720p, which requires only 5 Mbps. You'll find this setting in the Luna app under <strong>Settings &gt; Audio &amp; Video Quality.</strong></li></ul><hr><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Tip 4: Use your phone as a controller</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Since Luna is a cloud-streaming service, you can access your games on a wide variety of devices at virtually any time, as long as you're connected to the internet. One of the most convenient options is with your iOS or Android smartphone. You can pair a Luna controller or other Luna-compatible Bluetooth controller to your phone and play that way, but you can also use the phone itself as a controller thanks to Luna's virtual on-screen controls, which adds a d-pad, thumbsticks, face buttons, and triggers to your phone's screen.</p><p dir="ltr">While this lets you play and control the action all on one screen, you can also connect your phone to the same network as your main Luna streaming device and use your phone as a controller while playing on a TV, computer, or other external display. If you sign in to both devices with the same Luna account, you can quickly and easily sync them up. Guests can even join your gameplay using their phones via the Luna Controller app, making this a simple solution for local multiplayer, though they'll need your Amazon credentials.</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Tip 5: Play online with friends without a Luna subscription</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Speaking of multiplayer on Luna, the Luna Couch feature allows you to play with others online without them needing a Luna subscription. The only requirements are that they have an Amazon account and a supported controller.</p><p dir="ltr">To do this, select Couch from the Luna interface, pick a game, and start a Luna Couch session. Share the provided code with others, who then use the Luna Couch website to join your game.</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Tip 6: Broadcasting Games to Twitch</strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418511-014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418511" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418511-014.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418511"></a><figcaption>You can stream live to Twitch directly from Luna</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418511-014.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Thanks to Amazon owning Twitch, Luna integrates seamlessly with Twitch, making is super easy to stream your gameplay to viewers. Here's how it works:</p><ol><li dir="ltr">Select the Broadcast button in the Luna app's navigation bar. <strong>For Fire TV and Fire tablet:</strong> Scan the QR code using your mobile phone. Use your phone to set up your stream and broadcast audio and video.</li><li dir="ltr">Select Setup broadcast to open a new browser window.</li><li dir="ltr">In the broadcast setup window, configure your Twitch stream to enable or disable audio and webcam input.</li><li dir="ltr">Select <strong>"Start live broadcast" </strong>to begin sharing your audio and webcam on Twitch.</li><li dir="ltr">Return to the Luna app and start a game. A separate window will pop up, allowing you to manage your stream. This window includes controls to enable or disable your audio and webcam feeds, as well as options to stop or pause the broadcast at any time. Keep this window open while you broadcast.</li></ol><hr><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What to play On Amazon Luna</strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418512-015.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418512" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418512-015.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418512"></a><figcaption>Amazon Luna has dozens of great games to play.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418512-015.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">So now that we've covered some helpful tips and cool features, let's go over the most important part: what to play.</p><p dir="ltr">We've put together a few lists of suggestions based on various genres and popular series in the following slides. Note that our picks are all available in the core Luna+ and/or Amazon Prime libraries accessible as part of your subscription. We included several standout titles in each genre, but there's plenty more to play than what we've listed. Beyond Luna+, there are also various add-on channels and other storefronts you can sync to Luna if you want to add even more games to your Luna library. Check our Amazon Luna overview for more information. For now, let's look at some of our recommendations for what to play on Luna+.</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Fallout Games (Amazon Prime)</strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418484-001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418484" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418484-001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418484"></a><figcaption>Fallout 3</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418484-001.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If Amazon's Fallout Prime Video series has you curious about the games it's based on, you're in luck, as two of the best games in the franchise are available to stream on Luna. While they look and play similarly at a glance, <a href="https://luna.amazon.com/game/fallout-3-game-of-the-year-edition/B0CWDRMZDF?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign2-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Fallout 3</strong></a> and <a href="https://luna.amazon.com/game/fallout-new-vegas-ultimate-edition/B0CW16SB1M?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign2-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Fallout: New Vegas</strong></a> offer different takes on the open-world RPG formula. Fallout 3 is perfect for exploring the nuclear wasteland and crafting your own adventure, whereas Fallout: New Vegas is packed with some of the best bespoke storylines the series has ever seen. Either way, both will satisfy cravings for post-apocalyptic adventuring. Note that unlike the other titles covered in the post, the Fallout games require an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign2-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Prime subscription</a> to play. </p><hr><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>More RPGs (Luna+)</strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418994-017.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418994" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418994-017.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418994"></a><figcaption>Mortal Shell</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4418994-017.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Amazon Luna is stacked with plenty of other excellent RPGs of all styles.

On the other end of the spectrum are <a href="https://luna.amazon.com/game/bug-fables-the-everlasting-sapling/B096YNW2FH?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign2-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Bug Fables</strong></a> and <a href="https://luna.amazon.com/game/monster-harvest/B09KMBCMJ7?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign2-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Monster Harvest</strong></a>, which offer turn-based throwbacks to older eras of console RPGs with welcome modernized touches. </p><p dir="ltr">For something more experimental, we highly recommend <a href="https://luna.amazon.com/game/citizen-sleeper/B0BZBQLXXP?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign2-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Citizen Sleeper</strong></a>.

			<p>There's no doubt that Fallout 76 <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-is-now-free-to-grab-on-prime-gaming-for-pc-and-xbox-franchise-sees-player-boost-following-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a major boost in its player base following the smashing success of Fallout's TV debut on Amazon Prime Video. While previous installments in the franchise also registered significant upticks in player activity, Fallout 76 is the only game still running and being updated, and it also received a few nifty cross-over items like the Ghoul's outfit, inspired by fan-favorite TV show character Cooper Howard (played by Walton Goggins). Now, on the heels of the Ghoul craze, the studio is <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-ghoul-experience-detailed-by-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about to add playable Ghouls</a> for the first time in the franchise.</p>
<p>With all this excitement, no wonder, then, that it quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-passes-20-million-players-milestone-bethesda-is-planning-future-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> the 20 million player milestone and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-reaches-21-million-players-asks-for-labor-of-love-nominations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke</a> 21 million only a few months later. With the show's <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second season</a> now in full production, the question is, can fans expect a bigger cross-over event?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-76-lead-producer-of-fallout-show-season-two-crossovers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to VG247</a>, Fallout 76 Lead Producer Bill LaCoste replied that that's probably not going to be the case, as the team doesn't want to go all-in on fan service with the risk of overdoing it.</p>
<p><i>I would imagine it would probably be along the same lines because we have an appreciation for the TV show, the story it’s trying to tell, and the characters it's trying to portray, and we also have an appreciation for the story Fallout 76 is trying to tell.</i></p>
<p><em>So, very, very limited amounts of crossover, where it actually makes sense because, again, we're on extreme ends of the Fallout timeline as well. So, some of that crossover doesn't make sense. We just want to make sure that it's done in a way that is supportive of the TV show, but also allows us to just coexist within this story overall that's being told.</em></p>
<p><em>We probably won't go out of our way to add a whole bunch of stuff specific to the show because we don't feel like we need to. We feel like it's great to let the TV show do its thing and for people to love the TV show for what it is, but also love our game for what it is, and not just give fan service for just the sake of doing it. We'll do some things that make sense, the Vault 33 suit made sense, it's something that exists in the world and you can have it, but yeah, we'll probably keep that relatively light would be my guess.</em></p>
<p>On paper, it sounds like the right choice. While fan service is generally appreciated by gamers, it can easily backfire. For now, though, the Fallout 76 community is very excited about the future following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-gleaming-depths-update-now-available-adding-biggest-boss-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gleaming Depths update</a> and the upcoming debut of playable Ghouls.</p>
