<p data-characters="236" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/lance-reddick-actor-voice-talent-dies-60-obituary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lance Reddick</a> was a phenomenal actor who brought every character he played to life, whether on-screen or as a voice.<em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-destiny-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2</a></em> players heard him daily as Commander Zavalla, the head of the Vanguard who pulled us through so many crises. </p> <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="true">As we inch closer to the release of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-month-ahead-of-the-final-shape-destiny-2s-community-is-at-ease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Final Shape</em></a>, I and many other fans have been eager to hear what Commander Zavalla will sound like with Keith David stepping into the role. In the first of a series of ViDocs for the expansion, we were given a few lines of dialogue from David’s Zavalla, and it gave me shivers. The whole room felt cold because it was like I was hearing a ghost speak. But then, Guardians never really die. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odUA7RoEONQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full ViDoc</a> is very much worth a watch if you’re excited about the final expansion for <em>Destiny 2</em>. All you need to hear has been cut and put together by <a href="https://x.com/DestinyBulletn/status/1793677260643508265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny Bulletin on Twitter</a>, though, in case you can’t wait to hear what our new Zavalla sounds like. </p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">Lance Reddick was one of the greatest and most prolific actors of our time. A quick check of his IMDB profile shows 121 actor credits, 4 as a producer, and 2 on soundtracks. His voice was fantastic, the perfect blend of depth, attitude, and emotion, allowing him to fit easily into incredibly serious roles by bringing a level of authority to any situation that you simply understood without context. </p>
 <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">When Reddick spoke, you listened, and that’s a hard act to follow. From what we’ve heard from him so far, Keith David isn’t going all in on replicating Reddick’s voice as closely as possible. Instead, he’s bringing to the table what his predecessor did. Raw emotion, depth, attitude, and that same authority that you obey without question because you know this man is asking you to saunter up to the gates of hell for the fight of your life for a reason. </p>
 <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s expansions and seasons have always been pocketed with emotional crescendos. The opening to <em>The Taken King</em>, <em>Rise of Iron</em>‘s tale of the ultimate warriors sacrificing themselves, reconnecting with Rasputin in <em>Warmind</em>, and, more recently, seeing Crow become a heroic character after falling so hard from grace and Eris Morn take one for the team as the most badass witch in the galaxy. </p>
 <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="235" data-injectable="false">Commander Zavalla may not always have been the focal point of these stories, but he has been a stronghold when the game cracks our steely Guardian exteriors and forces us to remember that not everyone is going to come back from death. </p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="false">Handling that kind of role is a huge amount of pressure. In the two clips we’ve seen, though, David demonstrates both a vulnerable Zavalla, and the strong, commanding voice we often need him to be. There’s no doubt in my mind that he’ll be the perfect Zavalla come <em>The Final Shape</em>. Not because of any one particular thing his voice portrays but because of how it embodies the unbreakable pillar of <em>Destiny 2</em>.</p>

            <p>Larian Studios' Swen Vincke has opened up about crunch culture at the studio, acknowledging that the team did, at times, "have to do a bit of crunch" when "things happened that [the studio] didn't foresee".</p>
<p>In the Q&amp;A Vincke hosted after his address at the Digital Dragons conference in Poland, Vincke was asked if the team ever had to crunch – that is, the term given to the extreme overtime studios compel staff to do to get a game ready for its release date – and whilst Vincke said the team wasn't "overly" required to crunch, and it was "certainly less on BG3 than we did in the past", "It would be a lie to say that we didn't" crunch at all.</p>

<p>"We didn't overly crunch," Vincke said (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/baldurs-gate-3-had-less-crunch-than-larians-previous-rpgs-but-its-director-says-you-will-always-have-a-little-bit-of-overtime/">GR+</a>). "but we did have to do a bit of crunch. And I think, to be honest, you will always have a little bit when you're trying to finish something, especially when there's so much complexity that needs to be brought together."</p>
<p>Vincke further added that anyone who had to work late was paid for their overtime – many studios purportedly do not – and only "very, very, very rarely" would people work over the weekend or past 8pm at night.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios shared the "disappointing news" that its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-xbox-physical-edition-gets-a-bit-of-a-delay-due-to-production-issues">physical PS5 North America deluxe editions have been delayed once again</a>, this time to July 2024.</p>
<p>Larian also recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">confirmed its next game will not be Baldur's Gate 4</a>, DLC, or anything else to do with Dungeons and Dragons… but it did tease that it had other games in development.</p>

It’s one thing to make space look good; it’s another thing entirely to faithfully recreate the cockpit of a 747 and the whole world around which it might fly.</p><p>On&nbsp;<a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of&nbsp;<em>The Vergecast</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;the fourth and final installment of our series on the five senses of video games, we asked <em>Polygon’s </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/authors/charlie-hall">Charlie Hall</a> to help us make sense of the current state of the art in flight simulation. Hall, who once spent more than four months in VR <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/14/18182580/elite-dangerous-distant-worlds-2-waypoints-sign-ups">mapping the edge of the Milky Way galaxy in <em>Elite: Dangerous</em></a>, has more experience in a virtual cockpit than most. We wanted to know how the pros set up their simulators to get the most realistic experience and why it’s so complicated to make a virtual world look like the real one.</p><p>Hall makes the case that while VR and XR headsets hold a lot of promise for even more realistic experiences in the future, the best virtual cockpits of today are still made up of multi-monitor setups and power-hungry GPUs. That’s true whether you’re playing in your house or you’re running the official <a href="https://www.navair.navy.mil/news/Navy-and-Air-Force-fighters-train-joint-force-NAWCADs-Joint-Simulation-Environment/Tue">F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning simulators</a> at the US Air Force.

WB Games’ crossover platform fighter dropped in Open Beta in 2022, and the plan at the time seemed to be a smooth transition to a full launch. Instead the game was temporarily shut down, despite having run multiple Battle Passes and taking real money for skins and other cosmetics. Several months later, a relaunch is right around the corner with 1.0 scheduled for May 28, 2024.

    </div><div>



            <p>2K is rumoured to have secured the official FIFA license to develop the next FIFA game.</p>
<p>That's according to unverified claims from retailer <a href="https://x.com/mohplay_inc_">@mohplay_inc_</a>, which alleges that "the partnership is confirmed, and 2K will be developing a new football game series", albeit without sharing their source.</p>

<p>The news has been received with excitement, alarm, and scepticism in equal measure, not least because the leaker claims "FIFA 2K25 is set to launch this year, just in time for the FIFA World Cup 2K26!", which seems an incredibly quick turnaround.</p>
<p>Others are just delighted at the prospect of EA's football series having competition beyond Konami's eFootball franchise, which secured <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/efootball-2022-season-1-review-too-little-too-late">an Avoid in our review</a> when it first released back in 2022.</p>

</span></p><p>EA's long-running football series might have jettisoned the FIFA license, but the publisher was keen to let everyone know it's doing just fine without it, announcing that this year's iteration, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-24-trumpets-11m-players-in-first-week-1m-more-than-fifa-23">EA Sports FC 24, reached 11.3m players in its first week of release</a>.</p>
<p>That's compared to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fifa-23-had-series-largest-ever-number-of-players-at-launch">10.3m players that hopped into last year's FIFA 23</a> during the same period - a figure EA referred to as "record-breaking" and the "biggest launch period" in the franchise's history at the time.</p>
<p>EA Sports FC launched for PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and Switch at the end of September, earning itself 3 out of 5 stars in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-24-review-sensible-changes-and-disappointing-constants">Eurogamer's EA Sports FC review</a>. "There are improvements, and there are problems, business as usual," contributor Josh Wise wrote. "The era of EA Sports' FIFA may be over, but the game goes on."</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-delayed-to-second-half-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2</a> was arguably the star of the recent Warhammer Skulls 2024 live stream. The long-awaited sequel <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-maine-2-co-op-operations-mode-6v6-pvp-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed off the multiplayer modes</a> available in the final release: the PvE Operations mode, which runs parallel to the co-op enabled campaign, where you'll play as your own customized Space Marine and work as a team to defeat various Xeno abominations; and the PvP Eternal War mode, where Chaos and Empire will once again clash with chainswords in intense 6v6 multiplayer battles.</p>
<p>In both modes, players will pick between six multiplayer classes with very different gameplay. By playing them, they’ll be able to upgrade these classes with different perks and customize their armor from helm to greaves, with a wide selection of cosmetic elements, such as colors, heraldry decals, pauldrons, gauntlets, and more.&nbsp;On that note, publisher Focus Home Interactive later <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1794020543798427832" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made a clarification</a> that will probably make many fans happy:</p>
<ul>
<li>There aren't any microtransactions in Space Marine 2. No in-game cash shop.</li>
<li>All gameplay content and features will be free to all players. Paid DLCs will be cosmetic only.</li>
</ul>
<p>The six multiplayer classes are Tactical, Assault, Vanguard, Bulwark, Sniper, and Heavy. The classes are similar but not quite all the same compared to the original game, which included Tactical, Assault, Devastator, Raptor, Dreadnought, and Havoc.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now open for Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2. All pre-orders will receive the Macragge's Chosen cosmetic DLC, which includes the Ultramarines-inspired skin set for the bolt rifle, the chainsword, and the Crux Terminatus pauldron.</p>

<p>The Gold Edition, priced at $89.99 on PC and $99.99 on consoles, also provides four days of early access (meaning players would start playing on September 5 instead of 9) and the Season Pass, which will revolve around cosmetics. The $99.99 (on PC; $109.99 on consoles) digital-only Ultra Edition adds the Ultramarines Champion Pack with two unique cosmetics for your Heavy Bolter and Power Armour. Finally, the $249.99 Collector's Edition also includes the Collector’s Case with unique artwork, a finely painted and detailed 8.25 x 6.7" resin statue of protagonist Lieutenant Titus (with two interchangeable heads: with and without the helmet), the game’s official Steelbook, and the 172-page book 'The Art and Making of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2'.</p>

  <p id="Ig3jIz">It’s been decades since games started implementing in-game communication devices that resemble our own real-life phones — and it’s often a successful mechanic for separating and consolidating menus, as well as tracking progress. But recently, I’ve noticed a weird trend: mobile games that are set entirely inside of a simulated mobile device. In other words, phone games where playing them feels like being on your phone. And frankly, I’m over it.</p>
<p id="HLrYqP">Take <em>Guildlings</em>, the very cute turn-based RPG. The game opens with you, a character named Coda, discovering your magical phone (also called a Tome). The phone comes with a purple fairy-like wisp that acts sort of like your avatar to move about the world — when your Tome brings you to new places in Worldaria, you’ll use your wisp to control Guildlings (aka wizards) through battles and exploration. </p>

<p id="WvF9te">The game eventually transitions into these more complex interactions — you can move around, investigate with different items, recruit new Guildlings, and ultimately battle other wisps and wizards — but for the first 15 minutes or so, you’re basically just using a text-like chat on your magical phone to make foundational decisions. It’s... frustrating. And it doesn’t do justice to the game’s otherwise decent gameplay.</p>
<p id="pEbTjq">This chat system carries on throughout the game, and its clunkiness probably doesn’t bother most players. But my patience for my real-life phone is wearing thin, because at this point this thing is more tool and less gadget. When I play a game on it, I want to forget how annoying my phone is to use. Instead, I’m often met — particularly at the outset of a game — with a UI that vaguely imitates the UI of my real phone, but with fewer decisions and less control.</p>
<p id="nraG3G">There are plenty of titles that successfully pull off the design of an in-game phone. Nearly every mystery game I’ve played includes a phone, and it’s not the most exciting part of the game, but it’s often unobtrusive — you usually get notifications triggered by location or plot, and you otherwise don’t need to use the faux phone. In <em>Guildlings</em>, the game <em>is</em> the phone, and for that reason, I have to really try to get into it. Moreover, it’s not the only instance of a clunky phone-within-a-phone game I’ve found.</p>
<p id="nrJpg7">In-game texts in particular feel a bit tired, since this format is ostensibly a much easier way to design game conversations than animating several characters speaking to one another. <em>An Elmwood Trail</em> is an example of this. The game is well written and decently interesting, but it’s primarily set inside faux iPhones that only give you two options for each text you send. For a game, that’s predictable — but for a phone, it’s extremely limiting.</p>

<p id="YVBMjo">In the opening scenes of <em>Elmwood</em>, you’re a detective choosing responses to send to an unknown number that’s trying to blackmail you into solving a case. The conversation is fine, but it ends up being a miss for me because I don’t find it fun to wait for someone to respond to my text. I also wish I could choose between more than two options — we know the technology is out there to put in our own responses and let the game digest and decide what happens next based on keywords we send (looking at you, <em>Scribblenauts</em>). I realize that type of game would be much more laborious to create, write, and design. But something in between the two would be wondrous.</p>
<p id="DEDppo">As <em>Elmwood</em> progresses, you’ll gather other evidence to investigate, and one of the first pieces is another character’s phone. This device has some impressive nuggets of detail that should be celebrated: emails that contain clues, photos of the character’s cat, a Pixabowl (aka Instagram) app.</p>
<p id="XWUJQQ">But this setup falls short for me because it all so closely resembles my real-life phone that it’s almost stressful. Maybe a younger audience finds this <em>more</em> alluring than a game without phones. Ultimately, I’ve found myself wishing developers wouldn’t rely so much on a watered-down version of a real-life item that can do everything to tell their stories. </p>
<p id="Hoa0XH">In <em>Elmwood</em>, eventually you can interact with items on your desk in addition to your device-based evidence. I don’t want to punch down at this game outright, because holistically it isn’t bad — but I do think there’s something uninspired about using incoming texts and calls to introduce the story. Further, I think there’s much more interesting commentary about phones and metagaming to be had. </p>

<p id="BMUnZ5"><em>Reigns</em> is an example of a game that uses elements of smartphone-like UI, but these elements are so piecemeal that the experience is still really enjoyable. Using the “swipe left for no, swipe right for yes” format of lots of dating apps, the game leads you through binary decisions that extend or truncate your reign as king. You can read it a bit as commentary on the way we use dating apps (er, the way <em>you</em> use dating apps — I’m married) — don’t think, just swipe. The game even prompts players to slow down and read to fully understand the implications of their decisions, which sounds like advice plenty of my friends who use dating apps could stand to internalize.</p>

<p id="QVZmyZ">There’s also <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, the steamy RPG with turn-based battles — and a superpower in-game phone. The (very good, very fun) game takes place outside of the device, which is only used for communications between characters and tracking missions. <em>Honkai</em> accomplishes something I haven’t seen elsewhere: The phone UI in this game is better than my real phone. It’s faster with sleeker design and intuitive menus, along with cheeky texts that come as delightful surprises rather than obtrusive notifications.</p>
<p id="Pm6KQR">I’d be a fool to think phones in games are going anywhere, and really, I don’t want them to. But I’m genuinely more enthused by mobile games that create a version of my phone that’s <em>more</em> exciting than the one I use all day every day. Particularly since modern phones are lightning-fast and virtually ubiquitous, I enjoy playing games that synthesize or critique our real-life use of our smartphones rather than replicate it. </p>

            <p>Don't worry, Helldivers – developer Arrowhead has a solution for unscrupulous hosts who are kicking fireteam members from the lobby just before they secure their rewards.</p>
<p>Asked if players could "keep 50 percent of the samples collected if [they] get kicked by an arsehole lobby leader when the dropship has been called" – a fair question given griefing does happen in Helldivers 2 – community manager Twinbeard stressed that a "solution" is on the way.</p>

<p>"We're actually working on a solution to mitigate problems with, well, 'getting kicked by an arsehole lobby leader' as someone once eloquently put it," Twinbeard responded in the game's  Discord community. "No ETA on that, but it's coming."</p>
<p>The inspiration for the suggestion seemingly comes from Deep Rock Galactic, which similarly ensures a player receives 25 per cent of the XP and materials they accrue in the mission, even if they get kicked.</p>
<p>Other suggestions include a reputation system where the Helldivers 2 community itself gives out reputational awards at the end of matches, so good citizens can be matched together and trolls and griefers are forced to played together, too (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/helldivers-2-solution-is-coming-kicked-by-lobby-leaders/">VG.com</a>).</p>

</span></p><p>Helldivers 2 may be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever</a>, but despite its initial success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-sees-huge-drop-in-player-numbers-since-release">player numbers have declined</a>.</p>
<p>A look at the game's Steam charts shows a steady drop since February, when the game launched. According to SteamDB, at its peak in February shortly after launch, there were 458,709 concurrent players. In comparison, its peak over the last 30 days is 166,305. That's a drop of 64 percent.</p>
<p>The most notable explanation as why this has happened could be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">infamous PSN debacle that kicked off earlier this month</a>. At the start of May, Helldivers 2 publisher Sony announced players on Steam would soon be required to link a PlayStation Network (PSN) account to keep playing. This not only resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">swathes of negative reviews from a very disappointed community</a>, but the game was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">pulled from sale in 177 countries where PSN was not available</a>, forcing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony to backtrack on its plans</a>.</p>

First of all, here are the ones you recommended the most often:</p><div><ul><li><a href="https://linktr.ee/coffeegolfgame"><em><strong>Coffee Golf</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> A new five-hole golf course to play every day.

He uses weird, old photography equipment to make truly <a href="https://www.davidimel.com/landscapes/o7hwwreg7jbeseaa5lcpk9ecrc6dia"><strong>gorgeous panoramic photos</strong></a>; he makes great videos going super duper deep into <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSHOf1Wlgpek"><strong>how we talk to each other online</strong></a>; he hosts podcasts and makes videos with the rest of <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fchannel%2FUCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ"><strong>the MKBHD crew</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p></div><p>I asked David to share his homescreen, both to see which of his cool photos he picked as a wallpaper and to snoop on whether he had any cool photography / podcasting apps I didn’t know about. Turns out, he’s pretty minimalist! Here’s David’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:</p><p><strong>The phone: </strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><div><p><strong>The wallpaper: </strong>A picture I took in Ohio while chasing the eclipse on a <a href="https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/gfx100s-ii/"><strong>Fujifilm GFX 100S II</strong> </a>Frankenstein attached to my <a href="https://www.chamonixviewcameras.eu/"><strong>Chamonix 4x5 view camera</strong></a>.</p></div><p><strong>The apps: </strong>Photos, Settings, Viewfinder, Fujifilm Camera Remote, Telegram, Gmail, Pocket Casts, Messages, Arc, Spotify.</p><p>Gotta be honest, I generally use the swipe down to search apps gesture every time I want to use an app. I don’t know if that makes me a psycho, but I only keep a few on the homescreen. The widgets are for my bedroom lights and blinds — all running on Matter. 🤙 I get very little light in my apartment, so the blinds close at 9PM and open at 7AM to help me wake up, and I toggle the lights manually.</p><p><a href="https://viewfinderpreview.opticalaberration.com/"><strong>Viewfinder Preview</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This is my favorite app for shooting film. I mostly use it for my 6:17 and 6:24 120 film cameras, but it’s amazing. You can emulate any film format and field of view, and you can take digital copies to both remember which image you shot and what your settings were. It’s also a light meter and has been super accurate.</p><p><a href="https://fujifilm-dsc.com/en/"><strong>Fujifilm Camera Remote</strong></a><strong>.</strong> I use this to transfer photos from my X100 (my daily camera) to my phone. The new app (Fujfilmi XApp) never works for me for some reason, but the old app still works great.</p><p><a href="https://pocketcasts.com/"><strong>Pocket Casts</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This is probably the most-used app on my phone. I’ve used this app since like 2010 for podcasts, and since I bought it once for $7 way back in the day, I got grandfathered in for a lifetime pro tier once they added a subscription model. It’s a really fantastic podcast app, but I am aware that they hide a lot of features behind a subscription now, which kinda sucks.</p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Farc-search-find-it-faster%2Fid6472513080"><strong>Arc Search</strong></a><strong>.</strong> David, I think you and I are probably both the biggest Arc fans on the internet. The browser is just so delightful, and the desktop app is absolutely incredible for research; segmenting out my work life / accounts / research projects, and spaces is great. I could talk forever about how much I love the actually useful AI features they have in the desktop app like tab renaming, download / file renaming, tidy tab sorting, etc., alongside pinned tabs, the ability to share folders, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>I also asked David to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he shared:</p><div><ul><li>Right now, I’m in the middle of getting a <a href="https://www.filmscanner.info/en/HasselbladFlextightX1.html"><strong>Hasselblad Flextight</strong></a> film scanner up and running. It’s the highest-quality scan you can get outside of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner#Drum"><strong>drum scan</strong></a>, but they’re so old, you have to use a super old Mac for it. My friend Willem Verbeeck <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrKC7h6muOfo"><strong>made a video</strong></a> on it recently.

It weighs 60 pounds.</li><li>I’m a big fan of Casey Newton and Kevin Roose’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/hard-fork"><em><strong>Hard Fork</strong></em></a> podcast. It’s not exactly new, but I think they have a great dialogue, and considering they both cover similar things in their respective publications, the conversations are a great mix of funny, intelligent, and engaging.</li><li>I don’t watch a ton of movies, shows, or YouTube, but I’ve been going back through <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40Vsauce"><strong>VSauce’s channel</strong></a> and watching his old videos just because I really like the style of WHY WHY WHY storytelling.

The whole Boom lineup is great, honestly, but this one’s plenty loud, it’s tiny, it lasts forever, it sounds great, it’s $100. You might be able to beat it on one of those things, but I’ve never found a better “awesome speaker in a tiny box” anywhere. When the weather’s good, mine goes everywhere with me.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Infamous is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, May 26, 2024. Below, we look back at how its focus on traversal paved the way for modern AAA superhero games.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Soaring over a canyon in an Iron Man-like suit of metal armor in Anthem. Swinging through the financial district as a giant Sandman crushes cars below him in Spider-Man 2. Few mechanics in gaming feel as good as superhuman traversal. One of the most electrifying examples of superhero movement came 15 years ago when Sucker Punch launched Infamous.</p><p dir="ltr">Infamous--which was inspired by Batman Begins, Channel Zero, Shooting Wars, and other comic and comic adaptations--put you in control of the electrically powered superhuman Cole MacGrath. The city he fought to protect--or sometimes abuse if you chose that moral path--was also his source of power.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to give you powers that worked well in a video game context, and video games are really good for shooting things, ranged combat," Infamous game director Nate Fox said in a 2009 interview with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-06-09-interview-sucker-punchs-nate-fox-on-infamous-and-inspiration.html" rel="nofollow ">Engadget</a>. "So we figured we'd have a lot of that in the game, and electricity was a good marriage to that because shooting a lightning bolt into somebody's face is something that everybody understands."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4308137-infamous1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4308137" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4308137-infamous1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4308137"></a><figcaption>Cole MacGrath, protagonist of the first two Infamous games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4308137-infamous1.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Outside discharging bolts of electricity, Cole could grind on rails at accelerated speeds, float through the sky using propulsion from his hands, and navigate over nearly any building in Empire City. Infamous's traversal wasn't nearly as fast-paced as Insomniac's later Spider-Man series, but it was also gripping and dynamic. A climbing system similar to the one found in Assassin's Creed underlined everything Cole could do with his powers. It made it feel like every part of the city was scalable--and that's exactly what Sucker Punch was aiming for.</p><p dir="ltr">"We quickly found that electrical powers were super fun and crazy beautiful," Fox said. "After that, we had a ton of development work to do, both building a streaming world and creating a climbable city."</p><p dir="ltr">Empire City was a playground in every way. Buildings were lined with pipes that players could grapple, a railway that Cole could grind ran throughout the city, and rooftops were surrounded by so many climbable objects--power lines, billboards, antennas--that there was never a shortage of routes to take as you flew through the city.</p><p dir="ltr">That achievement was special in 2009 as seamless open worlds weren't nearly as spectacular as what we see in sandboxes today. They had been done before, but something of Infamous's scale was technically impressive as an open-world sandbox that had no slowdown from end-to-end.</p><p dir="ltr">"The urban climbing in Infamous is spectacular," said Sucker Punch co-founder and Infamous programming lead Bruce Oberg in a 2009 interview on the official PlayStation blog. "You can go anywhere you can see, and there are no loading screens. It's truly an open-world sandbox."</p><p dir="ltr">Combining rail grinding and Cole's electrical floating ability was a wonderful way to connect the city and superhero gameplay. The electrical abilities were a natural extension of both the player and the world around them.</p><p dir="ltr">Much like every other major city set in a fictional comic universe, Empire City was loosely shaped to resemble New York City. This was not because of its iconic landmarks or deep history, but because of the influence that Grand Theft Auto 3 had on the team.</p><p dir="ltr">Fox has mentioned multiple times that swinging aimlessly around New York while looking for someone to help was a major point of inspiration for the team. DNA from both games can be seen in the free-flowing gameplay that made Infamous's side missions and collectibles such a joy to complete.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think everybody fired up Grand Theft Auto 3 and thought, 'This game is so cool. I wish I were a superhero in this city!'" Fox said. "I mean it's kind of obvious, right? So, ta-da! That's the game we started to look at and make."</p><p dir="ltr">While Sucker Punch may have been a recognizable name in 2009, Infamous was new to the gaming world. The grungy, gray backdrop of Empire City could have fallen flat if it weren't filled with incredible platforming that's still incredibly fun to play 15 years later.</p><p dir="ltr">The team at Sucker Punch made a jump from making the Sly Cooper series to making a huge, sandbox-style comic-book adventure. Its roots developing a cartoonish and visually colorful platformer with incredibly sharp gameplay shine in how players get Cole McGrath moves around rooftops and highway underpasses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4308153-infamous3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308153" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4308153-infamous3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308153"></a><figcaption>Cole wreaks havoc.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4308153-infamous3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"What we really [wanted] to do is come up with our equivalent, and I am not in any way likening our work to Miyamoto's, but we need our Zelda to the Mario," said Sucker Punch co-founder and Infamous producer Brian Fleming in an interview with <a href="https://www.aol.com/news/2009-03-25-gdc09-an-infamous-interview-with-sucker-punchs-brian-fleming.html" rel="nofollow ">AOL</a>. "We need a title that works better earlier in the lifecycle of the game, of the platform, we need something that is a good complement, that brings out different skill sets that we have, but is similar enough that the technology you build and things could be brought forward into a Sly game someday."</p><p dir="ltr">Little did Fleming, Fox, and Oberg know in 2009 that Infamous would go on to become a cornerstone of Sucker Punch much like Sly Cooper. Its sequels built on its amazing traversal mechanics and made Infamous a beloved name in open-world superhero game design--even if the last entry, Second Son, released in 2014. Fans have been clamoring for a new entry or remake every year since.</p><p dir="ltr">"We developed a bunch [of] different pitches and the idea of doing a superhero comic sort of universe," Fleming said. "It kind of felt like a half step away from that, but still played off some of the strengths in terms of art, and presentation and all that, so you know, you start talking about it, and then we had a lot to learn about doing realism and character design, and play control with real people. It took a long time. It's a journey."</p><p dir="ltr">Traversal is the most important element in open-world game design and Infamous is one of the earliest games to make superhuman movement the core gameplay. Insomniac's Spider-Man--one of the most celebrated superhero games of the last decade--shares DNA with Sucker Punch's latest Infamous game, Second Son.</p><p dir="ltr">Iteration is a huge element in how the entire game industry--not just a single game or series--gets better. Infamous was one huge step in improving how it feels to control a superhuman in a sandbox. While Cole may not be as notable as Peter Parker or Bruce Wayne, he's a big part of why it feels so good to swing, parkour, and fly around the big city in dozens of other games.</p>

<p>Neil Druckmann was recently targeted in the media for a quote recorded in an interview with Sony. Per the statement, he made a bold claim that his next project would ‘redefine the mainstream perceptions of gaming.’ This caused dissent on social platforms, with many believing that Druckmann was getting too big for his britches and trying to make himself look like some God of Gaming, capable of altering the paradigm with a single release.</p>



<p>However, the man himself recently appeared on Twitter (X) with a copy of the interview’s transcript, setting the story straight and confirming that he was effectively misquoted because of ‘edits of his rambling answers.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-truth-will-out">The Truth Will Out</h2>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187395279253837" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In his post on Twitter</a>, Neil Druckmann revealed that he was indeed misquoted by Sony, but it was mostly because his answer to a particular question was lengthy and spun off into a few tangents here and there. He did speak boldly about his next game, stressing that he ‘can’t talk about it our (his) bosses will get very mad,’ and he did say that he’s excited to see how the world will react to the ‘incredible moving experience’ Naughty Dog is creating, but he didn’t use the words ‘redefine the mainstream perceptions of gaming’. </p>



<p>The transcript that Druckmann revealed on Twitter was juicy, though. He said that the developing title is something ‘fresh’ for Naughty Dog and that it’s the ‘most excited’ he’s been for a project <strong>ever</strong>. That’s hugely important, as the passion that was poured into both The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part II was unparalleled, producing a multi-award-winning series that went on to become one of the most widely beloved live-action adaptations ever made. </p>



<p>The closest Druckmann came to Sony’s quote was:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think it just kind of opens the eyes of a bunch of people that just weren’t aware of the kind of experience that exist in games … People even outside of gaming are looking at us to see what it is that we put out next.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It isn’t known what Naughty Dog is cooking at the moment, but recently, the team <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-officially-cancelled/">cancelled a planned multiplayer project</a> that would have been set at the heart of The Last of Us’ universe.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wrecked-finally-launches-with-fallout/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fortnite has finally launched Chapter 5: Season 3, "Wrecked," and with it come the new unique points of interest and skins for all you madmen out there.</p>
<p>Well, instead of going through the long patch notes released by Epic Games, we'll give you guys a rundown of what to anticipate with the new season. As always, the new Wrecked season brings exciting in-game content for gamers, this time focusing more on a post-apocalyptic theme, fitting the likes of Fallout (<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-enters-fortnite-in-chapter-5-season-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as previously teased</a>), with the Brotherhood of Steel's T-60 Power Armor being the most iconic Battle Pass skin.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the Mad Max-esque map changes first, though. The developers said that a "sandstorm" struck Fortnite Island, creating a new biome on the south side called the "Wasteland." With that, the game sees the inclusion of three new POIs: the Redline Rig refinery, Nitrodrome arena, and Brutal Beachhead operation base, all complementing the Wasteland theme. Below is the new map with the added Wasteland biome, making the island bigger than ever.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Moving on, Fortnite has added new consumables and collectives under the "Nitro" collections, where gamers have access to "Nitro Splash" and "Nitro Barriers," both of which give a severe boost in moving speeds when applied to moving items such as players and cars. When applied to a player, Nitro allows much faster movement, explosive bashing power, higher stamina, quick reloading speeds, and fall damage immunity, giving you the feeling of a madman.&nbsp;Nitro for cars allows fast movement, lesser fuel consumption, and explosive ramming power.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>What's a season without new weaponry? Well, Fortnite has catered to this perfectly by adding interesting weapons, with the first of them being Nitro Fists, which allows you to perform a 3x punch combo and give a "meteoric" impact when you aerial punch the ground. Nitro Fists will have a total of four chargers, with each recharging after eight seconds. Along with that, another weapon is the Boom Bolt, or in simple words, a madman's crossbow. It's a fast-firing crossbow that shoots explosive bolts, and by the looks of it, it does seem like a pump shotgun with a bow attached, or maybe I am missing the old days.</p>
<figure>

<p>Nuke Cola and Kind Cacti are interesting additions to the health department, with Nuke Cola responsible for restoring little health and shields immediately. At the same time, Slurp Cacti heals you when you hit it with your pickaxe after multiple times, even while in a car as well.</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>Finally, we also have new vehicles and vehicle mods, all revolving around the Wasteland concept. We'll drop the list for vehicle mods below, but the addition of War Bus is something interesting to discuss. They are driven by patrollers on the island, and two of them are present on the battlefield. Each of them features a cannon on top, along with a horn that comes with an EMP pulse, damaging nearby targets and reducing their health and shields.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Machine Gun Turret</strong>&nbsp;(roof slot): Have a passenger fire a machine gun while someone else drives!</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Grenade Launcher Turret</strong>&nbsp;(roof slot): Some would call this littering, but the Grenades will get rid of themselves by exploding.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Spiked Bumper</strong>&nbsp;(front bumper slot): Deal more damage to players and objects on impact.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Cow Catcher</strong>&nbsp;(front bumper slot): Boost your ramming power and give your car some defensive armor.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Bulletproof Tires</strong>&nbsp;(tires slot): Tired of tire poppers? Make your tires indestructible!</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Chonkers Off-Road Tires</strong>&nbsp;(tires slot): Make your car more off-road friendly. Especially useful if you’re not driving an SUV!</em></li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<p>Here are the new Battlepass Skins, which will unlock once you level up the pass:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The Machinist</strong>&nbsp;(unlocked right away!): Control your fire.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Rust</strong>: Shred the wasteland.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Peabody</strong>: Phil, Earl, and Axle. Three peas in a podcoat.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Ringmaster Scarr</strong>: Rule the chaos. Run the destruction.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>T-60 Power Armor</strong>: Courtesy of the Brotherhood of Steel.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Brite Raider</strong>: Drive fast. Burn bright.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Megalo Don</strong>: Nitro-fueled apex predator.</em></li>
</ul>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-reference-design/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-next-will-be-a-%E2%80%9Creference-design%E2%80%9D-for-manufacturers-to-make-their-own-devices-%E2%80%93-rumor.881757/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-reference-design/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xbox Next is going to be a very different gaming device compared to its predecessors, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>According to Windows Central's <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1794219028598153613">Jez Corden</a>, Microsoft's next-generation console will likely be a reference device with a heavy Windows slant for manufacturers to make their own devices, like the Surface Pro 11 is a reference device for AI PCs. This would be a huge departure from the previous Xbox consoles, as it would essentially make it a PC that could potentially run Steam games as well, and thus even the former PlayStation exclusives available on Valve's digital store like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-comparison/">Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-this-month/">God of War</a>.</p>
<p>Jez Corden using the Surface Pro 11 as an example is very interesting, as it was rumored earlier this year that the Xbox Next development is being led by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generation-xbox-surface-team/">Surface team</a>. The next Microsoft console is also said to be released in multiple SKUs, including a handheld one that will be capable of running games natively while also supporting cloud gaming.</p>
<p>As of now, very little is known about the Xbox Next other than that it is in the works and that it will deliver the "<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/">largest technical leap"</a> ever seen. How this will be achieved remains to be seen, but it is likely that <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-xbox-next-ram-storage/">software and storage advancements will play a big part in it</a>, as simply doubling specs, such as RAM, would not be economically viable.</p>

<p>It was recently reported that Bungie has won a lawsuit against Phoenix Digital (Aimjunkies) after alleging that the cheat provider infringed on a copyright. This is far from being the first time that a case like this has unfolded, but per Stephen Totilo, it could be a worldwide first that a jury has had to step in to settle the claim.</p>



<p>With Phoenix Digital filing a counterclaim and stressing that Bungie failed to prove a copyright infringement, it was left to a jury to pass the ultimate verdict – and they ruled in favour of Bungie.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-making-history">Making History</h2>



<p>Destiny is just like any other multiplayer-based game when it comes to cheaters – there’s a constant slew of malicious operators making their way into the game’s ecosystem and disrupting the ‘legitimate players’. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1792660056435200497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Stephen Totilo’s earlier report</a> filed on May 20, it was revealed that – potentially for the first time – a jury would decide the outcome of a copyright claim by a publisher against a cheat provider. That came about because of Phoenix Digital’s standpoint that Bungie was the malicious party in this debate.</p>



<p>In just a few days, that case has been wrapped up, with the jury siding with Bungie. Even though the compensation wasn’t substantial – sitting at just $63,000 – it’s an industry-first result that will go down in the history books. Phoenix Digital has already stressed that it will be appealing the jury’s decision based on a claim that Bungie ‘illegally accessed their computer systems.’</p>



<p>Totilo <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1794154042190700617" rel="nofollow">forwarded a statement</a> that was handed to him by Bungie’s lawyer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are grateful for the diligence, professionalism, and care exercised by the Judge, his staff, and the Jury. We’re committed to our players and will continue to protect them against cheats, including taking this and future cases all the way to trial.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In recent months, the number of developers and publishers filing claims against cheat providers has risen sharply. Activision Blizzard has been a key player in this realm, taking on all comers and – in most cases – receiving a default verdict that often results in multi-million-dollar reparation orders being documented.</p>



<p>Despite these efforts, the number of people cheating in video games seems to be rising.</p>

<p>Deadlock is widely rumoured to be Valve’s next title, a third-person, hero-based shooter rooted in a multiplayer-focused, lore-rich universe. In recent weeks, we’ve seen more than 100 leaks hit social media and content-sharing platforms worldwide, with the quality of said leaks improving over time. From full-fledged gameplay edits to walkthroughs of the character library, a stunning amount of content has been pulled from Deadlock – but Valve has yet to formally acknowledge that the game exists.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-might-as-well-be-here">It Might As Well Be Here</h2>



<p>Some of the gameplay edits that have surfaced on platforms like Twitter (X) have featured scenes that look remarkably well-polished. The earliest leaks from Deadlock looked drab and disappointing, but it’s believed that – despite dropping mere days ago – they were from a much earlier build of the game. Here’s an example of the most recent Deadlock leaks that have been turning heads on social media:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Once known as Neon Prime, Deadlock has evolved, turning from more of a sci-fi title to something that’s a diverse mix of various aesthetics. In the game, there’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-all-characters-in-valves-deadlock/">a range of characters</a> that float between an array of themes, from robots to Victorian police officers and from traditional monsters to ethereal warriors. With obvious inspirations from Team Fortress 2 leaking through to the surface, Deadlock could be a solid contender to the likes of Overwatch 2. </p>



<p>However, despite all this information and content appearing online, Valve has yet to recognise that the game <strong>exists</strong>. It isn’t known when it’ll be released, but the expectation <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-details-on-valves-new-game-deadlock/">is that it’ll drop in 2025</a>. These playtests that are causing most of the leaks to surface are seeing plenty of positive feedback about a game that’s cleaning up very nicely.</p>



<p>Will you be playing Deadlock?</p>

<p>On June 2, ASUS will release the ROG Ally X, the next iteration of the substantial handheld device that turned heads almost a year ago. It emerged as a solid competitor to Valve’s Steam Deck but boasted Windows 11 as an OS, which meant it could theoretically play ‘more games’. However, the high-priced handheld failed to hit the mark with a wide audience because of a few key drawbacks – but the ROG Ally X features some new internals designed to tackle those issues.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-same-but-different-but-still-the-same">Same – But Different – But Still The Same</h2>



<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/the-rog-ally-x-leaks-with-twice-the-battery-of-the-original-and-way-more-ram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to recent leaks</a>, the ROG Ally X will feature a battery twice as powerful as the one found in the ASUS ROG Ally, launched almost a year ago. That was one of the biggest flaws of the handheld, and playing a top-tier game on ‘Turbo’ mode would leave players with a device that died within around 40 minutes. The 40Wh battery in the original model has been replaced with an 80Wh battery in the ASUS ROG Ally X. </p>



<p>Further, ASUS has cast away the original 16GB of RAM and jammed in 24GB of LPDDR5 RAM, which should boost the device’s gaming performance dramatically. It was suggested that the original AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip would remain unchanged, and the touchscreen – which was also a sticking point for players – would be the same as the one in the original unit. Some minor changes have reportedly been made to the outer shell, such as a smoothing of rougher edges and tactile introductions being made to the buttons. </p>



<p>It’s expected that the ASUS ROG Ally X will retail for around $800. If ASUS has truly addressed the shortfalls present on the ASUS ROG Ally, this could be a killer handheld that dominates the ever-growing market.</p>

<p data-characters="301" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While <em>XDefiant</em> has had a few errors and glitches after finally launching, most fans agree that it’s a pretty solid shooter, even if the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiants-weapon-progression-is-criminally-slow-and-fans-want-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">progression system is absolutely pants</a>. However, some issues persist, and players have found that one of the strangest bends bullet arcs if you jump too much. </p> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">Jump spamming is a pretty big problem in <em>XDefiant</em> at the moment. A player’s hitbox seems to become smaller or just harder to hit with gunfire when they’re moving, so you can be almost invincible if you sprint for the perfect amount of time. Jumping works a treat, too, but now that appears to have its own problem, and it is bizarre. Not only does it increase your crosshair size, it makes shotgun bullets fly sideways out of the barrel.</p>
 <h2 id="h-if-you-jump-too-much-in-xdefiant-your-shotgun-will-fire-left-and-right-not-forward" data-injectable="false">If you jump too much in <em>XDefiant</em>, your shotgun will fire left and right, not forward</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="true">Fans on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XDefiant/comments/1d08sla/is_shotgun_spread_working_as_intended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>XDefiant</em> subreddit</a> have been discussing this issue at length because they can’t work out if it’s intentional behavior or not. User bopchara demonstrates what happens to a shotgun’s bullet spray after you’ve jumped so much that the weapon’s crosshair is as big as it possibly can be. While I’d expect to see some shots veer off to the side a little, shooting directly left and right feels like a joke. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="800" data-injectable="true">Bullets shooting to the side of the barrel is obviously not how any weapon is designed to work in a first person shooter, and I’d be surprised if that wasn’t a glitch here. However, as user Billy3King points out, “It could also be to stop people from jump spamming, just a thought.” Herein lies the trouble. We don’t know if crosshairs are meant to behave this way, widening with every jump to deter jump spamming or if it’s a glitch that’s yet to be fixed. </p>
 <h2 id="h-is-this-an-issue-or-a-design-choice" data-injectable="false">Is this an issue or a design choice?</h2> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">I jumped into the game to test this for myself and got the same results that others are reporting. If I jump to maximize the crosshairs with any weapon other than a shotgun, I can still land pretty accurate shots in front of me. With a shotgun, I can barely see any bullet holes where my shots have landed because they fly around me instead of toward the intended target. </p> <p data-characters="638" data-current-count="1010" data-injectable="true">Ubisoft will almost certainly address this in a future <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-may-24-update-patch-notes-practice-zone-enemy-health-bar-glitch-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>XDefiant update</em></a>, but user SuttonTM points out that making shotguns suffer more than any other weapons might be intentional. “It’s almost certainly not intended to be that wide, but shotgun’s they have to be very careful with when it comes to adjusting because if they become OP they will easily become the most annoying gun to play against and ruin fun in modes like Hard Point etc, just look at the Akimbo Shotguns <em>CoD</em> recently had like a month back, required no skill to one shot people just by looking at them essentially, and ruined the flow of the game.”</p>
 <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="false">It’s hard to argue that shotguns can ruin a shooter if they’re overpowered. I remember playing <em>Destiny 1</em> and using the good old slide and shotgun or shotgun and melee tactics while they worked in Crucible. For now, all I can suggest is that you don’t jump spam in <em>XDefiant</em> so you can avoid an embarrassing encounter when an enemy is up in your face and your shotgun showers them in a glorious halo of pellets before they end you with a single pistol shot to the skull. </p>

<p data-characters="345" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Helldivers 2</em> has inspired players from launch day with its incredible visuals and gameplay that makes you want to drop into just one more mission all through the night. Fans have created all sorts of artwork that bring its gritty battles to life, but oil and canvas might be the perfect medium for depicting what is now <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-has-entered-a-second-galactic-war-after-players-failed-to-kill-enough-automatons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Second Galactic War</a>. </p> <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">Since <em>Helldivers 2</em> was initially launched in February 2024, I’ve seen players make some incredible fan art. From the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/incredible-helldivers-2-fan-film-nails-the-feel-of-every-mission-in-just-over-60-seconds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gritty film that portrays the tension of being inside a Hellpod</a> before deployment onto the battlefield to Terminid miniatures that would look at home in <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cz4e16/check_out_my_recent_helldivers_2_oil_paintings_on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit user WriterSafe9019</a> has set a new standard for incredible <em>Helldivers 2</em> art with their oil on canvas series that brings to life the elation and fear of spreading managed democracy around the galaxy. </p>
 <h2 id="h-helldivers-2-oil-on-canvas-paintings-breathe-new-life-into-the-game-s-hellish-war-torn-landscapes" data-injectable="false"><em>Helldivers 2</em> oil on canvas paintings breathe new life into the game’s hellish, war-torn landscapes</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via WriterSafe9019 on Reddit</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true">The four oil on canvas paitings by Reddit user WriterSafe9019 were posted on the <em>Helldivers 2</em> subreddit, where they’ve recieved understandable praise. While there’s the usual collection of democratic Officer-approved responses and references to these being painted with oil produced from dead Terminids and Automatons, there’s also genuine appreciation for the work. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">User ALargeTuna commented that, “These are great! love the feel of 1 and 3 the most. great scenes and mood.” I agree with the first image being one that stands out, but I prefer the last one over the third because it’s reminiscent of the Anchorage Memorial ion <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-review-fallout-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 3</a></em>, as well as real statues dotted around the world that memorialize wartime events. </p>
 <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false">In fact, I’d go so far as saying they make <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s chaotic battlefront look beautiful. From these images alone, you wouldn’t know that Helldivers blast down from ships in orbit and step out into swarms of giant bugs and metal monstrosities that want to tear them limb from limb. </p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true">They all make Helldivers look heroic, which is absolutely how the game makes you feel while playing. They also dodge the mayhem that ensues when several Dropships start bombarding your squad or the crushing sadness of watching a Pelican fly away with your team just as you were diving toward the open door to join them.</p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">I think the whole series is the perfect translation of real wartime paintings we have in museums like the <a href="https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/10-paintings-of-wartime-london" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UK’s Imperial War Museum</a> today. Artists of the time captured moments they saw both in the heat of the moment during terrifying air raids and long after certain events because of the images etched in their minds. </p> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="false">While <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s warfare is obviously restricted to our screens, some battles have been pretty damn harrowing. You only need to mention Malevelon Creek to get some players to shudder with fear, but even in those horrible moments there is beauty to be found and isolated within canvases like these. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/which-mad-max-movies-do-you-need-to-see-before-furiosa.881640/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/which-mad-max-movies-do-you-need-to-see-before-furiosa/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=which-mad-max-movies-do-you-need-to-see-before-furiosa<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="381" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the long-awaited release of <em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em>, the overall <em>Mad Max</em> franchise has once again been thrust into the mainstream spotlight. The series started its engine way back in 1979 with director George Miller’s <em>Mad Max.</em> Since then, it has become a multimedia juggernaut recognized the world over and beloved for its unique look and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-weirdest-and-wildest-characters-in-the-mad-max-universe/">many weird and wild characters</a>.</p> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">At the same time, just because it has a colorful cast and a sprawling world doesn’t mean the <em>Mad Max</em> franchise is perfect. The lore and overall timeline is a bit confusing, and there’s a lot of ground to cover with ancillary media like novels, video games, and comics. Therefore, it can appear daunting for those new to Miller’s post-apocalyptic creation. </p> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="652" data-injectable="true">If you’re one of those newcomers who was beckoned by the chaotic, action-packed <em>Furiosa</em> but doesn’t want to watch <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mad-max-movies-order/">every single <em>Mad Max</em> movie in order</a> to prepare, here’s what you should watch at the very least before checking out Miller’s latest creation.</p>
 <h2 id="h-mad-max-fury-road-makes-for-a-good-starting-point" data-injectable="false">Mad Max: Fury Road makes for a good starting point</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image vis Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="777" data-injectable="true">Released in 2015, <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> is a hard-hitting, visually-stunning watch. It centers on Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy), who gets swept up in a feud between the vile ruler of the Citadel, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), and Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). This marks her first appearance in the <em>Mad Max</em> series, and between the action, drama, and worldbuilding the film brings, it’s quite an impressive one. After all, it got <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kojima-has-seen-mad-max-four-times-because-he-is-right-and-good/">Hideo Kojima to go see it four times.</a></p>
 <p data-characters="608" data-current-count="608" data-injectable="true">In terms of the <em>Mad Max</em> timeline, <em>Fury Road</em> takes place years after <em>Furiosa</em>, so there’s an argument to be made that it should be saved for after a <em>Furiosa</em> screening. However, giving it a watch first can make <em>Furiosa</em> a more interesting viewing. Knowing the title character and who she ultimately becomes ahead of time adds a layer of intrigue to her origin story. It can be rewarding to know her final form and watch what she goes through to reach it. Think witnessing Anakin Skywalker’s journey to become Darth Vader in the <em>Star Wars</em> prequels decades after the completion of the original trilogy.</p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">Not to mention, if you’re a bit unsure if what you’re getting into stylistically with <em>Furiosa</em> is for you, <em>Fury Road</em> is similar in aesthetic and tone. It can act as a good primer in that regard as well. If you like what <em>Fury Road</em> has to offer and want more, then you can go scratch that itch with <em>Furiosa</em> afterward.</p> <h2 id="h-the-original-mad-max-trilogy-is-optional" data-injectable="false">The original Mad Max trilogy is optional</h2> <figure data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">There’s no denying the pop culture influence and overall science fiction awesomeness of the original Mad Max trilogy. <em>Mad Max</em>, <em>Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior</em>, and <em>Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome</em> are all worth a watch decades after their premieres, and Mel Gibson’s rendition of Max Rockatansky remains iconic. With that said, these movies aren’t all that essential to one’s viewing of <em>Furiosa</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="470" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="true">The main reason why you can watch <em>Furiosa</em> without having seen the <em>Mad Max</em> trilogy is time. <em>Furiosa</em> and <em>Fury Road </em> are set in the mid-21st century, with the original trilogy spanning the mid-1980s to somewhere between the late 1990s to the early 2000s. These sets of films are so far apart chronologically and their casts are so radically different that, in terms of the core narrative, passing on the trilogy won’t impact your understanding of <em>Furiosa</em> much at all.</p>
  <p data-characters="514" data-current-count="514" data-injectable="true">Then again, what if you simply want to learn as much about the lore of this universe as possible? Well, you might still be better off skipping the trilogy, or looking at it as its own entity. Whether the first three <em>Mad Max</em> movies truly are in the same continuity as <em>Furiosa</em> and<em> Fury Road</em> remains a hot topic. Miller hasn’t shared a concrete verdict, and fans continue to debate if Gibson and Hardy are the same Max, if they’re related, or if the name is more of a mantle passed from person to person. </p>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">All of that is to say that ahead of <em>Furiosa</em>, you <em>could</em> watch all of the existing <em>Mad Max </em>movies to prepare if you so desire. If you’re seeking narrative cohesion and nothing more, though, your best bet is to stick with <em>Fury Road</em> alone. It ties in the closest to <em>Furiosa</em>, forming a highly entertaining duology with it.</p> <p data-characters="63" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false"><em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga </em>is now playing exclusively in theaters.</p>

The landmark decision may be the first time a jury has agreed that a cheat creator violated a gaming company’s copyrights.</p><p>Yesterday’s jury decision awarded Bungie (<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24689095-bungie-v-phoenix-digital-group-jury-decision?responsive=1&amp;title=1">PDF</a>) a tidy sum of $63,210. Bungie counsel James Barker said in a statement emailed to <em>The Verge</em> that the company is “committed to our players and will continue to protect them against cheats, including taking this and future cases all the way&nbsp;to trial.” </p><p>In 2021, Bungie sued AimJunkies and four defendants (here’s a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.300479/gov.uscourts.wawd.300479.1.0.pdf">PDF</a> of the complaint), alleging, among other things, that they hacked <em>Destiny 2</em> to copy the code used to make cheats. Some of Bungie’s complaints — like that AimJunkies violated a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201">DMCA provision</a> forbidding circumvention of copyright protection tech — went to arbitration and saw <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/bungie-wins-4-3-million-award-against-cheat-seller-in-arbitration-230220/">Bungie winning $4 million</a>. AimJunkies appealed after the judge confirmed that award. That appeal is still in process, as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161935/bungie-destiny-2-cheating-jury-trial-aimjunkies"><em>Polygon </em>wrote this week</a>. </p><p>Phoenix Digital founder David Schaefer will move to dismiss the jury’s verdict and appeal it if necessary, <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1794156492784087319">according to Totilo</a>. However that shakes out, the verdict is significant, given that cheating lawsuits tend to conclude in other ways, like settlements. (For example, a judge <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/take-two-grand-theft-auto/us-judge-blocks-programs-letting-grand-theft-auto-players-cheat-idUSL1N1V71ZK/">shut down a <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> cheat distributor</a> in 2018 following a Take-Two Interactive lawsuit, or when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/17/23172558/destiny-2-bungie-cheat-settlement">Bungie settled</a> another cheating lawsuit in 2022 for $13.5 million.)</p><p>The win may only mean pocket change for Bungie, and it won’t likely put an end to online cheating, but it does put a jury on record about the legality of creating such cheats. That makes this more significant than the pocket-change-for-Bungie $63,000 award lets on. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bungie has won its court battle against cheat and mod site, AimJunkies.</p>
<p>As reported by journalist Stephen Totilo, AimJunkies, aka Phoenix Digital, was instructed to pay the Destiny 2 developer $63,210 in damages – that's the revenue the company is thought to have earned selling the cheats – setting a new precedent in what's thought to be the first lawsuit wherein a jury has ruled on a game-cheating case.</p>

<p>The jury threw out AimJunkie's countersuit that Bungie had illegally accessed one of its computers, but founder David Schaefer says they will "fight this" and appeal the verdict.</p>
<p>"We are grateful for the diligence, professionalism, and care exercised by the Judge, his staff, and the Jury," Bungie's lawyer, James Barker, told Totilo.</p>
<p>"We're committed to our players and will continue to protect them against cheats, including taking this and future cases all the way to trial."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>$63,210 in damages, to be specific</p><p>To my knowledge, this is the 1st time a jury (in the U.S., possibly the world) has ruled on a game cheating case.</p><p>With this, we now have a jury verdict that supports game companies' frequent claims that cheats like these infringe on copyright <a href="https://t.co/qvDhFwq0zK">pic.twitter.com/qvDhFwq0zK</a></p></div>— Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1794155396065800511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>This isn't the first time Bungie has favourably settled a lawsuit. Back in July 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-wins-lawsuit-against-destiny-2-player-following-racist-harassment-and-threats-to-employee">the studio won a lawsuit against a player who repeatedly harassed, threatened, and doxxed one of its employees</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Tropical Haze, the developer of open-source Switch emulator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">Yuzu, agreed to pay $2.4m in damages to Nintendo</a> and cease all operations in response to the Mario maker's recent lawsuit.</p>

<p data-characters="349" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Magic: The Gathering </em>is packed with a wide variety of creatures whose identities revolve around their abilities and how they fit into a deck’s strategy. No matter what set you started playing MTG during, you’ve certainly seen cards that contain words such as <strong>Flying</strong> or <strong>Haste</strong> which provide abilities to the card they’re printed on. </p> <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">Some of these cards have “reminder text” printed along with them that gives a brief explanation as to what the words mean. Unfortunately, not every card has enough room to include rules for each Keyword Ability– especially those that contain multiple abilities on a single card.</p> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true">There are currently 18 evergreen Keyword Abilities in MTG. These are abilities that are commonly printed in new releases and have spent years of playtesting to earn their lifetime spot in the TCG. Overall, there are 170+ Keyword Abilities in MTG. Most of them are exclusive to particular sets due to their theme (Ninjutsu or Bushido) or have been banned from the game entirely (Ante). </p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">While Wizards of the Coast tend to introduce new Keyword Abilities into <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/magic-the-gathering-ever-set-released/">every <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> release</a>, knowing the evergreen Keyword Abilities and the rules associated with them will get you through 90% of MTG without issue.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/new-ghost-in-the-shell-anime-is-targeting-2026-release/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=new-ghost-in-the-shell-anime-is-targeting-2026-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="136" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Studio SARU and Production I.G have just unveiled a teaser for an upcoming <em>Ghost In The Shell</em> anime, titled only <em>The Ghost In The Shell.</em></p> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">The original <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> is based on the manga of the same name, and this new project seems to be a new adaptation of that. New media in the <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> franchise isn’t necessarily a rare thing, though, with the franchise spanning multiple animated adaptations, video games, and even an infamous Hollywood movie that starred Scarlett Johansson. </p> <figure data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="TVアニメ『攻殻機動隊（仮）』特報｜2026年放送｜THE GHOST IN THE SHELL" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ix7QURhM7jE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">The project is being helmed by Studio SARU, which recently made <em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off</em> for Netflix, a reimagining of the classic comic that earned critic and fan acclaim for its bold and refreshing take on the beloved story and characters. </p> <p data-characters="189" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true">Will we be seeing a similar approach with the new <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> adaptation? Fans are already speculating we could be looking into something similar to <em>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.</em></p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i cant believe they're making ghost in the shell brotherhood. not something i neccesarily want but i guess i shall be seated. i'm curious at the very least</p>— yuuko from nichijou (@headfallsoff) <a href="https://twitter.com/headfallsoff/status/1794393622948794423?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="183" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">Will Studio SARU pull off something incredible, or will it go the safe route? The teaser doesn’t reveal much, so we might be looking at a couple of years of intense speculation.</p>
 <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">Despite various other adaptations taking a stab at the story, the original <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> film is still considered the best outing in the franchise and is one of the most beloved works of sci-fi in history. Even if you haven’t seen the original movie, you’ve seen one of the hundreds of properties inspired by it. Though it came out in 1995, it hasn’t aged a day, and its story is still a poignant and relevant tale backed by some of<em> </em>the best — if not the best — animated sequences in the history of Japanese animation.</p>
 <p data-characters="137" data-current-count="137" data-injectable="false">The new <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> anime will hopefully land in 2026, but you can currently watch the original <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> on Prime Video.</p>

<p data-characters="250" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We’re all in love with the wasteland of Fallout thanks to the new Amazon Prime TV show and the graphical update to Fallout 4, but budding Wasteland Wanderers can find plenty of ghoulish joy in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/top-5-games-that-should-get-a-ttrpg/">these five TTRPGs</a> that explore post-apocalyptic worlds.</p> <h2 id="h-gamma-world" data-injectable="false">Gamma World</h2> <p data-characters="548" data-current-count="548" data-injectable="true">An absolutely wild game of acid-green nuclear nonsense, Gamma World has been around since the 70’s. Its most recent incarnation, a boxed set from Wizards of the Coast based on the 4th edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, is sadly no longer available in print, though you can still get it in pdf. It was filled with the same joyful chaos as Fallout, with mutated animals, treacherous wastes and an enjoyably cartoonish sense of humor. The 4th edition rules, while controversial at the time, find an excellent implementation in this tactical RPG.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"> <figure><figcaption>A typical day in Gamma World. Image from Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </figure> <h2 id="h-apocalypse-world" data-injectable="false">Apocalypse World</h2> <p data-characters="534" data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true">The big daddy of all Powered by the Apocalypse games since, Apocalypse World leapt onto the scene ready to blow people’s minds in 2010. The striking black and white images, the fast rules that constantly pushed the story forward, and the leading questions that empowered players to share the responsibility for building the world have been hugely influential. Apocalypse World has had an undeniable impact and inspired many other games, including the more community-focused apocalypse narratives of Legacy: Life Among the Ruins.</p>
 <h2 id="h-fallout-the-rpg" data-injectable="false">Fallout: The RPG</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Fallout RPG - How To Play" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WnklTH6aQbM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="811" data-injectable="true">Of course we had to mention Modiphius’s Fallout TTRPG. Based on their own 2d20 system and now supported by a vast array of gorgeously-produced books, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-fallout-game-ranked-best-to-worst/">Fallout RPG is stuffed with references to the classic and modern video games</a>. Solve problems with your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats, target hit locations in a callback to the VATs system, and delve into a deep scavenging system. You can also get Virtual Tabletop (VTT) versions of most products produced by Modiphius, and the art evokes the setting perfectly.</p>
 <h2 id="h-rifts" data-injectable="false">Rifts</h2> <p data-characters="980" data-current-count="980" data-injectable="true">Gamma World and Fallout are weird, but Rifts? Rifts is really, really weird. While it takes itself a little more seriously than many post-apocalyptic settings, it is also a perfect example of pure unadulterated 90’s TTRPG strangeness. The original TTRPG, published by Palladium, had more than fifty supplements for different parts of the worlds, dimensions and big events in the setting. It was also a completely unique post-apocalyptic setting in which the apocalypse was rifts to other dimensions filled with sci-fi monsters that bordered on the eldritch. Earth was divided into massively detailed factions and many places had returned to idealised sci-fi tinged versions of mythological eras, such as the griffin-riding cyberknights of England, and the dinosaur swamp that took over parts of the east coast of the United States. Pinnacle Entertainment created Savage Worlds Rifts using the well-loved Savage Worlds system, and so the absolute weirdness of Rifts lives on.</p>
 <h2 id="h-mutant-year-zero" data-injectable="false">Mutant: Year Zero</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Mutant Year Zero Tabletop RPG Release Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9jk7UBlwUPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="617" data-current-count="917" data-injectable="false">Based on a TTRPG from the 1980s, Mutant: Year Zero from Free League literally empowers the player characters with bizarre mutations and places emphasis on exploration as well as building a home base. Mutant: Year Zero combines the dark humor of Fallout with the grim horrors of the STALKER series of games, creating a world where the player characters are constantly escaping by the skin of their teeth but still get to throw fireballs. Overstretch your resources and you’ll have to risk more to restock, and the question becomes: what’s worth fighting for in a world where everyone is out for themselves?</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24164149/atlas-jennifer-lopez-director-brad-peyton-mech-design</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/respect-to-the-director-of-netflix%E2%80%99s-atlas-for-thinking-deeply-about-mechs.881562/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24164149/atlas-jennifer-lopez-director-brad-peyton-mech-design<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="h5sLC0">A lifetime of scarfing down sci-fi, video games, and comic books brought director Brad Peyton to the job of said lifetime: directing Jennifer Lopez in a frickin’ mech-suit movie. Signing on for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24099465/netflix-atlas-jennifer-lopez-scifi-movie"><em>Atlas</em></a>, now streaming on Netflix, was an easy yes: With two big-budget Dwayne Johnson vehicles under his belt, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/11/17226498/rampage-movie-review-the-rock-dwayne-johnson"><em>Rampage</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/2/18/11052008/san-andreas-sequel-dwayne-johnson"><em>San Andreas</em></a>, Peyton was no stranger to A-list-driven spectacle. Still, the film was an intimidating prospect for someone with a deep appreciation for mech suits, mech tanks, oversized mecha, and all the made-up classifications in between. </p>
<p id="x0xVvh">“I was <em>very</em> aware of what had come out ahead of me,” Peyton tells Polygon. The director cites James Cameron’s <em>Aliens</em> and <em>Avatar</em> as obvious but undeniable milestones in the art of on-screen mechs. He knew that the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/24/13377822/titanfall-2-review-xbox-one-PC-ps4-playstation-4">Titanfall games</a> put pressure on any new live-action attempt, having created full immersion into the experience of mech fighting. But when he started imagining how to rethink mechs, he returned to the first piece of mecha media that really blew him away: Stuart Gordon’s <em>Robot Jox</em>. </p>
<p id="HUqXkg">Peyton can’t quite explain why <em>Robot Jox</em> was his holy grail, but in talking to him, it’s obvious: Like Gordon’s whiz-bang vision of the future, where Earth’s conflicts are settled by colorful mech duels, <em>Atlas</em> needed clear, well-defined logic that would ground the world-building, but also let him rip in the action department in a way that would delight his inner child. And at the end of the day, he needed to be original.</p>
<div id="sxLCIQ"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P4QghULoUfE?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="M5yS4I">“My biggest thing was: I knew I had to separate from everything,” Peyton says. “I had no interest in repeating. I said, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2017/10/7/16441340/pacific-rim-uprising-daredevil-punisher-netflix">Pac Rim</a><em>’s [mechs] are </em>this<em> big. In </em>Avatar<em>, they’re </em>this<em> big. In </em>Titanfall,<em> they’re </em>this<em> big. So mine is gonna be </em>this<em> big. This one might be square and blocky, so mine is gonna be circular.</em> I come from animation. So a lot of it started with me sketching the silhouette and figuring how to make it unique and different.” </p>
<p id="1jzDQC"><em>Atlas</em> takes place in a relatively sunny future that still exists in the shadow of an impending apocalypse. Decades earlier, a rogue artificial intelligence named Harlan (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22633102/shang-chi-review"><em>Shang-Chi</em></a>’s Simu Liu) fled Earth for an alien planet with the intent of one day returning to lay waste to humanity. When scientists discover Harlan’s whereabouts, Terran forces launch a mission to take the fight to the robot army’s doorstep. Leading the charge: Atlas Shepherd (Lopez), a data analyst recruited to go full Jack Ryan on Harlan’s ass. Of course, the attack doesn’t go as smoothly as the Earthlings would hope, and Atlas has to begrudgingly click into an AI-powered mech suit in order to survive an alien planet populated with androids who want her dead.</p>
<p id="8oXSlo">The grounded futurism of <em>Atlas</em>’ Earth led Peyton and his creative team to extrapolate from current military tech for the mech design. Rounded edges and exhaust pipes are lifted from F-18 planes. The interior control panels were built for theoretical functionality. </p>
<p id="DqkJj1">“I had to understand all the tech from the inside out,” Peyton says. “Because of my experience on <em>San Andreas</em>, where I had to understand how a helicopter worked intimately to tell Dwayne what buttons to press and not to press — at least when he would listen to me! — I took that experience and wanted to make a similar experience for [Lopez]. I laid it out with the art department of why there are screens in certain places, why there are holograms in other places. And then on the day, I’m giving her little wires to be like, ‘That’s what this screen is. That’s where the screen is.’ So after going through the blocking, I pulled those away, and she had to memorize where they were.”</p>

<p id="8tKG0K">Drawings and schematics were only half of the equation. After drafting a design, Peyton set out to make his vision come to life. Coming at it from an animation background, that meant animating various walk cycles to see if the bipedal machine could move the right way.</p>
<p id="sfoGct">“The first couple of designs we had when we animated them to see how they would work — very basic animation, walk, run, walk, jog, run cycles — looked so clunky and terrible,” Peyton says. The animation team found a groove when they clarified the dynamic between man and machine. “[The mechs] are intuitive devices. The concept that I came up with was, the soldier is the brain. He doesn’t have to be super strong. He’s not like a grunt — the machine is the grunt. He is the emotional cognitive device that syncs with this thing. So it has to be able to be as fluid as a person who’s been trained in it.”</p>
<p id="anlxlU">As Atlas traverses the biomes of Harlan’s base planet — from snowy tundras to swamps inspired by Peyton’s love for <em>Return of the Jedi</em> — the film’s hero loosens up on her “no AI” stance and forms a cognitive link with her mech’s digital interface. Like a twist on the buddy-cop movie, the two bond for survival, which presents itself as more fluid mech motions. Early on, Atlas might be bumbling around a rocky cliff. By the end, she’s running, rolling, and slapping the hell out of robot assailants with mech-fu. The early walk cycle tests came in handy for the dramatic evolution, which Peyton was able to program into an enormous soundstage gimbal rig that stood in for the mech suit. Lopez was surprisingly well suited for the demands of the mech choreography. </p>
<p id="2JGjOb">“Her background as a dancer is what allowed her to really gauge that quickly,” Peyton says. “As much as she looks like she’s walking, [the mech] is walking her, and she has to react like she’s walking. So that training as a dancer allowed her to step right into it.”</p>

<p id="FD5xmE">It also helps that Lopez routinely performs for thousands all by her lonesome on a stadium stage. Peyton says <em>Atlas</em> turned out to be one of the most demanding shoots of his career, simply because for six to seven weeks, it was just Lopez performing solo on a gimbal rig that would be completely painted over with plate shots, VFX environments, and bursts of other action sequences shot elsewhere. Occasionally, voice actor Gregory James Cohan would dial in to perform the dialogue of Smith, her AI companion. </p>
<p id="92spoJ">All the prep work required to realize a mech with the capacity for real action, and clicking in a star who was up to control it, was in service of jolting the audience, says Peyton. The first time we see the mechs in action isn’t in an act of valor; they’re caught in an ambush, mid-flight. The carrier ship goes down — and so does Atlas, in her rig. Peyton’s imagination swirled at the possibilities, as evidenced in the finished sequence. “[The mech] would be tumbling, it would be spinning, it would be hit by debris. What would it be like to be trapped in that tin can? What would it sound like? What would it feel like? And once I get through that experience, well then, how can I up the ante? Well, what if I fall through black clouds, and I’m falling into basically a World War II dogfight, but with mechs and drones? [...] That’s just the first, I don’t know, 20 seconds of a two-minute sequence.</p>

<p data-characters="533" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The High Republic era of <em>Star Wars</em> is fascinating since it depicts a golden age of peace, long before the events of <em>The Skywalker Saga</em> that would see the Jedi culled and the galaxy dragged into seemingly never-ending war. And yet it faced its own hardships and galaxy threatening perils never been before in other <em>Star Wars</em> media. There are numerous novels that tell stories set during the 500 or so years the High Repulic era lasted for, and we’re here to help break down how you can read all of them and in the correct order.</p> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">For context, the High Republic era is divided across three phases, with each one set during a specific period of time: <em>Light of the Jedi</em>, <em>Quest of the Jedi</em>, and <em>Trials of the Jedi</em>. Each phase isn’t wholly comprised of books (there are comics and audio dramas too), but we will be focusing on the novels.</p> <h2 id="h-phase-1-light-of-the-jedi" data-injectable="false">Phase 1: <em>Light of the Jedi</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Disney</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true"><em>Light of the Jedi</em> ran from January 2021 to March 2022, and consists of two separate trilogies (one for adults and another for young adults), as well as a collection of short stories and a series of novels for children. There are a couple of books for very young children, but we’ll be leaving those ones out since they’re simple adaptations of two of the novels. Here is the recommended reading order:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-chris-chibnall-episodes-of-doctor-who-ranked/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=10-best-chris-chibnall-episodes-of-doctor-who-ranked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="212" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Chris Chibnall is perhaps the least prolific writer of the current generation of <em>Doctor Who</em>, with only 38 episodes to his name as writer. However, what he lacks in numbers, he makes up for in epic storytelling.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">Chibnall was the showrunner for most of the episodes featuring Jodie Whittaker as the first female Doctor, but he also wrote some great episodes featuring Matt Smith and David Tennant. I personally love Chibnall’s storylines and feel like they’re underrated, so here’s my top 10.</p> <h2 id="h-10-42" data-injectable="false"><strong>10. 42</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="585" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false">42 is the first episode of <em>Doctor Who </em>ever to be written by Chibnall and also the first mention of Saxon, who went on to be the next Master.</p> <p data-characters="470" data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true">This is an interesting episode because it’s the only one in the history of <em>Doctor Who</em> that has ever played out in real-time. The Doctor, played by a baby-faced David Tennant, has just 42 minutes to save the SS Pentallion from its imminent collision with a star. Not only is it full of tension, but the title of this episode is a reference to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and, more specifically, the answer to the ‘what is meaning of life?’ in the book.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-9-rosa" data-injectable="false"><strong>9. Rosa</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="701" data-injectable="true">Co-written alongside Malorie Blackman, Rosa revolves around the story of Rosa Parks and her now historic refusal to give up her seat on the bus during times of racial segregation. When the Doctor and her companions discover that a ‘rehabilitated’ mass murderer is attempting to alter the course of history, they must throw themselves into action to maintain history and keep things on track.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="137" data-current-count="137" data-injectable="false">I personally love any episode which features a significant historical moment, so this one is definitely up there in my favorite episodes.</p> <h2 id="h-8-arachnids-in-the-uk" data-injectable="false"><strong>8. Arachnids in the UK</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">There aren’t many episodes of <em>Doctor Who</em> that will see me having to shield myself with a pillow between myself and the TV, but thanks to the fact that I have arachnophobia, Arachnids in the UK is definitely one of them.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">Despite that, though, I love this episode. Maybe it’s the adrenaline it causes to surge within me, but I think there’s more to it than that. This is the episode during which Graham, Yaz and Ryan decide to go on adventures with the Doctor, launching them into a whole universe of experiences they never dreamed of.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-7-dinosaurs-on-a-spaceship" data-injectable="false"><strong>7. Dinosaurs on a Spaceship</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">Imagine you, as an ordinary person with no knowledge of aliens or interdimensional travel, were suddenly dragged into the world of <em>Doctor Who</em> and thrust into the center of the action. That’s essentially what happens to Rory’s Dad, Brian, during Dinosaurs on a Spaceship and his reactions during this episode perfectly reflect his bewilderment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true">For anyone who’s also a fan of Harry Potter, you can’t help but imagine Mark Williams, who plays Brian, in his role as Arthur Weasley meeting<em> </em>The Doctor<em> </em>and traveling through space alongside Egyptian Queen Nefertiti. It’s such a weird crossover that nobody asked for, but I cannot express quite how much I love this episode. Plus, it’s Matt Smith, the perfect chaotic good, and he gives the perfect “he said the thing!” moment.</p>
 <h2 id="h-6-fugitive-of-the-judoon" data-injectable="false"><strong>6. Fugitive of the Judoon</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">I love seeing places in beloved TV shows and being able to say, “hey, I’ve been there!” and Fugitive of the Judoon offered me that, being set in Gloucester. Besides that, though, this episode is an introduction to the Fugitive Doctor, who pops up in cameo roles moving forward and provides a small hint to the Doctor’s past long before it’s truly revealed in Timeless Children.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="149" data-injectable="false">On top of that, Captain Jack Harkness makes a return in this episode, and any episode featuring him is a winner in my book. Beware the lone Cyberman.</p> <h2 id="h-5-the-woman-who-fell-to-earth" data-injectable="false"><strong>5. The Woman Who Fell to Earth</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="288" data-injectable="false">As a female Whovian, I have to admit that I was both excited and apprehensive when I heard that the next Doctor would be played by Jodie Whittaker. However, as soon as she appeared on screen and took up the mantle, I knew that she would be incredible as the Doctor, and I was right.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="514" data-injectable="true">The Woman Who Fell to Earth is also our introduction to new companions – Graham, Yaz, and Ryan. Not only is this the inaugural outing of the first female Doctor, but it’s also a lesson in love, loss and perseverance.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-4-spyfall" data-injectable="false"><strong>4. Spyfall</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true">Spyfall was the two-part opening episode to season 12 of <em>Doctor Who</em>. These episodes see the return of the Master, this time played by Sacha Dhawan and a small but pivotal role played by Stephen Fry.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="329" data-injectable="false">My favorite thing in these episodes, though, is the humor injected by Ryan and Graham trying to figure out their stolen spy gadgets. Seeing Bradley Walsh, who played Graham, dancing as he tries to figure out how his laser shoes work is one of my favorite moments from the entire season and never fails to put a smile on my face.</p> <h2 id="h-3-flux-war-of-the-sontarans" data-injectable="false"><strong>3. Flux: War of the Sontarans</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="629" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="true">This episode is a beloved favorite of mine. It’s got everything I could ever want from an episode of Doctor Who – humor (John Bishop is an excellent comedian, and seeing him hit a Sontaran over the head with a Wok is great), threat (the potential erasing of the history of Humanity and Yaz being held hostage by Azure and Swarm), and some history thrown in for good measure (the Doctor working alongside Mary Seacole during rewritten Crimean War).&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false">Honestly, all six episodes of the Flux storyline are amazing. Sadly, I can’t include all of them in my top 10 because that would be cheating, but if I were to recommend any Chris Chibnall episodes, it would be the ones that are part of Flux.</p> <h2 id="h-2-the-timeless-children" data-injectable="false"><strong>2. The Timeless Children</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true">This episode has proved to be something of a dividing factor in fans. Some swear by it as a perfectly logical progression in Doctor Who canon, while others consider it a retcon, going back on the established lore that the Doctor only had a limited number of regenerations. However, whichever side of the fence you’re on, you can’t deny that Timeless Children is an incredibly hard-hitting episode.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="223" data-injectable="false">Seeing the Doctor trapped in the Matrix, with parts of her past that she doesn’t remember shown to her, it’s difficult to imagine how that must feel. But, her monologue aimed at the Master is inspiring to say the least:</p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true">“You think you’ve broken me? You’ll have to try harder than that. You’ve given me a gift. Of myself. You think that could destroy me? You think that makes me lesser? It makes me more. I contain multitudes more than I ever thought or knew. You want me to be scared of it because you’re scared of everything. But I am so much more than you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-1-the-power-of-the-doctor" data-injectable="false"><strong>1. The Power of the Doctor</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="714" data-injectable="true">The Power of the Doctor has everything – a questionable Dalek with a suspect plan, a sad goodbye to John Bishop as Dan, the return of the Master in the guise of early 19th century Russian mystic Rasputin alongside his Cybermasters, the return of former companions Tegan and Ace, and the glorious return of David Tennant as the 14th Doctor. I mean honestly, what more could you want from a <em>Doctor Who</em> episode?</p>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">I have to admit, I don’t think any of the Masters have managed to come across quite as unhinged as Sasha Dhawan’s portrayal. He plays the part, and for a brief time, the part of the Doctor, with the perfect level of chaotic, overpowered insanity.</p> <p data-characters="144" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">And on top of all this, the first ever meeting of Companions Anonymous. What I wouldn’t give to be a fly on the wall in one of those meetings.</p>

<p>With the upcoming Summer Game Fest featuring exclusive news and reveals from the likes of Xbox, Ubisoft, Nintendo, Devolver, and others, we’re left wondering about Sony. They fully intend to host their usual State of Play; it’s just a matter of when. So, here’s what we know about the PlayStation showcase this summer!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-playstation-showcase-take-place">When Does the PlayStation Showcase Take Place?</h2>



<p>While there is no official date for the PlayStation Showcase, better known as State of Play, rumors indicate it will coincide with Days of Play, a massive sale focusing on PlayStation Plus and consoles, sometime this coming week. It’s said that Days of Play takes place on May 28, perhaps May 29, and the PlayStation Showcase would either launch at the same time or shortly after.</p>



<p>It doesn’t surprise us that Sony wants to host its showcase before everyone else, especially considering that Xbox will showcase its upcoming titles during Summer Game Fest in June.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-games-will-we-see-at-the-playstation-showcase">What Games Will We See at the PlayStation Showcase?</h2>



<p>There is no official confirmation about the numerous upcoming games we’ll see at the PlayStation Showcase. However, rumors indicate the following titles will make an appearance:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Concord</strong></li>



<li><strong>LEGO Horizon Adventures</strong></li>



<li><strong>Astro Bot</strong></li>



<li><strong>God of War Ragnarok (PC)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</strong></li>



<li><strong>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, we’re pretty sure there’s something new coming from one or more first-party studios over at PlayStation. Sony desperately wants to maintain its lead in the gaming space, and a new reveal or two could help cement its position!</p>



<hr>



<p>There’s much to look forward to this summer, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-ubisoft-forward-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Forward</a> occurring in early June. If you don’t want to miss a single game reveal, don’t forget to subscribe to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

            <link>https://www.destructoid.com/the-5-best-fantasy-sci-fi-novellas-from-the-past-5-years/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-5-best-fantasy-sci-fi-novellas-from-the-past-5-years</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-5-best-fantasy-sci-fi-novellas-from-the-past-5-years.881541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-5-best-fantasy-sci-fi-novellas-from-the-past-5-years/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-5-best-fantasy-sci-fi-novellas-from-the-past-5-years<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="283" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Novellas have had an&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;resurgence over the past few years. Perhaps we have finally grown weary of the long, multi-book epic.&nbsp;Perhaps&nbsp;we&nbsp;just&nbsp;want bite-sized works to read in the middle of our busy lives. Whatever the case, I’m having a great time because of it.</p> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">As a wizened elder in his&nbsp;mid-30s&nbsp;with a young child who would put and eat many dangerous things in his mouth if I wasn’t watching, novellas provide me with works&nbsp;that I&nbsp;can read in one sitting when given the chance. Beyond that, they also&nbsp;provide&nbsp;some of the best writing&nbsp;you’re likely to&nbsp;find anywhere.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">Novellas force authors to be more efficient with their writing, fighting a ton of work into a&nbsp;little&nbsp;space. As such, many novellas include some of the hands-down best writing on a technical level I’ve ever seen. Don’t believe me? Here are some of the best novellas from the past five years. Give one a read and tell me if I’m wrong. </p>
 <h2 id="h-what-moves-the-dead-by-t-kingfisher" data-injectable="false">What Moves the Dead&nbsp;by T. Kingfisher</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true">This novella can be classified as several things, as it also ends up in horror sections in many stores. A retelling of Edgar Allen Poe’s <em>Fall of the House of Usher</em>, Kingfisher uses incredibly vivid descriptions and a tense atmosphere to create an unforgettable experience. It almost feels like cozy horror, with a slight sci-fi twist that I won’t spoil.</p>
 <p data-characters="498" data-current-count="498" data-injectable="true">It should be no surprise that Kingfisher’s novella reads well. She won the Hugo for another of her books, <em>Nettle &amp; Bone,</em> just last year. Her characters in this novella are&nbsp;wonderful, memorable, and fleshed out, with bits and pieces of their backstory scattered throughout like little lore nuggets. For fans of Poe, lovers of solid character, or even those who&nbsp;just&nbsp;want to dip their toes into horror without it being too horrific, <em>What Moves the Dead</em> is a fantastic choice.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Elder Race by Adrian Tchaikovsky</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="601" data-injectable="true">Fans of sci-fi novels should be aware of Tchaikovsky’s works. His <em>Children of Time</em> series has been a critical darling, winning award after award.&nbsp;Still, for those who want to give his works a try before starting his&nbsp;larger, more dense sagas, <em>Elder Race</em> would be a great place to start.</p>
 <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">To set the stage, we’ll first discuss another author. Arthur C. Clarke, author of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, penned an essay that listed his three laws of science fiction. Perhaps the most memorable is the third: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. <em>Elder Race</em> is that law turned directly into a novella.</p> <p data-characters="750" data-current-count="1089" data-injectable="true">The novella is a story told from two&nbsp;perspectives,&nbsp;one of a person who&nbsp;was told stories of a great wizard who lives high up on the mountain&nbsp;and once saved her people, whom she must now call upon again, and that wizard, who is really just an off-world researcher who puts himself into cryosleep for a decade or so before waking up to collect data with satellites and drones.&nbsp;Watching&nbsp;these characters try to interact, discuss technology, or even just how they perceive situations so&nbsp;differently&nbsp;is fascinating.&nbsp;Pair that with an endlessly&nbsp;cool&nbsp;sci-fi antagonist, if it can be called that, turns the novella into a two-perspective thriller that makes one consider more about the genres of sci-fi and fantasy and what they may have in common.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">This&nbsp;is How You Lose the Time War by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Simon and Schuster</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="702" data-injectable="true">This&nbsp;is the most breathtakingly beautiful book on this list. It almost isn’t fair. The prose in this book is unmatched,&nbsp;a&nbsp;masterful work that should prove to many that sci-fi is a genre to be taken seriously in the literary world. Written by two authors, the novel takes the form of messages sent between two opposing agents in a time war, fighting to make their future the future.</p>
 <p data-characters="535" data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true">Calling them messages doesn’t even do them justice. These are notes left in the dust of dying stars, taunts&nbsp;etched into cave walls to be read thousands of years&nbsp;in the future. The weft and weave of these characters and their relationship as they move through time is stunning, touching, and unforgettable. I won’t say too much more, as to do so would just be me continuing to gush, but if you’re a reader who likes prose-heavy works&nbsp;from time to time, you won’t find a better one than this.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Empress of Salt and Fortune&nbsp;by Nhgi Vo</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true">I&nbsp;straight up&nbsp;don’t understand how Vo accomplishes what she does with this one. I finished reading this and felt like I had just finished reading a worldbuilding epic, with a&nbsp;huge&nbsp;and expansive setting built and fleshed out that encompassed so much. Then I looked back and realized the book was only 120 pages long with a big font.</p>
 <p data-characters="742" data-current-count="742" data-injectable="true">For&nbsp;those who are still fans of fantasy epics but would like to try a novella, this is the go-to choice.&nbsp;The story follows an exiled Empress and her handmaiden, with all the information about the world provided to us either in the form of a story or second-hand as it&nbsp;is told&nbsp;to our characters. Despite this, the world Vo builds&nbsp;is well thought out, provided to us using such&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;means. The pace of this one will be fast, as the information has to&nbsp;be provided&nbsp;constantly as the story&nbsp;is told, but if you can hold on, this book achieves something that no other novella I have read&nbsp;does;&nbsp;matching the worldbuilding of any Sanderson or Jordan book in just over 100 short pages.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Ring Shout by P. Djèlí Clark</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="757" data-current-count="1057" data-injectable="true"><em>Ring Shout</em> is cool, culturally informative, and historically revealing, making it an incredibly dense novella. But, despite this density, there’s still some time for good old demon slaying. <em>Ring Shout</em> takes place in 1922 America, where the movie <em>Birth of a Nation</em>, the movie that single-handedly sparked the rebirth of the KKK, is being shown across the nation. However, the members of the KKK aren’t always flesh and blood. Something that feeds on hate has traveled through the stars and found our planet, where they found enough hate to sustain them among the members of the KKK. In response, fighters&nbsp;are trained&nbsp;to take them down, seeking to put an end to both the KKK and whatever pushes them forward from the edges of our cosmos.</p>
 <p data-characters="541" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="false">Part look at the black cultural experience in early 1900s America, part action demon shooting devil slicing action, part Lovecraftian horror, <em>Ring Shout</em> tells&nbsp;an awesome&nbsp;tale with a deep level of historical credibility that brings it a step further. For those looking for a viewpoint into African American history and culture, who want a bit of revisionist history with some otherworldly horror mixed in, or&nbsp;just&nbsp;want to read about sick-ass freedom fighters taking a shotgun to some demons, <em>Ring Shout</em> will get you there.</p>

			<p>Gaming in general and AAA gaming in particular are going through a rough patch. While 2023 was a stellar year when it came to well-received AAA releases, the constant rise of game budgets (with Marvel's Spider-Man 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-facing-cuts-playstation-may-close-another-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored to have cost $300 million to make</a>) is literally eating into the margins of publishers and developers alike. In February 2024, Sony Chief Operating Officer (COO) and SIE interim Chairman Hiroki Totoki explicitly <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-wants-to-improve-operating-profit-with-a-more-aggressive-pc-first-party-games-release-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> a more aggressive multiplatform release plan on PC would have to be enacted to improve the operating profit.</p>
<p>For its part, Microsoft, through Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, has <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-gaming-ceo-phil-spencer-is-confident-in-xboxs-future-but-stresses-the-need-to-find-new-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that the industry needs to find new customers and get back on a growth trajectory. Meanwhile, Microsoft has started releasing some of its exclusive games on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch consoles, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-announcement-rumor-xbox-games-showcase-medieval-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more possibly on the way.</a></p>
<p>Amidst all these shifts, the hardest part has been witnessing the record-breaking number of layoffs in 2024. AAA developers like <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-11-of-workforce-shuts-down-riot-forge-to-refocus-on-core-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Riot</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-lays-off-8-of-playstation-workforce-london-studio-closed-guerrilla-naughty-dog-insomniac-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Electronic Arts</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-lays-off-5-of-its-workforce-cancels-some-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take-Two</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEGA</a>, and, of course, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-announces-restructuring-program-crystal-dynamics-says-its-not-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Embracer Group</a> have laid off many thousands of employees to reduce costs. Most recently, Microsoft also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed</a> three internal Bethesda studios: Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog Games.</p>
<p>We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/xcoms-jake-solomon-qa-building-a-narrative-driven-life-sim-game-at-midsummer-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had the chance to interview Jake Solomon</a>, who worked for over 22 years at Firaxis Games on AAA franchises like Sid Meier's Civilization, XCOM, and Marvel's Midnight Suns. While the main topic was his new studio, which is working on a narrative-driven life simulation game, we also asked his opinion on what's happening in the industry.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about the state of the industry following all the layoffs? Is the doom and gloom warranted?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Honestly, it’s terrible. Too many people have lost their jobs, and it’s incredibly frustrating. It’s been nice to actually hire folks these last few months. The last few months have been terrible for a lot of folks, and hopefully, as Midsummer grows, we can provide a great studio home for some of them.</em><br>
<em>It’s a tough market right now. There are these incredible, over-the-top AAAA games that are impossible to follow. You also see amazing AA niche games that are more focused and successful. AAA sits in this awkward middle ground where it’s very expensive but hard to cover costs.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>In many cases, we've seen budgets double or triple between one installment and the next one in a series. Should developers and publishers rein in budgets to avoid these mass layoffs?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>I’m wary of telling other folks how to run their business. But I can tell you what we’re doing at</em><br>
<em>Midsummer. We want to make games in a small, collaborative atmosphere. We want to remain</em><br>
<em>independent. All of those things require that we stay relatively small, act and spend our money</em><br>
<em>in a sustainable manner, and make careful decisions on how we produce our games.</em></p>
<p>Do you believe AAA gaming to be in real trouble, or is this just a temporary phase? Let us know in the comments and through the poll below.</p>
