		<p>Just last week, TinyBuildGames and developer Fire &amp; Frost announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/13/of-ash-and-steel-will-launch-on-november-6th/">Of Ash and Steel would launch on November 6th,</a> but what a difference a week makes. However, after some more testing the development team has discovered some issues that need additional work, so Of Ash and Steel will not make the November 6th date as planned. The delay is not too long though, with Fire &amp; Frost confirming that the new date is now November 24th.</p>
<p><iframe title="Of Ash and Steel - Steam Next Fest Demo and Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EHDPSRpxF1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, the team wrote, <em>“Right now, we are in the active phase of testing the game before its release, making sure your journey across the island will be as smooth and bug-free as possible. Originally, we announced that your adventure would begin on November 6. However, during testing, our teams discovered several issues that require more time to fix than we initially expected. We’ll need a few extra weeks to properly address these issues. The new release date for Of Ash and Steel is now November 24th, 2025.</em></p>
<p><em>Announcing the release date was one of the most exciting and nerve-wracking moments of development, because deep down we feared something like this might happen at the very last moment. And… it did! Hopefully, you haven’t booked your vacation around the release just yet. We sincerely apologize for this short delay, and hope you’ll understand our decision. Finally, for those who haven’t tried the demo yet — good news! It will remain available for a while longer, so you still have time to step onto Grayshaft and experience the first hours of your adventure. Thank you for your support, and we’ll see you (just a little later) on Grayshaft!”</em></p>

<p>Steam Next Fest was a success for Of Ash and Steel with the demo being one of the best performing demos, and the game has now been wishlishted over 220,000 times. The game is being billed as an old school RPG where players will explore the Kingdom of the Seven without mission markers or overt quest guidance. The demo features part of the main quest, side missions, professions, and upgrades.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="f7323ddf36ebf"><a title="Legends Z-A 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f7323ddf36ebf/legends-z-a-1.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>There’s been quite a lot of talk recently about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-is-it-about-time-game-freak-added-voice-acting-to-pokemon">lack of voiceover work</a> in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, and I can understand why. Game Freak has made some pretty decent strides with its cutscenes, depicting characters that animate realistically right down to their facial expressions and mouth movements. Yet they don’t actually talk. It’s weird in practice to see such well-constructed scenes play out in near total silence, but that’s actually not my biggest gripe with the residents of Lumiose City.</p>
<p>If you go into a real-life busy city centre in the middle of the day, one thing you’ll notice is that most people will probably be walking somewhere. Whether they’re darting from shop to shop, slowly ambling along in chattering groups, or even taking a few steps backwards to pick up the sausage that’s slipped out of their hotdog bun, everybody’s moving. Heck, it’s the reason why cities are often described as ‘bustling’ – it literally means ‘full of activity’.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59hywpov&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Not in Lumiose City, though, oh no. You take a stroll through Legend: Z-A’s environment, and you’d be forgiven for thinking Medusa had run amok and turned almost everybody to stone. They just stand still, and it’s <em>so</em> <em>creepy</em>, man.</p>
<figure data-uuid="02291a5c99b34"><a title="Legends Z-A 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/02291a5c99b34/legends-z-a-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Erm... Hello? Anybody alive? — <em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, I want to acknowledge right off the bat that this isn’t a new thing; NPCs have always been averse to movement in Pokémon games. But there’s just something about Z-A that makes it more noticeable than ever. My theory is that because Lumiose City is the only major environment, anything that detracts from its sense of place is immediately more glaring. You could almost forgive previous entries for similar infractions because their towns and cities were simply part of a much larger world. Here, the city <em>is</em> the world.</p>
<p>There are so many people, too. I’ve honestly never seen a wider selection of NPCs in a Pokémon game, and the fact that 99% of them stand completely still makes for some seriously weird, unsettling imagery. They're not just on pavements too, but in the roads, sitting down for a sip of coffee (not actually drinking though), or standing on the grass, facing in seemingly random directions. It’s like that scene from M. Night Shyamalan’s cult classic <strong>The Happening</strong> where everyone suddenly stops dead in the middle of the street (I’m joking about the ‘cult classic’ bit – it’s a stinker).</p>
<p>I know everyone’s made a big fuss about the buildings in Z-A, and I get it, they’re pretty awful. But in my opinion, you can get away with quite a lot if you actually make it seem like your environment is busy with activity. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADY4LTn7TNA">Go back to the first 3D GTA games</a> if you don’t believe me. The cities there may look pretty crude by today’s standards, but of the few pedestrians and vehicles that those games are able to handle in one go, the majority of them are moving in some way. It makes a huge difference.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e2f97d24045ec"><a title="Legends Z-A 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e2f97d24045ec/legends-z-a-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Let's just ignore that sadist on the right, hm? — <em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s not just an aesthetic thing, either. One of the biggest mechanics introduced in Z-A is the ability to sneak up on your fellow trainers and land a move on their Pokémon before they’ve even had a chance to respond. So if I can do that, why can’t they? It would make navigating the Battle Zones so much more interesting and engaging if I knew that an NPC could get the drop on me at any moment. It’s yet another indication that in the world of Pokémon, you’re the hero, and everyone else is just surface dressing.</p>
<p>I’m not completely down on Legends: Z-A. I think the overall structure of having specific zones for catching and battling is quite interesting, and the character customisation is frankly the best it's ever been. But man, I’m so tired of these games feeling so lifeless all the time. Its environments are supposed to convey a sense of excitement and positivity, and I just feel like I’ve been plunged into the middle of a horror movie.</p>
<p>I don't know... Maybe I've been spoiled by games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a>. Or maybe Game Freak needs to get a grip and start making its worlds feel a bit more alive. It's not much to ask, right?</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Am I crazy in thinking this, or do you agree? Should more NPCs in Pokémon games actually start moving and living their lives, or are you happy for them to just stand around and wait for you to interact with them? Let me know with a comment in the usual place.</em></p>

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/">Escape From Duckov</a>, a duck-filled top-down PvE play on Escape From Tarkov, has had a stunning commercial launch with more than 1 million copies sold in its first five days, developer Team Soda and publisher Bilibili Game have announced.</p>



<p>This duck-focused game arrived on Steam almost exactly a month ahead of Escape From Tarkov's Steam arrival, <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-release-date-announced/">which is currently set for November 15</a>. Escape From Duckov arrived on October 16 on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and the Mac App Store.</p>



<p>"<em>Team Soda is incredibly humbled to have reached such heights, and we owe this success to an incredible community of players and our friends at BiliBili Game</em>," said Jeff Chen, producer on Escape From Duckov at Team Soda. "<em>Whether you have been with us through our early days promoting the demo on Steam or are just joining to see what all the quacking is about, thank you.</em>"</p>

We're Armed. | Escape From Duckov - OUT NOW! 🦆" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ewmV79zP5XQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>At the time of this writing, Escape From Duckov is one of the trending games on Steam, and one of the most played games right now, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3167020/charts/">per SteamDB</a>. Once Escape From Tarkov is out on Steam next month, it'll be interesting to see how both games fare.</p>



<p>Of course, they serve different audiences. No one is looking to Escape From Duckov for the kind of experience that Escape From Tarkov delivers. Still, it'll be fun to see if the parody is ever able to surpass the concurrent player count of the original, once we can see their numbers on a somewhat even footing, since there will surely still be plenty of Tarkov players who don't use the Steam version to launch the game. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-865-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-thursday-october-23.1332079/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Today’s NYT Connections puzzle is a mighty forgiving one, but that doesn’t mean you don’t still want some handy hints to make things <strong>even easier</strong>. It’s almost the weekend, and, understandably, you might want to give your brain a bit of a rest today.</p>



<p>With that being said, I’ve got the latest NYT Connections hints and solutions for you below, so that you can get the fastest answers possible for today’s puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-23">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 23)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #865:</p>



<ul>
<li>DOGGY</li>



<li>FINE</li>



<li>PRIZE</li>



<li>SWAG</li>



<li>STONE</li>



<li>KITTY</li>



<li>BALL</li>



<li>DUCKY</li>



<li>BIRDIE</li>



<li>GO</li>



<li>SWELL</li>



<li>PURSE</li>



<li>MIXED</li>



<li>POT</li>



<li>PUCK</li>



<li>DANDY</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These words all describe things going delightfully well, in a retro kind of way.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each of these can refer to a collection of winnings, often in games or competitions.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>You’ll find one of these in curling, another in badminton, and the rest in other Olympic sports.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word completes a common phrase ending in “bag.” Think dogs, surprises, and party favors.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 23.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-23-865">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 23 (#865)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– DANDY, DUCKY, FINE, SWELL</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – KITTY, POT, PRIZE, PURSE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BALL, BIRDIE, PUCK, STONE</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – DOGGY, GO, MIXED, SWAG</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>But it came out in October!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="b1abdb464219d"><a title="Galaxy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b1abdb464219d/galaxy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We knew <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> for the Switch would be popular, but according to the latest figures from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3rvn5ljlo25">Circana's Mat Piscatella</a>, the game topped the best-selling titles on Nintendo platforms in September.</p>
<p>Wait a minute... September? But it launched on 2nd October, right? Yes, that's right. But according to Piscatella's accompanying chart, the data is recorded from 31st August 2025 to 4th October 2025, so Galaxy and Galaxy 2 fell just within the relevant time period.</p>

<p>Looking at the new releases specifically, we've got the aforementioned Galaxy and Galaxy 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA SPORTS FC 26</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</a>. Nintendo's re-release managed to beat all of them, and this is even considering the fact that Nintendo doesn't share digital data, so this was achieved through boxed sales alone.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ws0BZJ-l_eg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed626890uowptk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>A good result, then, despite some vocal backlash online. It's Mario, y'know? It'll be interesting to see where things stand next time, but we're fully expecting Pokémon Legends: Z-A to top the charts for the month of October.</p>

			<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">Ubisoft RedLynx put out a statement today</a> that it was laying off up to 60 members of its staff in a restructuring to focus on "<em>small screens</em>," one of the teams that you could argue is one of Ubisoft's jewel studios for the Snowdrop Engine alone, Ubisoft Massive Entertainment, <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1981020343587258732">released a statement confirming its own restructuring,</a> and that it has launched "<em>a voluntary career transition program</em>," which is essentially giving employees a chance to take themselves off the board while still receiving proper severance and support.</p>



<p>"<em>As part of our ongoing evolution and long-term planning, we have recently realigned our teams and resources to strengthen our roadmap, ensuring our continued focus on The Division franchise and the technologies, including Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect, that power our games,</em>" the statement begins.</p>



<p>"<em>To support this transition responsibly, we have introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.</em>"</p>



<p>The statement concludes with Massive Entertainment reiterating it is "<em>fully committed to our roadmap and to creating</em> <em>great experiences for players around the world, including The Division 2, The Division 2: Survivors, The Division Resurgence, and The Division 3.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While Massive Entertainment's recent titles, both Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Star Wars Outlaws failed to hit the mark for Ubisoft on a critical and commercial level, what can't be denied is that the studio's Snowdrop Engine is technically impressive, because if nothing else, both Outlaws and Frontiers of Pandora are two of the best-looking games this generation.</p>



<p>It's unfortunate to see more layoffs from Ubisoft today, even when Ubisoft tries to wrap them up in a bow by framing it as employees taking "<em>their next career step on their own terms</em>." Sure, those "<em>eligible</em>" employees might ultimately choose to leave, but being told you're eligible to leave is another way of saying you're no longer wanted. </p>



<p>Beyond the layoffs announced at Ubisoft RedLynx, we've also seen Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-series-boss-didnt-choose-to-leave-ubisoft-asked-me-to-step-aside/">push out veteran developer Marc-Alexis Côté</a>, who until recently was the head of the Assassin's Creed franchise for the company.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/powerwash-simulator-2-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/powerwash-simulator-2-review-suds-up.1332037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Powerwashers, it's time to suit up, as the citizens of Caldera County require your cleaning expertise once again for ample soapy adventures. Developer FuturLab <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">returns with <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em></a>, the direct sequel to their 2021 bubbly simulation game, bringing forth new jobs to take on, more equipment to acquire, and new interiors and exteriors in need of a clean.</p>

<p>Following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/powerwash-simulator-review" rel="nofollow">the release of <em>PowerWash Simulator</em></a>, FuturLab laid out the blueprint for its sequel, which should make way for a host of new content to explore and new adjustments and optimizations for a more squeaky-clean gameplay. As for whether <em>Powerwash Simulator 2</em> sets itself apart from its predecessor or is more of the same, it's up to the players to decide, but what they can anticipate is plenty of time spent blasting the dirt away, as we did!</p>

<h2>Time For A Spring Clean</h2>

<p>Let's be honest, as it pertains to the previous sentence: FuturLab doesn't do much to innovate the formula they have set out with <em>PowerWash Simulator </em>in 2021 by comparison. Instead, the developers set out to build upon their sudsy creation by improving the game's graphics and controls, retooling its tools and equipment, and better structuring their maps for a smooth gameplay experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-907.jpg?itok=WnVpJauq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-907.jpg?itok=1AFCp2Ro 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We have a powerwashing office building to conduct our cleaning business.&nbsp;(Picture: FuturLab / Ashleigh Klein)&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure><p>As the owner of a powerwashing company in Caldera County, players will lend their hand to fellow residents through various jobs they'll undertake by cleaning multiple objects and buildings from a shooting gallery, a road sweeper, a few houses, and yes, even a public toilet. Luckily, they'll have a few things to help them on these jobs to make accessibility more seamless and guide them in completing them for their clients.</p>

<p>There's also a story in play whose foundations were laid in the first game, with an Ancient Statue, and it continues in its sequel, as it has some paranormal origins. Players will gain insight into this mystery through character dialogue in text messages and article clippings, which will help them piece it together.</p>

<h2>"Boom And The Dirt Is Gone"</h2>

<p>Admittedly, every player will have a method for cleaning objects and structures in <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, and mine was to clean from top to bottom and in a clockwise direction, for my OCD's sake. While my approach may be rather meticulous, perhaps bordering on obsessive, cleaning, or in this case, power washing, is cathartic and helps unwind or unpack the mind.</p>

<p>As relaxing as it is to blast away the dirt from the rooftops to the walls and on the ground, from a gameplay perspective, the maps that feature in every story job that players will undertake have been structured similarly to the first game, where, upon accepting a job, players blast away the dirt and grime from all surfaces. However, there are a few areas that are rather tricky to clean, like between joints, handles, drains, and the underside of vehicles, which will demand plenty of time for players to get clean.</p>

<p>While as frustrating as it may be when trying to determine which areas were amiss, a tracker can be accessed where players can mark which areas have not been thoroughly cleaned. Likewise, hitting a button or key can reveal the remaining dirt spots or unclean areas before aiming our power washer tool to wash the dirt away.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-878.jpg?itok=0iqyAD0_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-878.jpg?itok=5Gy4XDqO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Don't mind us. We're just cleaning the side body of the Airship's gondola. (Picture: FuturLab / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, buildings and other structures will be a much easier feat to accomplish, especially when utilizing various equipment pieces, such as jumping atop platforms, climbing ladders, and the new scissor lift, to reach and clean the rooftops, thus making our time on the job well spent. For floors and rooftops, perhaps the most useful tool of them all, the SwirlForce Surf Ace surface cleaner and its attachments ensure that the surfaces are cleaned extremely well and in a quicker time, too.</p>

<p>Although players will have to spend their hard-earned money to splash on the SwirlForce Surf Ace surface cleaner and other cleaners with their attachments over time, players can find their favorite tools of the trade. The tool wheel allows players to access all acquired cleaners and their attachments to find the best tool for the job or for the task at hand, whether it be for flat surfaces or cleaning the tricky nooks and crannies.</p>

<p>On the latter, not every job will go smoothly, as there will be some challenging jobs to tackle, like the shooting gallery, a literal billboard, a cement truck, and a shopping mall, which will throw players for a loop. While the task at hand may be daunting, having a plan of action and the right tools will make these jobs less intimidating while cleaning these precarious surfaces less arduous.</p>

<p>Despite the frustrations one may have with these complicated surfaces, which can be time-consuming, there is fun to be had, such as on the billboard map, where players can use a new piece of equipment, the abseiling apparatus. While high up in the sky, players can move up and down and left to right while being seated; however, the only restriction is that trying to clean the platform below will force you to disembark, so it's slightly limiting in its utility.</p>

<p>One of the welcoming changes to the washers and their attachments is that once they've surpassed their functionality, they can be sold, which wasn't possible in the first game. This, in turn, will allow players to recover funds to purchase more effective and powerful washers for more challenging jobs as they progress in the story.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-905.jpg?itok=UBBTPbvJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-905.jpg?itok=2hwYKR_5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Players can customize their office building by purchasing furniture pieces from the in-game shop! (Picture: FuturLab / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Another new change, or rather addition, is customization according to the sequel's story, and the expansion of their cleaning business; they'll move into new premises that can be personalized. You reorganize the shop where players can purchase furniture, which must also be cleaned before using the Placement Mode to reposition and place them within their business space.</p>

<p>And for the best possible experience, players have the option to choose between Classic and Modern controls, which have just a few differences between them, but for experienced washers, the Classic controls will be more akin to their experiences with the first <em>PowerWash Simulator</em> game. Likewise, the Free Play and split-screen co-op modes return, allowing players to revisit completed maps and team up with another player for the ultimate couch co-op experience.</p>

<h2>Not Entirely Spotless...</h2>

<p>One desire for the sequel was to up the ante, but unfortunately, it follows the same formula as the first game, and its gameplay can feel repetitive at times, almost in a loop of doing the same things over and over again. While it stays true to its formula and boasts a few new additions along with new adjustments and optimizations that change the formula ever so slightly, <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> is more of a continuation of the first game rather than a sequel.</p>

<p>Mind you, there are some long-awaited adjustments and optimizations, such as soap retooling, reselling of washers and attachments, new tools and equipment, improved controls and graphics, alongside the new maps and customization, gameplay is much the same. Yes, it's very much <em>PowerWash Simulator,</em> but with a fresh coat of paint, it's still plenty of fun engaging with the content, blasting all the dirt and grime off surfaces, and having a variety of tools at our disposal.</p>

<p>Sure, the details are in the small things that give <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> quite the upgrade from its predecessor. The developer didn't do much to evolve the game completely, but they have done enough to make it a standout release in the <em>PowerWash Simulator</em> series. And players won't be disappointed with this latest offering, with plenty of new content and a host of changes that will keep them engulfed in bubbly fun for hours on end.</p>

<h2><em>PowerWash Simulator 2 </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-904.jpg?itok=pZTs6w_8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-screenshot-904.jpg?itok=GKXSgMSu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Players can replay their favorite jobs in Free Play mode when accessing the Mementos Shelf.&nbsp;(Picture: FuturLab / Ashleigh Klein)&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure><p>With tens of hours invested in <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, one will certainly continue their soapy adventures and expand their powerwashing business in Caldera County. Having spent hours and hours in the first game and enjoying all the DLCs that were added post-launch, suffice to say, that there is an excitement towards the sequel, and I was genuinely surprised with what the developers offered in the sequel, even if it doesn't appear to be a sequel in the traditional sense.</p>

<p>Quite simply, FuturLab took the formula and the best parts from the first game, adding much-needed new content, adjustments, and optimizations for a more complete power-washing experience. What many are most looking forward to once they've rolled the credits is whether they'll follow a similar post-launch roadmap in adding free and paid content to the game in the form of DLCs, adding more variety to the game, and continued investment from the players.</p>

<p>It will certainly be interesting to see where <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> will be in the future, both short-term and long-term, and if the developers are following the success story of its predecessor. The future is undoubtedly bright and bubbly. Now, if only a particular achievement didn't get bugged, preventing me from unlocking it, but for once, we'll blame the gnomes for this!</p>

It was September’s best-seller on both the Xbox and aggregated PC storefront charts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most importantly for publisher 2K Games, Borderlands 4 generated the highest launch month dollar sales of any title in the franchise’s history, nearly 30% higher than the previous best, Borderlands 3.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting this stat isn’t about unit sales, rather revenue generated. Borderlands 4 launched at $69.99 (eventually, after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-standard-edition-price-set-at-70-after-all">a weird kerfuffle online about whether it would jump to $80</a>), with the Deluxe Edition priced $99.99 and the Super Deluxe Edition at $129.99. At its launch in September 2019, Borderlands 3 cost $59.99 for the standard edition, $79.99 for the Deluxe Edition, and $99.99 for the Super Deluxe Edition. It's also worth noting that Borderlands 3 was a PC exclusive to the Epic Games Store for six months after its release, whereas Borderlands 4 launched across PC via Steam as well as consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, we don’t have hard sales figures yet (2K Games has made no announcement so far). But according to Circana, Borderlands 4 was the first Borderlands title to launch as the best-selling game of its release month, so there’s that.</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There were encouraging signs for Borderlands 4 when it came out last month. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-the-biggest-borderlands-ever-on-steam-just-an-hour-after-launch">It set a peak concurrent player number record for the franchise on Steam</a> (neither Sony nor Microsoft make player numbers public). But it has suffered from performance issues that have contributed to its ‘mixed’ Steam review rating on Valve’s platform.

Helldivers 2 was the fourth best-selling game of September on Xbox platforms, after debuting third during its August launch month.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-shows-dlss-4-path-tracing-and-rtx-mega-geometry-with-new-downloadable-bonsai-diorama-demo.1332016/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA has released a new <a href="https://dlss.download.nvidia.com/demos/bonsaidiorama/2025.10.07_BonsaiDioramaDemo_NvRTX_5.6.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">downloadable 'Bonsai Diorama' demo</a> that shows off DLSS 4, path tracing, and RTX Mega Geometry. The Bonsai Diorama demo accompanies the latest update of the Unreal Engine RTX branch (version 5.6.1), showcasing RTX Mega Geometry alongside ReSTIR PT (which just received performance and image quality improvements) and the full DLSS 4 technology suite (DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Ray Reconstruction, and DLSS Frame Generation).</p>



<p>If you wish to try the demo, NVIDIA says the minimum graphics card is a GeForce RTX 2080Ti, while the recommended one is the GeForce RTX 5060. Also, you should be using the GeForce driver 581.29 or newer.</p>



<p>NVIDIA also warns that the resolution and window settings can only be adjusted in the main menu, before actually launching into the Bonsai Diorama demo level. You should start the demo with full screen; if using an 8 GB GPU, start with 1080p or 1440p. If you use an 11 GB GPU or higher, try 4K resolution.</p>



<p>Once in the demo, you can toggle the user interface by pressing H. Here, you can toggle RTX Mega Geometry and Ray Reconstruction on and off and tweak DLSS Super Resolution (Off, DLAA, Auto, Quality, Balanced, Performance, Ultra Performance) and Frame Generation (Off, Auto, 2x, 3x, 4x). </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The main feature being showcased here is really RTX Mega Geometry, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-performance-vram-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debuted in Remedy's Alan Wake 2 with a patch showing performance improvements</a>. In this case, though, NVIDIA focuses on the image quality benefits:</p>



<p><em>RTX Mega Geometry adds full quality Nanite geometry to the ray tracing bounding volume hierarchy (BVH). As a result, ray traced shadows and reflections no longer exhibit visual artifacts typically present with Unreal Engine 5's default behavior.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>A webinar is <a href="https://gateway.on24.com/wcc/experience/elitenvidiabrill/1407606/3849291/level-up-with-nvidia?linkId=100000374605923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled</a> for Thursday, October 28, at 10 AM Pacific Time. Developers will be able to ask questions about the Bonsai Diorama demo and its featured technologies.</p>



<p>In other NVIDIA news, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace-for-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACE</a> (Avatar Cloud Engine) can now use the open-source Qwen3-8B AI model as an In-Game Inferencing (IGI) SDK plug-in. This simplifies integration within a developer's pipeline and optimizes the simultaneous processing of AI and graphics for accelerated game performance. Qwen3 enables developers to create enhanced game characters that can reason in real time through non-scripted events and respond dynamically to player inputs and contextual information.</p>



<p>Alongside the release of Qwen3-8B, NVIDIA also made several improvements to the core IGI SDK:</p>



<ul>
<li>MultiLORA adapters to quickly fine-tune model weights with minimal computational overhead</li>



<li>CUDA support for graphics with Vulkan backends, which optimizes graphics and AI workloads for accelerated performance when both are running simultaneously.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With <em>Battlefield 6</em> out now and doing quite well for itself in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/battlefield-6-multiplayer-preview-all-out-warfare-in-mirak-valley-and-operation" rel="nofollow">multiplayer</a> action sphere – as we detailed in our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battlefield-6-review-war-on-unprecedented-scale" rel="nofollow">full review</a> – it’s time to turn our attention towards what’s next for EA’s biggest game of the year. We’re just under a week away from Season 1. Launching on October 28 and across three phases over time in an effort to bring high-quality content to players at regular intervals.</p>

<p>The first phase of content will open with Rogue Ops, which includes a new map known as Blackwell Fields, and a new 4v4 mode called Strikepoint. In the second phase, starting on November 18, we’ll see California Resistance and the addition of another new map called Eastwood.</p>

<p>Then, on December 9, Winter Offensive will begin with a seasonal update to the existing Empire State map.</p>

All of this content is being promised for free from the start, or is earnable on free tiers in the Battle Pass.</p>

<p>Digging into Rogue Ops specifically, it’s themed around high-stakes ops in pursuit of military secrets in the first all-new map: Blackwell Fields. While it’s a large map set in the Californian Chaparral and built for all-out warfare, there’s a good amount of structures that lean heavily into standoff with outdoor combat.</p>

<p>We got to try out this map in the Close-Quarters Battle mode, which meant smaller team sizes and up close and personal fights. Right away, it’s easy to see why this map is ideal for the selected mode.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can duck in and out of military installations and homesteads scattered across the land. Everything is dusty and dirty, and fires scatter the area, which makes it harder to see clearly in some aspects.</p>

There’s also the Glock 22 and the Mini Fix Bolt-Action rifle for long-distance attacks.</p>

<p>There’s also a new vehicle available – an APC called the Traverser Mark 2, which operates as an Infantry Support vehicle that offers up a spawn point and a supply station or other vehicles on your team. Rogue Ops and the Blackwell Fields map will run from October 28 to November 11, with Phase 2 to follow.</p>

<p>California Resistance is an apt name for the next round of Season 1 because it further explores another area of the region where both NATO and the local militia are trying to defend California from PAX’s incursion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The map coming up here is called Eastwood, is set in a quiet and upscale Southern California neighborhood – well, formerly quiet because now there’s a warzone running through it, and every part of it can be chaotic but also used to your advantage.</p>

<p>Trying out the All-Out-Warfare mode, it’s easy to see how this area has become a complete battlefield, and you’ll be fighting in and around houses, blowing them apart, and riding around in tanks and other vehicles to add to the destruction.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20251021181509_1.jpg?itok=SEcq-bGQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20251021181509_1.jpg?itok=8AJ9J0GV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This phase will also introduce a limited-time mode to<em> Battlefield 6</em> called Sabotage, in which two teams of eight attack and defend supply caches on the map. Attackers and defenders will swap sides after each round to mix things up, and destroying the most caches will net a win for the match.</p>

<p>Battle Pickups will also debut during this phase, which are high-value, rare weapons with limited ammunition but can do major damage to enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New weapons will include the DP-12 shotgun, which has different ammo types in each of its tubes, and the 8-shot S&amp;W M327 revolver.</p>

<p>Phase 3 of the season will turn towards winter, and while details remain sparse for now, it’ll launch ahead of the holidays with a winter-themed Empire State map. Following that, players can expect Season 2 to drop within the new year.</p>

You might be currently wondering where the latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> patch is, seeing as it hasn't turned up yet, and to explain its absence developer Arrowhead have taken to the game's Witter account with a post going into some details about it. Apparently it was originally planned for Tuesday, i.e. yesterday, October 21st, but a "last-minute certification issue caused a delay."
</p>
<p>
As a result, the studio is currently aiming for a release by the end of the week, with "staff ready to work over the weekend if needed." On that point, hope you pay good overtime and will give said staff members time off in kind, Arrowhead! However, you also shouldn't hold them to it, as they also say there's a chance the issue won't be fixed by this Friday, meaning the patch could be delayed even further into next week. "We’re doing everything we can to deliver it this week and will provide an update on Friday either way. Thanks for your patience and understanding," explains Arrowhead.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Freedoms greetings Helldivers,</p><p>We want to share an update on our most recent patch.

The post goes on to note how Arrowhead has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-director-confirms-arrowhead-are-biting-the-addition-delay-bullet-while-working-on-performance-fixes">pushed back things like Warbonds</a> to focus fixing up performance, and outlined some of the optimisations coming to the game whenever the next patch launches. This includes things like optimised status effects, physics, asset distribution and setup, VFX, and AI behaviours. 
</p>
<p>
There should also be reduced stuttering during the drop-in sequence for missions on Hive Worlds, improved audio IO performance and general performance. Generally sounds like it'll be a good patch for smoothing over some of its current snaggly bits. You just have to wait a bit longer for it!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/trials-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-to-lose-60-employees-in-layoffs-become-a-mobile-developer.1332004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft Redlynx, the developers of the Trails franchise, is set to lose up to 60 employees in the latest round of layoffs by parent company Ubisoft. </p>



<p>A statement posted on <a href="https://www.redlynx.com/restructuring-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the studio’s website</a> says that Ubisoft is moving forward with a <strong>“restructuring proposal for RedLynx as part of the company’s global efforts to simplify, reduce costs, and ensure a stronger prioritization and efficiency across the company’s worldwide studio network.”</strong></p>



<p>Redlynx says that it will negotiate with studio staff before making a decision on the proposal, which focuses “primarily” on the administration and production teams. These negotiations with the staff are scheduled to start on October 30 and will end by the end of November.</p>



<p><strong>“If materialized, this proposal would result in the reduction of maximum 60 positions,” </strong>they say.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-ubisoft-proposal-for-redlynx">What Is The Ubisoft Proposal For Redlynx?</h2>



<p>As far as what this proposal entails, it was said that Redlynx would “refocus” from being a multi-platform developer to one that’s “specialized in small screens”. </p>



<p>“This would enable it to position itself for sustainable success and optimize its resources to best leverage the studio’s unique expertise—starting with two unannounced mobile projects the studio is leading,” the statement reads.</p>



<p>Ubisoft RedLynx managing director Celine Pasula added that, “We are confident that, with the proposed changes, RedLynx would continue to play a meaningful role in Ubisoft’s future—driving technical excellence on mobile devices, and strengthening Ubisoft’s cross and multi-platform capabilities on small screens to expand our audience reach.”</p>



<p>The news of layoffs at Ubisoft RedLynx comes alongside the announcement that another Ubisoft studio, Massive Entertainment, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-massive-entertainment-is-laying-off-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having its own wave</a> of job terminations.</p>

                <p>The idea of exclusive games in 2025 is "antiquated," according to Xbox president Sarah Bond.

"For anyone interested, I'm now level 42 in 25 hours, I mostly finish top 5 scores in the game, most revives in 1 life is 47, I have 40.6% of my time on objective which puts me in the top 0.2% of players."</p><p>He didn't go into detail about those eight players that fell to him, although they could have been enemy soldiers who were trying to finish off the players he was saving.</p><p>Pacifist runs have become increasingly popular in multiplayer games that give players enough freedom to make it possible. We've seen them in other shooters and battle royales like Call of Duty: Warzone and Fortnite where players either hide or avoid combat until the last possible moment.</p><p>ThatFriendlyGuyTTV could probably make a Battlefield 6 version of Hacksaw Ridge, a dramatic and cinematic telling of the story of Desmond Doss.

  </div><p dir="ltr">As for other Sony hardware, the company reportedly stopped issuing sales figures for PS4 in 2022, when the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4-sales-reach-117-2-million-units-as-production-winds-down/1100-6506319/#:~:text=PS4%20Sales%20Reach%20117.2%20Million%20Units%20As%20Production%20Winds%20Down%20-%20GameSpot">system sat at roughly 117 units sold</a>. The PS2 is the best-selling system of all time, with Sony producing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-many-ps2s-sony-made-in-its-lifetime/1100-6528175/">over 160 million consoles</a> from 2000 to 2013. There is a chance--though possibly a small one at this point--that Switch could catch up to PS2. As of August, Nintendo had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">sold more than 153 million Switch systems</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Circana shared September 2025 video game industry sales data for the US earlier today. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-had-the-biggest-launch-in-franchise-history-in-the-us/1100-6535624/">Borderlands 4 had the biggest launch in history for the looter-shooter series</a>, when accounting for dollar sales. Piscatella noted Borderlands 4 was performing "30% higher than the previous best, Borderlands 3" for launch dollar sales. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-has-been-delayed/1100-6534965/">Switch 2 port of Borderlands 4 has been delayed indefinitely</a>.</p>

Five different versions of this are available, each covering a different catalog of monsters:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pokemon-Pok%C3%A9mon-Electronic-Guessing-Regional/dp/B0DW681M4R?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kanto Edition</a> -- $28</li><li><span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pokemon-Pok%C3%A9mon-Trainer-Electronic-Guessing/dp/B0DW6BJC2R?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legacy Edition</a> -- $28</span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pokemon-Pok%C3%A9mon-Adventures-Electronic-Guessing/dp/B0DW617BXC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ash Adventures</a> -- $27.55</span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pokemon-Pok%C3%A9mon-Electronic-Guessing-Regional/dp/B0DW66TD8K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sinnoh Edition</a> -- $28</span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pokemon-Pok%C3%A9mon-Electronic-Guessing-Regional/dp/B0DW6913FS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Unova Edition</a> -- $27</span></li></ul></div>                      </div>   </div><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-horror-movie-blu-ray-box-set-tv-collection-amazon-deals/1100-6535546/">Amazon Has Tons Of Horror Movie Box Sets For Low Prices In Halloween Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-marvel-spider-man-iron-man-busts-display-model-limited-time-deals/1100-6535581/">Lego's New Spider-Man And Iron Man Busts Get Limited-Timed Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/joe-hill-king-sorrow-horror-novel-stephen-king-book-2025/1100-6533887/">Joe Hill's Massive New Horror-Fantasy Novel Arrives Just In Time For Halloween</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/icon-blue-limited-edition-dualsense-ps5-controller-is-available-now/1100-6535294/">Icon Blue Limited Edition DualSense PS5 Controller Is Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-technic-formula-1-mclaren-retiring-soon-amazon-and-target-deal/1100-6520600/">Lego Technic McLaren F1 Race Car Retires Soon, Save $72 At Amazon Before It's Gone</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-amazon-holiday-2025-exclusive-premium-collection-restock/1100-6535543/">Pokemon TCG Amazon-Exclusive Holiday Premium Collection Is Back In Stock</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shudder-horror-movie-10th-anniversary-collector-edition-blu-ray/1100-6534744/">Get 10 Shudder Original Horror Movies On Blu-Ray For Only $51</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-preorder-guide/1100-6535007/">ROG Xbox Ally X In Stock At Best Buy On Launch Day, Ships Immediately</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>Dotemu has finally revealed that the hotly anticipated beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a> will assemble on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>1st December 2025</strong>. What's more, it's lifted the lid on two new characters in the roster.</p>
<p>Aside from giving us the release date, the all-new trailer also gives us our first look at Iron Man and Phoenix, the final two fighters in the game's 15-hero line-up. <strong>Spectacular Spider-Man</strong>'s Josh Keaton will be lending his vocal talents to Tony Stark, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a>'s Jennifer Hale will voice Jean Grey — the same character she voiced in <strong>X-Men '97</strong>.</p>
<p>Yep, these were the two names unearthed in an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/marvel-cosmic-invasion-demo-datamine-leaks-more-heroes">earlier datamine</a> of the game's Steam demo, but hey, it's still exciting to see them in action. Here's a closer look at the new pair:</p>

<p>With these two newbies, the full launch character roster is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Captain America</li>
<li>Wolverine</li>
<li>Spider-Man</li>
<li>Storm</li>
<li>Phyla-Vell</li>
<li>Venom</li>
<li>Nova</li>
<li>She-Hulk</li>
<li>Rocket Raccoon</li>
<li>Silver Surfer</li>
<li>Beta Ray Bill</li>
<li>Black Panther</li>
<li>Cosmic Ghost Rider</li>
<li>Iron Man</li>
<li>Phoenix</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a strong collection, and every new trailer sells us even more on the beat 'em up gameplay — if <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Shredder's Revenge</a> is anything to go by, we're in for a treat.</p>

			<p>Xbox has confirmed the games coming to Xbox Game Pass <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/22/xbox-game-pass-october-2025-wave-2/">for the remainder of October 2025</a>, and paired with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-keeper-pax-dei-xbox-game-pass-october-2025/">the games that have already arrived</a> on Xbox Game Pass for the first half of October, it's all together a strong month for new titles entering the subscription service, with The Outer Worlds 2, PowerWash Simulator 2, and 1000xResist all set to enter the fray.</p>



<p>Three major titles are entering Game Pass this week, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/">Ninja Gaiden 4 </a>already available in the service, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 entering as of today, and PowerWash Simulator 2 arriving tomorrow, on October 23. Next week, one of Xbox's last major releases for 2025 enters the service with The Outer Worlds 2 arriving on October 29, and one of 2024's best indie titles, 1000xResist, will be available in the subscription service as of November 4, 2025.</p>



<p>Other notable entries for this back-half of October additions include Football Manager 26, which is set to be available on both PC and console. Commandos: Origins, and the survival roguelike Hall of Torment are also a couple of noteworthy titles entering the service.</p>



<p>With regards to the games that are entering Game Pass on their launch day for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, those titles are: PowerWash Simulator 2, The Outer Worlds 2, Bounty Star, Super Fantasy Kingdom, and Football Manager 26.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games entering Xbox Game Pass for the remainder of October 2025, what platforms they're playable on, and what tiers they're available at:</p>



<ul>
<li>Commandos: Origins - October 22 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Microsoft Flight Simulator 24 - October 22 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>PowerWash Simulator 2 - October 23 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Bounty Star - October 23 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass</li>

            <p>Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth, whenever it is a damp, drizzly October in my soul, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. Specifically, I dream of cruise liners. I’ve never been on an ocean cruise, but I’ve been on at least two North Sea ferries and in my mind, cruise ships are paradise. 
</p>
<p>They are places of luxury and possibly a few exotic murders - ocean-going adventurelands that perversely harbour swimming pools and waterslides. Imagine it, a boat with a pool. Such delicious unreason. Here to disabuse me of these visions is No More Robot’s Cruise Control, which makes cruise ships look like hell.

<p>It's a management sim created by a team who include former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overcooked">Overcooked</a> developers, but for all the ability to construct "fine dining" facilities, I see little of Overcooked’s saucy joyfulness in the trailer. I see suffocating bingo halls and arcade machines crammed together like tombstones. I see crowds so dense the people have no choice but to walk through each other.</p><p>I see trash and vomit and despairing janitors. I see carpet patterns that follow like a tedious argument of insidious intent. I see potted cinemas that resemble factory farm incubators. I see dollar signs floating up from smiling, empty heads. Worst of all, I can’t see any waterslides or swimming pools.
</p>
<p>You wish to know what it’s like to <em>participate</em> in this inhumane simulation, this abject spawn of the Bermuda triangle? Very well. Cruise Control looks like a familiar rhythm of ensuring your ship has the facilities to keep your customers happy, while avoiding long queues to attractions and mechanical breakdowns. The more guests you serve, the more amenities you’ll acquire and upgrade. Perhaps there’s a waterslide to unlock, once enough bodies have been fed to the dancefloors. Fail to amuse the clientele sufficiently, and they'll send you direct to Davey Jones' Locker. Fools! We are all already there.
</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3973220/Cruise_Control/">read more on Steam</a>. It’s out in 2026, and is the work of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/not-tonight">Not Tonight</a> developers No More Robots. No More Robots are also publishers – their recent signings include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2451100/Little_Rocket_Lab/">Little Rocket Lab</a>, a Stardew factory sim that I have downloaded the demo for and feel guilty about not playing yet. Final anecdote: I have a musician friend who once worked on a cruise liner. He lives on a boat now. I'm not sure he's really my friend. Perhaps my friend is still out there, queuing for bingo in the doldrums, and some creature of the deep sea has stolen his face.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pikmin-5-free-update-sequel-switch-2-miyamoto-2000638244</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-being-real-weird-about-pikmin-all-of-a-sudden.1331944/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo has a history of making weird announcements out of the blue. Remember last year’s alarm clock? But even in its current chaotic era of tweeting out game reveals and doing hour-long follow-up livestreams for games like <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, Wednesday’s <em>Pikmin 4</em> announcement is low-key bizarre.</p> <p>The <em>Mario</em> maker revealed its 2023 strategy adventure game will be getting a free update two years later. But not for the newly released Switch 2. Instead, <em>Pikmin 4</em> will get new content in November for the original Switch version. That game can be played on the new hardware, obviously, but an official Switch 2 upgrade remains nowhere in sight. Hmmm.</p>

 <p>The meat of the update revolves around new cross-functionality between <em>Pikmin 4</em> and <em>Pikmin Bloom</em>, the augmented-reality mobile spin-off by the creators of <em>Pokémon Go</em>. Decor Pikmin, which wear funny outfits and were previously only available in <em>Bloom</em>, can now be found in <em>Pikmin 4</em> and transferred back and forth between both games. Meanwhile, <em>Pikmin 4</em>‘s Ice Pikmin will be joining <em>Bloom</em> for the first time to mark that game’s fourth anniversary.</p>

  <p>The rest of the update includes a camera mode for <em>Pikmin 4</em> and new difficulty settings to make the game easier or more challenging. There’s also now a free demo for the game on the eShop. <em>Pikmin 4</em> sold <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2023/231107_4e.pdf">over 2.5 million copies</a>, making it the best-selling game in the franchise that began back on the GameCube, but still far from one of the platform’s bigger first-party sellers.</p>

 <p>So why <em>Pikmin</em>? Why now? And why on the original Switch? Nintendo hasn’t shied away from making DLC and packaging it with paid “next-gen upgrades” to push sales of older Switch games on the new hardware. At the same time, this seems unlikely to feed into any meaningful holiday resurgence in<em> Pikmin 4</em> for the original console, with the update wedged in-between <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> and <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>.</p>

 <h2>Is Nintendo laying the groundwork for <em>Pikmin 5</em> or something completely different?</h2> <p>There’s also the extra weirdness with this update coming just after Nintendo released a couple of Pixar-like <em>Pikmin</em> shorts. <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pikmin-short-animated-film-mario-zelda-app-2000633651">It claims</a> those were tests to prove out the capabilities of its new internal Nintendo Pictures team, but the company rarely does random one-offs on a whim. Could this all be laying the groundwork for Nintendo’s next <em>Pikmin</em> project? And will that be a full-fledged <em>Pikmin </em>sequel, a <em>Pikmin</em>-centric movie or TV series, or a more unorthodox venture in the toy or theme park realm?</p>

 <p>There’s also the Shigeru Miyamoto factor. The famed Nintendo developer created the <em>Pikmin</em> franchise and it clearly lives near and dear to his heart. Would <em>Pikmin 4</em> have even happened without him pushing for it? He told press it was close to completion back in 2015, only for it to lay dormant until it was suddenly re-revealed in 2022 and released the following year.</p>

 <p><em>Pikmin 4</em> is also notable among Nintendo’s first-party projects for being made in Unreal Engine 4. There’s also that mysterious MMO playtest Nintendo performed exactly a year ago this week. It included <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-playtest-switch-2-mario-mmo-1851677142">world-crafting mechanics and user-generated content references</a> that suggested things like <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Roblox</em> were possible inspirations.</p> <p>Could Nintendo be prepping a <em>Pikmin</em> crossover with <em>Fortnite</em>? Will the next <em>Pikmin</em> game be Nintendo’s ambitious take on the survival crafting MMO genre? Will Miyamoto return to development to make it the last game he ever directs? Or is Nintendo just throwing hardcore <em>Pikmin 4</em> stans one last bone before the franchise goes dark for another decade?</p>

They're essentially the pieces of equipment that you spawn into every life with, and if you use them correctly, you can wreak havoc on the enemy team. Every class in Battlefield 6 offers several exclusive Gadgets for you to choose from, and while you can always stick with the default options, there are some better choices that are waiting to be unlocked.</p><p>Below, we'll go over the best Gadgets to use for the four classes in Battlefield 6 so you know exactly what to equip on your loadouts. It's worth noting that this guide pairs well with our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-guns-and-weapon-loadouts-in-battlefield-6/2900-6870/" data-ref-id="2900-6870">best weapons in BF6</a> guide, naturally.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Best_Gadgets_in_Battlefield_6">Best Gadgets in Battlefield 6</a><ul><li><a href="#Assault_class">Assault class</a></li><li><a href="#Engineer_class">Engineer class</a></li><li><a href="#Support_class">Support class</a></li><li><a href="#Recon_class">Recon class</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="Best_Gadgets_in_Battlefield_6">Best Gadgets in Battlefield 6</h2><p>With every class in Battlefield 6 allowing you to take two separate Gadgets, we'll be listing the top two Gadgets for each class. Some of them are unlocked by default, others are unlocked by leveling up, and some need to be unlocked through complex challenges. We made sure not to make the list consist only of gadgets you must sweat and grind for, though.</p><p>We'll go over each class and its best Gadgets below:</p><h3 id="Assault_class">Assault class</h3><p>First, we have Assault, one of the more popular classes in Battlefield 6. Assault doesn't have nearly the number of Gadgets as other classes do, but the options it does have can be game-wrecking. Here are our picks for the best Assault Gadgets:</p><ul><li>M87A1 Shotgun</li><li>Deploy Beacon</li><li>Assault Ladder</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589146-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.24.32.94.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589146" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589146-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.24.32.94.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589146"></a><figcaption>The Deploy Beacon for the Assault class</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589146-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.24.32.94.png"></figure><p>While we did say that we'd only be listing two Gadgets per class, Assault is a special case. Its first Gadget slot is dedicated to actual weapons, including the all-powerful M87A1 shotgun, carbines, and other decent guns. So, to compensate for that, we're listing two other Gadgets you can use in the second slot.</p><p>The Gadgets we've gone with are the Deploy Beacon and the Assault Ladder. The Deploy Beacon is extremely useful for flanking enemies and squadding up with your teammates, while the Assault Ladder can be used for a variety of reasons, including forgoing the need for stairs to reach a second-level building.</p><h3 id="Engineer_class">Engineer class</h3><p>Next up is Engineer, and it has access to some of the most varied and useful Gadgets in the entire game. As this class's goal is to take out vehicles, you'll find a slew of rocket launchers and other anti-vehicle equipment in the Gadgets section. Here's our picks for the best overall Engineer Gadgets:</p><ul><li>RPG-7V2</li><li>Supply Crate</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589151-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.25.31.50.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589151" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589151-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.25.31.50.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589151"></a><figcaption>The RPG-7V2 for the Engineer class</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589151-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.25.31.50.png"></figure><p>The RPG-7V2 is our choice for the best rocket launcher Gadget you can use for the Engineer class. The rockets are unguided and can be fired relatively fast, making them perfect for taking out ground vehicles quickly. You can also hit some incredible clips if you manage to destroy a helicopter or jet with an RPG shot.</p><p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, there's the Supply Crate. Not only can this help solve the ammunition problem for your teammates in Battlefield 6, but it also allows you to constantly reload a vehicle's weapons without the need for the vehicle to visit a dedicated resupply station on the map.</p><h3 id="Support_class">Support class</h3><p>Support is far and away the most team-friendly class in Battlefield 6, and one of its Gadget slots is essentially filled before you even enter a match for the first time. If you've played Support, you know what Gadget we're talking about. As for the other slot, though, check out our pick for that Gadget below:</p><ul><li>Defibrillator</li><li>M320A1 SMK</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589152-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.00.48.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589152" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589152-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.00.48.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589152"></a><figcaption>The Defibrillator for the Support class</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589152-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.00.48.png"></figure><p>The Defibrillator is basically a package deal with the Support class. It allows you to revive teammates instantly and can be used as a backup melee weapon if need be. You might as well not run Support if you're not going to use the Defibrillator.</p><p>The M320A1 SMK is our other Gadget pick for Support. This allows you to throw several smokescreens on the ground, allowing your team to reposition and not get picked off from a distance by snipers. You'll also clear any markers from enemies when you or a teammate runs into the smoke. This Gadget can replace a Smoke Grenade, but using the two together is even more powerful.</p><h3 id="Recon_class">Recon class</h3><p>Finally, there's the Recon class. This class is mostly reserved for sniper rifle players, as snipers are given massive advantages when running Recon. Whether you're using a sniper or not, though, you'll want these Gadgets on your loadout:</p><ul><li>Recon Drone</li><li>AP Mine</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589153-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.41.74.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589153" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589153-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.41.74.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589153"></a><figcaption>The AP Mine for the Recon class</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4589153-battlefield6screenshot2025.10.22-00.27.41.74.png"></figure><p>The Recon Drone might seem controversial for your first Gadget slot. While it won't impact your gameplay too much, it really helps out your team, as you can mark enemies continually as long as your drone doesn't get shot down. The Recon Drone also grants you incredible XP, which is hard to come by in Battlefield 6. If you're using a sniper, you can use the drone to scout out potential targets as well.</p><p>Our second pick is the AP Mine, which is basically a claymore that you can put down behind you as you set up in a cozy spot with your sniper or long-range weapon. As long as you place the mine in a hidden spot where enemies will run into it if they try to flank you, you're guaranteed a kill.</p><p>Use our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-guides-hub/1100-6533950/" data-ref-id="1100-6533950">Battlefield 6 guides hub</a> for lots more help on EA's massive shooter.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> is a PvPvE third-person extraction shooter set in an apocalyptic future. In this game, you strap on the boots of a scavenger who must collect valuable resources and gear from dangerous territory overrun with deadly robots and human threats. Like most extraction shooters, this game requires considerable risk to reap the best rewards. Our guide will provide you with some helpful tips for looting and staying alive in Arc Raiders.</p><p dir="ltr">Matches in Arc Raiders are called Raids, and they last for 30 minutes each. You can play solo or in a party of up to three players. You'll need to loot up and safely extract with your gear before the match ends in order to keep your stuff. If you’re eliminated or fail to extract, you'll lose everything on you--well, mostly everything, but we'll explain more on that below.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Basic_tips_for_solo_players">Basic tips for solo players</a><ul><li><a href="#Use_stealth_tactics">Use stealth tactics</a></li><li><a href="#Choose_your_fights_wisely">Choose your fights wisely</a></li><li><a href="#Approach_extraction_with_caution">Approach extraction with caution</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Plan_ahead_and_watch_the_time">Plan ahead and watch the time</a></li><li><a href="#Loadout_and_inventory_tips">Loadout and inventory tips</a><ul><li><a href="#Free_loadouts">Free loadouts</a></li><li><a href="#Know_what_weapons_to_bring">Know what weapons to bring</a></li><li><a href="#Don_t_let_your_guns_break">Don't let your guns break</a></li><li><a href="#Pick_the_right_shield">Pick the right shield</a></li><li><a href="#Make_the_best_use_of_your_inventory_space">Make the best use of your inventory space</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Movement_and_combat_tips">Movement and combat tips</a><ul><li><a href="#Drop_and_roll">Drop and roll</a></li><li><a href="#Watch_for_sneaky_alarms">Watch for sneaky alarms</a></li><li><a href="#Combat_tips">Combat tips</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Base_tips_and_upgrades">Base tips and upgrades</a><ul><li><a href="#Visit_Scrappy_often">Visit Scrappy often</a></li><li><a href="#Invest_in_the_right_skills">Invest in the right skills</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Basic_tips_for_solo_players">Basic tips for solo players</h2><p dir="ltr">While these are great tips for all players, they are especially useful if you're planning on playing Arc Raiders solo.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Use_stealth_tactics">Use stealth tactics</h3><p dir="ltr">Every little sound you make is dangerous in Arc Raiders. Footsteps, looting containers, opening doors. Every action you take creates audio cues that can be used against you. Likewise, listening carefully can help you use the same audio cues against others.</p><p dir="ltr">Crouch to make less movement noise, move cover-to-cover, and use light shields when possible for faster movement. Popping a smoke grenade can also be a great stealth tactic for looting, healing, or escaping a fight.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589417-arcraiders_screenshot_tt2_14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589417" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589417-arcraiders_screenshot_tt2_14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589417"></a><figcaption>Arc Raiders The Queen enemy type</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589417-arcraiders_screenshot_tt2_14.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Choose_your_fights_wisely">Choose your fights wisely</h3><p dir="ltr">Some missions require you to fight Arc robot enemy types, but it's best to avoid them if you don't need to engage. You should choose gunfights wisely, as firing your weapon can alert nearby enemies to your location.</p><p dir="ltr">Check your surroundings and approach extraction points with caution. Sometimes players can be waiting to ambush others at the extraction points. Activating the lift at an extraction point also creates a lot of noise, so make sure you stay alert for potential enemies to arrive.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Plan_ahead_and_watch_the_time">Plan ahead and watch the time</h2><p dir="ltr">You'll want to go topside with a clear goal in mind. Raids have a maximum timer of 30 minutes. If you need a specific item for a quest or an upgrade, make sure you check your map locations right away, so you know exactly where you need to go. Each main POI will tell you what types of loot are available there.</p><p dir="ltr">Example: If you need a mechanical part, hover over the POIs to see which specifies mechanical loot.</p><p dir="ltr">Also, watch the timer and give yourself enough time to get to an extraction point. Each extraction point has its own timer to indicate how long the point will be active. Don't wait too long and end up at one of the last points active, as other teams might be fighting you for that same extraction.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589420-arcraiders_screenshot_tt2_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589420" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589420-arcraiders_screenshot_tt2_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589420"></a><figcaption>Fighting robots in Arc Radiers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589420-arcraiders_screenshot_tt2_06.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Loadout_and_inventory_tips">Loadout and inventory tips</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Free_loadouts">Free loadouts</h3><p dir="ltr">What happens if you lose all your gear? Don't worry, Arc Raiders never leaves you completely empty-handed. You always have the option to start a match with a free loadout. This won't be a very good offering of gear, but you'll have a random weapon and some equipment to use for each match.</p><p dir="ltr">Using the free loadout is great when you're just getting started and don't want to risk much. It's also good for regaining and building up your inventory after some tough losses.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Know_what_weapons_to_bring">Know what weapons to bring</h3><p dir="ltr">As mentioned above, you want to plan out your objective before you start the raid. This also helps to make sure you bring the right weapon types for the job. Heavy weapons with bullet penetration are best for robots, while guns with light or medium ammo types are all you'll need for human threats.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll probably want to conserve the heavy ammo and weapons unless you know you're going topside to fight big robots.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589421-weapondurability.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589421" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589421-weapondurability.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589421"></a><figcaption>Weapon details and durability</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589421-weapondurability.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Don_t_let_your_guns_break">Don't let your guns break</h3><p dir="ltr">Weapons break in Arc Raiders. You'll want to be mindful of the durability of all your weapons. Highlight a weapon in your inventory to get its details and see what condition the item is in. You don't want to go into a fight with a gun that's on the verge of giving out on you. Make sure to make repairs when needed.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Pick_the_right_shield">Pick the right shield</h3><p dir="ltr">Consider your playstyle when picking a shield for your loadout. Shields are categorized as either heavy, medium, or light. Heavy and medium shields mitigate more damage but slow you down, while light shields mitigate less but are lighter, and you can move faster.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth mentioning that shields work differently from many other games. A shield doesn't completely block you from taking damage and instead only reduces how much damage you take. Each shield's description will detail the percentage of damage it will reduce, but it's important to remember that a shield won't save you in a fight if you're low on health. Always keep healing items available in case you take damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589434-salvagingitems.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589434" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589434-salvagingitems.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589434"></a><figcaption>Salvage items to free up your inventory</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589434-salvagingitems.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Make_the_best_use_of_your_inventory_space">Make the best use of your inventory space</h3><p dir="ltr">At the start, you'll load into raids with 30 inventory spaces and one safe pocket slot, but you can get more space by equipping various bag types. Safe pocket slots are for your most important items. These are the <strong>only loot items you keep if you die</strong>. This is a good place to store high-value loot or quest items that you want to make sure you don't lose.</p><p dir="ltr">Your inventory will fill up really fast when looting, especially in the beginning, before you get a bag with extra space. This doesn't mean you should avoid or discard items you find. Try to hide and safely check your inventory while in the match to see if you're holding items that can be salvaged and into basic materials such as fabric and metal parts. These materials are highly stackable, and they can be salvaged mid-match to free up space.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, any required quest items you find are marked with a white diamond icon in the top left corner. This should help you better identify them, because these are items you'll want to hold on to.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Movement_and_combat_tips">Movement and combat tips</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Drop_and_roll">Drop and roll</h3><p dir="ltr">When jumping or falling from heights, press the crouch button right before falling to perform a roll and protect yourself from fall damage. This won't work from really tall heights, but you can save yourself from reasonable heights.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589422-redalarm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589422" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589422-redalarm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589422"></a><figcaption>Destroy these sneaky alarms</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589422-redalarm.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Watch_for_sneaky_alarms">Watch for sneaky alarms</h3><p dir="ltr">Keep an eye out for small red lights. They can be subtle, but you'll often notice a red light on a car or inside a doorway. These are alarms, and getting close will trigger a noisy sound that gives away your position. You can melee the light to destroy the alarm.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Combat_tips">Combat tips</h3><p dir="ltr">There is an orange explosion and an audio cue when you break a player's shield. The killfeed will indicate with text to let you know you've knocked that player.</p><p dir="ltr">A knocked player sends up a flare. This can be seen by anyone in the area, so you don't want to linger too long, but listen for any approaching squadmates before finishing any kills and looting bodies. If they have teammates, they might be close. Knocked players also have a fair amount of health. Don't waste your ammo on them. Use your melee weapon to finish the kill.</p><p dir="ltr">Also, flares can be tricky. Don't assume you're going towards a flare to third-party a fight or loot potential bodies. Players can manually call flares if they have one to equip, and that can be a sly way to lure you into a trap.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Base_tips_and_upgrades">Base tips and upgrades</h2><p dir="ltr">Arc Raiders can feel tough in the beginning, especially if you are new to extraction shooters. There are ways to level up your character and experience while you are back home in your underground base inside Speranza. Make sure to utilize the workbench and other features to craft new items, recycle unwanted loot, and make upgrades to your gear.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589423-scrappy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589423" data-ratio="0.56208791208791" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589423-scrappy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589423"></a><figcaption>Scrappy the rooster</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589423-scrappy.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Visit_Scrappy_often">Visit Scrappy often</h3><p dir="ltr">Scrappy is your rooster companion. Yes, a rooster. He'll gather small quantities of essential materials for you. Make sure to visit Scrappy after every raid, as he'll collect items for you during each match. He can also be trained to be more efficient at scavenging materials.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Invest_in_the_right_skills">Invest in the right skills</h3><p dir="ltr">You'll earn experience from your raids, and leveling up earns you skill points to invest in a skill tree. This skill tree is divided into three sections: Conditions, Mobility, and Survival.</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, how you choose your skill points will depend on your playstyle and if your focus is on looting, fighting, or movement-based skills. However, you can pull skills from all three tiers, which will give you a pretty well-rounded character.</p><p dir="ltr">Skills good for solo players include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Agile Croucher </strong>to increase your movement speed while crouching</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Silent Scavenger</strong> to make less noise when looting</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>In-Round Crafting</strong> to gain the ability to craft items mid-match</li></ul>

<p>But producer Kensuke Tanabe decided against it</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="359443003808c"><a title="Metroid Prime Remastered" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/359443003808c/metroid-prime-remastered.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo is shortly launched <strong>Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective</strong>, a new art book looking at concept art for the original trilogy on GameCube and Wii (with a small section dedicated to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>).</p>
<p>Speaking of the more recent Switch remaster, the book reveals that Retro Studios had originally proposed completely new cutscenes for the game. However, in a producer's note, Kensuke Tanabe confirmed that he opted against this approach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When the project first started, Retro proposed an idea regarding cutscenes – that we create entirely new ones. The prototype cutscene they presented was undeniably impressive, with a high level of quality.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="FsuAt4uVyTk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4022bdxqojnr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
<p>"However, I came to the decision to closely observe the cutscenes from the GameCube version and replicate them essentially as they were. The reason for this choice was that the cutscenes were not created solely for dramatic effect; they also played a role in conveying gameplay-relevant information to the player. Each scene was carefully crafted with this purpose in mind. Retro demonstrated exceptional professionalism and fully adhered to this direction."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting, huh? It's hard to imagine what this cutscene prototype might have looked like, but our assumption is that it might have been something akin to Halo 2: Anniversary. That game, remastered by Halo Studios (then 343 Industries) took the original Bungie-created cutscenes and revamped them from the ground up.</p>
<p>Still, we fully understand Tanabe's reasoning here. The cutscenes do provide a lot of information to the player regarding gameplay mechanics, so we can't be too mad. The final product looks pretty amazing as it is, after all!</p>

			<p>As 2025 approaches its final months, AI becomes more and more a subject of discussion across all industries, including game development. The games industry has long utilized artificial intelligence to populate its virtual worlds. Still, with the veritable explosion of generative AI in the last few years and the concurrent ballooning of game budgets and development timelines, some developers have been exploring whether it could be used to reduce costs and production time.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/starfinder-afterlight-qa-even-after-bg3-not-many-are-jumping-into-crpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In our most recent interview with independent developer Epictellers Entertainment</a> about their upcoming cRPG Starfinder: Afterlight, we asked the Spanish team their opinion on the thorny matter. CEO and co-founder Richard Pillosu was crystal-clear: he'd like AI to help him with daily tasks around the house, but he doesn't really want it to touch any creative areas.</p>



<p><em>The problem with AI is that AI should be doing the things that we don't want to do, and it seems that it wants to do the things that we want to do. We want to do games. We want to invent characters. We want to invent worlds. We want to draw them. We want to invent them for that. Why? We don't want AI for that. I mean, this is the fun part of video game development. I would like an AI that does my dishes and cleans my apartment. Then I can stay creative. But we don't have the AI for that. It seems that the AI that we are being pushed into is the AI that removes this kind of creativity. So, no, no. We could be doing other stuff, but we jumped into making games because we truly love inventing those things and seeing how we connect those things. There is no point in using AI for any creative endeavor. So, no, we don't like it.</em></p>



<p>Famous video game designer and director Hideo Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently shared his own take on AI</a>, calling it 'a friend' that will help him stay ahead. However, he also noted that he wants AI to do the menial tasks while he focuses on the creative part, so in that regard, he is aligned with Pillosu.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/discussing-ghost-of-yoteis-lord-saito-with-actor-feodor-chin-he-and-atsu-are-really-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we interviewed actor Feodor Chin</a>, too, who provided a similar take from his point of view:</p>



<p><em>I think, like with any technology, there is a place for AI as a tool, but I don't think it should ever be a replacement for human beings.</em></p>



<p>Will the games industry be able to use the latest advancements in artificial intelligence to allow humans to give their best creatively without replacing jobs? That remains to be seen, but we'll continue to gauge the opinions within the industry and the various implementations of the development studios.</p>

            <p>
Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair used its newfound success to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">start a publishing arm</a>. This, I think, is generally a net good, even if I have some feelings about the studio as a whole, which we'll dig into shortly. Nobody has money in this industry except for the few who do, so when a few of the few who do decide to put some of that money into much smaller games, that is somewhat of a win. But heed this warning from Pocketpair's communications director and publishing manager John Buckley: they won't publish your game if you use generative AI.
</p>
<p>
Buckley recently spoke with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-don-t-believe-in-it-palworld-maker-pocketpair-wont-be-publishing-games-that-use-generative-ai">Game Developer</a>, saying that he just "doesn't believe" in AI as a technology. Worth noting is that many often accuse Pocketpair of using the stuff in Palworld, a point Buckley does acknowledge: "People are going to say I'm lying, but these are just the hard facts. We don't believe in it. We're very upfront about it. If you're big on AI stuff or your game is Web3 or uses NFTs, there are lots of publishers out there [who'll talk to you], but we're not the right partner for that."
</p>
<p>
Buckley does also know we're seeing more and more games releasing on Steam that he describes as "low quality, AI-made," but to counteract that he thinks "think we're going to enter this kind of authenticity market where people are going to slowly say 'no, these guys are really trying to make something special' to fight back."
</p>
<p>
I do think it's worth highlighting the slight bit of irony here. The quality of Palworld notwithstanding, it is incredibly hard to argue that it doesn't harbour similar issues that AI has. Many of the Pal designs are a regurgitation of various Pokemon designs, but worse, or even more crude, removing them from their original contexts, or assigning them new ones that don't make much sense.
</p><p>
I'm not exactly thrilled that one of the poster creatures, that big yellow guy you can see up in the featured image, is essentially My Neighbour Totoro's titular beastie but with a gatling gun, personally. Everyone knows how anti-war Hayao Miyazaki is! It genuinely is great to hear a studio like Pocketpair, which has the financial capability to back other, smaller independent games, take a stance against AI. I just also hope that they look at the tech steadily encroaching on the games industry, and think about the ways they might perpetuate its aesthetic sensibilities.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ubisoft is asking an unknown number of developers at the studio behind <em>The Division 2</em>, <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>, and <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> to voluntarily lay themselves off as part of the French publisher’s latest cost-cutting restructuring.</p> <p>“As part of our ongoing evolution and long-term planning, we have recently realigned our teams and resources to strengthen our roadmap, ensuring our continued focus on <em>The Division</em> franchise and the technologies, including Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect, that power our games,” the Sweden-based studio <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1981020343587258732/photo/1">announced in a statement</a> on Wednesday. “To support this transition responsibly, we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.”</p>

 <p>Massive was acquired by Ubisoft from Activision Blizzard back in 2008. It initially began supporting the publisher on <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> and<em> Far Cry</em> before spearheading the development of <em>The Division</em>, an ambitious multiplayer shooter that let players team up or fight one another over loot in a ghostly depiction of post-outbreak New York. While its Snowdrop engine is now being used in the development of the next<em> Far Cry</em>, recent licensed projects like <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> and <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> haven’t delivered new best-selling franchises.</p>

 <p>The cuts come as Ubisoft shifts its management structure under a new deal with Chinese conglomerate Tencent which has invested over $1 billion in a a smaller subsidiary called Vantage Studios which will prioritize franchises like <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>. With none of the projects it leads in that group, Massive appears to be on the chopping block, though it’s unclear how many actual developers will be laid off as part of this new initiative.</p> <p>The studio says it will remain focused on delivering promised content within the<em>&nbsp;Division</em> universe, including<em> The Division 2</em>,<em> The Division 2: Survivors</em>,<em> The Division Resurgence</em>, and and eventual <em>Division 3</em>.</p>
