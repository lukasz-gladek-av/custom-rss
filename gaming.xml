            <p>
Fortnite players were last night treated to a mini live event, as the battle royale capped off its current Greek god season, and set up a grittier, heavy metal-infused new season to come. 
</p>
<p>
The event seemed to show a moment of revenge from the now-felled Greek god Zeus, as his statue charged up the map's enormous Pandora's Box and unleashed a new threat to the Island.
</p>
<p>
The action began at 7pm UK time when, for the third day running, Zeus' giant statue atop Mount Olympus began glowing with light. In-game combat was temporarily paused as the statue raised its sword aloft and red lightning shot upwards - and then came crashing down onto Pandora's Box.

</figure>
<p>
Filled to the brim with energy over the past three days, the Box then spat out energy itself, sending players into the sky for a bird's eye view on what happened next: energy fizzing out of the Box and skipping across the map like a stone skimming across a pond. 
</p>
<p>
With a further explosion, the energy transformed into a dark sandstorm, which is now approaching the Island, red energy crackling.

Fortnite's next season, subtitled Wrecked, will launch on 25th May. It's expected to have Mad Max-inspired vibes, while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">recent leaked roadmap suggested there will be a major crossover with Metallica</a>.
</p>
<p>
Music accompanying last night's live event even seemed to subtly hint at this, as its initial Greek choral sound transformed into an electric guitar riff from veteran Fortnite live event composer Phill Boucher.

This is the second season in a row where Fortnite has featured a mini live event, following the reveal and opening of Pandora's Box back in March. I wrote at the time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-giant-hand-event-was-a-return-to-the-games-uniqueness-of-old">how these moments restore the uniqueness of Fortnite</a> - and continue to show off things few other games can do.
</p>
<p>"The cynical might see this all as a smart bit of viral marketing to ensure players are aware a big seasonal change is coming and that their V-Bucks are appropriately topped up," I wrote. "But as someone who has followed Fortnite's labyrinthine lore closely over the years - and decried the dirth of narrative over much of the past 12 months - it is still thrilling to watch unfold."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-ccu/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the game's PC release yesterday, PlayStation's Ghost of Tsushima is off to a good start on PC.</p>
<p>The PC version of the 2020 PS4 (and PS5) title was launched through Steam yesterday, and despite a PSN account requirement for the game's online mode, the game quickly claimed the third spot when it comes to peak player numbers for PlayStation-published PC titles. At the moment of writing, the game had an all-time peak of nearly 58.000 concurrent players, <a href="https://steamdb.info/franchise/PlayStation+Studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thereby beating other high-profile PlayStation Studios titles</a>, including Horizon: Zero Dawn, Horizon: Forbidden West, The Last of Us Part 1, Days Gone, and Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection. Currently, the CCU peak for Ghost of Tsushima is only being bested by God of War and, <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-passes-starfield-and-destiny-2-ccu-steam-numbers-servers-now-capped-at-450k-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">without much of a surprise, Helldivers 2</a>. Right now, nearly 40.000 PC players are playing the game.</p>
<p>We've included a screenshot of the chart for PlayStation Studios titles on PC (via SteamDB) below:</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-steamdb.png"></a></figure>

<p>It will be interesting to see how player numbers for the game will evolve over time. Do you believe that the game would have a higher CCU on Steam if a PSN account for the game's Legends multiplayer mode wasn't required? Hit the comments below.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima is available globally now for PC, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check out this comparison</a> to see how the PC version compared to the PS5 version. Here's what we wrote about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 game in our launch review back then</a>:</p>
<p><em>"Content-wise, Ghost of Tsushima certainly impressed during the playthrough. Its map (divided into three zones, Izuhara, Toyotama and Kamiagata, that are unlocked as you progress through the story) is simply huge and there's a lot to do, more than enough in fact to keep most players occupied for dozens of hours.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond the main tale and the aforementioned 'ally' side content, there are also a great number of secondary tales. Sucker Punch devised a rather interesting way to point out these local tales for the player. When you manage to free civilians who've been captured by the Mongols, they'll often reward you with rumors of what has been going on in the vicinity, or possibly how they were captured in the first place, which will put the rumored location on your map. Again, even it's not quite a revolutionary feature, it's a nice way to organically weave side content into an open world design."</em></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Killing Floor 3 - Killing Floor 15th Anniversary Developer Diary</p>
      </div>
<p>When it came to creating the third game in the franchise, the developers are looking to find the perfect balance between old and new. "I knew I wanted it to return to [Killing Floor 1's] level of horror, have some cult elements, but become a little more mainstream," said studio creative director Bryan Wynia, who only joined Tripwire after the release of Killing Floor 2, but has been a fan of the franchise for a lot longer.</p><p>Wynia briefly touches on the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the Killing Floor 3 development process--though in this case it actually turned into an unexpected positive. With the entire studio switching to remote work, it meant Tripwire could now "open the floodgates to people that wanted to be part of the team."</p><p>At that point in development, the Tripwire team was working on early concepts for Killing Floor 3, experimenting with fun new ways the game could play. While early prototypes for the game were just rough, greyboxed levels, it was enough for the team to get a feel for what <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-revealed-during-opening-night-live-with-gruesome-trailer/1100-6517080/" data-ref-id="1100-6517080">Killing Floor 3's gruesome reveal trailer</a> might look like when it was ready to reveal it last year.</p><p>"It's been 10 years [since Killing Floor 2]; let's step the game right up and give people some new challenges," Tripwire VP Alan Wilson concludes in the anniversary video, which shows off plenty of footage of the new sequel in development.</p><p>Killing Floor 3 is set in the year 2091, 70 years after the events of Killing Floor 2. Taking the role of an operative from rebel group Nightfall, the player can join up to five teammates in their fight against megacorp Horzine and its army of obedient bio-engineered monstrosities called Zeds.</p>

Supergiant Games is already proving the utility of its early-access period, with a majority of Patch 1's changes implemented as a result of player feedback--including one major quality-of-life change.</p><p>The first patch makes resource-gathering far less of a chore, which will be a relief to everyone who found the original process too grindy. "You now can gather from <em>any</em> resource point once you have unlocked the corresponding Gathering Tool," the patch notes read. "You now can Prioritize any available Tool in the Training Grounds to make its resources appear as often as before, while resources for Tools you do not Prioritize will appear far less often."</p>

<p>The update should go a long way towards solving players' frustrations with resource gathering, making it easier to target the resources you really need from any given run.</p><p>The update has also made a number of changes to the player's Dash and Sprint. "Your Sprint is innately faster and turning is more responsive," the patch notes read, also noting that abilities that boost the Sprint have also been re-scaled. The Swift Runner tarot card has also received a new bonus, and will now make your Dash immediate as well.</p><p>The standard Dash has also gotten an overall upgrade, with it now being more reliable to Dash out of many attack-recovery animations. Supergiant has also tweaked the Dash to make it easier to cross chasms in a certain biome of the game.</p><p>The patch includes a handful of other small quality-of-life fixes and balance tweaks in response to players' early feedback, such as being able to see your current Gold amount from a Well of Charon without having to check your Boon Info. A number of bugs have also been fixed up in Patch 1.</p><p>Check out the full patch notes below, though beware they do contain some spoilers.

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time, but the game could impact the industry as a whole if it performs below expectations.</p>
<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KyleBosman">Kyle Bosman</a>, Mat Piscatella, Executive Director and Video Game Industry Advisor at Circana (NPD), commented on the sixth entry in the series by Rockstar Games that was confirmed yesterday to release<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/"> in late 2025</a>. According to the analyst and industry advisor, the game will be the biggest entertainment launch to date in terms of overall spending in its launch period. However, it will face plenty of challenges, so it is difficult to say if it will replicate GTA V's smashing success or build on top of it. The market has changed in the past few years, peaking in 2020 and 2021 in terms of overall spending and engagement, peaks that haven't been reached since. As such, the industry is playing the "share" game as opposed to the "growth" game it has played for a long time, and games are competing for a known amount of players' money and time.</p>
<p>In this market, Grand Theft Auto VI has to compete not only with established franchises as Call of Duty but also with those "forever" games like Fortnite, Minecraft and Roblox, which continue to be extremely successful in terms of engagement. Another big competitor is GTA V, as it is unknown if the new entry in the series will be able to make fans of its predecessor purchase a new console to play it. If there's one game, however, that could bring back the hours of engagement lost since 2020 and 2021 is the Rockstar Games open-world title, according to Piscatella, but it is not yet known if it will be capable of bringing the gaming industry to grow again.</p>
<p>While a single game making or breaking the industry sounds a little excessive,&nbsp; a lot seems to be riding on Grand Theft Auto VI's success, as usually, one single game doing well can change the entire story of a quarter. In this regard, Mat Piscatella mentioned how Helldivers II success changed the discourse on the previous quarter regarding where the consumer is in video gaming. At the end of the day, Piscatella continued, the gaming industry is a hit-driven industry, so, hypothetically, if Grand Theft Auto VI or the Nintendo Switch 2 perform below expectations, the discourse in the industry would be very negative. If they do above expectations, however, we will hear statements on how the gaming industry is back.</p>
<p><iframe title="Actual Gaming Business Facts with Mat Piscatella" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YlsDoGVwPbs?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That a lot is riding on Grand Theft Auto VI's success is no mystery. Take-Two Interactive CEO Straus Zelnick highlighted yesterday how he expects the game to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-sales-not-affected-by-launch-window-take-two-ceo-believes-expects-game-to-move-consoles-aplenty/">a massive system seller</a>. If that will be the case, then the industry may indeed be back to growing after these past few years where it has stalled.</p>

IGN has asked Sega for comment.</p><p>Creative Assembly has endured a difficult time in recent years, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-cancels-creative-assemblys-hyenas">the cancellation of its live-service shooter Hyenas</a> as well as the sales failure of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/total-war-pharaoh">Total War: Pharaoh</a>, released last year. The studio also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/total-war-developer-creative-assembly-apologises-to-its-community-issues-partial-refunds-for-pharaoh"><u>apologized for various missteps it had made with Total War: Warhammer 3 DLC</u></a>.</p><p>In March, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/layoffs-hit-sega-europe-total-war-developer-creative-assembly-and-sonic-dream-team-developer-hardlight-sega-sells-relic-entertainment">Sega announced sweeping layoffs</a> that affected Sega Europe, Creative Assembly, and Sonic Dream Team developer Hardlight. Meanwhile, Sega off-loaded Company of Heroes and Dawn of War developer Relic Entertainment</p><p>At the time, Sega told IGN that Creative Assembly “continues to have multiple projects in development with Total War and a new unannounced project.”</p><p>Total War fans have called on Creative Assembly to give a Star Wars game a shot for years, although there are equally vociferous calls for the studio to follow its <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Warhammer trilogy of Total War games</a> with a similar effort for Warhammer 40,000.</p><p>That’s all we have for now. Creative Assembly has traditionally used gamescom as a platform to show off its games. Perhaps we’ll know more when gamescom 2024 launches in August.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Summer Game Fest has announced its first round of partners for this year's event.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/summergamefest/status/1791137883367030845">revealed on Thursday</a>, 55 companies will be taking part in the two-hour showcase to be held on June 7, 2024, including Xbox and PlayStation, alongside publishers such as Epic Games, Electronic Arts, Bandai Namco, Capcom, Sega, WB Games, and Ubisoft.</p>
<p>The inclusion of Xbox, PlayStation and Ubisoft are most likely references to their individual showcases which the companies run alongside Summer Game Fest.</p>
<p>The Xbox Games Showcase will take place on June 9, with Ubisoft Forward following on June 10. PlayStation has yet to announce when it will hold its showcase.</p>
<p>Nintendo has announced it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-switch-2-promises-announcement-by-april-2025">will broadcast a Nintendo Direct in June</a>, but this does not appear to be connected to Summer Game Fest.</p>
<p>Summer Game Fest is fronted by Geoff Keighley and has been trying to establish itself as a replacement for E3, the long-running trade show which <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/e3-officially-abandoned-by-the-esa">shut down last year</a>.</p>
<p>It faces some competition from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/now-ign-details-its-answer-to-e3s-cancellation">IGN Live</a>, which is the media site's answer to E3 and is de to run June 7 to 9, 2024 in Los Angeles.</p>

<p data-characters="381" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After Take-Two Interactive announced it would be <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gta-publisher-take-two-is-laying-off-five-percent-of-staff-a-few-months-after-saying-it-had-no-current-plans-for-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laying off 5% of its workforce</a> in April, it was reported just a couple of weeks later that the company would also be shuttering two of its subsidiaries: Roll7 and Intercept Games. However, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has denied closing down any such studios while at the same time refusing to confirm that they’re still open.</p> <p data-characters="475" data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true">During an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Zelnick was asked about why it was decided that Roll7 (the London-based studio behind <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/rollerdrome-review-destructoid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rollerdrome</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-olliolli-world-pc-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OlliOlli World</a></em>) and Intercept Games (the Seattle-based studio that made <em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em>) would close. Zelnick simply answered with, “We didn’t shutter those studios,” adding, “We’ve announced that we’re saving $165 million in existing and future costs, but we haven’t shuttered anything.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Intercept Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="533" data-current-count="833" data-injectable="true">IGN did push for a definitive answer on whether this means both studios remain operational, but a PR representative stepped in to refer back to the company’s cost reduction plan. Basically, all Take-Two is willing to say is that 5% of staff worldwide were let go, but it “did not give a label-by-label breakdown of what that looks like.” When asked again about the status of Roll7 and Intercept Games, the PR representative only said, “We have not provided any additional color beyond what I just said.”</p>
 <p data-characters="616" data-current-count="616" data-injectable="true">So, does this mean Take-Two is denying the Bloomberg report? Again, it didn’t offer a concrete answer but, in the wake of IGN’s interview, Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier posted on Twitter part of the note Roll7 employees had received and shared with him. The note clearly states, “We are therefore proposing to shut down [Roll7].” As for Intercept Games, Bloomberg had spotted a notice filed with the Washington State Employment Security Department, which showed Take-Two intended to shut down a Seattle-based office and cut 70 employees. That description perfectly matches Intercept Games.</p>
 <p data-characters="862" data-current-count="862" data-injectable="true">This whole situation is frankly bizarre since there is evidence of Roll7 and Intercept Games’ closure, yet Take-Two is saying this isn’t the case. Surely if Take-Two intended to keep both studios open, it would just say so, but it isn’t for some reason. Although this wouldn’t be the first time Take-Two’s done this. 2K Marin, the studio behind <em>BioShock 2</em>, was shut down in 2013 after mass layoffs (per <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sources-bureau-xcom-bioshock-2-dev-essentially-closed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>), but 2K never acknowledged the closure. Zelnick even insisted that 2K Marin would be responsible for helming the <em>BioShock</em> series months after reports of the studio’s closure (per <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zelnick-2k-marin-now-responsible-for-bioshock-franchise" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>). For the record, a new <em>BioShock</em> is in development, but at a new internal studio called Cloud Chamber, which had taken over 2K Marin’s old San Francisco office according to a 2019 report by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-in-development-at-new-2k-studio-cloud-chamber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="446" data-injectable="false">I cannot fathom what advantage there is to pretending that a studio is still open. It’s bad enough that studio shutdowns are becoming distressingly common in the games industry, with Microsoft just <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently closing four of its own, including Tango Gameworks</a>. If the 2K Marin example is anything to go by, Take-Two may not ever formally announce the closures of Roll7 and Intercept Games, even if we never see a new game from either of them.</p>

Microsoft is adding the ability to pre-download game updates before their scheduled release. 
</p>
<p>
The feature, which is already available on PlayStation, allows you to download hefty game updates days before their release. Then, when the update is formally released, the update simply installs - meaning less wait time to get playing. 
</p>
<p>
Microsoft has <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/xbox-insider-release-notes/console/alpha/2024/05/alpha-2406-240509-2000">begun</a> rolling out the feature to those in the Alpha ring of Xbox Insider testers, before it filters down to more people and eventually becomes public in the coming weeks.

<p>
The first game to take advantage of update pre-downloading will be the Insider build of Rare's nautical online multiplayer title Sea of Thieves.
</p>
<p>
While the whole process should all happen behind the scenes, you'll be able to check the status of any pre-downloaded updates from the My games &amp; apps &gt; Manage &gt; Updates menu.
</p>
<p>
In other recent Xbox update news, Microsoft has now <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/15/xbox-may-update-2024/">added</a> the ability to use your mouse and keyboard with Xbox Cloud Gaming on web browsers, beginning with 25 games.

            <p>
Creative Assembly is reportedly working on three new Total War games, including an officially licensed Star Wars game.
</p>
<p>
The news comes from <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-works-at-creative-assembly/">DualShockers</a>, which has reported as of October 2023 Total War: Star Wars was one of three games in development at the studio.
</p>
<p>
The studio's most recent game was Total War: Pharaoh, but a Star Wars game would see it return to the more fantastical settings of Total War: Warhammer and (to an extent) Total War: Three Kingdoms. 
</p>

<p>
The report from DualShockers does not provide further detail on Total War: Star Wars, nor does it name the other two in development. As such, it's impossible to know how far along in development the game is.
</p>
<p>
Still, with Creative Assembly releasing new games almost annually, perhaps an announcement for its 2024 slate is due soon.
</p>
<p>
Until then, the studio is working on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-war-pharaoh-getting-four-new-factions-as-part-of-free-update">free update to Total War: Pharaoh</a>, which will rework the campaign to expand its map and add new playable factions.

</p>
<p>
Before this, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/creative-assembly-apologises-for-missteps-with-total-war-series-offers-pharaoh-refunds">apologised for missteps with the series</a> and offered refunds on Pharaoh after its poor reception from players due to high price and lack of content.

</p>
<p>
This, alongside the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-has-cancelled-hyenas">high profile cancellation of loot shooter Hyenas</a> last year, suggests a tricky time for the studio. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-war-developer-creative-assembly-refocusing-on-strategy-games-after-hyenas-failure">studio will now refocus on strategy games</a>, adding further credence to reports of these three new Total War games. A Star Wars version would certainly help turn around the studio's fortunes.

            <p>You might remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enotria-the-last-song">Enotria: The Last Song</a> as the Italian-inspired <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/italian-inspired-soulslike-enotria-the-last-song-moves-release-date-to-august-to-avoid-elden-ring-dlc">shifted its release date</a> from June to August to avoid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-date">Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>... but found itself nestled next to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-release-date-details-everything-we-know">Black Myth: Wukong</a>. Well, scratch that August release, as now it's been shifted back to September instead! But hey, there's a demo coming out real soon that'll hopefully give us a better sense of what the game's like. I imagine it'll involve a lot of fighting spindly monsters, dying, and resurrecting at whatever object they've decided will be the equivalent of Dark Souls' bonfires. Likely something Leonardo da Vinci made or drew or invented. That man's stats were specced <em>high</em>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Enotria's now officially arriving on the 19th of September on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and Xbox. A nice date, I think, that gives us Soulsheads plenty of time to digest Shadow Of The Erdtree and navigate its many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-enemy-revealed-a-bloke-with-a-basket-for-a-head">basket-headed individuals</a>.</p>
<p>As for Enotria's demo, that'll arrive on May 22nd on PC. It'll be around 8-hours long and start you off in "Quinta, the City of Actors", where you'll almost certainly parry lots of dribbly theatre kids who give off an irksome vibe. You'll do that with four weapon classes, six masks, 20 spells and 30 perks. Masks, by the way, are ways of equipping different attack styles and building loadouts. There's no word on whether demo progress will carry into the full game, which suggests that it won't be the case.</p>
<p>Shadow Of The Erdtree is more on my mind right now, but I'm certainly excited for Enotria. It's cool to see a Soulslike with a summery setting and an obvious slant towards buildcrafting. I can find buildcrafting a bit much, though, especially as someone who is very happy to use the same broadsword for an entire playthrough. Then again, if it's implemented well, Enotria might encourage me to be a bit more playful and/or force my hand if enemies suddenly develop broadsword immunity.</p>
<p>You can keep up with Enotria over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102450/Enotria_The_Last_Song/">Steam</a>, where you'll find its demo at the time of release, too.</p>

            <p>
Fae Farm and Dauntless developer Phoenix Labs is undergoing a significant restructure, cancelling all other projects and laying off around 140 staff.
</p>
<p>
The studio shared the news in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7196925181712343042/">LinkedIn post</a>, stating that after a "long period of evaluating how to navigate our economic environment, we have had to significantly restructure the company to pave a path for a strong future."
</p>
<p>
The statement does not specify how many staff are affected by layoffs, but principal engineer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7196912654806835200/">Kris Morness</a> posted "about 140" people have been impacted. What's more, one of the cancelled projects includes a game set to be announced in a month's time.

<p>
"We are reorganising Phoenix Labs to focus on our best-in-class live service titles, Dauntless and Fae Farm, and serving their communities," the studio's statement continues.
</p>
<p>
"This unfortunately means cancelling work on all other projects at the studio, which will impact many of our colleagues immediately. We are giving notices to everyone whose roles are affected.
</p>
<p>
"This restructure has not come easily, and truly has been the last resort to ensure Phoenix Labs can survive, and thrive in the long term. It's impossible to put into words how deeply we value every talented individual who has contributed their hard work and passion to every project at our studio."
</p>
<p>
The Vancouver and Montreal-based Phoenix Labs was founded in 2014 by former Riot developers. Dauntless, its first game, is an ARPG released in 2018, while farming life sim Fae Farm was released just last year.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fae-farm-developer-phoenix-labs-lays-off-34-staff">developer laid off 34 staff last December</a> across its publishing, HR, IT and shared services teams. "Our games teams were unaffected and our work continues across our titles at Phoenix Labs," it said at the time.

            <p>I've clocked up nearly 400 hours playing BioWare's big fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition/">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, which is not a stat I'm particularly proud of. I'm not ashamed either, partly because, as has been identified by artist <a href="https://x.com/CoreyBrickley/status/1791294517687050483">Corey Brickley</a>, via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-13th-may-17th-may-2024#coverage-8je7o6">the Maw</a>, there's a lot of filler. Brickley has <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qe6mn9eQdCFyXWdgdNk-wBD4OtFAUsNCK4lRplvkXcY/edit">collated a list of suggested mods</a> to slim down Dragon Age: Inquisition from a potentially 80 hours-long epic to a trim 40 hour story-focused romp, which means you might be able to play through it again in time for the launch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a> - which is a direct sequel to Inquisition.</p>
<p>I find this list of mods interesting! It's a way to change the game quite substantially without exactly transforming it, and it's very in-keeping with my campaign to make games 60% smaller. Still, there's at least one item on there I'd push back on, but also this isn't really a new problem for Dragon Age as a series.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Among the mods Brickley suggests is one that makes looting instant, removing an animation of your Inquisitor bending over to pick plants which will honestly save you at least 2 cumulative hours over the course of the whole game. There's also one to boost loot, and an XP multiplier so you level up way faster. One that I would suggest is absolutely essential is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonageinquisition/mods/1454">More Banter</a> mod. Inquisition is party-based, and there are hundreds of lines of inter-party banter unique to different party combinations you might have, but in the base game they almost never trigger. This mod makes them actually happen, which is good.</p>
<p>I don't think removing the map Fog Of War is super necessary, although I get the appeal of having all the fast travel locations open straight away. But surely exploration is the most funnest bit of filler content in an RPG? Brickley also suggests one that makes actions at the in-game War Table all <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonageinquisition/mods/479">happen instantly</a> and honestly, I think that one just makes the War Table unfun. I like the War Table! It's a decent bit of roleplayering in the game and making it all instant turns it into a dreary boxticking exercise. Might as well fuck the table out the window entirely.</p>
<p>People have always been trying to make Dragon Age a bit less annoying, though. Dragon Age 2, which is the cool kids' favourite Dragon Age, has the illusion of having a lot of filler because it reuses a bunch of the same cave maps when you go on missions, but because it's much shorter than the other two games, the mods are all just to give the women nicer hair. Going back to Dragon Age: Origins, one of the most popular mods is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/816">Skip The Fade</a>, a mod that removes a chunk of the game on the basis that it is annoying to play through.</p>
<p>In the context of fandom I see Brickley's list, a compilation of work by different modders, as just another brick in the wall of tradition of Dragon Age fans being kind of annoyed by the series, and in that sense I welcome it. And I find it super interesting how transformative a selection of mods can be when they're not, in a sense, transformative. This list makes the game shorter without technically removing anything, which is fascinating to sit and think about.</p>
<p>The tradition of being annoyed by Dragon Age while simultaneously loving it looks set to continue. Dreadwolf - which could be out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-set-to-arrive-by-next-march-according-to-report">next March</a> after about a decade in development - has been overhauled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/before-a-2017-reboot-dragon-age-4-was-about-wizard-heists">at least once</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-production-director-and-mass-effect-veteran-leaves-bioware">lost a bunch of staff</a> (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-production-director-and-mass-effect-veteran-leaves-bioware">more than once</a>) suffered some <em>alleged</em> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-leaks-show-off-faster-paced-action">leaks last year</a> suggesting the combat could be real time action more akin to God Of War. So. That all sounds great. The stage is set for Dreadwolf's full reveal this summer. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/creative-assembly-is-developing-a-star-wars-total-war-game-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.873816/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/total-war-star-wars/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>A new report from DualShockers has claimed that Creative Assembly is developing a new Total War game based on the Star Wars universe. </p>



<p>According to the outlet’s <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-works-at-creative-assembly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>, a total of three different Total War games are in development. Total War Star Wars (or whatever it will be called) will apparently be the second game of the three to release, but it’s unclear on how long the game has left in development.</p>



<p>I first got wind of a ‘futuristic’ Total War game in late 2022, with several other second-hand sources reaching out since and stating that the game is based in the Star Wars universe. So, in my opinion, at least, the rumor has a lot of credence and is likely real.</p>



<p>Currently, Creative Assembly is developing a massive update for Total War: Pharoh, whilst its other projects are officially not announced following the cancellation of Hyenas and other unannounced projects. In late 2023, SEGA announced that the cancellations of some of Creative Assembly’s projects and staff reductions were to “reduce various costs”.</p>



<p>The company said, “We will reduce various fixed costs at multiple group companies in the region, centered on The Creative Assembly Ltd. We expect to incur one-time costs related to fixed cost reductions.”</p>



<p>Hyenas was Creative Assembly’s most expensive project to date and by a lot of accounts, was almost ready to be released.</p>



<p>What do you think of a Star Wars Total War game? Let us know in the comment below.</p>

PS5 has sold over 59 million units since going on sale in November 2020, and it has yet to see a price cut. Infact, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-is-getting-a-price-increase-in-europe-canada-mexico-asia-and-australia">Sony has raised the price of the console</a>.</p><p>Speaking to the investment community (<a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1791091935215571338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as reported by Totilo</a>) Sony president Hiroki Totoki painted a rosy picture of the situation, saying MAUs will steadily increase as PS4 players eventually upgrade to PS5, but as Daniel Ahmad, Director of Research and Insights at Niko Partners, pointed out in a tweet, the transition from PS4 to PS5 has so far been “slow.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>On console PlayStation Network MAU’s have barely grown since the PS5 launch. </p><p>It’s just been a slow transition from PS4 &gt; PS5</p></div>— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1791105314500067566?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>So, why have so many PS4 gamers held off on upgrading to a PS5? Or, perhaps to put it a better way, why are so many PS4 gamers content to stick with the console they have?</p><p>Mat Piscatella, Executive Director and Video Game Industry Advisor at Circana, suggested in a <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1791095962947244176" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a> that the most-played games in the U.S. are all currently available on the last generation of consoles, and that’s enough for most people. These games (Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, GTA 5, and Call of Duty), are all available on PS4. “Any console that can play a majority of, or all five, of these games will be just fine for many people,” Piscatella commented.</p><p>This is not a situation unique to PlayStation, either, Piscatella added, as it affects all consoles. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-shipped-almost-5x-more-than-xbox-series-x-and-s-during-last-quarter-analyst-reports">IGN has already reported on tumbling sales of the Xbox Series X and S</a>, which looks like it will struggle to outsell its predecessor, the much-maligned Xbox One. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-rares-sea-of-thieves-tops-the-ps5-sales-chart-whats-the-next-xbox-game-to-go-multiplatform">Microsoft’s answer includes bringing its Xbox games to rival platforms</a>, including PS5, but it has also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-next-gen-console-confirmed-business-update">committed to releasing a more powerful next-gen console</a>, and there are rumors <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-official-xbox-handheld-rumors-swirl-phil-spencer-reveals-what-he-wants-from-it">it plans an Xbox handheld</a>, too.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The Best PS4 Games (Summer 2020 Update)</h3></div></output><p>As for Sony, PS5 sales currently trail those of PS4 after the same amount of time after launch, but it’s worth pointing out the PS4 had undergone price cuts totaling $100 by now. Sony has said it expects PS5 sales to continue to decline, although it is also expected to launch a PS5 Pro later this year.</p><p>Sony’s plan to increase sales and profits from PlayStation in the coming years depends upon its ability to expand the number of active PlayStation users and user engagement, and cutting business costs. In February, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-significant-playstation-layoffs-affecting-900-staff-london-studio-to-close">Sony announced a significant round of layoffs</a> affecting around 900 staff, or about 8% of its global PlayStation workforce. The layoffs affect a number of PlayStation studios, including Insomniac, Naughty Dog, Guerrilla, Firesprite, and, most significantly, PlayStation's London studio. Alongside the layoffs, a number of in-development games were canceled.</p><p>Sony also plans to grow sales of first-party games. It has said this financial year ending March 2025 will not see the release of big new games in its major franchises, ruling out sequels in the Spider-Man and God of War series. But Sony is expected to release a number of big-hitters from April 2025 onwards, including the likes of Insomniac’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Wolverine</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
Hades 2 creative director Greg Kasavin said the game will be in early access "at least through the end of this year".
</p>
<p>
The much-anticipated rogue-lite sequel released into early access on PC on 6th May, though it's unknown when the game will be fully released.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hades-2s-creative-director-says-we-expect-to-be-in-early-access-at-least-through-the-end-of-this-year/">PC Gamer</a> in the wake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-hades-2-patch-aims-to-underline-melinoes-distinct-swift-style">the game's first patch</a>, Kasavin detailed Supergiant's plans for the foreseeable future.

<p>

"In the short run, we plan to deploy at least a couple of relatively small patches to improve parts of the game where we can think of short-term improvements that alleviate issues we've heard from some players, while hopefully making the game even better for those already pleased with it," said Kasavin.
</p>
<p>
"Then, we'll focus on our first Major Update, which will take us several months during which the game won't be updated. This Major Update will include new features, locations, foes, and other content. Then we'll patch that a few times to shore up any issues, and repeat this broader process... until we consider the game complete! We expect to be in early access at least through the end of this year."
</p>
<p>
In its current state, Hades 2 already feels like a more complete experience than Hades 1 was when that began early access. 
</p>
<p>
The first game was in early access for almost two years (across Epic and then Steam), so it seems like Hades 2 will be wrapped up quicker. The 1.0 release of Hades 1 coincided with its console release on Switch, which was later followed by Xbox and PlayStation releases almost a year later.
</p>
<p>
Does this mean Hades 2 could also see a console release at its 1.0 release after the end of this year? We can but hope.
</p>
<p>
Kasavin's comments follow the game's first patch, which released yesterday. Much of the focus has been on protagonist Melinoë's movement, allowing players to sprint faster and dash out of attack recovery animations more reliably. Further, players can gather from any resource point once the corresponding Gathering Tool has been unlocked. Full patch notes are available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4175477072263852699">Steam</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-launch-on-steam-reaches-over-100k-concurrent-players-24-hours-after-launch">Hades 2 reached a peak concurrent player count of over 100,000 players</a> within 24 hours of release. Player counts have dipped since then, likely as the 1.0 release is anticipated.


</p>
<p>"Supergiant's first ever sequel may feel very comfortable and familiar, but Hades' best weapon remains the power of surprise," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Eurogamer Hades 2 early access review</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">Open world</a> crime-a-thon <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> will release next “fall”, according to publisher Take-Two Interactive’s latest earning report, via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">Eurogamer.</a> This narrows the previously announced release window of “2025” down by, uh, infinity I suppose? A year is an effectively endless stretch in terms of release calenders. But “Fall”, despite not being a real season, is something I can work with.</p>

<p>This means the coveted sequel to the 200m selling <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> will arrive roughly twelve years after. Coveted not least by Take-Two themselves, unsurprisingly. "Our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase" they said, expecting “tremendous growth.” Elsewhere, they said they’re “highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience". Love a good unparalleled entertainment experience, me. </p>
<p>All this is contrary to the rumblings that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> might end up shipping <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-could-slip-to-2026-under-rockstar-fallback-plan-according-to-reports">as late as 2026</a> under a "fallback plan" at Rockstar. An anonymous source told <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-development-2026-delay-rockstar-office-release-1851359831">Kotaku</a> that studio heads were “worried” the game could drive-by 2025 completely, and not see release until the following year. Kotaku’s source also mentioned that Rockstar were aiming for a Spring 2025 release date at the time. It’s this worry that’s also blamed for Rockstar’s earlier decision to mandate that remote and hybrid staff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-reportedly-orders-gta-6-developers-to-end-hybrid-working-in-the-name-of-quality-and-polish">return to office</a>. As Edwin points out in that piece, it’s hard to not view such a mandate as deeply selfish, or just plain wrongheaded at best. Especially since, even putting employee comfort aside (which I’m sure they did), there’s evidence to suggest remote work is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200710-the-remote-work-experiment-that-made-staff-more-productive">more productive anyway</a>.</p>

<p>Whenever the game releases, two things strike me as certainties. 1. Chirpy cockney urchin Strauss Zelnick will finally get a hot meal and 2. It’ll be a good time! Rockstar don’t really make bad games any more. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2 was great</a>, especially the boring bits! I like shaving! It’s satisfying! Shame about all the predatory MTX and crunch and layoffs and all that, but you can’t make good games and not do all that!  Oh, wait, hang on. I’m just being informed of the many good games that prove me wrong. Bum.</p>

			<p>New Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut comparisons were shared online, highlighting the differences between the PC and PlayStation 5 versions.</p>
<p>The comparisons, put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1">Cycu1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TerraWare">Terra Ware</a>, highlight how the PC and PlayStation 5 versions don't look too different from one another, not counting the higher resolutions possible on PC, which return a clearer and sharper image. Still, the PC version does look better than the console version, thanks to higher-quality shadows, volumetric fog, and ambient occlusion.</p>

<p><em>Ghost of Tsushima is Sucker Punch's best game yet and a great open-world title capable of measuring to some of the biggest names in the genre.

        <p>Changes coming with upcoming Echoes update following the title being dropped by publisher Digital Extremes</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>  <div>



            <p>Wayfinder is transforming from a free-to-play online-only multiplayer game into a premium single-player offering after the game lost its publisher last year.</p>
<p>Developer Airship Syndicate announced that the upcoming Echoes update to the game will remove all online requirements, leaving Wayfinder as a single-player affair with optional three-player co-op.</p>
<p>In doing so, the studio will also remove all microtransactions and in-game purchases, selling the game for a one-time payment of $24.99 during Early Access. This price will increase upon full release.</p>
<p>"We realize this is a big shift, but a necessary one to guarantee that the game is around forever," the team wrote in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1171690/view/4174350531696890458?l=english">announcement post on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Wayfinder was originally published by Warframe developer Digital Extremes, but was dropped when that company <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/digital-extremes-impacted-by-layoffs-closing-publishing-division">closed its publishing division</a> in November 2023.</p>
<p>The impact on Airship Syndicate led to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-airship-syndicate-lays-off-12-staff">12 people being laid off</a> and pay cuts for the studio leadership, but the developer has pressed on with Wayfinder's development.</p>
<p>The Echoes update bringing these changes will be released for current players on May 31st, with Wayfinder being made available for purchase on Steam via Early Access again on June 11th. Airship Syndicate hopes to fully launch the game by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The studio warned that player data and progress will not be carried over after the online requirements have been removed.</p>
<p>Airship Syndicate also said these changes will be introduced to the PlayStation 5 version later this year. The PlayStation 4 version will be discontinued, with all players offered a free upgrade to the PS5 edition.</p>
<p>The developer announced it will also be bringing to Xbox Series X|S in Early Access at some point, with more details later this year.</p>
<p>"We know that the path to get here hasn’t been easy, and the game has had a rocky past," the team wrote. "We also know that this wasn’t the original game that we envisioned or that our fans bought into. When faced with the reality of where we are, we saw our options as shuttering the game fully as other online games have done before or making this pivot and releasing the Echoes Update.</p>
<p>"During this process, we quickly came to the realization that we’re making a superior game for both current and future players. We’d love to support Wayfinder for years. We have ideas for additional characters and new content, and we have the intent to do so if the players demand it and Wayfinder finds a new audience."</p>

		<p>The next few weeks are really going to be ramping up with showcases and announcements, and there was a big one from Ubisoft a couple days ago. Of course, all the games companies reveal will be months, if not years away, so let’s bring the focus back more to the here and now… where I’ve been playing a game that’s a few months away from release. I got to dip a toe into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/16/prison-architect-2-preview-incarcerating-the-third-dimension/">Prison Architect 2</a>, which has a big and daunting task to follow on the cult smash original. That’s been joined by a couple things I can’t talk about yet, so let’s move swiftly on!</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/15/assassins-creed-shadows-confirmed-for-november-release-story-and-characters-revealed/">Assassin’s Creed Shadows announcement</a>, <strong>Dom</strong> has been replaying ACIII, saying, “I don’t know why I really like that one.” <strong>Ade</strong> has a similar love for the series in general, but has been playing&nbsp;Astor: Blade of the Monolith for review, which is a “My-First-Zelda” action RPG kind of game. He’s also made a start on the medieval XCOM-like Crown Wars: The Black Prince for another review, and washed that down with his continuing murder investigation in Pentiment – “No idea who the culprit is but I’m having enormous fun regardless!”</p>

<p>Joining the Assassin’s Creed train, <strong>Aran</strong> has been playing and enjoying the throwback gameplay and size of Assassin’s Creed Mirage. There’s also been some Darksiders Warmastered on Steam Deck, which has a funny old bug where cutscenes aren’t playing.</p>
<p>Jason’s not been Hades 2, and having now beat the final boss for the first time is putting it to one side while Supergiant build the game through Early Access – “It’s incredible, but I’m happy to wait a bit.” So he’s moved on to Inkound from the Monster Train developers, and Gatekeeper, which is a roguelike with top-down Risk of Rain vibes.</p>


<p>Having rampaged through Little Kitty, Big City like a cat in a china shop, Steve has grabbed the platinum trophy in Tales of Kenzera: Zau, which he enjoyed as a combat platformer more than a metroidvania, and moved on to Crow Country for a review.</p>
<p>Gamoc is mostly playing Fallout 4, and adding mods to make it less annoying. His sister also now has Baldur’s Gate 3, so he’s created yet another character to join her world – he’s up to three current characters now – before trying the MOBA Gigantic and Capes for review.</p>
<p>While AC Shadows has made him want to replay Ghost of Tsushima, Nic B’s on night feeding duty, and has been using the wee hours to gett back into MTG’s Arena client and some online play – “even when horrifically sleep deprived, I can still beat people with virtual cardboard.”</p>

<p>Rattling through his hefty gaming diet, Miguel has played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/16/read-only-memories-neurodiver-review/">Read Only Memories: Neurodiver</a>, Panzer Knights, Neptunia Game Maker (R)evolution, Honkai Star Rail, Genshin Impact, some Fortnite, and a pinch of Dread Delusion and Apex Legends!</p>
<p>And Tuffcub has played “Fallout 4, Destiny 2. Kilmarnock vs Rangers is a late kick off,” but reckons that nobody will get this joke anymore. In other news, he’s also been spotted yelling at clouds in the park.</p>
<p><em>That’s us, but what about you? Let us know what you’ve played in the comments below.</em></p>

            <p>
Rockstar's GTA 5 has now sold over 200m copies.
</p>
<p>
This news, said Take Two CEO Strauss Zelnick, exceeded the company's forecast. By its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-closes-in-on-200m-copies-sold">previous financial report, GTA 5 had sold 195m copies</a> - so that's another 5m copies since February.

</p>
<p>
"We are thrilled that more than a decade after their initial releases, Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online grew their audience size by an incredible 35 percent and 23 percent, respectively, for the full year," said Zelnick.

</figure>
<p>

GTA 5 is still the second best-selling game ever behind Minecraft, which at 300m copies is unlikely to be beaten, but this is a staggering number of sales.
</p>
<p>
What's more, Red Dead Redemption 2 also surpassed the company's expectations and has sold almost 64m units globally. Previously, in February, this was at 61m copies. 
</p>
<p>
If you're one of the millions yet to play Rockstar's cowboy simulator, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-headlines-playstation-plus-premium-and-extra-games-for-may">coming to PS Plus later this month</a>.
</p>
<p>
During the financial report, Take Two announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">release window for GTA 6 would be autumn 2025</a>.

</p>
<p>
Will the hotly-anticipated follow-up exceed the sales of GTA 5? We'll have to wait and see, but other studios are likely shifting their release schedules accordingly so as not to compete.
</p>
<p>
"We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase," said Zelnick of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>. "As we release our groundbreaking pipeline, we expect to achieve tremendous growth, including sequential increases in Net Bookings in Fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027."

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-portable-ps4-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-playstation-portable-capable-of-running-ps4-games-is-in-the-works-%E2%80%93-rumor.873780/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-portable-ps4-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony may be gearing up to return to the handheld market with a new PlayStation Portable that will be capable of running PlayStation 4 games, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-sony-is-preparing-for-a-new-psp-that-will-run-ps4-games.873753/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, Russian journalist Anton Logvinov, who was among the first ones to confirm PlayStation exclusives would be coming to PC years back before the official confirmation, revealed on Telegram that the Japanese company is working on a new PSP capable of playing PlayStation 4 games. Unfortunately, the launch lineup is only comprised of games that are also available on PC, and thus on the Steam Deck, so there's a good chance the system hides some surprises, also considering how retailers are apparently skeptical about this portable system.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have heard about Sony working on a new PlayStation Portable system. In February, Moore's Law is Dead talked about <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-handheld-amd-18-cus-1-8-ghz-gpu/">a new system powered by a custom AMD APU</a> designed to maintain compatibility with PS4 and PS5 games. While there's a chance it is the same system Anton Logvinov talked about, the Russian journalist did not talk about PS5 games, so compatibility with current-generation titles has either been kept secret or may be implemented at a later time if this system is indeed in the works.</p>
<p>With the immense popularity of the<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-overclocking-open-world-60-fps/"> Nintendo Switch</a> and other portable gaming systems like the aforementioned Steam Deck, it is not impossible for Sony to decide to get back into the handheld market, especially after releasing the surprisingly successful <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/">PlayStation Portal</a>. Still, we have to take the existence of a new PlayStation Portable with a grain of salt until an official announcement is made.</p>

It’s sold nearly 86 million units across all titles, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-2">Borderlands 2</a> secure as 2K’s top-selling video game with 28 million sold. <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> is 2K’s fastest-selling video game ever, and has sold nearly 20 million units to date.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Borderlands: Games to Movie Comparison</h3></div></output><p>Currently, Gearbox has both a new Borderlands and "at least one exciting new intellectual property" in development. 2K Games plans to reveal the "next iteration in one of its biggest and most beloved franchises" at Summer Game Fest, which is set to take place on Friday, June 7. Fans speculate this game may be Borderlands 4.</p><p>If so, it would match up neatly with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-movie-trailer-reveals-jack-blacks-claptrap-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vibes-and-more-ign-fan-fest-2024"><u>release of the Borderlands movie</u></a>, which comes out on August 9. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-teased-by-gearbox-founder-randy-pitchford"><u>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford</u></a> has teased Borderlands 4 in the past. "Look, we haven't even announced anything of it," Pitchford said back in March. "Clearly, we're working on something. And I know what we're working on, and holy shit... It's the greatest thing we've ever done. And I can't wait, but it's not time yet. It's not time yet. There will be a time."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Speaking in an investor-focused call following its latest financial results, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said the company now plans to double-down on Borderlands, and had already identified “many potential growth opportunities” for the series.</p><p>“Borderlands 3 outpaced our forecasts and we are thrilled that Randy Pitchford and Gearbox Entertainment are slated to join officially 2K’s renowned internal studios in the coming weeks,” Zelnick said.</p><p>“We have already identified many potential growth opportunities for the Borderlands series and Gearbox’s catalog, which we plan to pursue once the studio is integrated into our organization. We are also excited to see growing buzz for the star-studded Borderlands feature film which is planned for release by Lionsgate this summer.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We have already identified many potential growth opportunities for the Borderlands series and Gearbox’s catalog, which we plan to pursue once the studio is integrated into our organization.</p></div><p>The Borderlands franchise has already expanded with a number of video game spin-offs and is set to expand further with the release of the aforementioned Borderlands movie, starring the likes of Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, and Jamie Lee Curtis. One spin-off Take-Two has singled out as doing particularly well is 2022 action role-playing first-person shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands">Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</a>, which is set within the world of a fantasy-themed tabletop RPG.</p><p>Expanding on the decision to buy Gearbox during the investor call, Zelnick said that when the opportunity presented itself to buy the company “on terms that we felt were reasonable, we frankly jumped at the opportunity.”</p><p>“We have all the respect in the world for Randy Pitchford and his team,” Zelnick continued. “He has the ability to bring AAA products to market, responsibly and on a very reliable and rather rapid cadence. And he is a hit maker. And it's very hard to make a new hit, and [Tiny Tino] was a new hit. And of course, Borderlands just goes from strength to strength. So we're thrilled to have Gearbox in the family.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Borderlands just goes from strength to strength. So we're thrilled to have Gearbox in the family.</p></div><p>Based on Zelnick’s comments, we can expect plenty more Borderlands in the future now Gearbox is under the Take-Two umbrella. But there are issues elsewhere in the company. Earlier this month, Take-Two announced a cost reduction plan that included project cancellations and layoffs amounting to 5% of its workforce. Amid this announcement came <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reports based on internal documentation</u></a> that seemed to confirm Take-Two was closing OlliOlli World developer Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 developer Intercept Games. But when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios">IGN asked Zelnick why these closures happened</a>, he replied: "We didn't shutter those studios.” Reports also indicate publishing label Private Division, which is behind  was also gutted.</p><p>This week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-take-two-interactive">Take-Two narrowed the hotly anticipated GTA 6 release date window to fall 2025</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

</header>  <div>



            <p>Singularity 6 has gone through another round of redundancies, laying off 36 people.</p>
<p>Talking to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-palia-studio-singularity-6-lays-off-36-employees">Game Developer</a> (and confirming information from <a href="https://x.com/sweetpotatoes/status/1790866384810811763">Polygon's Nicole Carpenter</a>), the developer said it'll continue supporting its online cosy sim Palia despite the layoffs, which represented around 40% of its staff.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately we have had to restructure and reduce the size of our team as we stay focused on supporting Palia and serving our community long term," a spokesperson from Singularity 6 said. "We had to let 36 of our colleagues go yesterday, in an effort to navigate this tough economic period."</p>
<p>They added: "We thank our departing team for all their work; we are committed to providing the best assistance and transition we can. We hope the industry will provide homes for these talented colleagues."</p>
<p>Singularity 6 already <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/singularity-6-reduces-workforce-by-35">laid off just over a third of its staff back in April</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/singularity-6-raises-usd30m-to-fund-debut-mmo-game">Having raised $30 million in 2021</a>, the studio released Palia in August 2023, with the title <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/palia-reaches-over-3m-players-in-six-months-thanks-to-invaluable-switch-partnership">reaching more than three million players by March 2024</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="300" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We’re less than a week away until the release of the <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> remake, and we cannot wait for our pre-orders to arrive. However, it seems Walmart customers won’t be getting the same courtesy as the retailer has reportedly been cancelling pre-orders for the game.</p> <p data-characters="625" data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1791192335407018031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter user Wario64</a>, who frequently highlights gaming related deals, recently shared a post sent them to by a Walmart customer who had been informed by Walmart that they wouldn’t be getting their pre-order for the <em>Paper Mario</em> remake. Is it because of stock shortages? No, instead Walmart’s email says it’s because “Nintendo will only be offering this item in stores.” So, Walmart will have copies of the game, but customers will only be able to buy it in-person once it launches on May 23. As an apology for the cancellation, Walmart is offering $25 off affected customers’ next purchase.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Not sure if this is widespread but it looks like Walmart will only sell Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door in-stores (seemingly a Nintendo directive). </p><p>Online orders are getting cancelled and looks like they are offering $25 off a future order as an apology. <a href="https://t.co/vgmR4ESgUA">https://t.co/vgmR4ESgUA</a></p></div>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1791192335407018031?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="552" data-current-count="852" data-injectable="true">The phrasing makes it sound like this was Nintendo’s decision rather than Walmart’s, but that doesn’t make it any less perplexing. Especially since, at the time of writing, the <em>Paper Mario</em> remake can still be pre-ordered online at other retailers, such as <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door---nintendo-switch/20009003.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameStop</a>, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-oled-model-nintendo-switch-lite/6578805.p?skuId=6578805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.target.com/p/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-nintendo-switch/-/A-91538599" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Target</a>. <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Paper-Mario-The-Thousand-Year-Door-Nintendo-Switch/5337897462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Walmart’s website</a>, meanwhile, says the item is out of stock. That said, the game’s also been <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paper-Mario-Thousand-Year-Door-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0CXQ7N9Z6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">unavailable at Amazon US</a> too for at least a month, with customers <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1bzfcac/psa_amazon_is_cancelling_switch_game_preorders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Reddit</a> reporting it had cancelled pre-orders due to a lack of inventory.</p>
 <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="390" data-injectable="false">We’ve seen some suggest that this is Nintendo’s way of preventing <em>Paper Mario</em> from breaking its street-date. In the past, retailers have shipped some games to customers early, resulting in gameplay footage and story spoilers being posted online. However, we’ve contacted Nintendo for an official comment on the situation, and will update this article if we get a response.</p>

        <p>Update: Take-Two says "entire organisation contributed to cost reduction efforts" after CEO claims firm hasn't "shuttered anything"</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>  <div>



            <p><strong>Original story</strong>: Take-Two hasn't shut down Roll7 and Intercept Games, CEO Strauss Zelnick said in an interview.</p>
<p>Talking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios">IGN</a> off the back of the company's Q4 financials, Zelnick was asked about why the closures happened.</p>
<p>He replied: "We didn't shutter those studios, to be clear. And we are always looking at our release schedule across all of our studios to make sure that it makes sense. So we are being very judicious because we are in the middle of a cost reduction program that we've already concluded and are now fully rolling out.</p>
<p>"We've announced that we're saving $165 million in existing and future costs, but we haven't shuttered anything."</p>
<p>IGN senior reporter Rebekah Valentine further asked Zelnick about whether he was denying the reports, at which point a PR representative interjected and said:</p>
<p>"What we've said is, in the 8-K filing that we put out, we talked about the cost reduction plan is approximately 5% reduction in headcount worldwide, but we did not give a label-by-label breakdown of what that looks like."</p>
<p>When asked again whether the studios still existed, Take-Two did not provide more details, with the PR adding: "We have not provided any additional colour beyond what I just said."</p>
<p>Later in the interview, discussing Private Division's health specifically, Zelnick said he didn't think the label was in trouble, adding: "I think, as I said, we're reviewing all of the projects company-wide, and sometimes we do have to make hard choices. We just tend to leave those announcements to the label, we don't tend to talk about them, so we're not trying to be cute or difficult today. It's just that we don't tend to bring those discussions into these meetings."</p>
<p>Reports of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-reportedly-shuts-down-roll7-and-intercept-games-private-division-suffers-mass-layoffs">Roll7 and Intercept Games being shut down emerged earlier this month</a> through <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a>, which had access to internal documentation about the closures. A WARN notice was also filed in Washington <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-reportedly-closing-its-seattle-office">indicating a studio closure impacting 70 people</a> in Seattle (Intercept Games has about 70 staff and is based in Seattle). Take-Two never formally confirmed the closures.</p>
<p>Take-Two's financial report yesterday saw the company post a $3.74 billion net loss, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-moves-grand-theft-auto-6-out-of-current-fiscal-year">confirming that  GTA 6 won't release this current fiscal year</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Replying to <em>GamesIndustry.biz'</em>s request for comment, a Take-Two representative provided the following statement:</p>
<p>"Our entire organisation contributed to our cost reduction efforts, including Private Division. We refocused our pipeline within Private Division and are still planning to support an array of titles," they said, listing Moon Studio’s No Rest for the Wicked, Wētā Workshop Game Studio’s Tales of the Shire, and atitle in partnership with Gamefreak.</p>
<p>"Additionally, the label continues to make updates to Kerbal Space Program 2. We will continue to opportunistically evaluate future projects that have the potential to meet our financial benchmarks."</p>

            <p>Hell-wandering roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-release-date-details-everything-we-know">Hades 2</a> has received its first proper patch, and it does everything the developers said it would. You now sprint faster and, significantly, you can gather more than one type of crafting resource per run (as long you've unlocked the tool that lets you gather that resource). This  means Melinoë can now go fishing, dig up seeds, mine silver, and gain the trust of errant shades, all in a single night's work. There is a catch though.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Previously, you had to commit to using one tool during any run, meaning you were only able to collect one of these resources at a time. But, following feedback, the game's creators said they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-will-change-your-dash-and-sprint-abilities-in-its-first-patch">"don't want resource gathering to feel too frustrating."</a> As a result, you can now gather everything. Hooray! But wait, what is the point in choosing a tool now before you set out? Well, that's the catch. Choosing a tool now alters how often other items will appear during a run.</p>
<p>"You now can Prioritize any available Tool in the Training Grounds to make its resources appear as often as before," says Supergiant, "while resources for Tools you do not Prioritize will appear far less often."</p>
<p>So, pick the spade, and you'll get the usual amount of digging spots showing up, but those little ripples in water that show a fishing spot will be rarer. Makes sense. All this means, yes, you can gather any resource now, but the tool you pick still affects how many clumps of silver appear, or whatever. You won't be farming everything at an equal rate.</p>
<p>As for the sprint, I can confirm it feels speedier. The dash is now even better too, as you can now dash straight out of an attack. Previously, there was a slight delay between battering ghouls and darting away, as a few milliseconds of attack animation finished. Now you can get away from harm much easier, it feels. I previously wrote that I wanted the sprint to auto-activate after a dash, but, no, I think I might be a moron. This feels good. 

</p><p>There's a bunch of other small changes. "Entries in the Book of Shadows
are generally easier to reveal," for example. That's the lore book that gives you tidbits about all the creeps you're fighting. You can view <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4175477072263852699">the full patch notes here</a>. Normally when reporting on a game's update I like to pluck a few notes out, because patch notes are inherently funny ("The nose worm no longer eats eyes", "Fixed an issue where jetpacks propel downwards"). But Supergiant are either too good at programming and make few funny mistakes, or they hide all their funny mistakes behind the item: "Other minor fixes". We may never know. </p>
<p>Hades 2 is still in early access, so there's more to be added to the game. Supergiant are planning a new area and a new main weapon, for example. The first Hades remains one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">best action games</a>. But truthfully? I think I prefer the sequel. You can probably tell from our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2 early access review</a>.</p>

			<p>GTA 6 sales likely won't be affected by the game's launch window, according to Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick.</p>
<p>Yesterday, GTA 6 publisher and Rockstar owner Take-Two Interactive confirmed that the highly-anticipated next entry in the franchise<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> would be released in the fall of 2025</a>. Some hoped that the title would be released in early 2025, but that won't be the case. During the company's most recent earnings call with investors, CEO Straus Zelnick was asked whether a release during the 2025 holiday season would have an additive effect. According to Zelnick, releasing the game in early 2025 or late 2025 likely won't matter. "While it probably doesn't matter, I think we'd all rather be in the release window that we're looking at now", the CEO <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4693998-take-two-interactive-software-inc-ttwo-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said during the earnings call</a>.</p>
<p>It's clear that Take-Two has high confidence in the next Grand Theft Auto (we can't blame them with 2013's GTA V selling over 200 million copies), and as expressed by Zelnick during the same call, the game is expected to move a lot of consoles. In addition, the CEO expects that going by projects from research firm IDG, around 111 million consoles will be sold globally by the end of 2024. According to Zelnick, IDG projected that 81 million consoles have been sold worldwide by the end of 2023. This implies that an additional 30 million consoles will be sold throughout this year. Zelnick only mentions "Gen 9" consoles, which include the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles. Since we know that Sony managed to sell 55 million PS5 consoles as of December 31, 2023 - this means that around 26 million Xbox Series consoles are projected to be sold as of last year.</p>
<p>"We are using IDG's projections, which are pretty substantial", Zelnick said. "So for Gen 9 alone, their view is that they're about 81 million consoles worldwide currently that was at the end of the last year, they project that will rise to 111 million by the end of this year and 175 million by the end of 2027. Now we don't necessarily subscribe or not subscribe to those views, but that shows an awful lot of growth. And we do expect a very significant attach rate."</p>
<p>Although these aren't confirmed numbers, it's pretty interesting to see the difference in sales numbers between consoles, and how Take-Two expects that GTA 6 will indeed by a system seller.</p>

            <p>Being offered a 4X game for free is definitely one of those cursed-monkey-paw situations. Sure, you’re saving physical currency, but at what price in terms of that most treasured and least tradeable of commodities, time? In the hours it takes to properly clean out a 4X game, you could probably build an empire yourself. OK, not a huge empire. An empire the size of the Vatican or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Sealand">Principality of Sealand</a>, perhaps. Maybe an empire that only covers the distance between your desk and your fridge. But an empire nonetheless. Go on, pronounce yourself God-Tyrant of your bedroom while you download Amplitude’s Endless Legend, which is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/289130/ENDLESS_Legend/">100% off on Steam</a>  till 10am PDT, 1pm EDT and 6pm BST on May 23rd.</p><!--more-->
<p>Now that you’ve become God-Tyrant of your bedroom, permit me to offer my services as your trusty NPC advisor and share some wisdom about Endless Legend. My liege! It is an honour. But I will be brief, for your realm already faces insurrection in the shape of flatmates who hate it when you call them "minion", and a dire assault on the borders from the neighbour’s cat, which has been a thorn in your side since you left that tuna salad on the windowsill six months ago.</p>
<p>Endless Legend came out in 2014 and is renowned even today for the diversity and inventiveness of its factions, as Ollie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-goty-revisited-2014s-endless-legend-is-still-one-of-the-most-vibrant-important-4x-games">describes at greater length in his 2023 retrospective</a>. This isn’t just the usual Science vs Economy vs Military spectrum. You’ve got factions who build their cities on the backs of huge insects, factions who eat their own dead to offset their deficient agriculture, factions who have a phobia of research… It’s a regular vaudeville extravaganza of competing alien species, each with their own major questline. The game also plays merry hell with the 4X traditions laid down by elder Civilisations – only one city per region, and techs divided into pools rather than forming trees with branching progression paths.</p>
<p>If you take a shine to it, publishers SEGA are also bundling <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/13263/ENDLESS_Legend_Definitive_Edition/">nine expansions for 81% off</a>.</p>
