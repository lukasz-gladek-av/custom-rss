			<p>Today, THQ Nordic announced that Early Access for Titan Quest II is on the horizon. It will be available to interested players in the Winter of 2024/2025. This title is being developed by Grimlore Games, known for detailed fantasy games such as SpellForce 3 and Titan Quest II.</p>
<p>This game will allow players to dive into a deep world of fantasy, where they experience what it means to rival a God. The first Titan Quest game was released in 2006, and it then received an anniversary edition of the game in 2016, merging both the Titan Quest game and Titan Quest Immortal Throne into one game.</p>
<p>THQ Nordic first announced Titan Quest II's development in August 2023. Players can dive into Early Access this coming Winter. There is no news on how much this upcoming ARPG will cost, but the game will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Whether Titan Quest II's Early Access will also be available on console hasn't been clarified, but it's safe to assume it'll be available on PC via Steam.</p>
<p>For those attending Gamescom 2024, attendees will be able to get a hands-on experience of Titan Quest II and some of the other games that THQ Nordic has to offer, such as the Gothic Remake. In addition, they are showcasing two unannounced games, with their announcements potentially happening during Gamescom week.</p>
<p>The developers of Titan Quest II have been making sure that those interested in the game are well-fed by releasing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1154030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple dev diaries</a> that deep-dive into subjects such as the Mythology surrounding the game, the music, world design, and more.</p>
<p>In Titan Quest II, you must take up <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-new-dev-diary-talks-about-looting-items-and-more/">your spear and fight</a> against Nemesis, the Goddess of Retribution. She has become out of control and is trying to change the Threads of Fate, punishing anyone who opposes her. It becomes your duty to fight back against her and team up with other Gods in the game to try and stop her and weave your fate alongside allies.</p>
<p>If Titan Quest II is shaping up to be something that you find yourself interested in, make sure to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154030/Titan_Quest_II/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlist the game</a> on your platform of choice so that you can keep up with any announcements they make or any new dev diaries that they may release, giving you a glimpse into what to expect from this Greek Mythology-filled ARPG.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225171/asus-wi-fi-7-gaming-router-rog-rapture-gt-be19000-rt-be86u-usb-be92-adapter-windows-laptop<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asus announced <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-wifi-7-devices-gamescom-2024/">three new Wi-Fi 7 products</a> today, including a tri-band ROG Rapture GT gaming router, a dual-band router, and a new Wi-Fi 7 USB adapter.</p><p>The <a href="https://rog.asus.com/networking/rog-rapture-gt-be19000/">ROG Rapture GT-BE19000</a> has a familiar ’80s retro-future look shared by predecessors like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/1/23745096/i-have-never-been-so-convinced-that-a-router-was-going-to-come-alive-and-murder-me">quad-band GT-BE98</a>, along with most of the same specs, including two 10Gbps and five 2.5Gbps ethernet ports. It also supports 320MHz channel bandwidth on the 6GHz band, which unlocks much higher throughput (although you’ll need a 2Gbps or higher connection to your ISP for that to shine). </p><div><figcaption><em>The ROG Rapture GT-BE19000 has seven ethernet ports.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Asus</cite></p></div><p>Since the GT-BE19000 uses Wi-Fi 7’s multilink operation feature, you<strong> </strong>can connect a supported device to<strong> </strong>the 6GHz and 5GHz band at the same time for increased throughput, less latency, and more stability. </p><p>Asus’ other new router is the comparatively modest dual-band <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Fnetworking-iot-servers%2Fwifi-routers%2Fasus-wifi-routers%2Frt-be86u%2F">RT-BE86U</a>. It’s Wi-Fi 7, so it can support multilink operation across the 2.4GHz and 5Ghz bands. It also has a 10Gbps WAN port for connecting to your modem or fiber ONT, along with four 2.5Gbps ethernet ports for wiring up your gaming PC and whatnot.</p><div><div><figcaption><em>The RT-86U, a dual-band Wi-Fi 7 router.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Asus</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>Stick this in your PC and download with it.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Asus</cite></p></div></div><p>Finally, Asus announced the <a href="https://rog.asus.com/networking/rog-usb-be92/spec/">ROG USB-BE92</a>, an external USB Wi-Fi 7 card. It connects using USB-A or USB-C, and Asus says it should work with Windows 10 or 11 PCs out of the box — just plug it in and go. It’s an easy way to add Wi-Fi 7 to a computer once you’ve upgraded to a Wi-Fi 7 router, unlocking features like MLO for better stability and faster throughput. </p><p>Asus didn’t announce any release dates or prices for these devices. </p><div><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23902812/wi-fi-7-explained">What is Wi-Fi 7</a>?</h4></p><p>Wi-Fi 7 is the next version of Wi-Fi to follow Wi-Fi 6E. Like Wi-Fi 6E, the protocol works on the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands, and it’s backward-compatible with devices that precede it. Wi-Fi 7 promises higher throughput, with features like 320MHz channel bandwidth (twice what’s offered on Wi-Fi 6E), Multi-Link Operation (which combines bands into one for greater throughput and more stability), and improved interference handling.</p><p>More Wi-Fi 7 routers have hit the market and prices are beginning to come down, though it’s still early days. Even if your devices don’t support it yet, you may benefit from Wi-Fi 7 mesh systems, which will be able to take advantage of the features listed above for faster, more stable wireless backhaul connections between nodes.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As the name suggests, they are machine gun turrets that lock onto enemies. This weapon is great for whenever you find yourself fighting more than one person at a time, because it helps take some of the pressure off. It’s your little shooty buddy.<br></p><h2 id="h1751"><a id=""></a><strong>Captain America’s Shield</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="06e5ce0de18a839b007435ce2e2b5aa5" data-recommend-id="image://06e5ce0de18a839b007435ce2e2b5aa5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cap's shield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cap's shield." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="06e5ce0de18a839b007435ce2e2b5aa5" data-recommend-id="image://06e5ce0de18a839b007435ce2e2b5aa5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cap's shield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The shield can be used in two different ways. The first is throwing it at your enemies, because apparently you’re worthy of picking it up. Once you throw the shield, it’ll bounce off various objects and hit whatever is next to it before returning to you. The other use is the more traditional shield fare of blocking incoming damage.<br></p><h2 id="h1752"><a id=""></a><strong>Doom’s Arcane Gauntlets</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="158358d0104f964bb7c757a6c1c990cf" data-recommend-id="image://158358d0104f964bb7c757a6c1c990cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Doom's gauntlets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Doom's gauntlets." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="158358d0104f964bb7c757a6c1c990cf" data-recommend-id="image://158358d0104f964bb7c757a6c1c990cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Doom's gauntlets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Doom’s Arcane Gauntlets are similar to the Magneto Power from last season, in the sense that they throw projectiles at enemies. Its main attack lets you shoot arcane energy at enemies, but it’s mainly meant to be used in close quarters. Its secondary attack will launch you into the air and shoot a massive beam covering the immediate area.</p><h2 id="h1753"><a id=""></a><strong>Dual Micro SMGs</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="2a4119431efe3ddb2c7c5748511ef977" data-recommend-id="image://2a4119431efe3ddb2c7c5748511ef977" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dual micro SMGs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dual micro SMGs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2a4119431efe3ddb2c7c5748511ef977" data-recommend-id="image://2a4119431efe3ddb2c7c5748511ef977" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dual micro SMGs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Dual Micro SMGs are fairly simple to understand. As the name suggests, they’re two Micro SMGs that excel in close-quarter combat. But be careful, because it can be easy to blow through ammo.</p><h2 id="h1754"><a id=""></a><strong>Hover Jets</strong></h2><p>The Hover Jets are a part of the War Machine gear. These don’t inflict any type of damage at all. Instead, they allow you to fly up in the air for a short period of time, which is great for getting the upper hand on enemies when you’re trying to get the high ground.</p><h2 id="h1755"><a id=""></a><strong>Monarch Pistol</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="ef103233aa8bff42bea7e5591a555715" data-recommend-id="image://ef103233aa8bff42bea7e5591a555715" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Monarch pistol." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Monarch pistol." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ef103233aa8bff42bea7e5591a555715" data-recommend-id="image://ef103233aa8bff42bea7e5591a555715" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Monarch pistol." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Monarch Pistol is a weapon that Doom drops once he’s killed. The gun is a semi-automatic weapon. It can be used for mid-range fights and packs a big punch.<br></p><h2 id="h1756"><a id=""></a><strong>Sovereign Shotgun</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="5c2e63115496bd65c80a1a7c0a36af44" data-recommend-id="image://5c2e63115496bd65c80a1a7c0a36af44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sovereign Shotgun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sovereign Shotgun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5c2e63115496bd65c80a1a7c0a36af44" data-recommend-id="image://5c2e63115496bd65c80a1a7c0a36af44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sovereign Shotgun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Sovereign Shotgun is a gun that Mysterio drops.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-gaming-mouse/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Everyone loves a good gaming mouse. While everyone has their own specific needs when it comes to gaming mice and what works for them, there are still a few mice that are superior to all others. So, what is the best gaming mouse?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-best-gaming-mouse">What Is The Best Gaming Mouse?</h2>



<p>A lot of factors are involved when determining the best gaming mouse. You have weight to factor in. You have the number of buttons to look at. Some mice have better durability than others. There are so many different aspects to look at when figuring out whether a mouse is worth it or not.</p>



<p>So, which mouse is the most worth it?</p>



<h3 id="h-the-best-gaming-mouse-glorious-model-o-wireless-mouse">The Best Gaming Mouse: Glorious Model O Wireless Mouse</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Glorious Model O Wireless Mouse is easily our number-one pick for the best gaming mouse on the market. This honeycomb-styled mouse is perfect with its medium-size and lightweight features. </p>



<p>The Glorious Model O Wireless is currently only <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Glorious-Model-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B098RDJZFM/ref=asc_df_B098RDJZFM/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=692875362841&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=7951794455995394899&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9007527&amp;hvtargid=pla-2281435179098&amp;psc=1&amp;mcid=89315b41c9533e3eb5ad0740c338c87e&amp;hvocijid=7951794455995394899-B098RDJZFM-&amp;hvexpln=73&amp;gad_source=1">$59.99 USD on Amazon</a>, making it extremely affordable. The mouse is 69 grams, which is incredibly light compared to many other mice on the market. This helps with reaction time and speed when gaming.</p>



<p>Despite it being incredibly light, it is still extremely durable, allowing the mouse to last for years. </p>







<h3>How Many Buttons</h3>



<p>The Glorious Model O Wireless Mouse has five buttons. There are two side buttons, the typical left and right click buttons and a DPI control button. For gamers, all you need are the main four buttons. </p>



<p>The mouse being wireless is also an incredible feature, too, as you never have to worry about your cord getting snagged on your keyboard or desk. Still, you can purchase the same mouse with a cord for cheaper, if you would like. The non-wireless version of the Glorious Model O is still much better than many other mice on the market.</p>



<h3>Additional Gaming Mice</h3>

<li>HyperX Pulsefire Haste</li>



<li>SteelSeries Aerox 3 Super Light</li>



<li>Logitech G502</li>



<li>Glorious Model D</li>

<p>Other features of the new joystick include the ability to link it with an Xbox controller using Xbox Controller Assist, complete button remapping with multiple profiles, and the ability to be mounted to “any ¼”-20 threaded mount equipment.”</p>



<p>The Xbox Adaptive Joystick itself features four buttons on the front, an Xbox thumbstick and two buttons at the top that act as the bumper and trigger of the controller.</p>

<h2 id="h-more-accessibility-options-from-xbox">More Accessibility Options From Xbox</h2>



<p>In addition to the Xbox Adaptive Joystick, Microsoft is offering even more accessibility options to make sure players can enjoy their games no matter what. </p>



<p>First are new 3D printable files for adaptive thumbstick toppers. The six new designs include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Plate-shaped thumbstick topper:</strong>&nbsp;Provides a shallow, indented surface helpful for operating sticks with larger body parts, like the chin.</li>



<li><strong>Dome-shaped thumbstick topper:</strong>&nbsp;Features a rounded, convex surface designed to accommodate various grip strengths or dexterity levels.</li>



<li><strong>Stick-shaped thumbstick topper:</strong>&nbsp;Offers a narrow cylindrical grip, increasing height and leverage to reduce the force needed to operate the stick.</li>



<li><strong>Pull thumbstick topper:</strong>&nbsp;Provides a deep, bowl-shaped surface that surrounds a thumb, finger, or similar object, reducing the pressure required.</li>



<li><strong>Sphere-shaped thumbstick topper:</strong>&nbsp;Presents a smooth, rounded, ball-shaped surface to support alternative ways of operating a thumbstick, such as grasping it.</li>



<li><strong>Custom thumbstick topper:</strong>&nbsp;Allows players to create their own shape with increased adhesion for shapable materials like clay or moldable plastic, enabling them to make and affix any shape that works best.</li>
</ul>



<p>The next new offering is the new 8BitDo Lite SE 2.4G Wireless Controller, which was designed “specifically for gamers with limited mobility.”</p>



<p>“It features low-resistance buttons and highly sensitive Hall Effect joysticks, making it easier for everyone to play,” Xbox says. “All&nbsp;buttons are conveniently accessible on the top of the controller, and it even has a non-slip silicone mat to keep it steady while gaming.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Lastly, ByoWave is releasing the ByoWave Proteus Controller after four years of development. Retailing at $299, the Proteus is a modular controller with a number of combinations.</p>



<p>“The Proteus Controller comes with “snap and play” parts and is all about personalized customization,” they said. “With its modular design, players can tweak their controller setup to match their unique play style, physical needs, and game preferences with over 100 million different combinations.”</p>

In June, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-announced-confirmed-for-ps5-xbox-games-showcase-2024">Microsoft announced Id Software's upcoming Doom: The Dark Ages will also launch on PS5</a> next year.</p><p>During a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/L1Qd1cFr9VY?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft gamescom 2024 livestream</a>, Xbox chief Phil Spencer responded to a question specifically about the decision to bring Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PS5 and what it means for other upcoming new Xbox releases. Responding, Spencer pointed to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-rares-sea-of-thieves-tops-the-ps5-sales-chart-whats-the-next-xbox-game-to-go-multiplatform">the apparently successful release of the four Xbox games on non-Xbox platforms</a> and the boost they’ve enjoyed by going multi-platform.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>“Our franchises are getting stronger. Our Xbox console players are as high this year as they’ve ever been,” Spencer said. “So I look at it and I say, okay, our player numbers are going up for the console platform. Our franchises are as strong as they’ve ever been.”</p><p>Crucially, Spencer added that Xbox’s multi-platform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business — with the pressure now on to deliver following Microsoft’s eye-watering $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard last year.</p><p>“And we run a business,” Spencer said. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.</p><p>“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/spencer-1724249575303.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Xbox boss Phil Spencer speaking at gamescom 2024. Image credit: Microsoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Spencer’s comments come amid a tumultuous time for Xbox that has seen <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">1,900 staff cut from the gaming business</a> this year and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">multiple studio closures</a>. All the while, sales of Xbox Series X and S have fallen dramatically, Xbox Game Pass growth has stalled, and Microsoft faces a backlash from hardcore Xbox players about its potentially wavering commitment to exclusives and the console business.</p><p>Perhaps addressing those concerns, Spencer said fans need to get used to Microsoft’s new way of thinking around the games it makes. Xbox, Spencer said, is trying to grow, and it very much sounds like making Xbox console exclusives is not how the company plans to achieve that going forward.</p><p>“The last thing I’ll say, as an industry right now, there’s a lot of pressure on the industry,” Spencer said. “It’s been growing for a long time and now people are looking for ways to grow. Us as fans, as players of games, we just have to anticipate there’s going to be more change in how some of the traditional ways that games were built and distributed, that’s going to change. That’s going to change for all of us. But the end result has to be better games that more people can play. If we’re not focused on that, I think we’re focused on the wrong things.</p><p>“So for us as Xbox, health of Xbox, health of our platform, and our growing games, most important things.”</p><p>The question now is, what other upcoming Xbox exclusives will also make the jump to PS5? Will Obsidian's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>? Will The Coalition's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</a>?

                <p>Cheating is an ongoing problem in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex Legends</a> and one that--from the outside looking in--feels like an issue that's gone unaddressed for dozens of seasons now. It's a tricky situation for the Apex Legends team. On one hand, if the team tells players how it's actively getting rid of cheating players or bots, then the team shows its hand and subsequently makes all of Apex Legends' safeguards that much easier to get around. But on the other, saying nothing makes it seem like the team is actively ignoring player concerns. For a while now, the Apex Legends team has opted for the second approach, seemingly believing it the better of two imperfect strategies. Going forward, however, the team is going to try to thread the needle between both strategies.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahead of the release of a blog post that goes into how the Apex Legends team has contended with cheaters in the past and breaks down the anti-cheat takeaways for this past June and July, Electronic Arts head of product and studio integrated communications Tracey Thompson spoke to me about the philosophy behind this change in strategy.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Apex Legends - Official Shockwave Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"EA Entertainment is sort of looking at the landscape of where we are," Thompson told me. "And obviously as you know, there is the narrative around cheaters in Apex and being afraid to play the game means that this is a very acute problem that's ongoing and isn't necessarily the most easy to tackle."</p><p dir="ltr">Most of all, Thompson continued, EA and Respawn hope that players see that the team behind Apex Legends already knows there's been a lack of transparency when it comes to the implemented anti-cheat strategies in Apex Legends. That sentiment was "an important part" of putting together the blog. In the blog itself, the Apex Legends team notes that more than six million accounts have been banned since Apex Legends' launch in February 2019, with a little over 100,000 accounts banned each month on average. In June and July 2024, these bans were overwhelmingly permanent and most were imposed for cheating as opposed to bots.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4354056-june2024banreport.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354056" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4354056-june2024banreport.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354056"></a><figcaption>Far more permanent than temporary bans in Apex Legends the past few months.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4354056-june2024banreport.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We know that we need to tell you more," Thompson added. "We want to really kick things off with sharing what we have been doing and then knowing that it needs to be more... [We acknowledge] that this may not be as meaty as people would like, but I do think that in sharing this with you...[it sets] an expectation with [players] that we know that there's way more that we have to do."</p><p dir="ltr">While talking with Thompson, she reiterated that this blog post is merely the "first of many" to come and that fans shouldn't be worried that this one post will be Apex Legends' one-and-done response. "Over time, we're going to actually start to open the aperture to give people more and more without actually giving away the secrets that people could then circumvent," she said.</p><p dir="ltr">In a follow-up email to the PR team, I asked if Respawn had an idea concerning the cadence of players getting updates like this blog post. Would players hear more during seasonal updates? Once a year during the annual birthday celebration? Every other month?</p><p dir="ltr">In response, the Apex Legends team emailed the following statement: "We want each of these updates to be meaningful so that will guide us on the cadence. However, we won't always wait for a blog. If we want to share something in the moment that we feel is a win or a smaller update, we'll do that through social [media], community platforms, etc."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4354057-s5_loba2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354057" data-ratio="0.54248810333107" data-width="1471" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4354057-s5_loba2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354057"></a><figcaption>Squashing cheaters is a never-ending battle.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4354057-s5_loba2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">As someone who plays Apex Legends fairly regularly and has been covering every season for GameSpot since Season 3, I'm curious to see the dev team's follow-up to this initial blog. From day one, the Apex Legends team has firmly remained in the "We don't really talk about it" camp when it came to its anti-cheating strategies. And this was to, again, avoid cheaters learning what to circumvent. It feels a little strange to see the team shift the pendulum in the other direction after all this time, even if it's only to aim for a middle ground. What can the team share that was too difficult to share before? But like anything when it comes to a live-service game, we'll just have to wait and see.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/apex-legends-season-22-patch-notes-new-lmg-gun-shield-refreshing-loot-and-controller-recon-buffs/2900-5659/" data-ref-id="2900-5659">Apex Legends Season 22</a> is in full swing.

            <p>Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has addressed the surprise revelation that first-party exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">release on PS5 in spring/Q2 2025</a> just a few months after its Xbox debut, stating Xbox is "a business", and that "the bar is high in terms of the delivery we have to give back" to parent company Microsoft.</p>
<p>In an in-house interview with Xbox On, Spencer was not directly challenged about the decision to release Indiana Jones on PS5 so soon after its December Xbox debut, only insisted that, at that time, Xbox was "gonna learn" and "watch", and "from our learning, we're gonna do more".</p>
<p>At that time, Spencer explicitly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-xbox-exclusive-games-heading-to-ps5-and-switch-according-to-phil-spencer">said that neither Starfield nor Indiana Jones and the Great Circle were one of the four games tipped to come to PS5</a>, and whilst that's true - Indiana Jones was <em>not</em> one of the four games mentioned; it's actually the fifth - some fans have taken issue with Spencer's framing of the issue.</p>

<p>"Obviously, last spring we launched four games, two of them on the Switch, four of them on PlayStation, and we said we were gonna learn," Spencer said. "We said we'd watch. I think at Showcase, I might have said, from our learning, we're gonna do more.</p>
<p>"What I see when I look is: our franchises are getting stronger. Our Xbox console players are as high this year as they've ever been. I look at it, and I say, okay: our player numbers are going up for the console platform. Our franchises are as strong as they've ever been. And we run a business.</p>

<p>"It's definitely true inside of Microsoft, the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company, 'cause we get a level of support from the company that's just amazing, what we're able to go do," he added.</p>
<p>"So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow both on console, on PC, and on Cloud, and I think it's just going to be a strategy that works for us.</p>
<p>"The last thing I'll probably say is that I think there's a lot of pressure on the industry. It's been growing for a long time, and now people are looking for ways to grow.</p>
<p>"I think us - as fans, as players of games - we just have to anticipate there's going be more change, and how some of the traditional ways that games are built and distributed - that's gonna change. That's gonna change for all of us. But the end result has to be better games that more people can play. If we're not focused on that, I think we're focused on the wrong things. So for us at Xbox - health of Xbox, health of our platform, and our growing games are the most important things."</p>
<p>Reports that Microsoft was preparing to release a number of first-party games on competing consoles <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-xbox-exclusive-games-heading-to-ps5-and-switch-according-to-phil-spencer">first surfaced at the start of this year</a>, but it wasn't until claims that high-profile exclusives such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would also be going multiplatform that Microsoft broke its silence.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft has announced the release date for its upcoming batch of Xbox console variants, including its digital-only Series X.</p>
<p>The three new Xbox console variants were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reveals-three-new-xbox-console-variants">initially revealed back in June</a>. At this time, Microsoft merely said they would be available at the end of the year, with no further specifics.</p>
<p>That was, until today, when Microsoft confirmed the three new Xbox Series X/S console options will be released on 15th October, with select countries then following on 29th October.</p>

<p>The pricing is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xbox Series S 1TB in Robot White - £299.99</li>
<li>Xbox Series X 1TB Digital Edition - £479.99</li>
<li>Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition - £549.99</li>
</ul>
<p>"With an exciting lineup of new games launching this year, there is no better time to jump in with Xbox," <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/21/xbox-series-x-s-new-console-options-pre-order/">Microsoft</a> closed today's post.</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in Microsoft news, last night it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will be the next game under the company's umbrella to make a jump over to PlayStation</a>. </p>
<p>This follows Microsoft's earlier announcement that it would be making more of its games available to a wider audience. Earlier this year, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-review">Sea of Thieves</a>, Grounded, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and Pentiment all also made the move across to additional platforms. On its PS5 debut, Sea of Thieves went onto top the console's download charts.</p>

According to developers, the main idea behind Herdling is to provide gamers with an immersive experience that is relatable not just to the users but to the actual creators themselves. Here's how representatives from both Okomotive &amp; Panic express their optimism towards the upcoming title:</p>
<p>"With Herdling we wanted to start a new kind of adventure, not only for the players, but also for us. To create the herd of beasts and their mountainous world was an ambitious challenge for us, and we enjoyed every step of that journey," said Co-Founders Don Schmocker and Goran Saric.</p>
<p>Nick Suttner, Panic's Director of Publishing, also stated: "The FAR games are moody, moving masterpieces as far as we're concerned, so we couldn’t be more thrilled to work with Okomotive on their brand-new adventure. Herdling feels like a return to the scale and fidelity of something like Firewatch for us, so it’s really exciting to have it in our lineup. We’re huge fans of games like Inside and The Last Guardian - stirring, solo adventures that really communicate a sense of awe, loneliness, and a particular brand of companionship."</p>
<p><em>-Nick Suttner, Panic’s Director of Publishing.</em></p>
<p>Okomotive's newest title surely has fans waiting out, given the initial glimpses that show that the "herding" experience has gotten a lot more enticing. Here is how Herdling is expected to play out for fans:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&nbsp;Guide, protect, and fall in love with a motley herd of Calicorns</em></li>
<li><em>Traverse stunning mountainscapes, fog-wreathed forests, snowy plateaus, and forgotten valleys</em></li>
<li><em>Hone your herding skills as you navigate a wide range of challenges, threats, and light</em><br>
<em>environmental puzzles</em></li>
<li><em>Feel the rush of the mountain air alongside your herd in exhilarating stampede sequences</em></li>
<li><em>An emotional, wordless tale of trust, survival, and companionship during a great crossing</em><br>
<em>through a fallen world</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of the release of the title, Okomotive x Panic is expected to showcase the behind-the-scenes look at the Panic Games Showcase, which is set to be held by August 27, with first-hand playable demos to be held at PAX West 2024. Herdling will debut on PC and consoles by 2025, but we haven't gotten an exact launch date yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-hits-2-3-million-concurrent-players-at-steam-surpassing-cyberpunk-2077-elden-ring/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Black Myth: Wukong, the title that has taken the industry by storm, has now broken records for Steam concurrent viewers, reaching its all-time peak.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong has become a favorite in the industry. Just within a few hours of launch, the title has managed to hit 2.22 million concurrent players on Steam, the highest for a single-player title ever on the platform, beating the likes of Counter Strike-2, Dota 2, Elden Ring, and Cyberpunk 2077. Given that this number is limited to players on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?snr=1_4_4__118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam only</a>, it's imminent that the overall figures will be much higher.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This is shocking for the industry, given that the hype around Black Myth: Wukong pre-launch wasn't that massive for it to be translated into such figures. But the gaming industry has its ways, and we might have an idea about the turn-out of the title. Black Myth: Wukong is highly popular in Eastern regions, particularly in China, and given the population the nation holds, we believe that 2.22 million players aren't the actual peak, and there's still a lot to happen.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">How China-specific is interest in Black Myth: Wukong? A lot: <a href="https://twitter.com/gamediscoverco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GameDiscoverCo</a>'s current estimate of its Steam country split for players is 88.1% China, 3% U.S., 1.6% Hong Kong, 1% Japan. <a href="https://t.co/FeAFn85NBH">pic.twitter.com/FeAFn85NBH</a></p>
<p>— Simon Carless (@simoncarless) <a href="https://twitter.com/simoncarless/status/1825818693751779449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>An estimate by GameDiscoverCo shows that around 88.1% of Black Myth: Wukong's share is owned by China, while other nations such as the US, Hong Kong, and Japan hold a lesser portion. This shows that Chinese influence is indeed playing its part in the viewership of Black Myth: Wukong, and by the looks of it, the viewership figures are expected to skyrocket from hereon, too.</p>
<p>For those unaware, Black Myth: Wukong is a title which seeks to combine rich storytelling with stunning visuals and a unique take on the action RPG formula, putting players on a journey to discove ancient Chinese mythology, breathtaking landscapes, and a diverse cast of memorable characters based on their novel Journey to the West. The close attachment of the title to Chinese cultures and traditions is one of the main reasons why there has been a massive portion of players from the region. Along with that, the in-game mechanics and the visually stunning staff-based melee combat system have elevated the title's experience to new levels.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">review of&nbsp;</a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a> also showed that the title "couldn't have been a better debut for Game Science." The game has received a Metacritic average score of 82, showing that in terms of the overall experience, it is undoubtedly something to savor and something gamers should look forward to.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/just-six-of-yesterdays-gamescom-announcements-are-confirmed-for-switch.959658/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-2024-switch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An eagle-eyed observer has noted that of the 62 announcements and reveals featured during yesterday's Gamescom Opening Night Live show, just six are definitely coming to Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/of-all-the-62-games-featured-at-the-gamescom-opening-night-live-only-7-games-are-available-or-will-be-available-on-switch.959187/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ResetEra user BY2K</a>, 62 announcements were made during Gamescom, of which some were new games, some were expansions or updates for existing games, and some were release date trailers or launch trailers for games we already knew about.</p>
<p>Just six of those announcements were for games that are either already on Nintendo Switch or are coming to the console at some point in the future, BY2K notes. One of them, HoYoverse's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-50-release-date">soon-to-be-updated</a>&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, has a very uncertain future indeed on Nintendo's console.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nikoderiko-nintendo-switch-gamescom-announcements.jpg?itok=S8Dpe33v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nikoderiko-nintendo-switch-gamescom-announcements.jpg?itok=lBupvOuK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Colorful platformer&nbsp;<em>Nikoderiko: The Magical World&nbsp;</em>is one of just six Gamescom ONL 2024 games definitely coming to Switch.</figcaption></figure><p>Here's the full list of confirmed Switch releases from last night's Gamescom presentation in all its glory.</p>
<ul><li><em>Dave the Diver</em>'s upcoming crossovers (with&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/potion-craft-alchemist-simulator"><em>Potion Craft</em></a>, and YouTuber mxmtoon)</li>
<li><em>Nikoderiko: The Magical World</em></li>
<li><em>King of Meat</em></li>
<li><em>Sid Meier's Civilization 7</em></li>
<li><em>Little Nightmares 3</em></li>
<li><em>Floatopia</em></li>
</ul><p>BY2K's list also includes&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>as a "maybe", but even if we include that game, seven out of 62 announcements isn't the best look for the machine that is still Nintendo's only current console on the market.</p>
<p>Many of these games are titles we already knew weren't on Switch, like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/naraka-bladepoint"><em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/black-myth-wukong"><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/street-fighter-6"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a>, to name but a few. For others, it's not surprising they're missing the Switch;&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred&nbsp;</em>was hardly going to appear on Nintendo's console when&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>doesn't.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-gamescom-announcements-switch.jpg?itok=9GhIqfMP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-gamescom-announcements-switch.jpg?itok=T_ZXc3R3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of yesterday's Gamescom announcements were guaranteed Switch no-shows, like&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, the lack of Switch ports or versions for many of yesterday's Gamescom games arguably demonstrates that the need for Nintendo to make an announcement regarding the Switch's successor is growing more urgent.</p>
<p>Many of these games are likely skipping the Switch because it simply doesn't have the technical prowess to run them; it's hard to imagine&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>running on a Switch, for instance.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Nintendo has pledged that it will reveal information about the Switch 2 (or whatever it ends up being called) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">before the end of this fiscal year</a>, which means we'll likely learn something between now and this coming April. Stay tuned for more.</p>

It’s a wired companion for existing Xbox controllers and includes four buttons, an Xbox thumbstick, and two additional buttons for bumper and trigger controls.</p><p>The Xbox Adaptive Joystick allows you to operate a controller without having to use both hands, making it ideal for any players who might have difficulty using the thumbsticks on existing controllers. All the buttons are fully customizable, and there are a variety of 3D printable thumbstick toppers to customize the sizes, heights, and width of thumbsticks.</p><p>“From very early on with the adaptive joystick, we had disability community be hands-on with early designs and functional prototypes,” explains Kaitlyn Jones, senior accessibility product manager at Xbox, during a Gamescom stream. “Even from a software perspective, we’ve really heard from our players that they’ve wanted an affordable joystick for their adaptive controller, but also something that fits in seamlessly with their existing setup.”</p><div><figcaption><em>The joystick has four buttons and easy access to an Xbox thumbstick.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div><p>You can connect the Xbox Adaptive Joystick to Microsoft’s Adaptive Controller for a full adaptive setup, or you can plug it directly into a PC or Xbox. It can even be mounted, thanks to a threaded insert like you’d find on a camera tripod.&nbsp;</p><p>Community feedback played a big role in shaping this hardware. Microsoft visited a hospital in Seattle with a box of prototypes for one particular feedback session. “We got feedback on the grip size, shape, the number of buttons, and where the buttons are located,” says Chris Kujawski, principal designer at Xbox.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside Microsoft’s own Xbox Adaptive Joystick, the company has also revealed a new $59.99 <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/lite-se-wireless-xbox/">Lite SE controller from 8BitDo</a> that’s also designed for gamers with limited mobility. It has low-resistance buttons and Hall effect joysticks, and all the buttons are accessible at the top of the controller.</p><div><figcaption><em>8BitDo’s new accessibility controller.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></p></div><p>Microsoft has also built a new toggle hold feature for Xbox controllers that’s available to test for <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/xbox-insider-release-notes/console/alpha-skip-ahead/2024/07/alpha-skip-ahead-2408-240725-2000">Xbox Insiders today</a>. “This new feature is intended to help make using a controller even easier and supports players who have difficulty holding prolonged button presses,” says <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/21/xbox-accessibility-adaptive-joystick-thumbstick-toppers/">Microsoft’s gaming accessibility team</a>. “Similar to sticky keys on a computer, assign any button or port on the Xbox Adaptive Controller, Xbox Adaptive Joystick, or Xbox Elite Series 2 controller to stay pressed until pressing again to release.”</p><p>The Xbox Adaptive Joystick also comes with improved packaging that’s similar to what Microsoft did with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/25/17611488/microsoft-xbox-adaptive-controller-unboxing-packaging">previous Xbox Adaptive Controller</a>. Microsoft is also improving the accessibility of the packaging for its three new Xbox Series S / X console options that are launching in October.</p><p>The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fxbox-adaptive-joystick">Xbox Adaptive Joystick</a> will launch in early 2025 in select Xbox markets worldwide and will be sold exclusively through the Microsoft Store, priced at $29.99.</p><div>

                <p dir="ltr">Star Wars is for kids. At least, that's the excuse that gets rolled out whenever one raises an issue with poor plotting, fart jokes, or pat moral lessons. But Star Wars also takes place in a universe with dark implications, like a fascistic Empire that turns a blind eye to crime lords who trade in sentient slaves and illicit drugs. Star Wars has long shied away from letting its seedy criminal underworld simply be unapologetically seedy, but by setting itself in the midst of it, Star Wars Outlaws may just be the scumbag simulator we've been waiting for.</p><p dir="ltr">While it would be easy to lay this problem at the feet of the kid-friendly Disney corporation, the Star Wars franchise's unease with portraying criminals actually began much earlier, with franchise creator George Lucas. Lucas himself authored the classic ur-example of a charming dirtbag with a heart of gold, Han Solo. Years later, he apparently felt conflicted about one of pop culture's most enduring icons being introduced as an unrepentant killer. As one of many changes made to the "Special Edition" releases of Star Wars, he altered Han's confrontation with Greedo. What was originally Han making a wry comment and then casually offing the Rodian, was changed to Han awkwardly "dodging" a shot and then firing in self-defense.</p><p dir="ltr">Subsequent edits have altered the timing slightly, and the most-recent edit has Greedo more explicitly threatening to kill Han to make the latter's actions read more as self-defense. Arguably it was always self-defense; Greedo was a bounty hunter openly stating his intentions to turn Han over to Jabba the Hutt, a ruthless crime lord who later kept Han as a trophy out of sheer spite.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4354377-3311590-han-solo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354377" data-ratio="0.64833333333333" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4354377-3311590-han-solo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354377"></a><figcaption>The dirtbag with a heart of gold, Han Solo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4354377-3311590-han-solo.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Han_shot_first" rel="nofollow ">"Han shot first" controversy</a> rocked the early internet and Star Wars fandom, but at the core of the controversy was the sense that Han Solo was <em>supposed</em> to be a dirtbag. That was part of his character arc. He was a scoundrel and a loner who stumbled into a cause bigger than himself with friends he loved and that moved him to change. The Han Solo that we see gently smiling at the end of Return of the Jedi is not the same Han Solo who put a smoking hole in Greedo's torso, and that's the whole point. Those who favor the original cut, like myself, argue that it's actually good writing to show that a character has grown and changed as a person and is learning from their adventures. That's why we go to the movies.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Lucas decided his hero needed to be more unambiguously heroic, and less dark. Since the first change was made in 1997, 20 years after the original release, Han Solo has now spent more time being a justified self-defender than a good old-fashioned dirtbag.</p><p dir="ltr">The kid-friendly view of crime continued into the prequels, when Obi-Wan and Anakin visit a seedy Coruscant bar in Attack of the Clones while hot on the trail of a failed assassin. Our clearest signal that this is a sleazy place is when a random patron offers Obi-Wan some death sticks. That character's name? Elan Sleazebaggano. Subtle!</p><p dir="ltr">This trend continued into the Disney era with the reintroduction of Boba Fett. The popular character had lived on in expanded universe books for a long time but hadn't been seen in the main, canonical cinematic universe since he was ignominiously and presumably killed, by accident, by a blind Han Solo in Return of the Jedi.</p><p dir="ltr">Fett showed back up in live action The Mandalorian, Disney's biggest Star Wars hit on the small screen from a sheer merchandising perspective. Baby Yoda, aka Grogu, has certainly sold more lunchboxes than any other character in recent years. But Boba Fett's appearance followed a story arc revolving around Cobb Vanth, a local Tatooine lawman played by Timothy Olyphant--essentially reprising his gunslinger roles from shows like Justified, except in a Star Wars context. Vanth had found Boba Fett's old Mandalorian armor and was using it to clean up <em>this-here town</em>. But the title-character's fanatical obsession with Beskar armor being the birthright of true Mandalorian heritage led circuitously to the reappearance of Fett to reclaim his armor.</p><p dir="ltr">That was all to set up The Book of Boba Fett spin-off, a miniseries focused squarely on the character. The Book of Boba Fett was, unfortunately, a boring slog--to the point where the show itself just surrendered a whole episode to its more-popular character, Din Djarin.</p><p dir="ltr">But at the heart of the Book of Boba Fett's pacing problems was the simple fact that this was a story about a crime boss that was afraid to be about a crime boss. Boba Fett took over Jabba's old crime business to become Daimyo of the Mos Espa region: a sort of gentleman-criminal ruler in the style of old mobster movies. They carve up territory, put vassals in charge of pieces of their business, and keep the gears oiled with bribes and favors between government officials. It's a meaty idea that Star Wars could have sunk its rancor teeth into.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the show shied away from going into any detail about what crimes they were doing or how the enterprise worked. We saw him flexing on other crime bosses and saying his business would be run on mutual respect, but it felt toothless because the show went out of its way to tell us that Fett was a crime boss who wasn't interested in doing crimes. Instead, Fett came off as a kindly grandpa, sometimes pushing back on other crime lords who threaten him, but otherwise minding his own business and leaving the citizenry alone. At its climax, another famed bounty hunter came to town and confronted Fett, telling him that he couldn't just change his stripes so easily. While that could have been a compelling dramatic hook, the whole affair up to that point had been too muddied. Rather than feel like the culmination of the show, audiences were left asking: Wait, <em>that's</em> what this has been about?</p><p dir="ltr">Imagine the arc of The Godfather or Breaking Bad but in reverse: a skeezy criminal transforming into a good, boring, law-abiding citizen. There's probably a way to do this in an entertaining fashion, to make the character's redemption compelling, but this wasn't it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4354378-3911759-screenshot2021-11-29at16.41.44.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354378" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4354378-3911759-screenshot2021-11-29at16.41.44.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354378"></a><figcaption>The Book of Boba Fett was a narrative mess, but the armor is still cool</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4354378-3911759-screenshot2021-11-29at16.41.44.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now at long last we have Star Wars Outlaws, a game that appears to actually be about the criminal underworld, with nary a Jedi or Mandalorian in sight. This may finally be a Star Wars crime story that allows itself to be about criminals doing crimes, and dirtbags getting their hands dirty. Ubisoft is leaning into that direction in its public statements, outlining various criminal syndicates like the Hutts and Pykes, and stating that the rise of the criminal underworld is all a byproduct of a galaxy under the boot of the Empire.</p><p dir="ltr">"What happens when you have a civil war consuming the galaxy? Well, criminal organizations and syndicates, they find a space to rise up," narrative director Navid Khavari told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-developers-on-creating-the-most-ambitious-star-wars-game-yet/1100-6515135/">GameSpot</a>. "This [era sees] them thriving and seeking all kinds of opportunities--them at their strongest, to a certain extent. To enter into the underworld within that window felt like a perfect starting point for someone like Kay and for the player."</p><p dir="ltr">And Kay herself is no shining beacon of virtue. The central plot revolves around her planning a massive heist, and maintaining good working relationships with the syndicates with factional alignments is how you make your way through the campaign. That sounds as if your choices aren't so much good or evil, but rather, different variations of bad.</p><p dir="ltr">I have no doubt that protagonist Kay Vess will ultimately be a criminal with a heart of gold--taking risks to save people she's come to care about or to stop some greater, unrepentant evil from taking place. That's just how this character template works. But it's the contrast between her criminal activities and her heroism that makes these stories work, and for that to be believable, we have to give the universe some room to show us how shady it can be. I'm excited for Outlaws for lots of reasons, but mostly because I hope we finally get a closer look at the underworld.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The number of people playing video games and the time spent playing continues to fall behind the all-time highs achieved in 2021, Circana said. The downturn is attributable in part to inflation on everyday items people need to live like groceries, which in turn has left less money available to the average person to spend on gaming, Circana said.</p><p>For 2024, video game hardware revenue is expected to continue to decline due in part to the total number of units sold and their average prices declining. People have shifted some of their play time to more accessible platforms like PC and mobile, and this has helped offset some of the declines in the console market, Circana said.</p><p>"This will continue to be a difficult year for video game manufacturers and publishers, as an overall spending decline, albeit in the low single-digits, is expected," Piscatella said.</p><p>Looking ahead to 2025, though, Piscatella said the US video game industry is poised for a rebound. GTA VI, which is among the most-anticipated games of all time, along with the massively hyped Switch 2, should help the video game industry's fortunes in 2025, Piscatella said.</p><p>"The anticipated first-half debut of Nintendo's next generation hardware platform should provide a significant boost, as should the launch of Grand Theft Auto VI, which may just become the biggest entertainment launch in US history," Piscatella said.</p><p>Not only are video game industry revenues falling this year in the US, but a number of major developers are cutting jobs. More than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">10,000 video game jobs have been lost so far in 2024 worldwide. </a></p>

But many were surprised that Capcom had recast the voice of beloved protagonist Frank West. After weeks of speculation, Capcom has finally announced the new West: Jas Patrick.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-dev-team-interview">IGN in a recent interview</a>, the development team behind Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster confirmed that Patrick would voice Frank West. Patrick is best known for his work on Octopath Traveler 2, where he voiced Partitio. Additionally, Patrick has lent his voice to other projects, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnKwHlxLklE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genshin Impact</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UY8vpu2OZE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jojo's Bizarre Adventure</a>, and the 2023 version of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVRgS4pVATg&amp;t=6s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rurouni Kenshin</a> anime, to name a few, as shown on his YouTube account and listed on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10572395/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his IMDb page</a>.  </p><p>"Jas Patrick is the new voice of Frank West for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. We're very pleased with the work he's done for this project," the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Development Team confirmed to IGN in the interview.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster was announced in late June. The<a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-official-teaser-trailer"> first teaser trailer</a> revealed that T.J. Rotolo, the original voice actor for Frank West, was not voicing the character. Following the trailer's release, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/original-frank-west-voice-actor-says-capcom-didnt-ask-him-to-return-for-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">Rotolo revealed</a> to a fan on <a href="https://x.com/FrankByDaylight/status/1806716618699059583?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> that he was not reprising his role in Deluxe Remaster because Capcom did not contact him, and "the reasons are the producers' own." </p><p>When we asked them about this, the development team said they regret that "[they] were unable to have TJ Rotolo reprise his role in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster." However, Capcom added that the studio "sincerely" appreciates all of the work Rotolo did for the Dead Rising series. </p><p>Frank West is just one of many characters who received a new voice actor in Deluxe Remaster. Nevertheless, as I mentioned briefly <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/we-love-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-so-far-unlocked-655">in an episode of Unlocked</a>, Frank West's new voice grew on me. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Dead Rising Dexlue Remaster is the second remastering of the 2006 original. Powered by the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-date-revealed-will-run-in-4k-and-60fps-in-re-engine">RE Engine</a>, Deluxe Remaster improves the lighting, in-game backgrounds, and environments. More importantly, a ton of quality-of-life changes have been introduced, such as the ability to move while aiming and improved survivor AI. Some things have also been removed, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-removes-the-erotica-genre-from-the-photography-mini-game-update">such as the "Erotica' genre</a> in the photography mini-game. </p><p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will be released on September 19 for digital storefronts, while the physical version will be released on November 8.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-finally-adds-an-option-to-save-mid-game-in-infinity-mode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is finally released, and alongside the previously-announced quality-of-life changes to the core gameplay loops, veterans of the series will be happy to know that even Infinity Mode has received a tweak that makes playing the mode a lot less of a headache to endure.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-dev-team-interview">an interview with IGN</a>, Capcom confirmed that Infinity Mode also received some quality-of-life changes that make the experience much more enjoyable for a wider variety of players. Specifically, Capcom confirmed to IGN that Infinity Mode in Deluxe Remaster includes an option to "save" your progress, allowing you to hop in and out at your leisure. Infinity Mode also includes some "adjustments," including the ability to fast-forward time and confirmation that zombies will now drop items, albeit at a low rate. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>"Regarding Infinity Mode, players are now able to save mid-game and exit without losing their progress," the developer confirmed to IGN during the interview. "Along with the ability to fast-forward time, we made some adjustments that we think will allow players to enjoy the mode more casually than in the original game. Since zombies now drop items at a low rate, a more aggressive playstyle has become a viable option for this mode as well."</p><p>For those unfamiliar with Dead Rising, Infinity Mode is an unlockable survival mode where players try to keep Frank alive in the mall for as long as possible. It is unlocked after the players beat both 72-hour and Overtime modes. Unlike the other two game modes, Frank's health will slowly deplete (even if he is not attacked), which makes forging for healing items and trying to avoid taking damage from enemies an additional challenge. </p><h2><strong>The game mode that Dead Rising fans loathed</strong></h2><p>In the original Dead Rising, Overtime Mode was loathed by those who dared to play it, as in both the 2006 original and its 2016 HD re-release it did not provide players with the ability to save. Additionally, food items did not respawn in the mall and the supermarket was locked out, so that people could not simply camp inside the store. Additional weapons and health pickups were obtained by defeating humans, as both psychopaths and survivors were hostile toward Frank. Defeating those enemies would provide a box of randomized items, which could include healing items. </p><p>While this mode is not required to obtain Dead Rising's true ending, players would often endure the brutal gauntlet of Infinity Mode to obtain achievements and trophies. Additionally, staying alive for five days would unlock the real Laser Sword, one of the most powerful melee weapons available in the game. Of course, due to the fact you previously could not save, players had to play Dead Rising nonstop to get one or both of those achievements, with the achievement for surviving five days taking upwards of 12 hours to achieve, while surviving seven takes 14 hours to achieve. </p><p>With the changes made to Infinity Mode, including the option to "save" the game and zombies having a (low rate) of dropping items, it appears Capcom was fully serious about remasting Dead Rising to make it not only more enjoyable for veterans but also more appealing to a wider audience. </p><p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will be released on September 19 for digital storefronts, while the physical version will be released on November 8.
