I also don’t expect Nintendo to announce a new, lower price.

The kart racer is due out on the same day as the Switch 2, June 5.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/next-project-in-frostpunk-universe-set-for-2027-release-and-11-bit-studios-is-working-on-a-new-ip-as-well<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> developer 11 bit Studios has begun work on "the next project set in the Frostpunk universe", which it plans to launch "as early as 2027". </p>
<p>Eurogamer recently heard word of this new project from 11 bit CEO Przemysław Marszał, who was talking to me about the history of the studio, and about its future. Today, 11 bit has now confirmed the project in its latest <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-boldly-invests-in-new-titles/">financial results</a>.</p>
<p>With two games released in the Frostpunk series already, and the series' recent second entry still on wobbly ground with the community - Steam reactions are currently "mixed" - I asked Marszał whether the series had, for the moment, run its course, or whether there was a future for it.</p>
<p>Marszał replied: "We totally believe in Frostpunk. We believe in that IP. We totally believe in that fantasy. I don't want to spoil it but I can tell you that in about two weeks, you will hear about something, so it's really soon. We totally believe in the IP and we will definitely work on the IP more."</p>

<p>He added: "On the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> front, we are doing a lot of work right now. The patch is coming, the DLCs are coming, etc. We see the problems with the game, we know the strengths of the game, and we are working on that game. But that's not only it. Frostpunk is definitely one of our key IPs, key games, and we love the IP so, yeah, we will work on that more."</p>
<p>Incidentally, while we are still waiting for a release date more specific than "summer 2025" for the console versions of Frostpunk 2, I'd be surprised if the upcoming teased announcement was for it - not least because Marszał separately said during our conversation that "the console version is releasing very soon".</p>
<p>But this new Frostpunk game - could it be an expansion? - is not the only new project the Polish studio is currently working on. "We've started working on two other things," Marszał said. "One thing is connected to Frostpunk and one thing is something new. We totally believe we should do new things."</p>

<p>Frostpunk 2 was released last September and arrived to glittering critical reviews, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frostpunk-2-review-a-sequel-of-consequence">my Eurogamer Frostpunk 2 review</a> included, but it struggled - and continues to struggle - to convince fans. "It is a mixed release for us," said Marszał. "We have a very good game, we have really awesome reviews from the press; then on the other hand, a lot of players aren't satisfied. There's a disconnection here. Then on the other hand, we had really awesome sales at the beginning with that game, but now the question is if those sales will be long-term, especially with the mixed reviews we have right now. We understand that it's a lot of work, still."</p>
<p>The mixed reaction to Frostpunk 2 highlighted a difficult second half of 2024 for 11 bit Studios which, at the end of the year, announced it had cancelled a full-scale game, Project 8, which it had been working on for several years. It's a game not much has been known about until now, but I have seen a video of it in action and spoken at length to Marszał about it. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-war-of-mine-developers-cancelled-project-8-revealed-a-risky-project-that-would-have-been-a-big-departure-for-the-studio">I can tell you all about Project 8</a> in a separate article.</p>

Get in the video game, loser - we're going to the future in order to shoot some tentacles in order to go to the past in order to save the future by soul-jacking people from 1980s Poland. Wait, let me rewind time and start afresh: here's a new overview trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, a sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remakers Bloober Team. It's got a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a>-style suit that makes you look like either an enormous fly or a sewn-up bottom (delete as appropriate), and some manky environments that recall Bloober's last original production, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-medium">The Medium</a>. Quickly now, watch the trailer while I finish writing this article.

Phew, made it just in time! Announced last October, Cronos: The New Dawn takes place in a world marred by The Change, a cataclysm that appears to have reduced Earth to a spectral asteroid field. The remnants of humanity survive in fetching hexagonal glamping pods, while the ravaged cities are full of things with tendrils and teeth where the abdomens should be. 
</p>
<p>
You play a "Traveller" working for the "Collective", and your job is to search this fallen world for portals to 1980s Poland, where The Change is still taking hold. There, you must use your wholly unterrifying fold-out "Harvester" gauntlet to "extract the Essences" of people fated to die, allowing them to accompany you back to the future. Presumably this will be useful somehow.
</p>
<p>
This looks like Bloober's most combative offering yet - a sizeable step up from the largely plank-based melee of the Silent Hill 2 remake. Your arsenal ranges from a reassuringly brick-sized handcannon to a shotgun, an automatic rifle and a weapon that appears to make things implode. It looks like there are a few terrain puzzles that involve time-rewinding. It's not clear whether the bulk of the game is spent in the future, with the old-timey Poland bits serving as climactic interludes, or whether you'll be running and gunning through the 1980s as well.
</p>
<p>
The thing that interests me most about Cronos is that it continues Bloober's curious dissection of their own cultural context, as they unpack Poland from different temporal vantages by way of different horror subgenres. Their breakthrough cyberpunk chiller <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/observer">Observer</a> took place in an apartment block in Kraków - Bloober's home town. The Medium, which is set in 1999, begins in the same apartment block. I wouldn't be surprised if the old lady's home from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-silent-hill-2-remake-devs-new-horror-game-is-a-time-travelling-jaunt-through-apocalyptic-eastern-europe">the first Cronos: The New Dawn trailer</a> was that very same apartment block again. Anyway, the new game is out this year and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101960/Cronos_The_New_Dawn/">read more on Steam.</a>

      </div>
<p>The alpha test requires all players to have a Bungie.net account, and presumably the full release will, as well. A PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live account is not required to play the alpha test, but will be once Marathon officially launches. Friend invites are not supported during the alpha, although friends will be able to group up with each other if they were selected participants.</p><p>The alpha is approximately 6GB and only supports the English language. However, Bungie plans on supporting the full game with many additional languages. Additionally, account progress from the alpha will be deleted from test servers when they're closed and will not be saved for launch.</p><p>Marathon launches on September 23, and will support both cross-play and cross-save. While Marathon won't be full price, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-wont-be-full-price-though-bungie-says-it-will-be-a-premium-title/1100-6530835/" data-ref-id="1100-6530835">it'll be a premium title</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-will-be-40-report/1100-6526561/" data-ref-id="1100-6526561">reports that it'll be $40</a>.

            <p>Bloober's forthcoming survival horror Cronos: The New Dawn has received a fresh trailer to give a proper look at gameplay and its unique merge mechanic.</p>
<p>Cronos is the Polish studio's all-new original survival horror, following its success last year remaking <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer, below, introduces the game's apocalyptic setting of 1980s Poland, hinting at story details and warning players of enemies that merge.</p>

<p>Downed enemies must be completely destroyed using fire. If not, existing enemies can merge with them to evolve into deadlier versions with new abilities.</p>
<p>This is one of the game's core combat mechanics, which co-directors Jacek Zięba and Wojciech Piejko hinted at when I spoke to them last year about Cronos, comparing it to Dead Space's limb shooting and Alan Wake's flashlight.</p>
<p>As for the story, it's set across two time periods as a mysterious Traveller from a dystopian future is sent back to the 1980s to discover the truth of its apocalypse.</p>
<p>The Polish setting is inspired by the real-life Nowa Huta district of Krakow, here seen as brutalist architecture warped by strange time anomalies.</p>
<p>There's no specified release date yet, but Cronos: The New Dawn is due for release this year across PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>For more on the game, check out my interview with the co-directors about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-bloober-is-following-silent-hill-2-with-its-first-original-survival-horror-cronos-the-new-dawn">how Cronos will be a worthy follow-up to Silent Hill 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

CD Projekt has warned fans of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> beta test "scam" currently doing the rounds, saying it's "been taking the necessary steps to take this fraudulent messaging down".
</p>
<p>
The studio <a href="https://x.com/thewitcher/status/1912514283847504311">shared its warning to the Witcher community in a statement posted to social media</a>, writing, "Recently, we've been getting reports from some community members that they've been invited to a beta test of The Witcher 4 - this is a scam!"
</p>
<p>
"We've been taking the necessary steps to take this fraudulent messaging down. That said, if you receive any invites to or stumble upon news of one, we kindly ask you to report the scam using the tools available to you in your email client or the social media platform you are using."

<p>
Word these Witcher 4 beta test invites are fraudulent won't be much of a surprise, of course, given the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ciri-as-witcher-4-protagonist-really-really-interesting-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-says-geralt-voice-actor">Ciri-fronted game</a> was only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">formally unveiled last December</a> and isn't <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">set to release until sometime after 2026</a>. But as CD Projekt says, "Remember: professional monster slayers don't fall for scams; they see right through them and slay them!"
</p>
<p>
That doesn't, however, mean beta initiatives are completely out of the question further down the line. "Should we ever organise any beta tests in the future," the studio adds, "you will hear about it first, as always, via our official social media and websites."
</p>
<p>
As confirmed last November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-confirms">The Witcher 4 is now in full production</a>, but it's not the only title currently in development at CD Projekt - and the studio recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-shares-witcher-and-cyberpunk-project-updates-announces-partnership-with-mobile-developer-scopely">shared updates on its other projects</a> as part of its financial earnings report. Witcher spin-off Project Sirius remains in pre-production, for instance - although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-spin-off-developer-the-molasses-flood-has-been-absorbed-into-cd-projekt-red">The Molasses Flood has now been folded into the main studio</a> - and the Witcher 1 remake, announced in October 2022, is still at the concept phase.
</p>
<p>
Away from The Witcher, CD Projekt's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> sequel - currently known as Project Orion - was said to be entering pre-production "in the coming weeks".

			<p>A new Indiana Jones and The Great Circle video shared online today compares all console versions, highlighting how the Xbox Series X version is closer to the PlayStation 5 Pro version than the base model release.</p>
<p>The video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@brazilpixel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brazil Pixel</a> takes a good look at the Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 5 Pro versions of the game, showing an early game sequence running on all systems while keeping track of the performance, which is rock solid on all three systems in terms of frame time and frames per second, and the render resolution. While the PlayStation 5 Pro version obviously runs at the highest resolution, native 4K most of the time, the Xbox Series X doesn't lag too far behind, having a smaller gap with the PlayStation 5 Pro version than with the base PlayStation 5 version, which is made more impressive by the console's power usage.</p>
<p><iframe title="Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - Xbox Series X vs PS5 vs PS5 Pro - FPS and Resolution Test" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itCYV8m04Fc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There was no doubt that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle would run best on PlayStation 5 Pro, considering it is the most powerful console available on the market. Besides running at native 4K resolution most of the time, this version of the game comes with some <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-playstation-5-pro-global-illumination-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhancements</a> over the other systems, which include light global illumination, ambient occlusion, and contact shadows improvements.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a> is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. The game is now available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro for owners of the Premium Edition, and will release for everyone else later today.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2s-worlds-are-going-bigger-ign-first</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-outer-worlds-2s-worlds-are-going-bigger-%E2%80%93-ign-first.1165878/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2s-worlds-are-going-bigger-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the very first things we were targeting when we started The Outer Worlds 2 was to make these big, expansive areas. It's what players told us they wanted,” game director Brandon Adler told me when talking about how the team at Obsidian built the open regions for this sequel. But bigger doesn’t always mean better, and they seemed aware of that when creating the more expansive zones across the different planets and moons you’ll visit in The Outer Worlds 2. There appears to be a focus on rewarding exploration, creating dense environments, and designing areas that pull you in specific directions to investigate points of interest off in the distance. So, while it’s structurally similar to the original where you visit distinct open areas through the main quest, there’s a greater sense of scale this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was able to see some of these ideas in action with a gameplay tour of Golden Ridge, a new open region on the planet-moon Dorado that you’ll visit early on in The Outer Worlds 2. It’s an arid, desert-like region with trench lines from a war that broke out in the past, mining facilities run by a faction called The Protectorate, and a ton of hostile wildlife mutated from the polluted environment. Art director Daniel Alpert spoke about maintaining the first game’s decorative art nouveau and retrofuturistic inspirations, but going with something a bit more harsh for Golden Ridge. “We were able to pull from areas of the late old West to World War 1 and imbue the areas with little touches – you’ll notice a trench warfare line, and if you go a little further into a town, you'll still find that frontier colony vibe,” he said when working on Golden Ridge.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Outer Worlds 2 - Golden Ridge Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Adler spoke to how the art direction feeds into the stories they’re trying to tell, specifically on this planet: “Before we get into any area, we have deep conversations about the overall story, the factions and what they’re doing, and what's important to them. Asking things like, why was anybody in Golden Ridge?” He gave examples of collaborating with the art team to have a sort of synergy between aesthetics and the game’s purpose, saying “We’ll say like, we want the trench lines <em>here</em>, maybe for gameplay reasons, but talk about why it makes sense story-wise.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As any good RPG does, these kinds of stories are woven into the regions themselves, and Adler teased some of that, saying “I won't get into what happens at the beginning of Golden Ridge, but there's a big state change in the area when you first get there. It’s going to blow people away and make them really want to investigate what's happening.” That’s said to be indicative of the rest of the game, as he continued telling me, “You’ll see that throughout a lot of our areas as well. We try to do those types of things - let the players see big events that are happening pretty early and get them hooked into the area.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With that foundation, the team wanted to pack the region with interesting things along the way with the main quest. “We made sure of that with big open sightlines and we spent a lot of time and effort on making really cool looking points of interest out in the distance to really draw players and really bring them off the beaten path,” Adler said. He referenced filling these areas with side quests, supporting characters, and smaller stories to unravel, similar to the first game. There seems to be a concerted effort in rewarding players with collectibles (like a new collection of tossball cards) and gear, even for exploring parts of the region that don’t really have a specific story or quest purpose. It’s an important piece to this style of RPG, of course, and something they were conscious of when it came to improving things from the first game, making sure all parts of the development team were involved in making that happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also got to see the Zyranium Lab, which is an interior level on Golden Ridge, and it was impressive not just for its scale, but the ways in which I can see gameplay possibilities for how I approach these kinds of games. In a similar vein as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-gameplay-the-outer-worlds-2-ign-first">exclusive gameplay demo</a> I saw of the N-Ray Facility, I got the impression that levels like these are more intricately designed and drawing from immersive sims like Deus Ex and Dishonored. They’re larger and have multiple paths forward that look deliberate for a range of playstyles while still maintaining a focus on pulling the player in specific directions. “When we're building these more open spaces, we have a defined path that we want the player to go through. But in true Obsidian game style, we allow players to go everywhere and kind of experience whatever they want,” Adler said with regards to designing levels within the open regions.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“One of the very first things we were targeting when we started The Outer Worlds 2 was to make these big, expansive areas. It's what players told us they wanted.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Golden Ridge was the only open region I was able to see, so I asked about what we can expect from the rest of the game’s worlds. Alpert told me, “We intentionally design each of our worlds to feel different from each other. It's a unique landscape every time you land on a new moon or new area. So it shouldn't be like, you go somewhere new and it's a little bit more of the same. These other areas are completely different from the last moonscape you just came from, and the next one you're going to be visiting is completely different as well.” While that may seem par for the course in a spacefaring journey like The Outer Worlds, the conscious effort to address the limitations of the first game and be more intentional about how its worlds are built makes me hopeful that the The Outer Worlds 2 can be an evolution of how Obsidian designs its games and worlds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, from what I’ve seen thus far, The Outer Worlds 2 looks promising on several fronts. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-the-outer-worlds-2-lets-you-go-wild-with-rpg-character-building-ign-first">reworked RPG elements</a> look like they’ve been made to be more distinct when it comes to the role-playing experience, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-gameplay-the-outer-worlds-2-ign-first">small snippets of gameplay</a> show better accommodation for specific playstyles. And taking a look at the open zone of Golden Ridge gave not just a better sense of scale, but a natural sense of exploration with greater density and purposeful points of interest along the way. Soon, we’ll be diving deeper into combat design and the evolution of the Flaws system as part of IGN First exclusive coverage on The Outer Worlds 2, which also includes a conversation with original Fallout developer and creative director Leonard Boyarsky on how the first game was about establishing a new foundation for Obsidian and this sequel being the idealized version of that initial vision.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In 2022, Rockstar Games introduced GTA+, a subscription service that provides a variety of perks and bonuses in GTA Online.

Do you really need to sign up for yet another subscription service? Only you can answer that, but below you'll find a breakdown of the key facts about GTA+ to help you decide.</p><h2 id="What_Is_GTA__"><strong>What Is GTA+?</strong></h2><p>GTA+ is a subscription service for GTA Online that originally debuted in March 2022 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.

On PC, people can sign up via their preferred store or in game.</p><h2 id="GTA_6_"><b>GTA 6?</b></h2><p>Rockstar Games has not said anything yet about if GTA+ will be supported with GTA 6.

It's expected that GTA 6 will have a significant online mode given the huge success of GTA Online, but it remains to be seen what form it may take. Rockstar has not uttered a word about GTA 6 since December 2023.</p><h2 id="Take_Two__Thrilled__With_GTA_"><strong>Take-Two "Thrilled" With GTA+</strong></h2><p>In 2022, Rockstar owner Take-Two commented on GTA+'s introduction, saying the company was "thrilled" with the response out of the gate.</p><p>"We're thrilled about how it's been rolled out so far.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steel-ball-run-is-the-best-jojo%E2%80%99s-bizarre-adventure-part.1165851/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/steel-ball-run-jojos-bizarre-adventure<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last Saturday was <a href="https://jojowiki.com/JOJODAY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JoJoDay,</a> a special fan celebration event where the official <em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</em> anime brought back <a href="https://x.com/miyake_ktrm/status/1911240544275316910" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved voice actors</a> and the musicians behind its <a href="https://x.com/kazusou_oda/status/1911053146669154469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banger opening themes</a>. The event also announced an upcoming <a href="https://jojocaravan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">art exhibit</a> and a <a href="https://t.co/jljMpW0gbD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Japan-only mobile game</a>—something Western fans may not play but will certainly appreciate for its crisp new character renders. The star of the attraction was the long-awaited official announcement of David Production’s anime adaptation <a href="https://jojo-portal-anime.com/sbr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Steel Ball Run</em></a>, the seventh part in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/jojos-bizarre-adventure-jjba-jojolands-jodio-dragona-1850130485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still-ongoing manga series</a>. Without hesitation, I’d argue it stands as the best part of the entire series.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast to previous parts, which followed generations of JoJos from 1888 to 2011, <em>Steel Ball Run</em> rewinds the clock back to 1890s America to follow Joestar protagonist Johnny—a paraplegic ex-jockey who enters a grueling cross-country horse race from San Diego to New York, in the hopes of winning a $50 million prize. But for Johnny, the real draw isn’t the money—it’s the chance to learn more about the enigmatic Gyro Zeppeli, a former fellow competitor whose mysterious steel balls briefly restored Johnny’s ability to walk. What unfolds is&nbsp; essentially a 19th-century<em> </em>take on <em>Death Race</em> <em>2000</em>, where Johnny and Gyro square off against a fleet of dangerous riders with weird powers of their own.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="『スティール・ボール・ラン ジョジョの奇妙な冒険』 特報映像／&quot;STEEL BALL RUN JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure&quot; Anime Announcement trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RHkvkwnQbEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Much of <em>JJB</em>A’s mass appeal is pretty simple. It features a revolving door of eccentric supermodel-looking weirdos whose names and ghost powers are peppered with music references as they battle to save the world. Along the way, the show weaves in other oddities, like a vampire’s generation-spanning vendetta against a family whose genetics he’s hijacked, the grim realities of the Floridian female prison system, and Italian gangsters waging a war on drugs. While <em>JJBA </em>delivers plenty of unforgettable characters and strategic, chess-like battles—like Jolyne Cujoh navigating a prison riot with literal meteorite hazards—it’s hard to ignore the sheer number of wild, last-minute asspulls the series commits.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s be honest—while Araki has a habit of loosely sprinkling in hints just enough to justify how heroes and villains outmaneuver each other, a lot of the show’s better moments are because it re-adjusts how previously poorly defined powers worked at the tail end of the series (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/9e7j6v/i_have_some_questions_about_gold_experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">looking at you, <em>Golden Wind</em></a>). While <em>Steel Ball Run</em>’s release is still on the horizon, I wanted to take a moment and explore one particular battle between its heroes and a man named <a href="https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Ringo_Roadagain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ringo Roadagain</a>, which solidified it as the crown jewel of Hirohiko Araki’s manga series.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Spoilers for that, I guess.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>JJBA </em>fights run on a tried and true formula of its heroes mysteriously encountering a villain and having to suss out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitPostCrusaders/comments/ap6t5c/op_jojo_stands_explained_in_one_picture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how their powers work</a> in order to exploit a weakness within it. That happened in part three with <a href="https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/The_World" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dio’s time rewinding The World power</a>, Diavalo’s King Crimson (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/c8wxjf/how_does_king_crimson_work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whose powers are still a subject of debate to this day</a>) in part five, and in part six with Enrico Pucci’s Infinity Stones-esque <a href="https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Made_in_Heaven" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Made in Heaven</a>. In <em>Steel Ball Run</em>, when Gyro and Johnny cross paths with Ringo Roadagain — a gunslinger enlisted by the president to take them from the race (don’t ask) — Ringo wastes no time explaining his ability outright. His stand, <a href="https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Mandom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mandom</a>, grants him the power to rewind time back six seconds. Why reveal such a crucial detail? Well, Ringo is chasing what he calls “the True Man’s World”— a&nbsp; philosophy where true strength comes from one’s willingness to risk life and limb to achieve their goals. In essence, he’s on some Kraven the Hunter type shit, believing that fairness in battle is essential to proving oneself. The concept is very old hat, but it fits seamlessly into the rugged, macho cowboy setting of <em>Steel Ball Run</em>. To add even more machismo into their battle, Ringo and Gyro settle their affairs&nbsp; through an old-fashioned duel inside the quiet confines of a log cabin.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>@ Shueisha/Viz Media</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gyro and Ringo’s duel is less a battle of strategy and more a clash of ideals. Ringo sees Gyro, who was raised Catholic and was formerly a Neapolitan executioner, as a “conformist” bound by societal and religious frameworks imposed on him. His critique of Gyro isn’t rooted in anti-Christian sentiment; rather, Ringo recognizes Gyro’s relentless drive, referred to in the series as “<a href="https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Determination" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dark Determination</a>,” as something hindered by the constraints of dogmatic beliefs. Ringo’s battle with Gyro is the closest thing the series has come to a villain outright telling its hero, “We’re gonna get you some self respect, even if it kills you.” Ringo also stands out as arguably the most honorable villain in the entire series. He bows before and after duels and refrains from using his Stand against opponents without spiritual abilities, ensuring fairness in combat, which is a neat change of pace for the series.&nbsp;</p><p>When Gyro believes he’s cracked Ringo’s tell — the act of turning the hand on his wristwatch as a trigger to rewind time, which Gyro assumes is the physical manifestation of his stand — it’s revealed that the watch isn’t necessary at all. Ringo uses it purely to give his opponent a fighting chance. That shit is raw as hell. Although Ringo is a minor villain in the grand scheme of <em>Steel Ball Run</em> meant to serve as a narrative stepping stone for Gyro and Johnny to overcome as they press onward to greater challenges, this battle leaves a lasting mark on Gyro’s character. Before their journey continues, Ringo offers Gyro one final farewell.</p><p>"Welcome...to the True Man's World.”</p><p><strong>Correction, 4/16/25, 10:45am-</strong>-The original version of this article misstated the name of character Ringo Roadagain.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-feels-great-about-xboxs-2025-slate-of-games-with-more-unannounced-titles-to-come/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With the success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-movies-success-continues-the-trend-of-film-tv-adaptations-bolstering-game-sales-and-engagement/">Minecraft movie</a>, Microsoft's head of gaming, <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-would-rather-revisit-owned-ips-than-rely-on-more-licensed-games/">Phil Spencer</a>, took an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/microsoft-phil-spencer-minecraft-movie-fallout-season-2-1236352653/">Variety</a> to discuss how Microsoft and Xbox feel about navigating the future of its adaptations.</p>
<p>In that conversation, Spencer also commented quickly on what Xbox has lined up for the rest of 2025. He avoided accidentally leaking anything, but he does confirm that there are more unannounced titles beyond what Xbox has already officially announced. Along with what we do know, Spencer feels "<em>great</em>" about Xbox's 2025 lineup.</p>
<p>"<em>For us and the rest of this calendar year, I really feel great about the slate of games. We just had “Avowed” come out, and I have to go backwards and just say Obsidian continues to do a great job. We’ve obviously talked about “The Outer Worlds 2,” “South of Midnight,” “Doom.” There’s more stuff, some stuff that’s unannounced and I’m walking in my head to make sure I don’t leak anything.</em>"</p>
<p>One of the games that Spencer is trying to avoid talking about is likely the one that has already leaked: the remaster of <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>, which could be officially confirmed in a matter of days.</p>
<p>Other potential titles could be the long-rumored Gears of War and Halo Collections coming to PlayStation and possibly even Nintendo. There's been less buzz around those of late, but if Xbox continues to be as good at keeping secrets the way it's kept the Oblivion remaster a secret, we won't have to wait very long to hear more about either collection.</p>
<p>Spencer was also asked about the Nintendo Switch 2, and he said that he wants to support it and that "<em>Nintendo has been a great partner."</em></p>
<p>"<em>We think it is a unique way for us to reach players who aren’t PC players, who aren’t players on Xbox...I’m really a big believer in what Nintendo means for this industry and us continuing to support them. And getting the support from them for our franchises, I think, is an important part of our future.</em>"</p>
<p>Speaking of Xbox's future, the platform's next big date will be its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/">upcoming June showcase</a>. After that, we'll have a better idea of what 2025 looks like for Xbox.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-planet-crafter-update-biggest-yet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Miju Games has announced a brand new update for open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>, and the Moons Update is set to be the game's biggest yet, according to the developer.</p>

<p>Miju says that the "love" it received upon <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-planet-humble-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow">releasing</a> the game's recent&nbsp;<em>Planet Humble&nbsp;</em>DLC persuaded the studio to "continue to support&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>for a long time", and that the Moons Update will "bring [the game] to the next level".</p>

<p>You'll be able to visit two new moons after you've finished terraforming your first planet, and once you're on a moon, you'll be able to terraform that as well. You'll keep all your blueprints, knowledge, and equipment, and you'll even be able to exchange resources between planets and moons.</p>

The changelog is temporary right now, though, so more could be added to the update as it nears its full release.</p>

<p>Right now, you can only check out the Moons Update on&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>'s development branch. The update doesn't have a full release date yet, but if you want to see how to access the dev branch, you can check out <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1284190/announcements/detail/588390482275468569" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this Steam post</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game based largely around terraforming planets. Your goal is to land on a planet and render its ecosystem habitable for humanity.</p>

<p>To that end, you'll have to gather resources from said planet in order to survive, and you'll need to find a way to generate oxygen and warmth to make sure you can live in your new environment as well.</p>




<p><em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1284190/The_Planet_Crafter/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/649665/microsoft-xbox-copilot-first-look-notepad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft has started testing an early version of its Copilot for Gaming experience. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s Xbox plans tell me that employees can now access Copilot within the Xbox mobile app, and that while it looks similar to the existing Copilot chatbot, it’s designed to tap into your Xbox account.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/628666/microsoft-xbox-copilot-for-gaming">Announced last month</a>, Copilot for Gaming will eventually be available across multiple devices — including Xbox consoles — to act as a companion or assistant that can guide you through games, download and launch titles, and more.</p><p>To my understanding, the early version available to Microsoft employees – which might change before release – includes the ability to pull up your recent Xbox achievements, get game recommendations based on your play history, and ask for tips about completing games. You’ll also be able to use this assistant to download and install games on your Xbox console.</p><p>Much like the existing Copilot, you can type to this Xbox chatbot or use voice to ask questions. You can also pick between a variety of voices: energetic, wise, chill, or heroic. Microsoft is also working on Copilot characters that will be animated versions of the AI assistant, but this isn’t present in the Xbox version yet.</p><p>Microsoft is also working on more features for its Copilot for Gaming experience in general, with ambitions to use its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645666/microsoft-copilot-vision-windows-beta-testing">Copilot Vision feature</a> to let the AI assistant see what you see during games on a PC. This will, if Microsoft can pull it off, eventually allow Copilot to fully guide you through games and offer tips on how to play titles like <em>Overwatch 2</em> or <em>Minecraft</em>.</p><p>This initial Copilot for Gaming feature will be available to Xbox Insiders soon, and Microsoft plans to tweak it constantly based on feedback from Xbox players. It’s not clear when this gaming Copilot will appear on Xbox consoles though, but I’d imagine it’s a while away given that Microsoft has only just started testing Copilot inside the Xbox mobile app.</p><p>I’m interested to hear what feedback Microsoft gets about Copilot for Gaming, particularly because it will debut as a feature inside the Xbox mobile app. I’m not sure why I’d use a chatbot to download and install Xbox games or check my achievements, but if Microsoft can actually turn this into an AI gaming coach then that would certainly pique my interest.</p><div><p id="xbox-games-keep-appearing-on-battle-net"><h2><strong>Xbox games keep appearing on Battle.net</strong></h2></p></div><p>Blizzard’s PC launcher, Battle.net, used to only have a handful of games available to download and install, but it’s quickly becoming Microsoft’s launcher of choice for new and existing Xbox games. <em>Avowed </em>launched on Battle.net recently, and now <em>Sea of Thieves</em> is <a href="https://x.com/seaofthieves/status/1911832579306569928?s=12">heading to the launcher</a> next month.</p><p>What’s interesting about these two additions is that they’re not Activision or Blizzard games, and both are available for Game Pass subscribers.You had to use the Xbox app or Microsoft Store to access Game Pass titles on PC previously, but by opening them up to Battle.net, Microsoft is signaling that it might be open to enabling Game Pass access on more PC launchers.</p><p>This isn’t just two games, either. <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> are also coming to Battle.net at launch, and Game Pass subscribers will be able to get these through this launcher, too. The downloads are fully managed by the Battle.net client instead of being handed off to the Microsoft Store, and all you need to do is link your accounts to get access to Game Pass titles.</p><p>I doubt this means Microsoft will fully move away from the Microsoft Store and Xbox app for Game Pass installs. But with millions of Battle.net users, it does mean the company can offer up more choices for how people obtain and play Xbox games. The Battle.net launcher is certainly another opportunity to sell PC players on PC Game Pass or Xbox Play Anywhere titles.</p><p>If you know more about Microsoft’s Battle.net plans, you can reach me via email at <a href="mailto:notepad@theverge.com">notepad@theverge.com</a> or speak to me confidentially on the Signal messaging app, where <a href="https://signal.me/#eu/soK8N9/6J1KVh2/ZZblbDEGXHNH1gK0Q+RaxJQ7vUxDDTYvxX8hARqMZfjuz3Egj">I’m tomwarren.01</a>. </p><div><p id="the-pad"><h2><strong>The pad:</strong></h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Microsoft is slowing some of its data center buildouts. </strong>After weeks of reports about Microsoft adjusting its data center projects, the company has finally admitted things are slowing down. “We are slowing or pausing some early-stage projects,” said Noelle Walsh, Microsoft’s president of cloud operations and innovation, in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/noelle-walsh-b29356108_microsoftcloud-datacenters-activity-7315439628562423808-W67e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios&amp;rcm=ACoAAAGe5_YBNBxfcDaC5YJlW57cvMMdg5ZCG-g">post on LinkedIn</a> last week.

Recall was supposed to debut alongside Copilot Plus PCs last June, but after security researchers raised concerns, it was delayed multiple times so that the company could properly secure it. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646911/microsoft-recall-windows-insiders-preview">It’s now in Release Preview</a>, which means it’s only weeks away from releasing to all Copilot Plus PC owners.</span></li><li><span><strong>ActiveX is now disabled by default in Microsoft 365 apps</strong>.

Leaked images from developer Virtuous’ own website have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648877/oblivion-remaster-images-leaked-microsoft">confirmed a long-rumored <em>Oblivion </em>remake</a>.

            <p>
11 Bit Studios have shared new details and images of their untitled Project 8, a mournful third-person action-adventure that was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frostpunk-creators-cancel-project-8-and-lay-off-staff-amid-concerns-that-narrative-driven-story-rich-games-dont-sell">cancelled last year amid layoffs</a>. CEO Przemysław Marszał observed at the time that "it was conceived under very different market conditions, when narrative-driven, story-rich games held stronger appeal" - a comment that made me want to unplug the internet and crawl into bed with a choose-your-own-adventure book. Now, Marszał has offered a fuller account of the cancellation.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
All this comes from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-war-of-mine-developers-cancelled-project-8-revealed-a-risky-project-that-would-have-been-a-big-departure-for-the-studio">a Eurogamer report</a> penned by Prince Robert of Purchese. According to the report, Project 8's main character was a slender, masculine figure equipped with a slingshot you could use to distract threats. Set in a colourful fantasy world, the game would have focussed on stealth, climbing and environmental puzzling rather than combat. Its story was a process of working through the five stages of grief after losing a loved one. In brief, it sounds like a mixture of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gris">Gris</a>, Prince of Persia, and the recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>. 
</p>
<p>
So why was it abandoned? According to Marszał, 11 Bit were overambitious about moving into the third-person action-adventure genre, having expanded their workforce dramatically off the back of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>'s success. With little direct experience to call upon, the Project 8 team struggled with both the relatively arcane 'stages of grief' concept and more familiar difficulties, like how to make hiding from enemies enjoyable. All this was, of course, exacerbated by wider factors such as the Covid pandemic.
</p>
<p>
"We felt like it would be possible to do another game in a totally different genre, with a bit of a crazy difficult topic, with a new team," Marszał told the site. "And it was a bit too optimistic to be honest. We thought a lot about it so it wasn't like 'hey let's do it', but going back, it was a bit too optimistic, and thinking that games are easy. And making games isn't easy. It's very difficult stuff." 
</p>
<p>
According to Marszał, Project 8 faced frequent delays over the course of "seven or eight years" in development. After all that time, the only playable parts of the game were a prologue and a level themed around the emotion of denial, which feels rather on-the-nose as poetic ironies go. "And when we heard that we need to add another year or two to the production time it was like 'wow'," Marszał went on. 
</p>
<p>
Following this proposed delay, 11 Bit considered Project 8's odds of success against wider market conditions at the time. In particular, they looked at the reception for similar emotive or psychological action-adventure games, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-plague-tale-requiem">A Plague Tale: Requiem</a>. They eventually came to the conclusion that they would lose money selling the game.
</p>
<p>
"We allowed ourselves - that was the optimism - to do too difficult a game," Marszał concludes in the piece. "It had a cool premise but that wasn't wise, especially for a team that was doing the game as a first game. It was just too ambitious. It was multiple aspects that, at the end, we knew, no, we won't make it. Either [cancel it] or we will spend another tens of millions of dollars and fail heavily." 
</p>
<p>
A number of 11 Bit staffers were slated to lose their jobs alongside Porject 8's cancellation, though some appear to have been transferred to other projects. Marszał has now confirmed that 18 people were let go. If you're one of them, I hope you've found your feet elsewhere.
