            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The likelihood of a roleplaying game once again getting most Game of the Year prizes after 2023's Baldur's Gate 3 is very high thanks to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The game has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-leads-the-golden-joystick-awards-2025-nominations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scored many nominations from the Golden Joystick Awards 2025</a>, with the winners due to be announced in a week from today.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the surprising sleeper hit of the year has received two 'votes' from industry figures like Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer and Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Famitsu</a>, Spencer mentioned various games as his personal 2025 highlights, but ultimately picked Sandfall Interactive's debut title out of the bunch.</p>



<p><em>Excluding our games… I love the game I'm playing now, Hollow Knight: Silksong. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, that's very good. Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound was also good. Also, although it is a game for PlayStation 5 and PC, my friend director Kojima's Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. The Game of the Year is probably Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</em></p>



<p>While not exclusive to Microsoft's platforms, the game was available on its subscription service, Game Pass, from day one. As such, one could think Spencer might be slightly biased in his choice, but he's far from the only one who thinks Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 deserves such recognition. Hamaguchi-san <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-directors-goty-pick-and-not-just-because-it-features-jrpg-inspired-combat-it-gets-all-of-the-elements-in-it-right/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Gamesradar the same thing</a>, although he was also careful to highlight how its merits go beyond the advancements made to turn-based combat:   </p>



<p><em>It's a really great game and would deserve Game of the Year. I'd like to see them get that. What makes that game so good is the fact it gets all of the elements in it right, and it balances them all at such a high level of quality. The setting, the world, the characters, and the storyline, those are all really well done as well, in addition to the gameplay. And I think it all comes together, and that's why it's such a well-regarded game, why the fans like it so much, why it sold as well as it had.</em></p>



<p>As you may remember, there was a bit of a controversy with Square Enix. A few years ago, Final Fantasy XVI Producer Naoki Yoshida famously excused the game's lack of a turn-based combat option <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-says-realistic-graphics-and-turn-based-combat-dont-fit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the statement that it did not mix well with realistic graphics</a>. Following the smashing success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, some Final Fantasy fans have been hoping that Square Enix might change its stance in the future, but for now, there have been no such announcements. It will ultimately be up to the producers of the next mainline installments to choose what's best.</p>



<p>In other Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 news, one of the biggest Hollywood stars of the past couple of years has <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollywood-star-glen-powell-loves-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently expressed interest in being part of the film adaptation</a>. By the way, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-tgs-2025-qa-no-dlc-rebirth-but-theres-a-chance-for-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we have our own TGS 2025 interview with Naoki Hamaguch</a>i about Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Part 3, in case you missed it earlier.</p>

            <p>In further evidence that the Vampire game series is as cursed as its toothy goreguzzlers, the developers of troubled battle royale offshoot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt</a> have announced that it’s shutting down for good – mere days after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Bloodlines 2</a>, the long-delayed (yet <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">apparently still okay-ish</a>) mainline sequel finally released.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This might not be surprising if you’ve followed Bloodhunt since its own launch in 2022, with low player counts leading to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-battle-royale-is-ending-development-after-last-years-launch">end of active development</a> just a year later. Devs Sharkmob said at the time that its servers will remain online as long as an "active player base and community" continued to exist, but <a href="https://bloodhunt.com/en-us/news/bloodhunt-servers-will-close-on-april-28-2026">today’s blog post</a> confirms those servers will beep their last on April 28th 2026. I guess that’s still a decent chunk of time to get any last Winner Winner Human Dinners in, though the announcement timing is curious – is the Bloodlines 2 timing a coincidence, or were Sharkmob hoping for a bump in interest-by-association that never materialised?</p>
<p>Either way, and as the post states, "the current player population has reached a level where keeping the servers running is no longer sustainable." Bloodhunt has also been taken off sale immediately, and existing players can no longer buy tokens – Bloodhunt’s in-game currency – through its shop. Any tokens left in your leather trenchcoat’s tattered pockets will still be good for virtual purchases until the server shutdown, mind.</p>
<p>We never reviewed Bloodhunt, and Alice B’s (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-preview">2021 preview</a> was based on too embryonic a build to judge the multiplayer experiment’s chances. I do remember playing a bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-system-requirements-pc-performance-and-the-best-settings-to-use">for hardware reasons</a>, but wasn’t terribly compelled: the inclusion of the 'masquerade' dynamic, wherein you’re encouraged to hide your vampiric powers and/or murders from the eyes of an ignorant public, might have made for a better battle royale twist if the game’s rendition of Prague wasn’t so empty. Which, unlike the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-devs-provide-workarounds-for-high-priority-bugs-including-seattles-populace-disappearing">accidental abandonment of Bloodline 2's Seattle</a>, wasn’t the result of bugs. And I know I bring up this god damned game every time I write about BRs, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> was already doing highly agile last-man-standery at much higher technical and presentational calibres.</p><p>Thus, Bloodhunt’s slow undeath is finally set for an end. At least Bloodlines 2 seems to be doing, again, okay-ish, peaking at a respectable #3 in the Steam Top Sellers charts last week and already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-mods-are-flowing-offering-quicker-movement-more-blood-and-a-pedicure">siring an active modding community</a>.</p>

            <p>Happy this week all! Good news, James has returned from India and appears none the worse for his voyages. I was hoping he'd come back with a top-to-bottom report on Indian game development, but no, it turns out the smirking jackanapes was merely "on holiday". Still, we welcome him back with open arms and in the Maw's case, orifices, because it's another stuffed week for PC game releases. Here are a few that seem noteworthy.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-jackery-1500w-portable-power-station-drops-50-off-amazon-preps-you-for-winter-outages-2000639219</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-jackery-1-500w-portable-power-station-drops-50-off-amazon-preps-you-for-winter-outages.1335562/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter storms knock out power without warning and leave homes dark and cold for hours (or even days). Having backup power stops being a luxury and becomes essential when your heating system shuts down, your refrigerator starts warming up and your phones need charging to stay connected with emergency services. The <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000</strong> portable (1500W) power station addresses exactly this scenario with enough capacity to run critical appliances during outages. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5029/">it’s hit an all-time low of $419 on Amazon, slashed from its regular $839 price</a>. This <strong>50% discount makes serious emergency preparedness accessible</strong> without the commitment and installation costs of whole-home generators.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5029/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power That Covers the Essentials</h2>
<p>The <strong>1,070Wh energy storage allows for actual use time</strong>&nbsp;and that’s important during emergency situations. This model will support a contemporary refrigerator for 10 to 12 hours, thereby preserving food during a power outage. Use it to heat a room for 4 to 5 hours when set to low output for a space heater, or use it to power LED lights, allowing them to keep shining for several days. The <strong>pure sine wave AC has a 1,500W continuous power</strong> output and comes with 3,000W surges that can handle motor startups for refrigerators or furnace fans.</p>
<p>The emergency charge feature through the Jackery app allows for a <strong>quick recharge to full power in only 1 hour</strong>. Normal portable chargers can only recharge to full power in 6 to 8 hours and gaps exist during multi-day power outage situations. This particular power bank will reach 100% power in 60 minutes only when emergency mode is enabled, although it comes optimized for 1.7-hour recharge for better battery longevity.</p>



<p>The chemistry used in the energy storage system – <strong>LiFePO4 (Lithium Iron Phosphate) – has a significantly longer lifespa</strong>n than that used in standard lithium-ion batteries that are found inside low-cost energy stations. This type of battery retains more than 70% of its original capacity after 4,000 charge cycles, meaning that it will last for more than 10 years. Standard lithium-ion batteries normally depreciate to 80% after 500 to 1,000 charge cycles.</p>
<p>The port options include both contemporary and traditional devices: The<strong> two USB-C ports support a total output of 100W Power Delivery</strong> for fast charging of laptops, tablets, or smartphones without requiring additional wall chargers. The <strong>USB-A port is for traditional laptops</strong>, and functions at standard rates. The <strong>three AC plug options</strong> allow for the simultaneous use of several appliances, such as a lamp, computer charger, and phone, at the same time. The <strong>DC car port option</strong> supports 12V-powered appliances such as portable coolers or tire pumps.</p>



<p>This time, the <strong>bundle comes with a 16-foot extension cord</strong> that is specifically made for use when connecting solar panels. The placement of the solar panels (sold separately) has to be carried out while exposing them to sunlight and the stations, on the other hand, need to remain either under cover or in vehicles. The weight – 23.8 pounds – is portable and make it simple to relocate from room to room.</p>
<p>With a price tag of $419 and a rating of 4.7 stars from buyers, it is an incredible bargain for a true emergency-power solution that works when it matters.</p>

            <p>Almost half of the 1,448,270 signatures amassed by the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Destroying Videogames</a> EU citizens' initiative have now been verified, according to the campaigners' latest update. Meanwhile, the group are working to "secure expert backing" which doesn't rely on "expensive consulting firms" for their effort to push EU lawmakers to look into the issue of publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">rendering online games unplayable when servers are switched off</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Out of 1,448,270 signatures, 689,035 are already verified, and 15 countries have met their thresholds," reads this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1og0kb3/stop_killing_games_announcement/">latest update post</a> from organiser Moritz Katzner. "We are still missing the two largest countries - Germany and France—but based on our current progress, we are confident we have surpassed the required thresholds." Getting over the signature verification hurdle was something the campaigners had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake">expressed concerns about previously</a>. There were fears that removing the fakes would result in the initiative falling short of the numbers needed to push for government action. Those worries were somewhat abated last month, with the group <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despite-fakery-concerns-stop-destroying-videogames-campaign-claim-around-97-of-their-signatures-are-valid-so-far">citing positive "early reports"</a> regarding the validity of their signature totals.</p>
<p>In his post, Katzner went on to claim that the European Commission's <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/consultations/commission-launches-open-consultation-forthcoming-digital-fairness-act">Digital Fairness Act</a> received a "record-breaking number of submissions" during its feedback phase. That act, which is the brainchild of European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, has been <a href="https://www.digital-fairness-act.com/">in the works since last September</a> and will aim to protect consumers against the likes of "deceptive or manipulative interface design, misleading marketing by social media influencers, addictive design of digital products and unfair personalisation practices, especially where consumer vulnerabilities are exploited for commercial purposes".</p>
<p>As for what the campaigners are currently up to, Katzner wrote that along with taking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/european-parliament-vice-president-throws-his-support-behind-stop-killing-games-campaign">meetings with politicians and governments</a>, they're "actively working to secure expert backing" for their initiative from developers in the industry. "Having politicians, lobbyists, and developers in our ranks is invaluable, but we must credibly address the tough questions - without relying on expensive consulting firms," the organiser explained.</p><p>"Our fight is not against a united CEO front," he added. "It’s against a handful of companies holding our favourite games hostage. That’s why we said 'enough' - and why so many of you did too. Let’s not just talk about developers but with them, big and small, who are already resisting these awful practices. We can’t undo past damage, but we can stop what’s coming. If we allow these few bad actors to dictate the future, we will continue to lose ground on issues that should never have arisen."</p>
<p>We'll see just how much support from within the games industry the Stop Destroying Videogames lot can get on board, while they wait for the rest of their initiative's signatures to be checked. Then, it'll be up to politicians and bodies to debate whether and how any action is taken in response to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-stop-killing-games-supported-eu-petition-now-closed-the-campaigns-loudest-voice-reckons-its-done-about-as-well-as-is-humanly-possible">this and similar campaigns across the globe</a>.</p>

<p>As spotted by our friends over at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-we-are-making-now-is-a-nintendo-game-metroid-prime-producer-kensuke-tanabe-reveals-creative-tensions-with-retro-in-new-book">IGN</a>, the book highlights some of the clashes that occurred between the North American studio and Nintendo itself during the development of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>.</p>
<p>Tanabe explains that while "Nintendo retained the final decision-making authority", there were "many instances early on where our approaches to the specifications did not align, leading to disagreements."</p>
<p>He says that Retro would often push back on key decisions, telling Nintendo that "this is how Western studios approach and think about game development." Tanabe countered this by explaining to Retro that "the game we are making now is a Nintendo game, and this is Retro’s first time working on one. I’ve been working on Nintendo games my whole career, so I believe I have the most experience in making Nintendo games. So please trust me first."</p>
<p>Tanabe reveals that these disagreements would often result in day-long meetings ending in a stalemate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One day, during a video conference about the Meta Ridley battle, our discussions kept clashing, and we couldn’t find common ground. Time slipped away, and by the time the meeting (which had started in the morning) finally ended, the sun was setting. Many Nintendo developers have learned from Mr. Miyamoto that the appearance of enemy characters should be designed based on functionality… this had not yet been articulated quite so concisely. As a result, it took time for us to convey the concept clearly to Retro."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that this was Retro's first game, it's remarkable that its staff felt bold enough to challenge Nintendo – but it would seem that this willingness to dig in is what helped make the three Prime games so memorable.</p>
<p>One example of stubbornness paying off is related to the game's Morph Ball transformation, which shifts the player's perspective to third-person. However, even then, a compromise was still reached.</p>
<p>"The transition animation for shifting from first-person Morph Ball mode was proposed by Retro," says Tanabe. "However, Retro also suggested a skip feature to reduce morphing time, but Mr. Miyamoto directed that it should be unskippable, as it was one of the opportunities to view Samus in third-person. Retro also proposed the mechanic of rolling through half-pipes in Morph Ball mode. Initially, Nintendo was skeptical, questioning whether it would actually be fun. However, Retro responded, ‘Please try it first before deciding.’"</p>
<p>Ultimately, Retro and Nintendo were able to produce a game which is now regarded as one of the best ever made, and Tanabe is keen to acknowledge the contribution of both parties.</p>
<p>"[The Metroid Prime Trilogy] was made possible by Retro maximizing the hardware’s potential through expert engineering, incorporating countless ideas without compromise to refine game design, and setting new standards for graphics in Nintendo titles."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has finally unveiled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, a remake of the campaign portion of Bungie’s beloved Halo: Combat Evolved. Halo fans have spent most of the weekend debating the changes Halo Studios has made for this upcoming 2026 shooter, from the addition of sprint to the more pristine art style. But what do the developers of Halo: Combat Evolved itself make of the remake?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jaime Griesemer is one of the key developers behind Halo. He was most involved with designing Halo’s famous ‘30 seconds of fun’ gameplay loop and designed much of the campaign itself. Now creative director at Highwire Games (Six Days in Fallujah), <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1981927318752039135" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Griesemer took to X / Twitter</a> to deliver an early verdict on gameplay footage coming out of Microsoft’s Halo: Campaign Evolved reveal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He did not sound impressed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"You aren’t supposed to be able to take the Warthog up to steamroll the Hunters," Griesemer said. "I intentionally placed rocks in the way so you had to fight them on foot. When you can just smash the crates out of the way it wrecks the encounters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But the worst part? They put trees in the landing area of the WooHoo Jump. Lame.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s unpack this a bit. Griesemer is criticizing a key part of the iconic campaign mission, The Silent Cartographer: the first encounter with two Hunters. In the original Halo, this fight is meant to be played with Master Chief on-foot (players soon discovered it was possible to brute force a Warthog into the arena). But in Microsoft’s remake, players can freely take their Warthog up to the Hunters and ride roughshod over their hapless victims. I imagine the Hunters, with their dying breaths, gurgling: “no fair!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(Oh, and that WooHoo Jump? <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982314253072953402" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Griesemer explained</a>: “There’s a ramp that is supposed to have a bunch of jackals at the landing spot. Your gunner would always say ‘Woohoo!’ When you got airborne.”)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Halo: Campaign Evolved – First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say Griesemer’s tweet, viewed 2.3 million times, has sparked a reaction online, with some fans insisting the level layout change ruins the gameplay flow, others saying this change and others like it will make the game more fun. As for Griesemer, in a subsequent tweet, he explained that if Microsoft is going to change Halo’s crates to be dynamic, then they should have also redesigned the encounters that use them as permanent cover."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982259703137829074" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He continued</a>: “Most people forced the Warthog through BECAUSE of the Hunters. The introduction of the Hunters was supposed to be intimidating and difficult, but in the light so you can understand them. Then you meet them in an enclosed dark area and they are even harder. But then you get Rockets and Vehicles and turn the tables. It’s a three act play of enemy design and you want to throw it in a blender. Fine, it’ll go down easier but it’s not going to taste as good.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1981959132082274764" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And</a>: “It’s like the dance remix of a classic song that skips the intro and the bridge and just thumps the chorus over and over.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Griesemer <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982317401426526649" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later offered</a> a potential explanation for this change: “On further analysis I’m sure it’s because the vehicles take damage and so you’re just as likely to destroy the hog as get it over the rocks. If anything that makes it -worse- because -none- of the vehicle tricks are going to work anymore.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">“Make it an option” is the biggest red flag for a dysfunctional design. We have no vision for what this is supposed to be, here’s the tools to fix it yourself.</p>— Jaime Griesemer (@32nds) <a href="https://twitter.com/32nds/status/1981964024511422902?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Another aspect of Halo: Campaign Evolved that Griesemer has taken issue with is the addition of an optional infinite sprint button. Sprint seems to be the biggest talking point about Halo: Campaign Evolved; while you can choose not to sprint, some are saying using it destroys Halo: Combat Evolved’s classic, considered gameplay pace and thus its sense of wonder. Others say believe it’s essential for the fun factor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Griesemer doesn’t sound like a fan of sprinting in the Halo remake, either. In another <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982098938305171538" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, he pointed out that the player was able to sprint into The Silent Cartographer’s shaft vignette so fast that it broke the music transition. “Who is this for?” he asked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then: “If the world isn’t scaled to sprint, you will be able to trivially skip encounters.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo: Campaign Evolved’s Needler, too, has caused quite the kerfuffle. This iconic Halo weapon shoots deadly needles into an enemy, then, after a cool-sounding charge, they explode. The Needler stands out because the ammo — the needles themselves — stick out the top of the gun, so you can easily see how much ammo you have at any given moment. Still, Microsoft saw fit to add an ammo counter on the Needler, just in case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This change has drawn some ridicule online, and Griesemer is clearly not a fan. “By far the most comically unnecessary embellishment in the whole announcement,” <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982161221957660863" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>. "I’m not sure it isn’t intentional satire.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982335105579548762" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Then</a>: “But why would you add an ammo counter to a weapon that IS an ammo counter in the first place?”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">By far the most comically unnecessary embellishment in the whole announcement. I’m not sure it isn’t intentional satire.</p>— Jaime Griesemer (@32nds) <a href="https://twitter.com/32nds/status/1982161221957660863?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In response to Griesemer's original, now viral tweet on Halo: Campaign Evolved, one user accused the veteran designer of “crying” about nostalgia, to which <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982107143923990827" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he responded</a>: “Because I made it right and they are breaking it for no reason.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982116418536788417" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He continued</a>: “... I think there are dozens of changes (reload speeds, no health packs, falling damage, etc) that make the game 'slicker' but ultimately less interesting.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Bungie left Halo behind to develop Destiny, Microsoft, via what was known as 343 Industries, continued the franchise with Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians, and 2021’s Halo: Infinite. The internet would suggest that with these games, Microsoft has struggled to recreate the Bungie “magic,” for want of a better term. Certainly Bungie’s Halo games are more fondly remembered than Microsoft’s. But why has Microsoft struggled so?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Griesemer was asked this question, and in his response revealed his thoughts on the idea of remaking Halo and continuing to make new Halo games now, nearly 25 years after Combat Evolved came out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s not the early 2000s anymore,” <a href="https://x.com/32nds/status/1982101197025919181" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>. “Halo is of its time, maybe more than any other game franchise. So they are constantly trying to either take Halo out of 2001 and modernize it (which breaks it) or take players back to 2001 with nostalgia (which is impossible).”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">“Keep getting them checks.” Remakes and remasters are soul-destroying and I feel for any dev working on one. They can’t win and even if they do they won’t get credit. Bad situation unless you are getting paid $$$.</p>— Jaime Griesemer (@32nds) <a href="https://twitter.com/32nds/status/1981934406303703219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Probably not. But I’m not sure what the point is of a “remake” anyway. Nostalgia? A new generation of fans? Occupying an enormous art team while you figure out what to do?</p>— Jaime Griesemer (@32nds) <a href="https://twitter.com/32nds/status/1981969408525578526?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">They kept the music and the AI the same, it looks like. I’m glad I can play it on a Sony system.</p>— Jaime Griesemer (@32nds) <a href="https://twitter.com/32nds/status/1982264974878839081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 26, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">One member of the original Halo team who sounds thrilled with Halo: Campaign Evolved is Marcus Lehto, who was the art director on Combat Evolved and thus heavily involved in the iconic look of Halo itself. Lehto, who recently left the now shuttered Battlefield 6 developer Ridgeline Games (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-co-creator-marcus-lehto-disappointed-ridgeline-staff-were-not-properly-credited-in-battlefield-6-says-they-built-the-foundation-of-the-game">and hit out at EA for not properly credited former staff</a>), offered a positive assessment of Halo Studios’ work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“My honest impression of seeing the new Halo Campaign Evolved is this," <a href="https://x.com/game_fabricator/status/1982523556320948338" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said on X / Twitter</a>. “I absolutely love where this is going. The game looks and feels genuine. It's gorgeous in a way I wish we could have built it originally back in 2001. It warms my heart to see Halo CE like this.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo: Campaign Evolved isn’t out until 2026 (and probably near to the game’s 25th anniversary in November), so Halo Studios has time to react to some of the feedback it’s seen and make changes — if that’s what it wants to do, of course. It may stick to its guns on the likes of sprint, those rocks, and the Needler's ammo counter. Meanwhile, the Halo community continues to debate the changes, fussing over every detail and what it means for the tone, feel, and gameplay of Bungie’s seminal shooter. I suspect this will be a running theme well into 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Halo: Campaign Evolved, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-for-the-xbox-exclusive-but-in-truth-the-ps5-version-comes-as-no-surprise">why it’s the final nail in the coffin for the Xbox exclusive</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<figure data-uuid="0d9cfe7bdc6d4"><a title="Legends Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0d9cfe7bdc6d4/legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're back with another look at the UK boxed charts and, surprising no one, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has maintained its lead in the second week, with original Switch sales now starting to outpace Switch 2. Heck, with 150 million+ consoles out in the wild, we expected nothing less.</p>
<p>However, according to Chris Dring over at <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/pokemon-legends-z-a-captures-no1">The Game Business</a>, sales are roughly 28% lower than that of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> across Europe. Going one step further, he states that Legends: Z-A is the smallest retail launch for the 'mainline' franchise since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_lets_go_pikachu_and_lets_go_eevee">Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu and Let's Go, Eevee!</a> in 2018.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qivnux&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Now, one potential explanation for this is that Legends: Z-A was heavily pushed for the Switch 2, which naturally has a much lower install base compared to its predecessor. Switch 2 sales for the game, in general, have been stronger than that of Switch 1 since launch on 16th October.</p>
<p>We've also got a few newcomers this week, but none of them have really made a substantial impact – at least in terms of retail sales. Digital is, of course, another story. We've got <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/jurassic_world_evolution_3">Jurassic World: Evolution 3</a> at number 5, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ninja_gaiden_4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> at number 12, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> at number 16, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/vampire_the_masquerade_-_bloodlines_2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> at number 20, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tormented_souls_2">Tormented Souls 2</a> at number 27.</p>
<p>Good news for Nintendo, then, as Switch / Switch 2 games make up half of the top ten here, including the aforementioned Legends: Z-A, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-update-custom-search-player-movement-progression-to-come/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised on Friday</a>, the development teams working on Battlefield 6 (DICE, Ripple Effect, Motive, and Criterion) have released the patch notes for update 1.1.1.0, which is set to go live tomorrow ahead of the debut of Season 1. The update will be released at 9:00 UTC, whereas the new season will be enabled at 15:00 UTC.</p>



<p>With this update, the developers aim to address some of the biggest pain points the Battlefield 6 community lamented in the game's first few weeks. For example, the player character's core movement and animations have been refined to provide smoother landings, faster stance transitions, and improved vaulting behaviour. Bouncing issues when landing or spawning have also been reduced.</p>



<p>When it comes to shooting, players have complained about weapon dispersion, which this patch reworks to better align the accuracy and handling of each weapon with its intended design and performance over range. These changes address cases where the accuracy was inconsistent, such as when dispersion did not properly settle after sprinting. The developers believe the tweaks will bring the overall firing behavior closer to the intended balance between precision, control, and weapon power.</p>



<p>Furthermore, users had requested visibility and lighting improvements, and the developers promise this new version of Battlefield 6 will feature better exposure transitions, interior lighting, and reduced fog and smoke persistence. There's even more to patch 1.1.1.0, including improvements to audio and user interface and, of course, a long list of fixes you can read all about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2807960/view/534364965583194766" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the official changelog post</a>.</p>



<p>Between this patch and the debut of Season 1, EA and the development teams are hoping to keep the momentum going. The game's launch was as successful as they wanted, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breaking franchise sales records</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">garnering acclaim from critics</a> and fans alike. Season 1 will be pivotal, although <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">based on the hands-on by our David Carcasole</a>, there are highlights (the new Conquest maps) and downsides (the new small group modes).</p>



<p>The Battle Royale mode is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-shadow-drop-next-week-rumour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to make its debut in Battlefield 6 tomorrow</a>, although there has been no official comment yet.</p>

            <p>Screenshots for Bluepoint's cancelled live service God Of War game appear to have slipped through the titan fingers of publishers Sony. Assuming they aren't a dream woven by Morpheus (via his earthly emissaries at <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-first-look-at-cancelled-god-of-war-multiplayer-game-unveiled">MP1st</a>), they reveal a few work-in-progress environments from the abandoned project, which Sony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-put-the-axe-in-a-live-service-god-of-war-game-alongside-a-project-from-the-days-gone-studio">reportedly cancelled earlier this year</a> alongside a new game from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> devs Sony Bend.</p><!--more-->
<p>As you might expect, the screens are heavy on Ancient Greek architecture. Although perhaps you weren't expecting that, given that the last couple of Gowwers took place in settings from Nordic myth, with occasional, mostly unwelcome cameos from Kratos's old chums south of the Alps. MP1st's source for the screenshots claims that the game would have featured Hades, god of the underworld, playing the part of armory master. This suggests it would have taken place prior to God Of War 3. The cavern roofs and yellow sulphur pools in the snaps certainly look rather Stygian. There are also interiors with broken bridges and balconies that imply a touch of platforming. </p>



<p>The things that spring out to me the most from those screens are the pots. Such glorious pots! Pots of lime green and charcoal black and deepest terracotta, flaking away to bare pink clay. Pots with rolling, woven patterns and cute little handles and cracks that bespeak a lifetime of humble service. How I yearn to hit them with an axe and see how they fall apart. How I yearn to charge through them like piles of leaves. Quality pot smashing is six tenths of the thrill of action-RPGs, even when they aren't game-as-a-service projects in which hidden, semi-random loot is the focus. It doesn't matter how many HBO-courting father-son storylines you pack in if the urns don't break real good.</p><p>I'd say these pots are fit to be published, but uncle Sony had other ideas. They've spent much of the past few years splurging on live service games, and are now cutting back on that investment in the wake of the ill-fated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a> (which they threw in the bin mere weeks after launch). Bluepoint appear to be keeping busy in the wake of the reported God Of War cancellation. Earlier this month, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-job-listing-at-bluepoint-games-fuels-speculation-over-its-next-project-but-is-bloodborne-really-likely">discovered</a> that they were advertising for a senior combat designer with a "solid understanding of combat systems and mechanics for third-person melee action experiences".</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s update 1.1.1.0 is set to go live tomorrow, a day before the Season 1 launch, and it's taking a sledgehammer to one of the biggest problems players have had with the game since launch.</p>
<p>The key change in question addresses weapon dispersion, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/missing-shots-in-battlefield-6-well-you-might-not-be-bad-a-bug-might-be-throwing-your-shots-off">which has been throwing off player's shots ever since the game released earlier this month</a>. For those unaware, weapon dispersion refers to bullets spreading out from where you're aiming when you look down sights. Players have been taking shots they feel <em>should</em> be hitting, only to see them miss the target, leading to frustration.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981737524255961272">According to the patch notes</a>, the patch will rework weapon dispersion as to: "better align accuracy and handling with each weapon's intended design and performance over range. These changes address cases where accuracy behaved inconsistently, such as dispersion not properly settling after sprinting, and bring overall firing behavior closer to the intended balance between precision, control, and weapon power."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-default-settings-may-be-throwing-off-your-aim-on-pc-heres-how-you-fix-it">PC players have been jumping into the in-game settings to help remedy this problem</a>, so here's hoping these tweaks leave the game in a good state when it comes to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-battlefield-6-is-best-selling-entry-in-the-series-7m-copies-sold-172m-online-matches">the shooting portion of this hugely popular FPS</a>.</p>
<p>The 1.1.1.0 update will also be improving core movement animations, improving lighting and visibility, overhauling the audio, updated the UI and HUD, and fixing a scattering of problems on some maps. There's also a massive list of smaller changes on the way, including the ability to leap uphill, and the ability to customise your parachute. Nice.</p><p>This update should hopefully place the game in a solid state ahead of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-finally-has-its-season-one-trailer-showing-new-weapons-maps-and-a-tactical-game-mode">Season One update</a>, which is bringing a new game mode, a new giant map, new weapons, a shiny new vehicle, and other additions to EA and Battlefield Studios' blockbuster military shooter.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch-episodes-1-2-review-%E2%80%93-you-can-do-this-all-day.1335538/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Dispatch doesn’t mess around. Within the first ten minutes, it’s dropped umpteen F-Bombs, given you the option to drop an informant off a balcony, and shown you a supervillain’s luminous dick. Marvel’s Avengers this is not! Resurrecting the spirit of Telltale’s iconic narrative-driven episodic games, Adhoc Studio, alongside Critical Role, have updated the formula for 2025, creating an interactive cartoon that riffs on a post-Invincible/The Boys superhero universe. Based on Episodes 1 and 2, you’ll remember that.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dispatch | Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fTVgX7b1N8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Robert Robertson is Mecha Man. A third-generation hero who lacks any actual superpowers, but uses the Mecha Man suit to fight crime in Los Angeles. It seems that in this world, there are quite a few powers to go around, with the existence of superhero-only bars and Superhero organisations that take numerous heroes under their wing.</p>


<p>Robert Robertson – he’s not Bob or Robbie like his father and grandfather, because he wanted to be taken seriously – begins Episode 1 on a revenge mission. His father died in the Mecha Man suit after facing off against Shroud, a former hero-turned-villain, and Robert needs to find Shroud and… well, you get to decide.</p>
<p>As with all Telltale games, the narrative here is interspersed with decisions, with two or three branches sending you in slightly different directions. Do you talk openly about your father’s death, or brush it away? Do you drop the guy you’re interrogating off the building, or pull him back onto the balcony? Does Robert say, “F*#k it” and choose the option that seems kind of stupid?</p>


<p>The animated cutscenes look fantastic, and this is absolutely a fully realised interactive cartoon. You can choose between cinematic mode, which only leaves you with branching dialogue choices during your playthrough, or interactive, which introduces QTEs to each of the action sequences. These do give you some more interaction, and if you’re looking to have at least the vaguest of game experiences, it’s probably the one to go for. That said, the storytelling through the opening episode is good enough that just sitting back and enjoying it is a valid option.</p>
<p>After at least one, very key event, you get to the Dispatch part of the game. Robert receives a job offer from SDN, delivered by the mildly overly-friendly Blonde Blazer. This company employs a number of heroes, and they’re looking to you to work as their dispatcher. Sending the right hero to perform the right mission, whether that’s stopping bank robberies or helping old ladies cross the road. The tutorial for this becomes part of your interview, and it’s up to you to follow the logic puzzles through to their conclusion. Hopefully, you’ll get the job or it’s going to be a very short season.</p>

<p>Episode 2 see you heading over to SBN for that job – so I guess even if you’re terrible at it, you’re getting a do-over. This might just be the most compelling game mechanic you’ve ever seen in a Telltale/narrative-driven game. As the dispatcher, you have to send out the right team member based on the requirements of the emergency, and their strengths will make success or failure more or less likely.</p>
<p>This is made more complicated by things going wrong mid-mission, and the fact you’ve been put in charge of the worst, on-the-cusp-of-being-kicked-out, team at SDN. They’re also former villains, so it’s like managing a mildly reformed Suicide Squad, and hoping they don’t set fire to the park in their attempts to get rid of criminals. As you’d expect, there’s plenty of opportunities for humour with that, and largely, the comedy hits its mark each time.</p>

<p>At the close of each episode, you get to see what other people have chosen at critical points in the story, which never fails to be interesting, even if it doesn’t truly add all that much to the experience. Are you a bad person? Did you do something barely anyone else did? I’m sure that there’s some kind of hidden personality test going on here, and I hope it’s not one I’m failing.</p>
<p>The production values are stellar. Breaking Bad’s Aaron Paul takes the lead, and his rendition of the world-weary but ever-so-witty Robert Robertson is spot on, while the rest of the cast includes such luminaries as The Batman’s Jeffry Wright, video game aficionado Alanah Pearce and Telltale alumni Erin Yvette. The animation is top-notch, and the character design is right on point from the off, with Mecha Man’s robotic suit is a part-Iron Man, part-Transformer marvel.</p>

<p>We’re only two episodes in on the eight-episode arc, but Dispatch is already making a bid for one of my favourite games of the year. If you’re into Invincible or a fan of Telltale’s best works – that’s The Wolf Among Us, just so we’re clear – then you owe it to yourself to get onboard with Dispatch. You’ll still be in time for the water-cooler chat.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Forza Motorsport Series Is Just Resting for Now, Says Phil Spencer]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, when Turn 10 Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost over 70 members of its development team</a> as part of the latest round of layoffs mandated by Microsoft, a former employee <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-dev-turn-10-support-forza-horizon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that Turn 10 had effectively been turned into a Forza Horizon support studio. This chain of events had fans fearful about the future of the racing simulation franchise.</p>



<p>Now, at last, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer commented on this as part of a Tokyo Game Show 2025 interview <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Famitsu</a>. The Japanese magazine asked him whether the Halo and Forza Motorsport franchises were done for. Spencer vehemently denied that for Halo (which was quickly confirmed when the long-rumored Halo: CE remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced this weekend</a>), but had a more elaborate response with regards to the racing IP, hinting that it is currently 'resting' - albeit still not over.</p>



<p><em>No! Halo Studios is planning for the future and taking on new challenges. We're committed to Unreal Engine 5 and new technologies. We're committed to giving them the time they need to invest in the Halo franchise and create the next great game in the Halo series. </em></p>



<p><em>Regarding Forza Motorsport, we sometimes need to shift our focus to games that are released sooner. We understand the reaction many people had when we scaled back Turn10 Studios. We have a large number of games we want to support carefully, and sometimes we give development teams a little more time to avoid putting them under strain. Our current structure allows us this flexibility.</em></p>



<p><em>Xbox Game Studios has over 20 studios, and we have many games in development, each with different support needs. We have both short-term and mid- to long-term perspectives. We want our games to be successful. Xbox Game Studios is currently developing many titles, so please look forward to them in the future.</em></p>



<p>The thing is, Microsoft already tried giving Turn 10 Studios a lot more time with the next chapter in the racing series. Whereas the first seven Forza Motorsport games were released every two years without fail between 2005 and 2017, the last one, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-motorsport-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a reboot launched in 2023</a>, took six years to make and was still ultimately underwhelming according to most long-time fans. It also doesn't help that its sister franchise, the open world arcade racing game Forza Horizon, is massively more popular and <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will return next year with the long-awaited Japan setting</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, a ResetEra user <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-training-gaming-copilot-ai-watching-you-play-games-unless-you-turn-it-off/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> that the new Gaming Copilot AI installed by Microsoft on all Windows 11 PCs (integrated directly into the Game Bar) was training itself by screenshotting every game played by the user and then sending everything back to Microsoft. Gaming Copilot is also enabled by default, so if you want to turn it off, you need to go to the Game Bar, and then to Settings and Privacy Settings, where you will find the option for Gaming Copilot to pull "Model training on text" or not.</p>



<p>Needless to say, this discovery sparked a big controversy on what several users felt was a highly intrusive feature sneakily introduced by Microsoft. Following the news, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/microsoft-says-gaming-copilot-uses-screenshots-to-understand-in-game-events-not-for-training-ai-models-optional-feature-can-be-turned-off-but-not-easily-uninstalled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom's Hardware</a> was able to get a statement from the company about what the AI actually does:</p>



<p><em>When you're actively using Gaming Copilot in Game Bar, it can use screenshots of your gameplay to get a better understanding of what's happening in your game and provide you with more helpful responses. These screenshots are not used to train AI models, and Gaming Copilot is an optional feature that only has access to gameplay when you're playing a game and actively using it. Separately, Gaming Copilot may use its text or voice conversations with players to help train and improve AI. Players can adjust Gaming Copilot's privacy settings by visiting 'Settings' in the Game Bar, followed by 'Privacy Settings.</em></p>



<p>The AI <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-launches-copilot-for-gaming-beta-on-mobile-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first tested earlier this year on mobile devices</a>, though the global rollout only started last month on both PCs and the Xbox mobile app. Microsoft introduced Gaming Copilot as a sidekick specifically designed for gamers. Using AI, it recognizes which game is being played and understands the user's Xbox activity, allowing it to answer questions about games the user is interested in, provide links to further information when its response includes web sources, and answer various questions based on the user's account, play history, and achievements. Essentially, it is a guide to the game, should the player need it. Of course, it should be entirely optional, and its training feature should be disabled by default to comply with privacy laws.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Might Be Renamed to ‘Sonic CD’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-rename-sonic-cd/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-might-be-renamed-to-%E2%80%98sonic-cd%E2%80%99.1335514/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been claimed by a prolific insider that Paramount is considering a name change for the Sonic the Hedgehog 4 movie, slated to hit the big screen in March 2027. In recent reports, it was suggested that the film and television titan is looking to rebrand the movie to ‘Sonic CD’, in reference to the classic game of the same name.</p>



<p>There aren’t many details around the fourth movie in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, which is in a pre-production state at present. It follows Sonic the Hedgehog 3, released in December 2024, and will make the film franchise, which started in February 2020, a quadrilogy.</p>



<h2 id="h-sonic-cd-could-feature-time-travel-elements">Sonic CD Could Feature Time Travel Elements</h2>



<p>Industry insider DanielRPK has claimed that Paramount will mull over a name change for Sonic the Hedgehog 4. It has been suggested that ‘Sonic CD’ is the most likely pick for a new title going forward, breaking the naming convention trend that has existed since the run-up to the first film’s release in 2020.</p>



<p>It was earlier suggested by DanielRPK (reported by <a href="https://maxblizz.com/paramount-reportedly-considering-sonic-cd-as-the-new-title-for-sonic-the-hedgehog-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MaxBlizz</a>) that Sonic the Hedgehog 4 will feature ‘a time-travel plot’, which is taken straight out of Sonic CD, released way back in 1993.</p>



<p>It’ll likely be confirmed either way soon, as filming is set to begin in the coming months, and the studio is working with a slated release date of March 19, 2027.</p>



<p>In the recent Sonic space, it was confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rumble-release-date-november-5-pc-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonic Rumble</a>, a party royale game with a stunning character roster, is headed to mobile and PC platforms in early November, dropping worldwide on the fifth.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-shadow-the-hedgehog-trademark-quietly-registered-by-sega/">Shadow the Hedgehog trademark</a> was quietly filed by SEGA, but nobody knew why.</p>

<p>It’s not a title we thought we’d be sharing today, but here we are. In a recent post on social media, The White House published an image of President Donald Trump, now embodying Halo’s Master Chief, saluting the American flag. In his hand is grasped an energy sword, and in the background sits the House itself.</p>



<p>The post was published in response to GameStop declaring the end of all console wars as Halo prepares to be released on PlayStation for the first time. In a way, The White House is probably suggesting that President Trump ended this war, too.</p>



<h2 id="h-commander-in-master-chief">Commander in (Master) Chief</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> was recently revealed by Halo Studios during the Halo World Championship event. As Halo Infinite comes to a close, other projects are emerging, including this Unreal Engine 5 reimagination of the game that kickstarted the series back in 2001 on the original Xbox platform.</p>



<p>Back in August, dataminers and eagle-eyed fans of the sci-fi franchise were finding references to PlayStation ‘compatible’ Halo games. We now know that the references were pointing to Halo: Campaign Evolved.</p>



<p>Sadly, some gamers are finding out about the existence of this game by way of The White House, using AI to generate an image of President Trump in full Spartan garb as Master Chief:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Donald Trump recently shared a video (not created by him) showing him flying a fighter jet and dumping a mysterious brown liquid over protestors in a jab at the No Kings movement. That was also an AI construct, and the sharing of the clip was met with backlash from more than a few people.</p>



<p>One such person who took offense to the clip was Kenny Loggins, the artist behind Danger Zone, a song synonymous with Top Gun and featured in the clip circulated by Trump.</p>



<p>Do you think The White House is wrong for using AI to replicate Halo like this, or is it not that deep? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a new week, and that means seven fresh opportunities to keep your NYT Connections streak going await. Today’s puzzle is a great way to get your brain whirring as you wake up for a new Monday morning, and whatever challenges the day will bring.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I’m here again with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions that you need to ace today’s puzzle. Read on to get hte answers you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-27">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 27)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #869:</p>



<ul>
<li>ONLY</li>



<li>CONNECT</li>



<li>OLIVE</li>



<li>BRANCH</li>



<li>FAB</li>



<li>FAN</li>



<li>JUST</li>



<li>TWIST</li>



<li>FANTASTIC</li>



<li>SIMPLY</li>



<li>CHERRY</li>



<li>SPREAD</li>



<li>RADIATE</li>



<li>MINT</li>



<li>PETIT</li>



<li>MERELY</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These words all describe ways something can extend or disperse outward</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each of these words minimizes or qualifies something</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Classic bar-top embellishments</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Famous groupings or phrases that end in “Four”</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 27.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-27-869">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 27 (#869)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BRANCH, FAN, RADIATE, SPREAD</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – JUST, MERELY, ONLY, SIMPLY</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CHERRY, MINT, OLIVE, TWIST</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – CONNECT, FAB, FANTASTIC, PETIT</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>These icons will be made available between 28th October and 4th November, and you'll need to have a Switch Online membership to redeem them. As you can see, there's Mario dressed up as a pumpkin, and the rest of the Super Mario cast is joining him with their own themed outfits.</p>

<p>As usual, these icons will set you back 10 Platinum Points each, with backgrounds and frames priced at 5 Platinum Points each. This follows on from some NSO Icons for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/marios_super_picross">Mario's Super Picross</a> earlier this month. You can see these particular icons in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/marios-super-picross-has-got-some-rather-lovely-nso-icons">our previous post</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from this, Nintendo will also be celebrating Halloween in games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>. Plenty of other titles are joining in on the fun as well, with events and updates.</p>

              <p>Power outages, camping trips and outdoor events all share one frustrating problem:<strong> you need electricity where there isn’t any</strong> or you can’t rely on the grid to stay up when you need it most. Portable power stations solve this by packing serious battery capacity into something you can actually move around and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5002/">EcoFlow’s Delta 3 just hit an all-time low of $519 on Amazon, dropped from its usual $699 price</a>. This <strong>1024Wh unit can power 13 devices simultaneously</strong>, charges from dead to full in under an hour, and uses LiFePO4 battery chemistry that’s rated for 4000 cycles over a 10-year lifespan.</p>

<h2>Fantastic 1500W Continuous Power</h2>
<p>The Delta 3’s charging speed is what separates it from cheaper alternatives that take eight to ten hours to refill. EcoFlow engineered <strong>this unit to accept up to 1500W from a wall outlet and 500W from solar panels simultaneously</strong> which means you can throw 2000W of combined input at the battery. In practice, this gets you from zero to 100% in just 56 minutes when using both AC and solar input together. Even using just the wall charger alone, you’re looking at about 90 minutes for a full charge.</p>



<p>The battery itself uses LiFePO4 chemistry which is lithium iron phosphate, a different formulation than the lithium-ion cells in your phone or laptop. LiFePO4 cells are more stable, less prone to thermal runaway and significantly more durable over repeated charge cycles. <strong>EcoFlow rates the Delta 3 for 4000 cycles to 80% capacity</strong>&nbsp;which means you can fully charge and discharge this battery 4000 times before it degrades to 80% of its original capacity. That’s 25% more cycles than industry standard portable power stations,<strong> and it translates to roughly 10 years of daily use</strong>. The battery pack carries an IP65 rating, which indicates protection against dust ingress and water jets from any direction.</p>
<p>Capacity sits at 1024Wh. To put that in perspective, a typical laptop draws about 60W so you could run it for roughly 17 hours. A mini fridge pulling 100W would run for about 10 hours. A CPAP machine for sleep apnea averages 30-60W and would operate through multiple nights on a single charge. The <strong>1800W AC output means the Delta 3 can handle power-hungry devices like microwaves, coffee makers, power tools</strong> and space heaters. EcoFlow’s X-Boost technology pushes this even further by supporting resistive load appliances up to 2600W, though with some performance reduction.</p>



<p>The<strong> port options provide a total of 13 outlet options</strong>&nbsp;which come in various types. There are <strong>six AC outlet slots on the front of the unit</strong>&nbsp;which is more than what most of its contemporaries provide. However, this still won’t be enough if you plan on using all of your gadgets simultaneously. The <strong>USB-C port provides a total of 100W</strong> which is enough to provide a rapid charge for your laptop, tablet, or smartphone. There’s also a <strong>12V car outlet</strong> perfect for gadgets intended for use inside a vehicle. Additionally, there’s a DC5521 outlet.</p>
<p>Make sure you don’t miss that deal, it’s a record low price for the latest EcoFlow power station.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-quietly-liquidates-xm4-stock-at-new-record-low-amazon-just-sold-10k-units-2000639122</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-quietly-liquidates-xm4-stock-at-new-record-low-amazon-just-sold-10k-units.1335403/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Noise-canceling headphones have become essential gear for commuters and travelers who need to block out the world and focus on what matters. Sony just quietly liquidated XM4 inventory on Amazon, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">dropping the price to $198 from the usual $348</a>, and the timing is interesting because both the XM5 and XM6 are on the market at nearly three times this price.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing though: the technological improvements between these new generations are minimal and most users can’t tell the difference in real-world use. The XM4 delivers the same<strong> exceptional active noise cancellation, 30-hour battery life, multipoint connection, and premium sound quality</strong> that made Sony the leader in this category. Amazon has already moved over 10,000 units at this all-time low price, and it’s easy to see why.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Industry-Leading Noise Cancelation</h2>
<p>The core feature that made the XM4 legendary is Sony’s Dual Noise Sensor technology which <strong>uses microphones on both the outside and inside of each earcup to capture ambient sound</strong>. The <em>HD Noise Canceling Processor QN1</em> analyzes this audio data over 700 times per second and generates inverse sound waves that cancel out unwanted noise. This isn’t passive isolation from thick padding, though the earcups do provide physical noise blocking too: This is active electronic cancellation that targets low-frequency rumble like airplane engines, train noise and air conditioning systems.</p>



<p>The noise cancellation levels on the Sony can <strong>now be adjusted by an additional 20 levels through an app,</strong> and gives you complete control over how much of the environment you can shut out. The ambient sound mode reverses this by letting ambient sound come in through the headphones, which can be useful if you need announcements in an airport or traffic direction if you’re on foot. Again, there are 20 levels of adjustment there. The <em>Quick Attention</em> mode can be activated by resting your hand on top of the right cup which will instantly give you ambient sound while reducing the volume of your music.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery life reaches an impressive 30 hours of non-stop use</strong> with active noise cancellation, which will take you through not one but multiple cross-country flights or an entire week of commuting. The quick charging function is a lifesaver if you remember too late that you need to plug them in before bed. Charging via USB-C will give you an additional 5 hours of use after just 10 minutes of charging. Charging from empty will take a mere 3 hours.</p>



<p>The <strong>touch controls on the right side of the headband</strong> allow all of your playback and calling controls right at your fingertips. Simply swipe up or down to change the volume, swipe forward or backward to skip tracks, tap once to play or pause playback, or tap twice to answer or hang up a phone call. The touch controls take a little getting used to if you’re accustomed to physical buttons, but after a day of using them, they become second nature. The voice assistant compatibility comes with both Alexa and Google Assistant which can be accessed by either giving it the wake-up phrase or by pressing and holding the touch panel.</p>
<p>Wear detection uses a proximity sensor on the left ear cup that <strong>automatically pauses audio playback when you take off the headphones</strong> and resumes playback when you put them on. This conserves battery life as well as ensures that you do not miss anything in your podcast or audiobook. The XM4 headphones come with multipoint technology that allows you to pair two different devices simultaneously. For instance, you can be connected to your laptop as well as your smartphone. The audio automatically switches from one device to another according to which is in use.</p>
<p>At $198, you’re paying less than many mid-tier noise-canceling headphones while getting performance that rivals anything on the market today, regardless of price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-dumps-supersonic-hair-dryer-stock-now-selling-for-pennies-against-what-salons-charge-2000639117</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-dumps-supersonic-hair-dryer-stock-now-selling-for-pennies-against-what-salons-charge.1335397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Professional blowouts at a high-end salon easily run $60 to $100 per session and if you’re getting your hair done weekly, that’s thousands of dollars annually for results that last just a few days. Dyson just dropped the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/">Supersonic Origin hair dryer to $299 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $419 price</a>, and at this all-time low, you’re paying the equivalent of three to five salon visits for a tool that delivers the same professional-grade results at home for years to come.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This isn’t your average drugstore hair dryer: The Supersonic <strong>packs Dyson’s digital motor V9 that spins at 110,000 RPM</strong>, <strong>intelligent heat control</strong> that measures air temperature 40 times per second, and <strong>Air Multiplier technology</strong> that amplifies airflow by three times.</p>
<h2>Changes the Way You Dry Your Hair</h2>
<p>The key motor element of the Supersonic is Dyson’s digital motor V9: This motor is a brushless DC motor which is much smaller and more lightweight than traditional hair dryer motors. Typical conventional dryers place the motor in the foundation of the unit but Dyson relocated this motor to the handle of its unit. The motor’s speed of 110,000 RPM has more than just show value: This speed powers an impeller which draws air into its chambers. The motor pulls this air into its chambers at a rate of 13 liters of air every second.</p>



<p>The Air Multiplier technology is taken from Dyson’s bladeless fans. The function of this technology is the <strong>induction of air from the motor and then amplifying it through a carefully created hole</strong>. This amplifies the air into a <strong>three times more powerful jet of air</strong> than the motor’s capability, but this air comes from a smooth airflow. For this reason, it becomes capable of drying your hair sections quickly without releasing it all over the place.</p>



<p>The area where the Dyson Supersonic differs from more affordable models is heat control: The unit comes equipped with a glass bead thermistor sensor located in the airflow that t<strong>racks the temperature of the air up to 40 times every second</strong>. This information is then used by the microprocessor to make adjustments on the fly to ensure it does not reach unsafe levels. High temperatures damage hair by breaking down the protein bonds which makes it brittle, dry, and easy to break. The problem with most conventional dryers is that it can often reach temperatures above 300°F which is damaging enough on its own: The <strong>Supersonic keeps its top speed below 230°F</strong>.</p>
<p>Another field that Dyson ventured into is acoustic engineering: The hair dryer is a device that has always been known to generate considerable noise levels. This happens as the motor, along with airflow, produces sound waves of undesirable frequencies that tend to cause irritation in human ears. Dyson’s design of the motor ensures the <strong>generation of sound waves of frequencies higher than 16kHz&nbsp;which cannot be detected by human ears</strong>. Additionally, Dyson provided an acoustic silencer in the airflow path which serves to suppress sound waves. The outcome is a hair dryer that produces less noise than its predecessors.</p>
<p>The Dyson Origin series has only one magnetic attachment which is the styling concentrator. The styling concentrator is used for focusing airflow which enables the user to dry or style his or her hair. The magnetic attachment system is an excellent design aspect of this series: The user can easily switch from one attachment to another without waiting for it to cool down or handling it with hot hands.</p>
<p>For only $299, you will be paying the price of five salon blowouts but you will be gaining so much more than that.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-rival-baseus-100w-usb-c-charger-now-selling-for-pennies-on-the-dollar.1335394/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The modern tech life means juggling multiple devices that all need power at different times, and there’s nothing more frustrating than watching your laptop die while your phone sits at 10% because you only have one charger between them. Baseus just solved that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4261/">headache with their 100W USB-C charger that’s now down to $34 on Amazon, dropped from its usual $49 price tag</a>. This <strong>three-port powerhouse</strong> can charge your MacBook Pro, iPad, and iPhone simultaneously and at this all-time low price, it costs less than what Apple charges for a basic 20W charging brick.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4261/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two USB-C and One USB-A Ports</h2>
<p>The two USB-C ports support the PD 3.0 protocol which is the current standard for fast charging on everything from smartphones to laptops. When you plug a single device into either the C1 or C2 port, <strong>you get the full 100W output, enough to charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro at full speed</strong>. That means you can go from dead to 50% in about 30 minutes, which is clutch when you’re running between meetings or need to top up before a flight. The 100W capability also covers the Steam Deck, iPad Pro and any other USB-C laptop that draws significant power.</p>



<p>The intelligence comes into play when you’re charging multiple devices simultaneously. Baseus has incorporated their own smart power allocation technology, BPS 3.0, in this charging station. The technology analyzes which devices you’re connecting to each port simultaneously <strong>then allocates the power according to the device</strong>. Let’s say you’re charging your MacBook Pro on port C1, your iPhone on port C2 and your wireless headphones on the USB-A port. The charging station automatically adjusts the power allocation among all three. Your laptop receives more priority and more current, your phone gets charged as quickly as it can, which is its safe charging speed, and your headphones get exactly what they need, which doesn’t mean it gets excess current.</p>



<p>Heat management is where cheaper chargers fall apart, sometimes literally. When you’re pushing 100W through a device the size of a deck of cards, thermal control becomes critical. Baseus uses gallium nitride technology which is a newer semiconductor material that’s significantly more efficient than traditional silicon. GaN components <strong>generate less heat and allow for smaller charger designs</strong> without sacrificing power output. But Baseus didn’t stop there: They incorporated their BCT cooling system (which stands for Baseus Cooling Technology) and it actively monitors the internal temperature in real-time. Better thermal management also extends the lifespan of both the charger and your device batteries, since excessive heat degrades lithium-ion cells over time.</p>
<p>The physical design is engineered well: <strong>The prongs can be folded flat into the device</strong>. As a result, you don’t have to worry about the metal pins damaging your other electronics in a backpack or luggage. Being slightly more than two inches on each side, it doesn’t occupy much space on a power strip. Moreover, it won’t occupy space in other outlets. Otherwise, you would be forced to use a laptop charger that’s the size of a small box.</p>
<p>For only $34, you will be charged less than a single dollar per three watts of its charging abilities, supporting all the gadgets you use.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-laptop-with-office-365-drops-65-now-beats-even-the-cheapest-budget-laptop-on-price-2000639086</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp-laptop-with-office-365-drops-65-now-beats-even-the-cheapest-budget-laptop-on-price.1335379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Looking for a solid laptop that won’t drain your bank account? HP just dropped one of the most aggressive deals we’ve seen this year on Amazon: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5001/">HP 14-inch laptop with a full year of Office 365 included is now sitting at $279, slashed from its typical $799 price tag</a>. You read that right, a 65% discount that makes this machine cheaper than most bare-bones budget laptops on the market. This configuration <strong>packs an Intel Processor N150, 4GB RAM, 256GB total storage</strong> and a full docking station with 8 ports. HP couldn’t offer such a steep reduction on their official site, so they’re quietly moving inventory through Amazon where the real laptop deals happen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5001/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Deal Actually Makes Sense For Regular People</h2>
<p>Most people don’t need a powerhouse machine that costs over a grand. You need something that boots up fast, handles your daily tasks without freezing, and doesn’t die halfway through your workday. This HP 14 checks all those boxes with surprising competence. Under the hood, y<strong>ou’ve got an Intel Processor N150 that can turbo up to 3.6 GHz</strong> when you need that extra push. That’s a <strong>quad-core chip with four threads and 6 MB of cache</strong> which translates to smooth performance when you’re juggling browser tabs, editing documents or video calling with your team. It’s not built for gaming or heavy video editing, but for work and light content creation, it handles everything without the annoying lag.</p>



<p>What’s more, you’re getting 4GB of DDR4 RAM which is honestly the bare minimum for comfortable multitasking in Windows 11, but it’s enough for most everyday scenarios like working in Office apps, streaming content, and managing emails. The storage solution is interesting because <strong>HP splits it between 128GB of internal flash storage and includes a 128GB Micro SD card</strong> in the package. This gives you 256GB total to work with, and you can keep your operating system and programs on the internal drive while using the SD card for documents.</p>
<p>The battery life is another strong point here: <strong>HP claims it lasts through a full day of work or study,</strong> and based on the specs and the efficiency of the N150 processor, that’s believable. No more hunting for outlets in coffee shops or lecture halls.</p>



<p>The connectivity is surprisingly good given it’s a laptop of this price: You get the benefits of Wi-Fi 6, which is the latest standard for quick and stable wireless networking. The port selection is genuinely impressive. There’s a USB Type-C port capable of 10Gbps transfer speeds, two USB Type-A ports for your legacy devices, HDMI 1.4b for connecting to external displays, and an SD card reader.</p>
<p>But here’s where it gets better: <strong>HP bundles an 8-in-1 docking station</strong> that expands your connectivity even further. You also get an additional USB Type-C port, an RJ-45 ethernet port for wired connections, two more USB 3.0 ports, both SD and Micro SD card slots, a headphone jack, and a 4K HDMI port. That <strong>docking station alone would cost you $30 to $50 separately</strong>, and it transforms this laptop into a legitimate workstation when you’re at your desk.</p>
<p>The laptop comes <strong>pre-loaded with Windows 11 Home S mode</strong>. Windows S mode is a stripped-down version of Windows that will not install anything from outside the Microsoft store. The good news is you can switch out of S mode for free if you need to install traditional desktop programs.</p>
<p>The best part of the <strong>whole deal is the addition of Office 365, an entire year of it</strong>. This costs a staggering amount of $69.99 annually: It provides users with Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook as well as 1TB of cloud storage via OneDrive. For a student or a professional using office tools, this itself provides an amazing amount of worth to an immense portion of the purchase price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Screenshots of the cancelled God of War multiplayer game have surfaced online. The Bluepoint-led project, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-live-service-games-cancelled-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which was shelved</a> alongside a Blur Studio game, was never confirmed, but known to be worked on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it’s been revealed that <strong>screenshots from a in-progress build</strong> of the title have emerged online. Even more so, it confirms that the God of War project would have returned to an early time: during the original trilogy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-god-of-war-multiplayer-game-would-ve-returned-to-greece-screenshots-reveal">God of War Multiplayer Game Would’ve Returned to Greece, Screenshots Reveal</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mp1st has been a very reliable source of information for quite some time. From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-reboot-concept-art-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rare-cancelled-everwild-screenshots-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everwild</a>, they’ve been quite accurate with their reports. Now, the outlet has <strong>found screenshots of the cancelled God of War multiplayer title</strong>.</p>



<p>Its source has provided them with a ton of screenshots, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-first-look-at-cancelled-god-of-war-multiplayer-game-unveiled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available here</a>, and provide some interesting insight. It’s important to note that, while it may be true, take it with a grain of salt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most notable detail in the screenshot is that <strong>it would have taken place in Greece</strong>. The God of War series hasn’t been back to the setting since God of War: Ascension in 2013. Even more so, mp1st’s source told them that Hades would’ve been involved in some way. This means that the game would’ve taken place prior to his grotesque demise in God of War 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this is the only information we have at the moment. As the project wasn’t officially confirmed, details, like gameplay and such, will likely be as hard to find as Pandora’s Box. Still, it’s interesting to see what the vision Bluepoint was going for with the live-service project. The future of God of War is a bit uncertain, but, with reports of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-filming-march-2026-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon TV show</a> starting up next year and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumoured-god-of-war-metroidvania-game-will-feature-kratos-brother-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2.5D game</a>, it won’t be long before Kratos (or his brother) picks up those blades once again.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>President of Xbox game content and studios, Matt Booty, has claimed the company's competition no longer lies with other game studios and console developers, but "everything else".</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/arts/halo-playstation-microsoft-xbox.html">The New York Times</a>, primarily discussing the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">shock announcement that Xbox's longtime brand mascot, Master Chief, and exclusive first-party game, Halo, would be coming to PS5</a> in 2026, Booty said the decision came as a result of "seeking to meet people where they are", moving away from console exclusivity in a bid to reach more players.</p>

<p>"Our biggest competition isn't another console," Booty said. "We are competing more and more with everything from TikTok to movies.</p>
<p>"We are all seeking to meet people where they are."</p>
<p>It's a vastly different position to both Nintendo and Sony's PlayStation brand, both of which continue to avariciously guard their first-party exclusives, with Sony only recently experimenting with porting its console games to PC, albeit often months after their console debut.</p><p>Commenting on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">over 9000 employees laid off from the company</a> during the summer, which Microsoft told Eurogamer was "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace" at the time, Booty said: "Layoffs are difficult. They are a part of managing our business".</p>
<p>While the total number of laid off employees in gaming positions remains unknown, the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot, and a new ZeniMaz MMORPG</a> were cancelled, roughly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build">200 staff from Candy Crush developer King were laid off</a> and have reportedly been replaced by the AI tools they helped to build. The team at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-motorsport-is-no-more-claims-former-turn-10-employee-following-microsoft-cuts">Turn 10 Studios behind Forza Motorsport is also reportedly "no more"</a>, and the knock-on effect has also resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-next-shooter-project-loses-funding-following-microsoft-cuts">funding being cut for Romero Games' next project</a>, though contrary to reports the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-studio-not-closed-as-publishers-express-interest-in-saving-cancelled-game">studio has not closed</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">Microsoft confirmed the Halo series is coming to PlayStation 5</a>. In a new demo debuted at the Halo World Championship, Microsoft revealed Halo: Campaign Evolved – described as "a faithful yet modernised remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-combat-evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>'s campaign" – is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S next year. It marks the first time ever a Halo game will be released on a PlayStation system.</p>
