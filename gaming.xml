            <p>
Abubakar Salim, creator of the recent Tales of Kenzera: Zau, has addressed the "fever pitch" of "constant targeted harassment" the studio has received since the release of the game.
</p>
<p>
The game is inspired by Salim's own story of grief and set in an Afrofuturist world based on Bantu Tales and African folklore.
</p>
<p>
However, in a video posted to X, Salim responded to the abuse received and announced a price drop for the game on Switch.

<p>
"We are being faced with constant targeted harassment from people who see diversity as a threat, from people who look across the vast landscape of modern media and decide that anything that doesn't speak to them or centres around them is unnecessary and inauthentic," he said.
</p>
<p>
"There's always a reason diverse stories can't exist. It's either we're doing it the wrong way or it's just there to tick boxes. And it's just beginning to feel like there is no right way, these exclusionary rules just continue to stack up and the goalposts continue to shift until me, my studio, people who look like us just sit down, be quiet and just accept the fact that you're outsiders. But I won't do that."
</p>
<p>
He continued: "If there are people who aren't like you in a game, I want you to know that game is still for you. If the characters are a different race, or a different gender, or a different ideology, or a different perspective, that doesn't mean the game isn't for you. It can still be for you. It's an opportunity to live in rich new worlds, to explore different perspectives, to explore different cultures... you just need to be open to it."
</p>
<p>
In response, Salim has worked with Nintendo to drop the price of Tales of Kenzera: Zau in the US until the end of June, which he intends to do across all platforms.
</p>
<p>
"I really believe games are for everyone, that's why I insisted on setting Zau's cost at the price of a pizza," said Salim.
</p>
<p>
"I genuinely believe in the power that games have to bring us closer together," he surmised. "Diverse games are not about taking something away from you, they're about adding something in. Because there's room for all of us."

<p>
Sadly, since the release of the video, Salim and the development team have received further abuse accusing them of faking the harassment as a marketing ploy.
</p>
<p>
Salim has addressed this in a further thread.
</p>
<p>
"Since the first moments of creating this game, the focus was on my father's legacy and what I wanted it to leave behind to represent that," he said. "Since announcing, we steered away from race as a subject matter as much as possible, because the game isn't about that. It's about the human journey of grief. 
</p>
<p>
"This didn't stop the harassment that came our way. And I knew that as soon as I chose to address the subject of race, the legacy of this game would be diluted. But something had to be said. Suffering in silence wasn't an option. It needed to be addressed. Because by not speaking to it, countless others out there who would also suffer in silence and not see the power they have to tell stories through their unique perspectives, whether they choose to make the race of the character a key focus or not."

</p></div>

<p>
Salim has been refreshingly open about the development of the game in the run up to its launch and ever since. 
</p>
<p>
"There are all sorts of obstacles you have to go through [to make a game], but I feel like that knowledge needs to be shared," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/abubakar-salim-on-metroidvanias-as-a-vehicle-for-grief-and-storytelling">he previously told Eurogamer about his transparency</a>. "I think it's important to be quite open and talk about this and I think we're getting there, we're slowly moving towards that kind of position."

</p>
<p>
Salim's comments follow a new wave of anti-diverse sentiment that's seeped into the gaming community, particularly after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-alan-wake-ridiculous-fishing-devs-speak-up-in-support-of-consultancy-studio-sweet-baby-inc">work of diversity consultancy Sweet Baby Inc.</a>, which has been wrongly accused by some of pushing a "woke agenda" in the games industry. 

</p>
<p>
"I've not played a game like Tales of Kenzera before because this type of setting isn't seen enough in gaming, whether due to under-representation in the industry or perceived lack of interest from players," I wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-review">Eurogamer Tales of Kenzera: Zau review</a>. "But these stories deserve to be told and Salim deserves praise for creating a game with a world that feels so fresh and unique."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-combat-freedom-different-experience/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The third and final entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake series may end up being a very different game than its predecessors, judging from some recent statements from the development team.</p>
<p>Speaking in a new episode of <a href="https://youtu.be/j4fE8ATUr3s">Inside Square Enix</a> focusing on Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, battle director Teruki Endo revealed how he is thinking about how to give players even more freedom, suggesting a further push towards an action-based combat system, a push that was already evident in the INTERmission expansion and Rebirth with the inclusion of Precision Guard and improved aerial combat.</p>
<p>It's not only combat that will likely feel different in the third part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake over its predecessors. Director Naoki Hamaguchi commented on the conclusion of the series, saying that they want to give the fans a different kind of gameplay experience than what they had in the previous two games, suggesting that even the open-world formula introduced in Rebirth is going to be shaken up to offer this different type of experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="シナリオ×ワールド×バトル 『ファイナルファンタジーVII リバース』 こだわりの掛け算と限界への挑戦【#スクエニの創りかた】#FF7リバース #FF7R" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j4fE8ATUr3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>No matter what, it will be a few years before we can experience the conclusion of the Final Fantasy VII Remake series, as it will take at least three more years to come out. Given Rebirth's ending, it will be very interesting to see which direction the story will take in the third and final part of the series and how everything will be wrapped up in a game that promises to be epic.</p>
<p>The second entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake series, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, is now available on PlayStation 5. You can learn more about it by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

			<p>Microsoft's next Xbox console is said to feature an AI accelerator to handle AI tasks.</p>
<p>At least, that's what WindowsCentral's Jez Corden <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/the-enormity-of-microsofts-windows-phone-shut-down-mistake-is-becoming-increasingly-clear-in-the-ai-era" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a> to have heard from reliable sources in a freshly-published feature article about Windows Phone. According to Corden, this neural processing unit&nbsp;(NPU) inside Microsoft's next hardware will be able to perform some AI tasks, including Auto SR - <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsofts-automatic-super-resolution-upscaling-limited-to-copilot-pcs-select-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's own resolution upscaling tech</a>. "Reliable sources tell us that the next Xbox will sport an NPU for handling some AI tasks, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/microsoft-demos-baldurs-gate-3-borderlands-running-at-30-fps-on-the-new-snapdragon-x-elite-windows-on-arm-platform-with-auto-super-resolution-support-in-tow" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/microsoft-demos-baldurs-gate-3-borderlands-running-at-30-fps-on-the-new-snapdragon-x-elite-windows-on-arm-platform-with-auto-super-resolution-support-in-tow" data-component-tracked="1" data-hl-processed="none" data-custom-tracking-id="2826340130651112283" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-label="automatic Super Resolution">automatic Super Resolution</a>, for example, without detracting from the CPU or GPU", Corden writes. "The next Xbox will also have some form of Copilot, offering guidance in-game without having to use websites like ours (<em>RIP Windows Central</em>). Still, the amount of people likely to use these tools on Xbox is minuscule compared to the default setting on iOS or Android."</p>
<p>Although Corden initially said the AI accelerator (NPU) would come from Qualcomm, he later clarified that the manufacturer isn't known at this point.&nbsp; "<em>Currently, the manufacturer is unknown at my end, but it's most likely AMD", </em>he later added.</p>
<p>Further details haven't been shared by Corden, but it's interesting information nonetheless. As covered last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-reference-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's next Xbox console is said to be very different from the current console and will be a "reference design" for manufacturers</a> to make their own game devices.</p>
<p>Back in April of this year, we reported that Microsoft is seemingly working on an Xbox AI chatbot that helps automate certain tasks. According to The Verge, this bot can, for instance,&nbsp; help automate game refunds. Whether this AI Chatbot is related to the copilot that Corden mentioned, is not entirely clear. "“We are testing an Xbox Support Virtual Agent, an internal prototype of an animated character that can query Xbox Support topics with voice or text,” Xbox general manager of gaming AI, Haiyan Zhang, told the Verge last month. “The prototype makes it easier and quicker for players to get help with support topics using natural language, taking information from existing Xbox Support pages.”</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn about Microsoft's next Xbox.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rog-ally-x-launch-specifications/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/rog-ally-x-launch-specifications/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The Asus ROG Ally X has officially been revealed, and pre-orders are now live! Here’s more information about the handheld console, including specifications, pricing, and availability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The handheld gaming community has been growing steadily in recent times, with manufacturers releasing new devices and refreshes more frequently. The latest refresh comes for arguably the most used handheld console in the industry right now: the Asus ROG Ally. The Asus ROG Ally X is the successor to the handheld console, and it brings a few exciting upgrades. However, it isn’t a complete overhaul that many might be expecting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ROG Ally X vs ROG Ally</p>



<p>There are some notable enhancements for the ROG Ally X, including a lot more RAM, coming in at 24GB LPDDR5 – 7500 MT/s, compared to last gen’s 16GB LPDDR5 – 6400 MT/s. This upgrade will help with performance through the increased RAM and faster speeds. The next big change is its storage, which has doubled from last-gen’s 512GB to 1TB M.2 2280 NVMe PCIe Gen 4 SSD this time around. This means you can fit even more games on your device when traveling (how convenient!)</p>

<p>Moreover, the one change that fans will be the most excited about is the battery, as Asus has listened to the community and doubled the capacity from 40Wh to 80Wh, which is exciting, to say the least. Lastly, there are minor tweaks to the body, such as enhancements for the handles, the chassis, and the joysticks. Also, the ROG XG Mobile port has been discarded for USB 4 ports on the new device. However, the APU is the same one from the last gen, which is AMD Ryzen 1 Extreme. Check out the full specifications of the ROG Ally X below.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>A DIY engineer has created a realistic tank simulator that puts the average haptic controller to shame. The mechanical monster is jury-rigged to the top of an office desk and must be reloaded with a new shell after every shot. The recoil is terrifying. It's operated by three people: one person drives the tank with a steering wheel and levers, another uses cranks to aim the gun barrel, and a third reloads the shells that eject automatically from the chamber after every desk-lifting blast. The "shells" in question are 2-litre bottles of fizzy drink, and the crew has set up a whole rack of these bottles for panicked reloading. If you are the kind of person who yearns for the immersion of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_Battalion#/media/File:Steel_Battalion_controllers.jpg">legendary Steel Battalion controller</a> then you will get a definite buzz from watching the death machine in action below. </p>

<p>Just look at that smoke. This is a reupload to YouTube - the original video was posted by homebrew engineer "malublyat" on Chinese <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Qw4m1U7q3/">video sharing site BiliBili</a>. The video includes a link to World of Tanks, the free-to-play tank sim by Wargaming. That's what the crew appear to be playing on the monitor, you see. It's possible developers Wargaming have partnered with the engineer in a classic act of viral marketing, however the video description doesn't say so outright. So it's also possible the engineer is doing his usual thing. Because this is not the first ludicrous machine to come from this user's channel.</p>
<p>Malublyat is described in Chinese articles as a "well-known tech uploader" (thanks to Jeremy for the translation). The engineer has a strong record of creating wild video game controllers and funny devices. Here he is building <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Jz4y1Y7tB/">a mounted machine gun that glows so hot you can light a cigarette on it</a>. And here is an <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1qk4y1x72X/">anti-aircraft gun that can swivel around</a> as you fire into the digital skies. You may have already seen this viral video on TikTok: a  <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@malublyat/video/7073337519273790763">desk with built-in recoil to be paired with CS:GO</a>.</p>
<p>Marketing stunt or not, I respect and fear the human ability to engineer wild (possibly unsafe) controllers for the purposes of entertainment. If you like this sort of thing, there were many other weird controllers and games on display at EGX a couple of years ago, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kcOaSy0vnE">a game played with a Morse code machine and a warped pool table</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-wont-just-keep-farming-the-last-of-us-games-says-druckmann/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a statement relayed <a href="https://www.latimes.com/l-a-influential/story/2024-06-02/neil-druckmann-the-last-of-us-video-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the Los Angeles Times</a>, Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann confirmed the studio will create games other than The Last of Us sequels.</p>
<p>This is not very surprising. The Santa Monica-based developer owned by Sony Interactive Entertainment has a history of switching franchises between console generations. It all started with Crash Bandicoot with the original PlayStation console. Despite the great success, Naughty Dog decided to create a new IP when the PlayStation 2 was launched: Jak &amp; Daxter.</p>
<p>The same happened with the PlayStation 3. At this point, Naughty Dog left behind not only the IP but also the platform genre, targeting a more mature audience with Uncharted. Just a few months before the launch of the PlayStation 4, the studio launched The Last of Us, its most acclaimed and best-selling franchise to date. Uncharted wasn't immediately abandoned like Crash Bandicoot and Jak &amp; Daxter, appearing for two more games with Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy, but it is pretty much on the back burner now. The same could eventually happen with The Last of Us, too, despite the success of HBO's TV show. The studio is now working on 'multiple projects, ' almost certainly brand new intellectual properties.</p>
<p>First, of course, fans are expecting The Last of Us Part III. Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-3-story-outline-already-drafted-but-the-game-isnt-being-made-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> over three years ago that a story draft was ready, although the game wasn't in development yet. Back then, Naughty Dog was still focusing on The Last of Us Online, which got <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canned</a> earlier this year as the studio chose to maintain its single player story-driven focus.</p>
<p>In February, Druckmann publicly <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-iii-exciting-concept-decided-druckmann-tommy-story-shelved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> that Naughty Dog had found an exciting concept for The Last of Us Part III while also teasing it might be the last chapter in the saga. More recently, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-druckmann-new-project-is-the-most-thrilling-yet-may-redefine-mainstreams-perception-of-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the game they're now making is 'fresh,' and he's excited about how the world will react to it.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-the-last-of-us/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/naughty-dog-will-not-be-a-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-says-neil-druckmann.887856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-the-last-of-us/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new interview, Neil Druckmann has said that Naughty Dog will not remain a The Last of Us studio forever. </p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/l-a-influential/story/2024-06-02/neil-druckmann-the-last-of-us-video-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a>, Druckmann said that the studio is working on “multiple single-player projects”, and that “I promise you, we will not be ‘The Last of Us’ studio forever.”</p>



<p>“We create experiences that are steeped in story and character, especially relationships,” Druckmann said. “The stories have some sort of philosophical core that everything is going to revolve around and feed into.”</p>



<p>Following the success of The Last of Us HBO TV series, many fans thought that Part 3 of the game would soon be coming. However, in an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-will-develop-the-last-of-us-part-3-if-they-can-come-up-with-a-compelling-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview in early 2023</a>, Druckmann implied that might not be the case. Using the Uncharted series as an example, Druckmann said, “Just because something is successful, people think there’s all this pressure and we have to make a sequel. That’s not the case. For us, Uncharted was insanely successful — Uncharted 4 was one of our best-selling games — and we’re able to put our final brushstroke on that story and say that we’re done. We’re moving on.”</p>



<p>On Part 3, he continued, “Our process is the same thing we did when we did Part 2, which is if we can come up with a compelling story that has this universal message and statement about love — just like the first and second game did — then we will tell that story. If we can’t come up with something, we have a very strong ending with Part 2, and that will be the end.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-part-3-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rumors from late 2022</a> have already suggested that The Last of Us Part 3 is already in development and with the success of the TV series, and of course multiple single-player titles in the works at Naughty Dog, it’s hard to imagine that a Part 3 is not in development.</p>



<p>Waht do you think of Naughty Dog’s future? Will you welcome The Last of Us Part 3? Let us know in the comments below! </p>

            <p>
The legendary Horiyuki Sanada, star of hit Amazon TV series Shogun, is in talks for a role in the upcoming Ghost of Tsushima film.
</p>
<p>
That's according to veteran movie tipster <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/105254279?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_source=android">DanielRPK</a>, who shared word of the discussions over the weekend. 
</p>
<p>
Sanada, who played Toranaga-sama in Shogun, is also known for his roles in The Last Samurai, Sunshine and Lost. He's next set to appear on cinema screens in another video game adaptation: Mortal Kombat 2.

<p>
While this isn't yet a confirmation of Sanada's involvement by PlayStation Studios itself, fans are already celebrating the actor's potential involvement - and speculating who he might play. 
</p>
<p>
The obvious choice is Lord Shimura, the uncle and protector to Ghost of Tsushima's protagonist Jin. 
</p>
<p>
"As much as I want the cast of the game to reprise their roles, he would be a killer Shimura," one fan wrote on reddit.
</p>
<p>
"He's pretty much perfect as Lord Shimura," wrote another. "I would be very surprised if he was cast as anyone else."
</p>
<p>
Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-wick-director-making-ghost-of-tsushima-movie">announced a film adaptation of Ghost of Tsushima in 2021</a>, helmed by Chad Stahelski (director of John Wick: Chapter 4 - which also stars Sanada).
</p>
<p>
Progress on the project has been relatively slow, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-ghost-of-tsushima-movie-adaptation-names-its-writer">Takashi Doscher named as its writer in 2022</a>. But Stahelski has continued to discuss the project, and has said his desire is for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-will-be-a-complete-japanese-cast-in-japanese">"a complete Japanese cast, [speaking] in Japanese" throughout</a>.
</p>
<p>
Developed by Sony's Sucker Punch studio, Ghost of Tsushima originally launched for PlayStation 4 in 2020, and finally arrived for PC last month. As ever, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ghost-of-tsushima-on-pc-delivers-impressive-upgrades-over-ps5">Digital Foundry has cast its beady eyes over the Ghost of Tsushima PC port</a>.

SGF is sort of already in motion - last week, Sony kicked off the proceedings with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-concord-and-more-everything-pc-relevant-announced-at-playstation-state-of-play-may-2024">their latest State of Play showcase</a>, but you can expect the majority of new videogame announcements from Friday 7th June with the Summer Game Fest 2024 Opening Showcase, a two-hour livestreamed event which starts at 10pm UK, 5pm ET and 2pm PT. I'll be out there covering the whole sorry affair in LA from Thursday to Monday while the remainder of Rock Paper Shotgun hold the fort on London time.

It's a period of frightful bounty for the Maw, our resident Hadean icon of videogame news consumption. Look forward to trailers, celeb cameos, surprise demo releases, around a million hours of interlude music, and hands-on impressions fresh from the creaking furnace chambers of my jetlagged brain. Still, SGF isn't All She Wrote this week. A few brave developers and publishers are releasing new games alongside the event, like individual rockets plunging into Uncle Geoff's Fervid Fireworks Show. Here are a few that have caught our eyes.
</p>
<p>
Monday 3rd June sees the release of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/306130/The_Elder_Scrolls_Online/">Elder Scrolls Online's Gold Road expansion</a>, which Katharine (RPS in peace) considers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-onlines-new-gold-road-expansion-might-just-make-me-an-mmo-convert">a solid gateway drug to MMOs in general</a>, together with lurid 90s room-escaper <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1484760/Tamarindos_Freaking_Dinner/">Tamarindos Freaking Dinner</a>, in which you deliver pizza to a mansion full of Tim Burton-esque munsters. On Tuesday 4th June, there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2336880/Destiny_2_The_Final_Shape/">Destiny 2's Final Shape expansion</a>, a project whose success or lack thereof will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-face-a-full-sony-takeover-and-more-layoffs-if-destiny-2-the-final-shape-flops-according-to-reports">reportedly determine whether Sony mounts a full takeover of Bungie</a>, together with a pair of fairly handsome strategy games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2195410/Songs_of_Silence/">Songs Of Silence</a> (which looks a bit like a deck of Tarot cards) and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985050/Field_of_Glory_Kingdoms/">Field Of Glory: Kingdoms</a> (which looks a bit like a medieval manuscript). There's also asymmetrical horror outing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1556100/Killer_Klowns_from_Outer_Space_The_Game/">Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game</a>, which Nic will be upset if I don't mention. Wednesday 6th June sees the release of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1113010/Chornobyl_Liquidators/">Chornobyl Liquidators</a>, which is "not a fantastic tale of exploring the Zone" but "a story about real people facing a real threat", and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1206410/Kristala/">Kristala</a>, a Soulslike with a touch of Robin Jarvis. And on 7th June, finally, the "deceptively cute" (aren't they always?) factory sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1955110/Star_Stuff/">Star Stuff</a>.
</p>
<p>
As ever, let me know if we've missed anything I would feel deeply embarrassed about missing, and enjoy the week. You can follow our routine news coverage in the liveblog below, which I'm going to extend into Sunday so you can follow the deterioration of my writing abilities in real-time. Onward, to SGF! Keighley &amp; Friends! The Endless June! The Geoffervescent Circus!

        <p>The funding round was led by Play Ventures</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Hypersonic Laboratories has raised $7 million in a series A round led by Play Ventures.</p>
<p>AppWorks, WTIC, KB Investment, and Alex Ekvall also contributed to the round, with the funding going towards further development of Helix.</p>
<p>The sandbox platform aims at facilitating the creation of role-playing mods and servers. Helix is due to launch in a closed alpha later this year.</p>
<p>Helix initially launched as a web3 platform with an NFT marketplace, but the team recently switched to web2 and removed any blockchain and NFTs.</p>
<p>Hypersonic previously raised $4 million, having been founded in 2019 by CEO Jack 'Maker' Kim.</p>
<p>He commented: "It shouldn’t be that hard for the millions of people out there who want to mod or play modded games, but until Helix, there’s just never been a professional toolset or platform built by modders, for modding.</p>
<p>"Our team, cumulatively, has built mods and modding frameworks with more than 100 million total downloads – all in their own free time. Imagine what they can do now that they’re actually being paid to do it!"</p>

            <p>June has arrived and with it comes the usual cavalcade of video game announcements, all presented in a series of livestreamed showcases.</p>
<p>The season technically kicked off last week with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/astro-bot-and-concord-bookend-playstations-state-of-play-showcase">PlayStation's State of Play</a>, but the barrage of trailers will ramp up from Thursday, with Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest showing on the following day, culminating with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-forward-set-for-june-10-news-in-brief">Ubisoft Forward on Monday, June 10</a>.</p>
<p>In between, we'll see the latest announcements from Xbox, IGN Live, Devolver Digital, Wholesome Games, and more.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also confirmed it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-switch-2-promises-announcement-by-april-2025">will release a Nintendo Direct at some point in June</a>, which will show off titles it has coming to Switch in the second half of 2024. The platform holder has said this broadcast will not mention the console's upcoming successor.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/welcome-to-cooking-week.887838/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/welcome-to-cooking-week-<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p><span>Kirby image via Nintendo.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Food and cooking mechanics have a long history in video games, evolving from health power-ups to sidequest and mini-games and eventually into a creative pillar holding up entire genres. As we start out our week focusing on cooking games and restaurant simulators, let’s examine some of the most popular themes across the genre and explore what developers can learn and apply to their own delicious side dishes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some of the earliest uses of food in video games come from the classics; in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pac-Man</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (1980), we saw fruit used to award points based on how long the player could survive in a level. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Burgertime</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (1982), food preparation is at the core of a challenge rooted in skill, with players stacking different ingredients like lettuce and tomato to assemble a hamburger. In games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gauntlet</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (1985), large chunks of meat are used in health restoration, inspiring the classic and oft-quoted line: “Warrior needs food badly.” Whatever the era in gaming, food and cooking have served many design goals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As games grew in complexity, so did our context for the use of food, leading eventually to games that allowed you not to just eat but to cook. Among the earliest were games like the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cooking Mama</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (2006) on the Nintendo DS, which simplified the process of cooking down to easy visual steps and used the device’s second screen touchpad to mimic techniques like slicing or chopping vegetables. Another, 2012’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cook, Serve, Delicious!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (based on the 1999 PlayStation title </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ore no Ryouri</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which we explore in an interview with developer David Galindo later this week) used cooking as more of a concept, focusing on quick time button sequences to mimic the preparation and assemblage of a dish.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the years since open-world survival games have risen in popularity, so too has the concept of in-game cooking. It can be seen as a staple in games as broad as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Don’t Starve</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (2013) to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with a wide range in complexity. Some cooking games focus on gameifying the techniques of cooking. Others focus on the utility of food, like power-ups or health items while others still use it to reinforce a game’s crafting systems, adding an element of worldbuilding by teaching the player the regional flora and fauna.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why does cooking in games appeal to us, both as players and game makers, so much? Well, on the more obvious side, human beings have evolved to take cues about a food’s texture, flavor, and freshness from its appearance, and our appetites rely on that appeal. Think of the entire industries that have sprung up around food plating and presentation, be it the factory that manufactures food models for restaurant displays or fancy Michelin-starred restaurants that incorporate elements of traditional visual arts into each dish. What we see is a big part of enjoying what we eat.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This visual aspect combined with personal tastes can also turn cooking into a mode of self-expression. What we cook is a reflection of our skills, our opinions, our resources, and our history. As with other art forms, the joy is as much in its creation as the final product. (This topic is evoked briefly in our upcoming interview with the developers of TapBlaze later this week, “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Good Pizza, Great Pizza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would not exist if not for Costco.”)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there are many themes that cooking touches on, each speaking to its different roles. Cooking is a part of our everyday lives, a symbol of routine, stability, even boredom. It’s also a part of our special occasions, our holidays and family gatherings: times that call for scarce ingredients and hours of tedious but worthwhile labor. With that in mind, here are some of the themes, mechanics, and stories we'll explore in full this week.</span></p><p>Image via Visai Games.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Food, family and heritage">Food, family and heritage</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Venba</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a strong recent example of a game that depicts the complicated intersection of cooking and family, touching on racism, identity, and parental sacrifice while walking us through a trial-and-error process that reinforces the procedure of certain techniques in Tamil cooking. On top of crafting game mechanics out of dishes and cooking equipment unique to Indian cuisine, Venba also gave opportunities for the player to think about why we cook, and the emotions that are poured into the act of service, whether we’re connecting with our roots or sacrificing our time and energy for the benefit of someone we love.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One title that more directly attempts to educate players about a culture is the upcoming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rooster</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a point-and-click adventure game that celebrates Chinese culture through its visual style, music and ancillary features like papercrafting and cooking. Developer Deborah Chantson opined on this topic in “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-upside-of-using-culture-and-personal-stories-as-game-pillars">The Upside of Using Culture and Personal Stories as Game Pillars</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">” earlier this year, discussing the merits of using personal heritage in game design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another game to take this approach is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://creativags.itch.io/cacaocafe">Cacao Café</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which replicates the agricultural and culinary practices around the production of chocolate in ancient Mexica culture. We discuss this more in the article, “Exploring ancient Mexica culture through cooking in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cacao Café</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">” later this week.</span><br></p><p>Coffee Talk also bears an element of self-expression, allowing players to create foam art on the drinks they serve to customers. Image via Toge Productions.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Food, community and socializing">Food, community and socializing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Community can be many things, but the act of communing itself is well depicted within games, where service and hospitality often play a key part not only in our perception of this act but our role within it. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/914800/Coffee_Talk/">Coffee Talk</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the player is a barista whose job is in part that of a confidante, similar to that of the bartender in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/447530/VA11_HallA_Cyberpunk_Bartender_Action/">VA-11 HALL-A</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. As you listen to a customer’s story and pour them a coffee, there’s a lovely mirror between the thought and care put into actively listening to them and the drink you make based on their verbal tip-offs and emotional cues.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other games use cooking to reflect relationships in other ways; take for example </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Sword</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shield</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which let the player set up camp and make curry for their Pokémon, choosing different ingredients based on the strengths of their team to build stronger friendships, in turn giving the player a superior edge in battle.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another aspect explored in food and community is its role in socializing. One dish that shows up in many indie games is hot pot, traditionally a meal that is served for a group of people,&nbsp; becoming a metaphor about the unique stresses of eating as a group, as seen in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://keanerie.itch.io/hot-pot-panic">Hot Pot Panic</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This is somewhat subverted in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://rachelqxl.itch.io/hot-pot-for-one">Hot Pot for One</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which depicts the loneliness of being an ex-pat in a new city by walking players through the sad experience of having all the ingredients for a social dinner, and not enough friends to share it with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This topic is explored more this week in the Q&amp;A, “Why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Arctic Eggs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are a dish best served cold”, where developer Keven Brown discusses why they chose to create a game that reflects more on the social aspects of eating and cooking than the technical logistics, and what it says about the utility of eating versus the camaraderie of its creation. It is also warmly dissected in our upcoming Featured Blog from senior editor Bryant Francis, entitled “Strategy games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> let us think about the bigger picture of cooking,” similarly reminiscing about the value placed on food outside of its immediate necessity, and how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> supports that through its design.</span></p><p>In Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2, players manage not only incoming orders but the janitorial and kitchen responsibilities of running a restaurant, too. Image via Vertigo Gaming Inc.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Cooking and performance anxiety">Cooking and performance anxiety</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the other end of the spectrum are the games where the focus is timing, performance and successful execution of a specific skill. There are many series that model this by combining a light facsimile of actual food preparation with the frenzy of fast-paced restaurants, sometimes contextualized as a simulation (like</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Chef Life: A Restaurant Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/deep-dive-balancing-the-authentic-culinary-experience-with-chef-life-a-restaurant-simulator">whose developers shared with us their formula for achieving that balance in 2023</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). Sacrificing authenticity for simplicity, these games center on customer service, challenging players to master timing as each ingredient is prepped, cooked, plated, and served.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interesting to note that it’s often the addition of selling labor that adds the element of stress; whereas </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Venba</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or the cat cafe game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Calico</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> evoke comfort and safety, restaurant and food prep sims like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cook, Serve, Delicious!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Overcooked</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are all about performing in high-pressure situations. This is taken to an extreme with the surreal horror game</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1851380/Happys_Humble_Burger_Barn/">Happy’s Humble Burger Farm</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where players who botch too many orders will find themselves attacked by a violent fast food mascot. We can also see that dynamic subverted by the antics of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1977530/Onearmed_cook/">One-armed Cook</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where the challenge of cooking is played for comedy by limiting the player’s skills to the use of a single arm, to frustrating but slapstick results.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stressful though they may be, these simulators also reflect another of cooking’s many sources of appeal: the fantasy of self-sufficiency, be it as a Pizza Tycoon managing a restaurant or the pride and sense of accomplishment in preparing food for yourself. This is depicted to a certain extent with games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Sims</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where learning to cook provides better benefits in terms of your character’s needs but also, by way of ingredients either collected or grown, can reflect their interests and economic security.

While the game doesn’t give any insight into the cooking process or what a recipe looks like, its core premise does rely on the aesthetic appeal of food, using the game’s combat sequences and the gathered ingredients of each “dish” to tell us key things about wildlife within its universe.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This use of cooking also frequently factors into open-world games, where its purpose as a performance booster is also supplemented by what it tells the player about the environment. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, plants reflect their region and in turn, create potions and meals that strengthen Link’s resistance to the most immediate elements.

<p data-characters="196" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There’s good news for <em>XDefiant</em> fans who are sick to death of being destroyed by enemies using sniper rifles, as executive director Mark Rubin has confirmed a significant nerf is on the way. </p> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">The discourse around sniper rifles has rumbled on since release day, with fans claiming that weapon class has been <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-players-claim-ridiculously-overpowered-weapon-is-ruining-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruining the game</a>. Specifically, the fact that the rifles didn’t feature any flinch when being shot by an opponent caused huge frustration, as enemies were able to aim perfectly even when they were getting slammed with bullets. </p> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true">Thankfully, that’s about to change, as confirmed by Rubin himself in a tweet on June 1. Responding to a tweet that asked if snipers would ever be balanced, the <em>XDefiant</em> executive producer stated that the class was “a bit buggy right now,” asking fans to let them fix the sniper and then re-evaluate. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">They are a bit buggy right now.

Should be in an upcoming patch.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Right now we are adding flinch so if you are taking hits you can't just turn, point, click and delete people.

Still, it will definitely be a welcome adjustment, with fans replying that it’s “good it’s coming” and “exactly what [they] were hoping for.”</p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">I for one echo those comments, as I’m sick of getting sniped from a guy who has eaten three of my SMG bullets and somehow still got perfect aim. With this change, it feels like <em>XDefiant</em>‘s weapon classes will feel more balanced and have their own unique advantages, something that the game has been crying out for. </p>

        <p>A documentary and a drama series are set to release based on 2023's Doom Guy: Life in First Person</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>John Romero's autobiography is set to be adapted as a series, and will also be the subject of a documentary.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/doom-guy-life-in-first-person-documentary-drama-john-romero-quake-wolfenstein-1235944457/">Deadline</a>, 'Doom Guy: Life in First Person' will become a documentary directed by Rob McCallum, who's mainly known for 2023's Mr. Dressup: The Magic of Make-Believe.</p>
<p>The series adaptation doesn't have a director attached to it yet, but both projects will have Naomi Harvey serve as executive producer, via Golden Possum Productions.</p>
<p>John Romero's book came out in 2023, in which he goes through his life and career, from his childhood to the creation of Id Software, up until now. Considered the inventor of first-person shooters, Romero currently is the chief creative officer of Romero Games, which he created in 2014.</p>
<p>Romero commented: "Talking with both Rob and Naomi, I knew they were the perfect team to bring Doom Guy to life. Our backgrounds and aspirations have uncanny similarities, and I trust them to tell the story."</p>

        <p>Sources claim publisher told staff in April that it will no longer support indie-focused label</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Take-Two is planning to close or potential sell its indie-focused publishing label Private Division.</p>
<p>That's according to an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division">IGN report</a>, which cites sources familiar with the matter who say almost all Private Division staff have been laid off. Take-Two has declined to comment.</p>
<p>Management reportedly told employees in April that Take-Two would no longer support the publishing label, with only a handful of staff left to handle the remaining publishing deals. These include Moon Studios' No Rest for the Wicked, Wētā Workshop's Tales of the Shire, and an unannounced title from Pokémon developer Game Freak.</p>
<p>At least two other publishing deals are said to have been dropped. Bloober Team revealed last week it had <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/private-division-reportedly-drops-publishing-deal-with-bloober-team">lost its deal with Private Division</a> for an unannounced survival horror game, while IGN reports the other was with One More Level, the developer behind Ghostrunner.</p>
<p>Take-Two is said to be in discussions with potential buyers for Private Division, with an unnamed private equity firm showing interest.</p>
<p>The publisher has also been looking into selling the Kerbal Space Program IP, potentially with Kerbal Space Program 2 developer Intercept Games included.</p>
<p>All of this follows a series of reports that indicate Private Division is shrinking. Take-Two reportedly <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-reportedly-shuts-down-roll7-and-intercept-games-private-division-suffers-mass-layoffs">closed both the label's subsidiaries</a>, Rollerdrome developer Roll7 and Intercept Games.</p>
<p>CEO Strauss Zelnick later said <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zelnick-on-roll7-and-intercept-games-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios">neither studio has technically been closed</a>, but a WARN notice indicates Intercept will be shut down this month with staff confirming there have been <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/intercept-games-facing-layoffs-by-end-of-june">widespread layoffs at this studio</a>.</p>
<p>Private Division's changes follow Take-Two's announcement it was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-laying-off-5-of-staff">laying off 5% of all staff</a> as part of its third cost-reduction program in just over a year.</p>

			<p>A new Tomb Raider UE5 cinematic video has been released featuring fan favorites Angelina Jolie and Christoph Waltz.</p>
<p>Created by digital artist 'Lorenzo_CGI', this 'The Last Revelation teaser tribute' is a short cinematic video in Unreal Engine 5.3, and it looks really impressive. In the video, we can see Angelina Jolie portraying Lara Croft and Christoph Waltz portraying Mr Von Croy. No AI or deepfakes were used in order to create this video, which might make it even more impressive. "For this project, I used texturing xyz for the skin texturing, and for the hair cards for Lara I used ( with some retouch) the hair from 3d scan store", the artist <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/lDmnoz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a>. "For the creation of the environment, I tried to replicate the environment of the game, with some differences, with the help of the assets from Megascan."</p>
<p>He added, "For the animation I used a combination of motion capture made by me (see the picture of the cheap helmet) with the help of Metahuman animator and the amazing tool Metapipe and the software iclone from Reallusion."</p>
<p>You can check out the new cinematic video below. Be sure to write what you think about this video below. Although this is merely a fan project, it might provide a glimpse of what's possible with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-entry-in-development-crystal-dynamics-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming new Tomb Raider game within Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>

<p>The next Tomb Raider from Crystal Dynamics was announced to be in development back in 2022. Here's what the studio's General Manager had to say about it back then:</p>
<p><em>Crystal Dynamics is proud to be a part of the launch of Unreal Engine 5. This new engine translates into next-level storytelling and gameplay experiences. And that's why we are thrilled to announce that we have just started developer of our next Tomb Raider game, powered by Unreal Engine 5. Our goal is to push the envelope of fidelity and to deliver the high-quality cinematic action-adventure experience that fans deserve from both Crystal Dynamics and the Tomb Raider franchise. We can't wait to take this journey together. Thank you, and congratulations again to the Epic Games team.</em></p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as more information about the next Tomb Raider game comes in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/03/diablo-iv-season-of-loot-reborn-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Diablo IV’s latest season started on the 14th May aiming to redefine the game’s loot system. Called the Season of Loot Reborn, it makes some pretty massive changes to that loot system, and little else. Still, the loot is the heart of a Diablo game so the ability to save legendary affixes to imprint onto other items and upgrade loot by tempering it could be a welcome change, so I decided to once again take on the seemingly infinite forces of hell to get my loot on.</p>
<p><iframe title="Diablo IV | Loot Reborn | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdSehRhUOXM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We will get the none-loot based stuff out of the way first, because it is incredibly scarce. This season revolves around the Iron Wolves, members of whom have been disappearing mysteriously. Usually the season’s quest is available immediately upon entering the Endgame, but here you’ll need to find an Iron Wolves medallion that must be dropped from monsters during Helltides. This will trigger the side quest and finally let you go and investigate some missing Iron Wolves. These quests are short, re-use enemies from the Helltide, and are just generally a bit uninspired. That’s all the story you’re getting in this season.</p>


<p>There are a bunch of other changes though. In addition to being available to players in all world tiers now, Helltides themselves have a few more activities to engage in, even if they are pretty same-y all things considered. There’s also a huge Bloodmaiden public boss fight you can trigger and cross your fingers there’s someone to help you out nearby. On top of all this, there’s also a new heat system, where as you kill more enemies in the Helltide, you’ll progress through three tiers of notoriety with the hellspawn, each tier bringing more and tougher enemies, until it reaches maximum and triggers an onslaught and a boss called the Helborne.</p>
<p>This all makes Helltides a little more varied, even if it’s just a variety of slightly different ways to encounter and then slaughter legions of enemies. Thankfully you’ve got a few more tools to help gear yourself for this particular hellish threat. The biggest, and perhaps most important change of the Season of Loot Reborn is the way legendary affixes are now handled. Previously you could complete dungeons to unlock some affixes that could be imprinted onto items, but many of the best ones had to be found on gear. Now when you scrap a legendary item at the blacksmith, its affix is added to your library, ready for you to imprint onto any compatible item as many times as you like. If you scrap a legendary item that has the same affix with better rolls it’ll upgrade the one you have.</p>


<p>This has a profound effect on the game, now you can transfer your strongest legendary traits onto new gear as the original gets levelled out of its usefulness. Certain abilities can be permanent fixtures in your build – I’m playing a sorcerer this time around and I’ve had one legendary affix since I was relatively low level that splits the single beam of fire from Incinerate into three that each do more damage. I’m level 66 now and it’s still as fun as it is effective.</p>
<p>You can also now upgrade items using the new tempering system. In amongst all the loot – and there is a lot of it – you’ll find new recipes dropping that give you the ability to temper your gear with certain upgrades. You activate this recipe in your inventory to learn it and then make your way to the blacksmith to apply it to some gear. It’ll give you one of a small selection of upgrades with the opportunity to reroll a few times should you get one that’s less useful. There were quite a few times where I used all my rerolls trying to get a useful upgrade for my all fire sorcerer only to end up with one that upgrades ice blast.</p>
<p>This is a bit frustrating but I suppose that’s RNG for you. These upgrades aren’t exactly very powerful on their own but if you tailor them to your build they could give you a little extra impact or survivability where you need it most. Then there’s also the Masterworking system, which allows you to improve affixes that are already on your items once you unlock it at World Tier 4.</p>
<p>This is all mostly welcome changes. The legendary stuff means that you’re now more chasing for affixes rather than particularly well rolled items, which means you can use more loot but also does a lot to diminish how special it is when you finally get that item that’s rolled just right. It cuts down on frustration though, so overall it’s a positive. The changes to Helltide are mostly positive as well, but there is one frustration that keeps popping up and I don’t think it’s one that can really be fixed by seasonal changes: the difficulty is all over the place.</p>

<p>My sorcerer, in the past week, has destroyed the Hellborne that spawns after you fill the Helltide heat metre in seconds multiple times. Now I’m level 66 and when the Hellborne spawns, I know that I am about to die. This is despite slaughtering literally hundreds of enemies, including numerous elites, within a second or two each in the run up to the Hellborne spawning. Even despite killing the Seething Abomination in the PVP areas without any issue at all, or despite defeating Kixxarth the Helltide Assassin solo, which I had never managed to even come close to on any of my previous characters, the Hellborne just destroys me in a second whilst I barely dent its health.</p>
<p>It’s not that enjoyable having to watch the heat bar fill up when you know instant death is on the end of it, but it’s even worse twenty levels after you were able to do it easily or when everything else in the game might be a bit too easy. The Legion events and the World Bosses aren’t a challenge, but this one thing turns up and one shots me the moment I stop moving long enough to cast a spell. The only other thing with this issue I’ve encountered is the Bloodmaiden that can be spawned also in Helltides, which has a few attacks that are hard to avoid that deal disproportionate amounts of damage, but she’s meant to be a public event boss with multiple players fighting her off.</p>
<p>Obviously this problem is caused by the level scaling system that underpins all of Diablo IV. You can level up whilst fighting and find that the same enemies are now more difficult if you’re not careful and it effects the whole experience. Early on, it’s shockingly easy, but later on it’s only mostly easy except for extreme and unpredictable difficulty spikes that very suddenly and unexpectedly ends your life.</p>
<p>However despite this particular issue, I have been having a lot of fun with Diablo IV. Whilst I feel the move away from finding powerful items to just collecting affixes isn’t ideal for me, it does help to account for some of the issues the former approach has, namely items that become essential to your build outliving their usefulness before you have an adequate replacement. It allows you to mix and match your legendary traits more easily and enables unbelievably powerful builds to be a constant if you want them to be, which has the knock on effect of allowing you to try other options since it’s so easy to go back if needed.</p>

<p>It also helps that it’s so unbelievably generous with loot. I’ve found more legendaries in the last week and a half than I have with whole characters in the past, it’s astonishing if not a little overwhelming. Of course, there are only so many you can equip, so you end up scrapping a lot of legendary items and collecting their affixes instead. One place of particular looting note is the Iron Wolves caches you earn for levelling your reputation with them, some of which guarantee Unique items, which if you’re not familiar is basically an extra-legendary item with particularly powerful abilities and stats that can define your build. Uniques are even rarer than legendary items and with these caches you can guarantee you find one long before you’re likely to otherwise.</p>
<p>On top of the loot, Diablo IV’s gameplay – that is, the actual fighting of lots of monsters with your awesome abilities – is still the best in the genre. There are definitely issues specifically with how the game is multiplayer only, the level scaling that’s likely a result of that, that it’s a live service with a battle pass and seasons yet provides precious little content each season and stretches it out as much as it can, or even that it has a store that charges extortionate amounts of money for purely cosmetic horse armours. But, it sure as hell plays better than all of the competition.</p>

It's not the first time AI has raised eyebrows as some artwork featured in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bigby-presents-glory-of-giants-review-dm-knowledge-aplenty"><em>Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants</em></a> had AI involvement, the potential for AI has also caused <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-clarifies-stance-on-ai-artwork-in-their-books">wrongful witchhunt in the past too</a>, most recently with artwork from the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Players Handbook</em>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/principal-ai-engineer-at-wizards-of-the-coast-3828183411">Principal AI Engineer </a>job listing, posted a week ago, announces that they're "looking for someone who believes that crafting high-value, shared technology to accelerate creation and testing of content with [Machine Learning] systems engineering is key to delivering high-quality player experiences."</p>

<p>Reaching out to Wizards of the Coast TechRaptor received the following statement from Wizards of the Coast:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Our stance on AI hasn't changed. This job description is for a role for future video game projects.&nbsp;You can reference our AI FAQ&nbsp;<a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="0" data-ogsc="" href="https://dnd-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/26243094975252-Generative-AI-art-FAQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A key quote from their policy includes "we require artists, writers, and creatives contributing to the Magic TCG and the D&amp;D TTRPG to refrain from using AI generative tools to create final <em>Magic </em>or <em>D&amp;D</em> products."</p>

<p>With the provided statement and their AI Art FAQ Wizards of the Coast is drawing a very clear line in the sand between their stance on AI use in Artworks, primarily when it comes to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> as well as <em>Magic: The Gathering,</em>&nbsp;and for AI use in other aspects of product development.</p>

<p>It was only last month that it was announced that Larian, developers of the wildly popular Baldur's Gate III, would <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/events-conferences/larian-is-finished-with-baldurs-gate-were-going-to-move-away-from-dandd-and-were-going-to-start-making-a-new-thing/">not be creating any DLC for Baldur's Gate III and would also not be working on future installments in the Baldur's Gate franchise</a>.

            <p>"Something big is going on behind the scenes" at Starfield.</p>
<p>That's according to players who have been poking around in Steam's backend. By monitoring the updates made to the Steam files via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1716740/">SteamDB</a>, some players claim that Bethesda has made more changes in May than March and April combined.</p>

<p>"It's pointless trying to decipher the changelogs on Steamdb, but one thing is certain from experience: when there are a lot of changes, something big is coming," opined <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1d5uzkz/something_big_is_going_on_behind_the_scenes_there/">u/JarusinTheStars</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/starfield-update-patch-dlc-coming-soon-rumour/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>"And over the past week (and more generally since May 1st), there have been more changes than ever since launch, sometimes more than 10 per day. For example, there were around 50-60 changes between the February and March updates. And around 100 between the March and May updates.</p>
<p>We've almost surpassed that figure in less than a month."</p>

</span></p><p>Consequently, this player believes that on the day of the Xbox Showcase – 9th June – Bethesda will present the Shattered Space expansion as well as the June update, and they reckon it'll be "even bigger than the last one".</p>
<p>Whilst there's no doubt that the Reddit user is right about the number and frequency of recent SteamDB updates, the rest is – naturally – only conjecture at this point. Thankfully, we don't have to wait too long for an update that proves JarusinTheStars' theory either way; the Xbox Showcase is just next week.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfields-may-patch-adds-60fps-target-for-series-x-land-vehicles-footage-also-teased">Starfield's May update</a> - yes, the one that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfields-shattered-space-expansion-out-in-autumn-city-map-stuff-due-soon">teased by Bethesa's Todd Howard</a> - is now live, bringing with it the previously promised surface map overhaul, alongside a new 60fps target mode on Xbox Series X. Additionally, Bethesda has shared a brief look at land vehicles, coming to Starfield in a future update.</p>
<p>As Matt summarised for us at the time, Todd Howard, played down the absence of land vehicles prior to Starfield's launch, insisting it was a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfields-lack-of-ground-vehicles-is-a-deliberate-choice-bethesda-says">deliberate design decision</a> that allowed the studio to "make it an experience where we know how fast [players are] seeing things." But last December, Bethesda teased that "new ways of travelling" were on Starfield's Horizon.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-announces-new-astrobot-game">Astro Bot</a> will feature over 150 PlayStation-inspired cameos.</p>
<p>That's according to the game's recently unveiled store <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/astro-bot/">listing</a>, which says we'll get to "rescue over 150 iconic VIP Bots inspired by legendary characters from 30 years of PlayStation history".</p>

<p>The same listing describes Astro Bot as a "standalone, full-sized adventure that offers over four times more worlds, 300 bots to rescue, and dozens of new powers and features to discover". It also confirms that Astro Bot is strictly a single-player experience that will only be available on PS5.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it also makes it very clear that Astro Bot does not include microtransactions, assuring players that there are "plenty of coins" to collect and spend in the Gatcha Lab.</p>
<p>Sony announced the new Astro Bot game during this week's PlayStation State of Play. It's simply called Astro Bot, is once again developed by Sony's Team Asobi, and launches for PlayStation 5 on 6th September. It's Astro's first starring role since 2020's PS5 launch title Astro's Playroom.</p>
<p>"[The] announcement of Astro Bot was so bittersweet for me," wrote Eurogamer's Ian in his fabulous feature, I<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-hard-to-stay-excited-about-the-playstation-vr2-if-even-astro-bot-wont-wear-one">t's hard to stay excited about the PlayStation VR2 if even Astro Bot won't wear one</a>.</p>
<p>"Like everyone, I'm pumped for a new Astro Bot game, they're such joyful, heart-warming and uplifting games - and on top of that this new one looks a bit like a StarFox x Mario Mash-up. 'How can that not be a Game of the Year contender?!' I thought, as I watched the reveal. But then, as the trailer passed the one minute mark without showing footage of anything that looked like VR gameplay, my heart started to sink. That sunken heart then broke completely in two when, at the very end of the trailer, big bold words saying "COMING TO PS5" appeared. So no PSVR2 support at all?! For a character that technically only became big thanks to Astro Bot Rescue Mission on PSVR1? What gives?"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24168870/nvidia-sff-ready-enthusiast-geforce-card<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia just gave the PC gaming industry a reason to shrink its biggest graphics cards and produce smallish cases. It’s not what I expected, but I think it might actually help. Read before you judge, friends — I was definitely ready to call out some Nvidia BS, but I’ve mostly come around.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/26/24141884/nvidia-will-greenlight-gpus-for-tiny-sff-gaming-pcs">When leakers revealed last month</a> that Nvidia would help steer its graphics card partners toward smaller gaming PCs, I began to daydream. Might we finally see a genuinely small Nvidia powerhouse like <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/9621/the-amd-radeon-r9-nano-review">AMD’s old R9 Nano</a>? Could Nvidia at least convince partners to produce two-slot GPUs like many of its own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24039832/nvidia-rtx-4070-super-review-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">Founders Edition cards</a>? </p><p>Unfortunately, no. Nvidia’s just-announced “SFF-Ready Enthusiast GeForce Cards” aren’t actually that small — even a 2.5 slot thick, 304mm long, and 151mm wide RTX 4070 can qualify. That means supposedly “SFF” GPUs will not fit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725010/ncase-m1-pc-case-sff-small-form-factor-discontinued">into my SFF case</a>, and I have a hard time calling these “SFF” at all. </p><div><figcaption><em>Nvidia’s optional guidelines specify these maximum dimensions.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>This still looks like a pretty large case to me.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>But if you, like me, want to help smaller gaming PCs get a larger foothold, this could<em> </em>help —  because it’s not just about the cards; it’s about knowing you can fit a certain amount of graphics horsepower in a given case because both the case and the card identify themselves as compatible with one another.</p><p>“I’m giving them a guideline to say, hey, leave this much space, and then you’ll be able to fit an enthusiast graphics card in there like a 4080, a 4070. That’s the purpose of this program,” Nvidia senior desktop products director Justin Walker tells me. </p><p>Indeed, the list of cards that Nvidia is sharing today only includes RTX 4070 or higher: it’s not promoting a fat 4060, for example.</p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s a list of validated cards and cases so far. It’s not exhaustive, but these partners are on board.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Images: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>Today, figuring out if a given card will fit is often a matter of painstakingly trolling manufacturer websites for length, width, and height <em>twice</em>: once for the card and once for the case. Now, you might just be able to look for “SFF-Ready” and move on with your day. You may still have to hit up those manufacturer websites, though, as Walker says there’s not necessarily going to be a Newegg sort filter for “SFF Ready” or a badge on the actual product yet.</p><p>He tells me these guidelines should reduce uncertainty for case manufacturers, too: “I’m making a small case, and I want it to fit a high end graphics card... right now I have no idea, there’s so many sizes and shapes. Right now I don’t know how to make a case that fits everything.” Now, there’s a target.</p><p>While I personally still wish Nvidia had tried harder to shrink the sizes of partner cards themselves — again, their own Founders Edition cards are generally just two slots thick! — there is some hope for more such GPUs. Walker says it’s no mistake that there’s only a single RTX 4080 on the SFF-Ready list, and he hopes more partners will rise to the challenge.</p><p>“It takes a lot of work and a very intentional design to put a 4080 in this form factor,” he says. “I get that it’s not a tiny Mini-ITX thing, but I want to let someone be able to put a 4080 into that case.”</p><p>Speaking of which: just a few days ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/kopite7kimi/status/1795710634820268111">hardware leaker kopite7kimi attested</a> that Nvidia’s RTX 5090 Founders Edition card will have a dual-slot cooler.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="161" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest is upon us, taking its rightful place as the de facto summer video game experience after the shuttering of E3 last year. </p> <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="201" data-injectable="false">As is also tradition, Keighley has released his annual “Geoff’s Trailer,” a hype real spliced together of the biggest and best announcements that fans can expect at <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/summer-game-fest-2024-exact-date-time-and-how-to-stream-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a>. </p> <figure data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Summer Game Fest 2024: Geoff's Trailer (Watch Live Show This Friday in 4K!)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FZ2Clscn0Jg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">There’s not necessarily any surprises in the trailer, but it does do a good job of setting the tone fans can expect from the show. There is, of course, a <em>lot</em> of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> in here, which makes sense. The DLC is imminent, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/elden-ring/"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>‘s premiere was at Keighley’s Game Awards broadcast, so it should have a big showing here. </p> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true">There are other, similarily big games featured, too, hinting we may see more over the next week. The trailer features glimpses of the upcoming <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-release-window-trailer-and-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero</a></em> and what looks to be the next Batman game, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/first-new-batman-arkham-in-years-is-a-meta-exclusive-vr-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meta-exclusive </a><em><a href="batman: Arkham Shadow">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a></em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false">Summer Game Fest will air live on various platforms, including YouTube and Twitch, on Friday, June 7, at 5 PM ET/2 PM PT. The show will be a live production with trailers, reveals, and news of the biggest games from a plethora of devs. </p> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">In addition to the main SGF show, there are a number of highly anticipated ancillary programs over the surrounding days, including <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/devolver-direct-2024-when-and-where-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Devolver Direct</a> and the much-hyped <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xbox-games-showcase-locked-in-for-june-with-a-rumored-cod-direct-afterwards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase + Call of Duty Direct</a>. </p>
 <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="248" data-injectable="false">There will also be <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nintendo-admits-its-making-a-new-console-in-the-most-casual-way-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some kind of Nintendo Direct</a> soon, though details remain scarce. Though Nintendo is unaffiliated with Summer Game Fest, they do tend to schedule their presentations around the same weekend, so it may be sooner rather than later. </p>

<p data-characters="219" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A leak from a reasonably reliable source seems to hint that the Rabbids, Rayman’s iconic lagomorphic foils, could soon appear as a joinable faction in XDefiant. Where’s the limbless wonder when you need him?</p> <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true">The leak comes to us courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/AgainTx?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1795831710501982657%7Ctwgr%5Ec7ac00410ff2e9aac1f0a2285667ae623b3ae30f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwin.gg%2Fnews%2Fnew-xdefiant-factions-leak-shows-assassins-creed-rabbids-r6-sige%2F">AgainTx</a>, a data miner who has provided credible information about <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/second-xdefiant-double-weapon-xp-event-weekend/">weapons, abilities, and features</a> that made their way into XDefiant after the game’s initial launch. According to AgainTx, the Rabbids are just one of several new factions that will debut in XDefiant’s second year. Many of these factions are <a href="https://www.vg247.com/xdefiant-leaks-future-factions-might-include-assassins-creed-rabbids">based on Ubisoft games that have not yet received any representation</a> in XDefiant, including Assassins Creed, Rainbow Six, and The Crew.</p>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, many of AgainTx’s posts regarding this potential leak have been taken down to do copywrite strikes made against them by Ubisoft. While this means I can’t technically back up AgainTx’s claims, the fact that Ubisoft is going out of its way to censor their content does lend an air of credibility to them and their work.</p> <p data-characters="592" data-current-count="942" data-injectable="true">If this leak turns out to be accurate, I’m amazed it’s taken this long for the Rabbids to appear in XDefiant. The Rabbids have come a long way since their debut in Rayman: Raving Rabbids back on the Wii, to the point where they’ve effectively become the unofficial Ubisoft mascots. While I’m not afraid to admit that I feel the Rabbids’ whole “so-random” schtick is a little played out, I’d be lying If I said I’m not excited by the sheer madness they could introduce into the straight-laced world of a first-person shooter like XDefiant.</p>
 <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="265" data-injectable="false">Of course, this is still all speculation, and there is a real possibility that AgainTx will be proven wrong once XDefiant’s second year starts. Only time will tell, but it seems like this leak could be a fun, or at least funny, one if it turns out to be true.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168903/furiosa-villain-immortan-joe-actor<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="t2gXIF">George Miller’s <em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24164264/furiosa-best-prequels-george-miller-mad-max-franchise">complements and enhances</a> the impact of his 2015 blockbuster <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a><em> </em>in a lot of ways, but there’s only one I can’t stop thinking about: How little the new movie has to say about Immortan Joe, the original movie’s iconic arch-villain. </p>
<p id="erCsDA">Sure, Joe’s lack of interaction with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24162575/anya-taylor-joy-furiosa-souvenir-prop-prosthetic-arm-chris-hemsworth">Anya Taylor-Joy</a>’s Furiosa could be simply because Hugh Keays-Byrne, the actor who first put Immortan Joe on the screen, died in 2020. Lachy Hulme assumes the role for <em>Furiosa</em>, but perhaps George Miller reduced it out of respect for Keays-Byrne, who he worked with for many years.</p>
<p id="dQcJNm">But I’m skeptical. Joe’s consistent secondary status in Furiosa’s origin story fits the overall themes of <em>Furiosa</em> too well to be a coincidence: Immortan Joe, the demon of Imperator Furiosa’s last stand, wasn’t her nemesis at all. In fact, he wasn’t her <em>anything</em>. </p>

<p id="E3pDWM">This is in great contrast to <em>Fury Road</em>, where their beef seems <em>deeply personal</em>. Max Rockatansky wanders into somebody else’s narrative in <em>Fury Road</em>, as his stories usually go. This time, those somebodies are Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and Immortan Joe. </p>
<p id="pBZqpR">While <em>Fury Road</em> only subtly hints that Furiosa was once one of Joe’s captive harem of wives and incubators — the white wrappings of Furiosa’s top evoke the Wives’ impractical shifts — Theron confirmed that piece of her backstory <a href="https://ew.com/article/2015/05/14/mad-max-fury-road-charlize-theron-shaving-her-head-eating-dirt-and-being-part/">in interviews</a>. So Furiosa seems to have really personal reasons to hate Joe. And his response to her betrayal is presented as a towering rage, cresting mushroom cloud-like out of all proportion to her ability to withstand him. </p>
<p id="Qysz6h">Not to diminish the agency of the Five Wives in their own escape, but Joe considers them property that’s been stolen from him, not allies who betrayed him. Furiosa, however, he considers a traitor, worthy of his personal anger. And in the end, she’s the one who gets the honor of finally taking him down, underscoring her place on the same narrative level he occupies as <em>Fury Road</em>’s primary villain. </p>
<p id="bMELcL">Which is why it’s so wild that <em>Furiosa</em> says, quietly and implacably throughout its entire run time, that Joe actually isn’t even a main character in her story. Sure, he buys her, but then he forgets she even existed. He didn’t take anything from her that hadn’t already been taken, didn’t teach her anything she hadn’t already learned from someone else, didn’t give her anything she hadn’t already taken for herself. When they do share scenes, and even trade dialogue, there’s no interpersonal ire or affection in either direction. In spite of their characters’ intensity, Hulme and Taylor-Joy keep a neutral distance of emotion. </p>
<p id="IEnILb">It turns out, in <em>Furiosa</em>, that Furiosa’s life was actually framed by the completely different, utterly pathetic figure of Dementus, the Wasteland warlord who tortured her mother to death, sold Furiosa into slavery, killed her closest friend, and cost her her right arm. And just as emphatically, <em>Furiosa</em> says, Furiosa moved beyond revenge years before she ever stood against Joe. </p>
<p id="XDc91n">What you saw in <em>Fury Road</em>, <em>Furiosa</em> says, was the furthest thing from personal to Furiosa. Immortan Joe was never The Guy. He was just <em>the guy in the way</em>. And the “guy” part might be the most important one.</p>

<p id="VRPMea">The conversation that immediately surrounded <em>Fury Road</em> was about Immortan Joe as a Wasteland illustration of the death cult of capitalism and toxic masculinity. His very recognizable philosophy reduces all non-elites to things — women to Wives (sex slaves, forcibly impregnated) or Mothers (enslaved to produce breast milk for food), and men to War Boys (emphasis on <em>boys</em>), interchangeable cannon fodder addicted to the lie that they can only find purpose in violence for the True Leader. </p>
<p id="bLCboE">This was all emphasized by the emasculating nature of Furiosa’s rebellion. After all, by the language of a country-and-Western song, she’s wounded him in the most devastating way a man can be wounded, by stealing his wife (Wives), his money (water), his car (the War Rig), and maybe even his dog (Nicholas Hoult’s hapless character Nux, if we want to stretch the metaphor a little bit). </p>
<p id="rdDnNq">Immortan Joe is an electrifying villain, and <em>Furiosa</em> doesn’t exactly skimp on him! A scene contrasting Dementus’ shaky appeal to the self-interest of the masses with the unshakable belief created by Joe’s death-cult propaganda is among the film’s most chilling. But there is an eternal risk in presenting such an operatic villain who also represents such a wide-ranging theme. If you’re not careful, making them powerful and capable enough to claim villain status also risks making them look aspirational. You can swing right around to <a href="https://collider.com/darth-vaders-most-cool-bad-ass-moments/">making them seem cool</a>. </p>
<p id="ZDZL78">Which is why it’s so damn smart of <em>Furiosa</em> to put this final nail in the coffin of Joe’s emasculation, by establishing that <em>Fury Road</em>’s sense of personal beef was all on Joe — on <em>his</em> fear, and <em>his</em> vulnerability, not on Furiosa’s. He isn’t even important<em> to the woman who’s unmanning him</em>. </p>
<p id="m6TZKd">In a cliche reversal for the cinematic ages, Immortan Joe was, for Furiosa, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjZ5I8l32CI">just Tuesday</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="125" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Fans who were looking forward to <em>Little Nightmares III</em> will unfortunately have to hold on, as the game has now been delayed. </p> <p data-characters="150" data-current-count="150" data-injectable="false">In a post on the official <em>Little Nightmares</em> Twitter, developer Supermassive Games revealed the game was being delayed, and would now release in 2025. </p> <figure data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">“As much as we can’t wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves.” Supermassive <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1796512039768097038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> in the statement. “Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way. For this reason, we’ve made the decision to shift the game to 2025.”</p> <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true">“We’ll be sharing more about <em>Little Nightmares III</em> later this summer, so please bear with us and look forward to further updates.” the developer promised. </p>
 <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false"><em>Little Nightmares III</em> was announced in 2023 with a 2024 release window. It is the first in the franchise to be developed by Supermassive. The game will follow two young protagonists, Low and Alone, as they explore a haunting 2.5D world that focuses on exploration, platforming, and puzzles. </p> <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true">The previous games in the franchise were developed by Swedish-based Tarsier Studios, who had to leave the franchise when they were acquired by Embracer Group after the release of <em>Little Nightmares II</em>. Tarsier Studios does not currently have an announced project. </p>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false"><em>Little Nightmares</em> has been a cherished franchise since its 2017 launch. The original game followed Six, a girl who had to escape the horrifying vessel known as The Maw. Though Six retuned for 2021’s <em>Little Nightmares II</em>, the character and compatriot Mono do not appear to be returning for <em>Little Nightmares III</em>. </p>

However, the dev assures the game is bringing those features back. </p> <p data-characters="164" data-current-count="164" data-injectable="false">Several features that were available in what PlayerFirst and the community are generously calling the Beta were missing, which obviously rubbed fans the wrong way. </p> <p data-characters="132" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">But Tony Huynh, the co-founder of Player 1st Games, took to social media to assure fans that those features would be restored soon. </p>  <figure data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks you for the feedback!

 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">“Many of these features are currently implemented and are in testing and we had planned, but were left out due to time as we had to rebuild every screen and feature again to support our new netcode and Unreal Engine 5 switch.” Huynh revealed on his <a href="https://x.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1796903400497684726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter/X</a> account. </p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="576" data-injectable="true">When <em>Multiversus</em> finally returned after its long hiatus, fans were quick to note features were missing that had added to the game’s online multiplayer. These components included leaderboards, match stats, a co-op vs AI mode, and a <em>Smash Bros</em>-like free-for-all mode that added random items. </p>
 <p data-characters="186" data-current-count="186" data-injectable="false">Also missing was the ability to play as an unowned character in training mode. Without this option, players are left with no means of test-driving a new character without unlocking them.</p> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="false">In their place was a brand new season pass with unlockables and a new single-player driven “Rift” mode. The reception to the new <em>Multiversus</em> has been fairly mixed, but hopefully this is just a small bump for this already controversial game. </p>

<p data-characters="383" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">What started out as a little bonus mode in 2008’s <em>Call of Duty: World at War</em> has become a global phenomenon. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-call-of-duty-zombies-modes-ranked/"><em>Call of Duty</em>‘s <em>Zombies</em> mode</a> is a staple of the franchise, with complex lore, a sprawling multiverse, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-cod-zombies-maps-ranked/">varied maps</a>, and numerous now-iconic original characters behind it. Not to mention, more than a few celebrity guests have gotten in on the zombie-killing action.</p> <p data-characters="497" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true">While the likes of Tank Dempsey (Steve Blum), Dr. Edward Richtofen (Nolan North), and Samantha Maxis (Julie Nathanson) have carried the mode from game to game, several notable pop culture favorites have briefly come along for the ride. Malcolm McDowell, Jeff Goldblum, the late Ray Liotta, and more have featured in the mode, and that’s just in Treyarch’s titles. Sledgehammer Games’ <em>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</em> and <em>Call of Duty: WWII</em> boast celebrity guest stars of their own.</p>

Helena Bonham-Carter as Madame Mirela</h2> <p data-characters="556" data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4</em>‘s<em> Dead of the Night</em> takes players to the manor of skilled archaeologist Alistair Rhodes (Charles Dennis), where all kinds of paranormal entities threaten the lives of those present. Alongside Gideon Jones (Kiefer Sutherland), Jonathan Warwick (Brian Blessed), and Godfrey (Charles Dance) is Christina Fowler, aka Madame Mirela, as portrayed in voice and likeness by Helena Bonham-Carter. She turns in a solid vocal performance here, and considering her entertainment track record, she was a perfect fit for the <em>Zombies</em> mode.</p>
 <p data-characters="571" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true">Bonham-Carter has made a career out of taking projects of the supernatural and macabre variety. <em>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</em>, <em>Corpse Bride</em>, <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, and more fill her filmography. She’s also among director Tim Burton’s most frequent collaborators, in addition to being his former romantic partner. Bonham-Carter took the role of Mirela seriously, too, telling <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/games/2464098/how-helena-bonham-carter-changed-her-call-of-duty-black-ops-4-character">CinemaBlend</a> that she personally crafted Mirela’s accent and channeled Mrs. Lovett, her <em>Sweeney Todd</em> character, to get her <em>Dead of the Night</em> performance just right.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-4-ron-perlman-as-floyd-campbell" data-injectable="false">4. Ron Perlman as Floyd Campbell</h2> <p data-characters="571" data-current-count="871" data-injectable="true">Kicking off <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</em>‘s <em>Zombies</em> mode, Treyarch put its latest celebrity-loaded map at the forefront. <em>Shadows of Evil </em>takes place in the run-down, paranormal Morgue City, where seedy inhabitants do vile things to get ahead. One of these individuals is Floyd Campbell: a washed-up boxer who’s willing to kill if it means getting to the top of his profession. Ultimately, he pays the price for his underhanded tactics. Ron Perlman’s unmistakable face and rumbling voice couldn’t be more suitable for the grizzled journeyman fighter.</p>
 <p data-characters="564" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true">Much like Bonham-Carter, Perlman is no stranger to odd, paranormal fictional universes. He’s a mainstay in the works of director Guillermo del Toro, from <em>Cronos</em> to <em>Hellboy</em>, where strange is the name of the game. The surreal French fantasy flick <em>The City of Lost Children</em>, starring Perlman as carnival strongman One, also boasts a similar aesthetic to <em>Shadows of Evil</em>. All of this experience, coupled with the fact that Perlman told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7xcra2x6fs">IGN</a> he’d always wanted to play a boxer in some form, drove home the fact that no one could play Campbell quite like him.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-3-joe-pantoliano-as-al-the-weasel-arlington" data-injectable="false">3. Joe Pantoliano as Al “The Weasel” Arlington</h2> <p data-characters="531" data-current-count="831" data-injectable="true">One of, if not the absolute best <em>Zombies</em> map to date, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops II</em>‘s <em>Mob of the Dead</em> features four mobsters attempting to escape Alcatraz Island via a shoddily-built plane. Not only are they unsuccessful, but they’re trapped in a time loop, forcing them to fend off endless waves of zombies, die, and repeat their failure over and over again for eternity. The mastermind of their initial escape plan is Al “The Weasel” Arlington, modeled after and voiced by Joe Pantoliano to utter perfection.</p>
 <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true">In a cast chock-full of crime genre legends, Pantoliano very much stands out as <em>Mob of the Dead</em>‘s MVP. The <em>Sopranos</em>, <em>Matrix</em>, and <em>Bad Boys</em> actor was a prime choice to bring out Weasel’s meek and insecure yet innovative and intelligent personality. It’s just too bad that when the character returns in <em>Black Ops 4</em>‘s <em>Blood of the Dead</em>, he only does so as a bird in spirit form, thus preventing Pantoliano from getting another shot at the role.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-2-danny-trejo-as-himself" data-injectable="false">2. Danny Trejo as Himself</h2> <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="782" data-injectable="true"><em>Call of the Dead</em> from <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops I</em> is the first <em>Call of Duty Zombies</em> map to feature a celebrity cast, and it goes all-out. When their horror film set is overrun, Robert Englund, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Michael Rooker have to fight off waves of zombies in the middle of Siberia. Danny Trejo joins them, signature machetes in hand, to slaughter the incoming undead. All four actors thrive with the material provided, but Trejo takes it to another level as only he can.</p>
 <p data-characters="491" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true">To say that the <em>Machete</em> and <em>From Dusk Till Dawn</em> actor brings enthusiasm and gusto to the project would be a massive understatement. Trejo put his all into his lines, bringing a bit of comedy as well as plenty of badassery to match his tattooed, weaponed-up character model. The actor told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M9lIk19EyI">XboxViewTV</a> all about his experience working on <em>Call of the Dead</em> back in 2011, and while he’s not much of a gamer himself, it’s abundantly clear that he had a ton of passion for the endeavor.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Treyarch</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-1-george-a-romero-as-himself" data-injectable="false">1. George A. Romero as Himself</h2> <p data-characters="619" data-current-count="919" data-injectable="true">Continuing on with <em>Call of the Dead</em>, it’s worth remembering who was directing the film that Trejo, Rooker, Englund, and Gellar were working on when they were ambushed by the undead. That person was none other than George A. Romero, who’s overpowered by zombies during the intro cutscene and turned into one himself. Throughout the game, he wanders the map with a stage light in hand and loads of one-liners. If you make Romero mad, he’ll fly into a rage, sprinting after you with his weapon of choice. All in all, there’s not a single soul more fitting to appear in a <em>Call of Duty</em> map than him. </p>
 <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">Romero is single-handedly responsible for crafting the modern image of a zombie through revolutionary films like <em>Night of the Living Dead</em> and <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>. Even years after his death in 2017, he continues to inspire the horror genre and those working within it. <em>Zombies</em> simply wouldn’t exist without Romero, so it’s only right that the visionary director was included in what has become one of the mode’s most beloved maps.</p>
 <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">For those unaware, <em>Black Ops 4</em>‘s <em>Tag Der Toten</em>, a <em>Call of the Dead</em> reimagining, features Romero’s signature glasses sitting on a table. This is both a fun <em>Call of the Dead</em> Easter egg and a tribute to the man who paved the way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-games-based-on-movies/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=10-best-games-based-on-movies<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="246" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There was a time when movies based on games and games based on movies were tied in terms of suckage, but we started to see a bunch of fantastic games based on movies long before we saw great game-to-movie or TV series adaptations such as <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fallout-characters-in-the-amazon-series-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout.</a></em></p> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">That’s because there’s no actual curse regarding video game adaptations — so long as the game studios get the budget, time, and artistic liberty required to make them. Here are the games that will bring you the closest to actually living in the world of your favorite movies.</p>  <figure data-current-count="589" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">The Thing</h2> <p data-characters="622" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">If you’re sad about that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/shame-we-never-got-the-thing-as-a-point-and-click-adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Thing</em></a>‘s 2011 prequel which threw away the practical effects of the original in favor of <a href="https://geektyrant.com/news/the-thing-prequel-director-regrets-using-heavy-cgi-and-shares-details-on-scrapped-sequel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wonky CGI</a>, then the video game might prove a good alternative for you. Sure, it features even more computed-generated imagery than the infamous sequel, but it does a great job of putting you in the action of a situation similar to the events of the original classic. 2002’s The Thing video game even features mechanics that add a lot of replay value by always keeping players guessing who the thing might be. It’s like living that masterfully chilling final scene — for eternity.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Mobygames</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Star Wars Episode I: Racer</h2> <p data-characters="594" data-current-count="894" data-injectable="true">A lot of people seem to have changed their minds regarding the prequel trilogy when they saw the sequel trilogy. I’ll meet them halfway and admit that <em>Episode I</em> is a good movie — if the only part of it that you recall is the podracer scene. It’s well-directed, features some great effects, and, weirdest of all, for something out of the prequels, it’s thrilling. LucasArts had the genius idea of just excising this gem imprisoned in that terrible movie and giving it room to breathe and grow. Why is Disney yet to make a series about podracing, or, better yet, another game?</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via WB</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Mad Max</h2> <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="809" data-injectable="true">Even though it came out just a few months after the massive <em>Mad Max: Fury Road,</em> the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-mad-max/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mad Max</a> </em>video game failed to gain the traction that I believe it deserved among gamers — likely because it came out on the same day as <em>Metal Gear Solid V</em> . It made driving around the wasteland a surprisingly smooth experience, gave players a way to stay in that wicked universe outside of just having them rewatch the movie until the end of times, and even enriched <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-weirdest-and-wildest-characters-in-the-mad-max-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the canon</a> with elements we’d later see in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mad-max-movies-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Furiosa.</em> </a></p>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">Sadly, director George Miller <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/george-miller-didnt-2015-mad-162604475.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t too keen on it</a> and has said that he’d like to see Hideo Kojima taking a stab at a <em>Mad Max </em>game, but I think he’s underestimating this gem by Avalanche.</p>  <figure data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via FOX</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><br>Alien: Isolation</h2> <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">A considerable number of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sci-fi-horror-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alien</a></em> fans consider James Cameron’s <em>Aliens</em> superior to the original film. I believe that the only work in the franchise capable of rivaling the original is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-alien-isolation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Alien: Isolation</em></a>. It makes the Xenomorph scarier than any other <em>Alien</em> property as it puts you in a maze as the prey with your wits as the only weapon on hand. </p> <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">Bonus points for a mechanic where the game uses your microphone to detect any noises you make and alert the Xenomorph. Turns out someone can hear you scream in space, and that somehow makes it worse.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by FOX</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><br>Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay</h2> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true"><em>The Chronicles of Riddick</em>‘s tie-in came out in 2004. This means that the FPS that was already <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/butcher-bay-sold-purely-on-word-of-mouth-better-than-word-of-foot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fighting an uphill</a> battle because of the whack property it was connected to even had to face off against the likes of <em>Doom 3, Far Cry, Halo 2, </em>and <em>Half-Life 2.</em> </p>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">Miraculously, <em>Butcher Bay</em> is an order of magnitude above the movie that spawned it and also one that held its own in the best year in the history of FPS titles. You won’t find any groundbreaking gravity gun action in here, but the first-person stealth gameplay rivals that of the <em>Thief</em> and the <em>Dishonored</em> series.</p>  <figure data-current-count="618" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><br>Goldeneye 007</h2> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">You’ve probably heard of this one because it’s one of the greatest games of all time. Whether you’re more about wanting to be James Bond on a campaign to save the world or want to have some of the best split-screen action ever put on a split-screen, this is the one for you. </p> <p data-characters="91" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">Many have tried to recapture <em>Goldeneye 007’s</em> magic, but only <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-split-screen-games-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very few have succeeded.</a></p>  <figure data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Aspyr Media</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic</h2> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="278" data-injectable="false">Many games have already proven that the best way to adapt <em>Star Wars</em> is to ignore the source material and forge your own path ahead. <em>KOTOR</em> is the best example of the bunch, as it goes four thousand years into the past to tell a tale better than what we saw in most of the films. </p> <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">No other <em>Star Wars</em> film, game or TV series has ever done such a great job of making you feel like a true Jedi or Sith. Unfortunately, it seems like it’ll stay that way for the foreseeable future.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Spiderman 2 (2004) - Still the best web-swinging." width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikiuidSRcTM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-spider-man-2" data-injectable="false">Spider-Man 2</h2> <p data-characters="119" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true"><em>GTA 3</em> changed the entire landscape with its 3d free-roaming, and few games benefitted more than the <em>Spider-Man</em> series. </p>
 <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="329" data-injectable="false">The leap between the video game adaptation of the original <em>Spider-Man</em> game to the second was enormous, with most of it coming from ditching the regular level system in favour of allowing players to freely web-swing around a pretty good rendition of New York City. Even today, Spider-Man 2’s web-swinging is incredibly fun. </p> <figure data-current-count="629" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Westwood</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Blade Runner</h2> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false"><em>Blade Runner</em> was a flop when it was released in 1983, only finding its true audience with later releases, like the 1992 Director’s Cut. Despite this, 1997 saw Westwood making the counterintuitive decision of braving through hell to make their own video game adaptation. The company ended up revolutionizing both the gameplay and look of point-and-click adventure games.</p> <p data-characters="208" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true">My only gripe with the <em>Blade Runner</em> video game is that it sometimes sticks too closely to the film even though it supposedly tells a new story. Still, at least it mimics one of the greatest films of all time.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by LucasArts</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Indiana Jones and The Fate Of Atlantis</h2> <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true">One of the best things about being a gamer is that you don’t have to be as disappointed at <em>Indiana Jones</em> as movie fans. Not crazy about <em>Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull</em> or <em>Dial of Destiny</em>? Then perhaps you’ll be happy with one of the excellent video game releases. </p>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">1992 saw the release of <em>Indiana Jones and The Fate of Atlantis</em>, a point-and-click adventure title made in the old LucasArts SCUMM engines. Quite simply, <em>Fate of Atlantis</em> is possibly as good as <em>Raiders Of The Lost Ark</em> and perhaps better than <em>Temple Of Doom</em> or <em>Last Crusade</em>. An excellent game that filled a gap when there was no new Indy for a long, long time. </p>

            <p>Wuthering Waves developer Kuro Games has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuthering-waves-developer-apologises-for-launch-issues">once again apologised</a> to players for "the deficiencies and issues present" in the game, and outlined how it intends to improve the experience going forward.</p>
<p>In a lengthy blog entitled "Announcement on Wuthering Waves 1.0 Version and Future Adjustment Directions" posted earlier today, the team said Wuthering Waves was its "first fully independently developed and globally published game" and understood that the launch issues have "affected your gaming experience".</p>

<p>In a bid to outline how it intends to improve things for "those who love the game", Kuro says it has been focussed on optimisations and iterations for the 1.0 versions, as well as looking ahead to what changes it can introduce in further version updates.</p>
<p>"We are aware of the common concern in the community that the current Echo leveling experience feels too  grindy and the game lacks a Waveplates storage system," the team said. "We have confirmed and will implement the following adjustments while we are working internally on solutions to address other common concerns."</p>
<p>Consequently, there will be a limited-time Echo material double yield event called "Chord Cleansing" – although we're not sure when that will be – and the dev team says it will adjust the progression system to decrease the Shell Credit costs to develop Echoes in the 1.1 update.</p>
<p>The reward cutscene of the Tacet Field will also be removed from the 1.1 version, and the yield of Echoes and Echo development materials will be increased.</p>
<p>Similarly, the team has been focussed on the Echo recycling system that has been short-changing players when recycling developed Echoes, but admits it "failed to issue an announcement" of the hotfix it introduced as a result, "which regrettably caused negative experiences for our players".</p>
<p>"We sincerely apologise for our improper way of handling this situation and the inconvenience caused," Kuro said.</p>
<p>Consequently, by 10th June all players will be credited with one million Shell Credit as compensation.</p>
<p>"As has been discovered by our players, the description of the 5-Star Weapon Verdant Summit in the game in certain languages contained a mistranslation," the team added.</p>
<p>"Upon discovering this issue, we promptly corrected the description and issued compensations to all Rovers. We have also initiated a comprehensive internal review of the localised versions of the in-game texts across all the languages that we support. Any corrections or improvements made during the process will be included in the upcoming updates. We sincerely apologise for this mistake and want to reassure you that we're committed to continuously improving the quality of our localisation to better the experience for all Rovers."</p>
<p>As an apology, players will get a five Forging Tides as a one-off compensation gift for the translation error.</p>
<p>"Since Wuthering Wave's official global launch, we have been disheartened by our inability to provide a high-quality gaming experience to all Rovers. We understand that continuously releasing better versions and content is our goal and mission, and we will always strive to uphold them," the team concluded.</p>
<p>"Apart from the adjustments mentioned above, we recognise that there are still many issues in the game that affect player experience. We are committed to listening to every single piece of feedback, continuously organising, optimising, and resolving these issues to make Wuthering Waves better."</p>
<p>For more, <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/827">check out Kuro's detailed post right here</a>.</p>
<p>For the unaware, Wuthering Waves is a new free-to-play open world action-RPG with gacha. It's set in a futuristic post-apocalypse and features real-time action combat, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuthering-waves-voice-actors-list-9436">voice talent</a> from Final Fantasy, Baldur's Gate 3 and more.</p>
