            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redacted-callisto-protocol-spinoff-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Striking Distance Studios and publisher Krafton have announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>[Redacted]</em>, a top-down roguelike set in the world of survival horror game&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>.</p>
<p>You might know&nbsp;<em>[Redacted]&nbsp;</em>better as&nbsp;<em>Project Birdseye</em>, which is the name under which it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za06-A8-_5w" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first revealed back in March</a>. At that time, Striking Distance said that the game was a "side quest", and that the team wanted to "see if the concept clicks with you as much as it has with us".</p>
<p>Well, it looks like that concept has indeed found its intended audience, because now the project is officially called&nbsp;<em>[Redacted]&nbsp;</em>(yes, complete with brackets) and it's set for release across PC and current-gen consoles on October 31st.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/redacted-callisto-protocol-roguelike-gunplay.jpg?itok=fDlSSE6A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/redacted-callisto-protocol-roguelike-gunplay.jpg?itok=JuaSJlUt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>[Redacted]&nbsp;</em>is set to bring&nbsp;<em>Callisto Protocol</em>-adjacent roguelike thrills this October.</figcaption></figure><p>Each run allows you to experiment with loadouts of different weapons, buffs, and "powerful experiments" as you blast your way through&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/callisto-protocol"><em>The Callisto Protocol</em></a>'s Black Iron Prison.</p>
<p>As you play, you'll gain loot, and you can then use that loot to unlock new permanent weapons and buffs for future runs, and there's even a <i>ZombiU</i>-style mechanic that reanimates your corpse when you die, tasking you with defeating it to unlock a powerful new upgrade.</p>
<p>In a rather unique twist on the formula, at the end of each run, <i>[Redacted]&nbsp;</i>will ask you whether you want to escape or turn back and "risk it all in one last hardcore do-or-die run back through the prison". Successfully completing said run will grant you new permanent gear.</p>
<p>All of this is wrapped up in an "irreverent attitude" that's a little less serious than&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, as well as an "arcade-punk soundtrack" composed by&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Jak and Daxter&nbsp;</em>soundtrack studio Mutato Muzika.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>[Redacted]&nbsp;</em>when it launches on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on October 31st. Hopefully, this one does <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/callisto-protocol-review">a little better than its parent</a> when it comes to critical reception, and it hopefully also isn't asking <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/callisto-protocol-crunch-is-problem-with-100-hour-work-weeks">quite as much of its developers</a>.</p>

What you might not know is that it has a sequel, but it isn’t a movie. In 2007, developer Midway and Woo released <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/stranglehold&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/stranglehold"><em>Stranglehold</em></a></span>, an action video game that transfers the director’s signature cinematic flair to fascinating gameplay mechanics. Right now you can get it for just $1.99 on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/en/game/stranglehold&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stranglehold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOG</a></span>, and let me tell you, it’s worth it.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,196251,196395" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>One of the best parts of <em>Hard Boiled</em> is the incredible performance from Chow Yun-fat as the charismatic Inspector Tequila. <em>Stranglehold </em>puts players directly in Tequila’s shoes, with Yun-fat reprising his role. While the plot of the game is much more melodramatic and less tightly paced than the film’s, it’s still a damn good time. There are crime syndicates aplenty, kidnappings, and more bullets getting fired that you can possibly imagine. It’s a pulpy action fever dream worthy of Woo’s name. </p><p>That action is exactly what makes <em>Stranglehold </em>so much fun, as the game works overtime to translate the signature style of Woo’s films into something you can actually play. It plays out as a third-person shooter with some unique flair. If you’ve seen a Woo film, you’ll know that the director has a penchant for incredibly choreographed action scenes with slow-motion, dual-wielded weapons, and—yes—lots of doves flying around.</p><p>One of the best aspects of <em>Stranglehold </em>is its decision to forgo the need to reload the many weapons you will use to take down enemies. Instead you start off with a hefty amount of ammo and run through levels, never needing to worry about resource scarcity. This means you can just run and gun to your heart’s content. And you will do a lot of this considering how many enemies each level is filled with. To emulate the action ballet of Woo’s films, Tequila can also dive around in slow motion—a la <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/max-payne-remake-remedy-alan-wake-control-1850981091&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/max-payne-remake-remedy-alan-wake-control-1850981091"><em>Max Payne</em></a></span>—and fire off rounds with more time to take aim in the air. </p><p>To encourage you to play with cinematic flair yourself, there is also a style mechanic during combat, something you might expect to see more in hack-n-slash games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-5-the-kotaku-review-1833077591&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-5-the-kotaku-review-1833077591"><em>Devil May Cry</em></a></span> rather than a third-person shooter. By taking down enemies, using slow-motion dives, and activating special abilities called Tequila Bombs during combat, you build up stars rating how stylish you’ve been. This all combines to make <em>Stranglehold </em>a frenetic and fun action game with a cinematic twist that puts you in the director’s seat of every scene. For two bucks, it’s an absolute steal worth spending a weekend with. Also, go watch <em>Hard Boiled</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The frame rates on Monster Hunter Wilds could be limited on consoles. According to people who’ve played the demo while at Gamescom, the game appeared to be running at 30 FPS on PlayStation 5 (PS5).</p>



<p>“Demo was on a ps5, didn’t run at 60fps but felt like a stable 30fps,” one person (<a href="https://x.com/MH_Canta/status/1826208752078385195" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MH_Canta</a>) said about their experience. </p>







<p>In a follow up question about their experience, Canta said said that they didn’t see an option to switch to a performance mode. Thought, it’s worth noting that the game being shown is still an early build without the full feature set. So, for some, that does leave hope that it could be added down the line.</p>



<p>For what its worth, Dragon’s Dogma 2 was 30 FPS during demos ahead of its launch. However, after it was released on console, it was eventually given an update to set frame rate options within the game’s settings.</p>



<p>For clarification purposes, Insider Gaming has reached out to Capcom for comment on the game’s frame rate and if it could be 60 FPS by the time it launches. As of publishing, however, no response was received.</p>

<p>There were numerous rumors surrounding the announcement of NHL 25, with a few leaks indicating the game wouldn’t launch on old systems. It appears they were true. NHL 25 won’t launch on last-gen consoles, which is something of a shock considering some of the most popular titles in the franchise were on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Developers want to look forward, not backward.</p>



<p>In the past, titles in the NHL franchise enjoyed a broad launch to bring in as many players as possible. But this time, EA Sports opted for exclusivity to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. It’s a first, and it’s definitely going to rub some long-time players the wrong way. Unsurprisingly, many have yet to upgrade to the current-gen systems. They’re expensive, so we don’t blame you one bit! Unfortunately, that means missing out on a favorite franchise this time.</p>



<p>For now, check out the official reveal trailer here:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="NHL 25 Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RDHIrnNAWPo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>But you may want to reconsider. NHL 25 on current-gen systems features several gameplay improvements, such as the ICE-Q system, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-25-details-leak-ahead-of-official-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we previously reported on</a>, which completely changes how players experience hockey firsthand, with a strong focus on authenticity and intelligence on the ice.</p>



<p><span>NHL 25’s official release date is <strong>October 4</strong>, so you won’t have to wait long&nbsp;to play it</span>. </p>

Pulse allows Max to glimpse the opposite timeline before jumping through, since danger isn’t limited to just one timeline. With Pulse, Max can also overhear conversations happening on the other side, which is the perfect supernatural tool for an amateur sleuth.</p><p>Max will need to use both aspects of her new power to solve her friend Safi’s impossible murder. As Max Shifts back and forth between two increasingly different timelines, her power allows the player to complete unique puzzles, navigate complex campus social dynamics and explore all the mysteries that Caledon University has to offer.</p></blockquote><p><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,757 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,948 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,017 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1874000/Life_is_Strange_Double_Exposure/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/life-is-strange-double-exposure/9npzhqh1tt23" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a> on October 29, followed by <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,818 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> at a later date.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>EA Sports has officially announced NHL 25, and for the first time in the series, the game has not one but <em>three </em>cover stars. And these aren't three all-stars from different teams--they're the Hughes brothers.</p><p>Jack and Luke of the New Jersey Devils, along with Quinn of the Vancouver Canucks, will grace the cover of the NHL 25 Deluxe Edition. Jack stands alone on the cover for the standard edition, while Quinn gets the standard edition cover for Canada and the rest of the world. Luke, sadly for him, doesn't get his own standalone cover.</p><p>"We feel incredibly honored to be on the cover of NHL 25," Quinn said. "Being featured alongside my brothers is the sort of thing you dream about as a kid but could never imagine happening in real life."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4354756-screenshot2024-08-21at3.30.08pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354756" data-ratio="0.57243460764588" data-width="1988" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4354756-screenshot2024-08-21at3.30.08pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354756"></a><figcaption>The Hughes brothers.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4354756-screenshot2024-08-21at3.30.08pm.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355340-standardeditionjackhughes-usaonly.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355341-standardeditionquinnhughes-canadaandworld.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355340,1300-4355341" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4355340-standardeditionjackhughes-usaonly.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4355341-standardeditionquinnhughes-canadaandworld.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355340-standardeditionjackhughes-usaonly.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355341-standardeditionquinnhughes-canadaandworld.jpg"></figure><p>Jack added: "It reminded us that on the ice, we're competitors, always learning from each other, but off the ice, we're brothers who love to play hockey."</p><p>Luke said, "We have a one-of-a-kind hockey story growing up together and now a one-of-a-kind cover. We can't wait for fans to experience NHL 25."</p><p>In terms of what's new in NHL 25, EA says the game has a new "logic-driven animation system" that is able to better replicate an authentic NHL experience. One of the pillars is what's called Next-Gen Vision Control, which is a skating mechanic that gives players more freedom and control on and off the puck. The game also boasts improved AI to help teammates respond more realistically. There are also new "Reactive Actions," which include new animations for "critical" moments in hockey games.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355327-nhl25_utah_away_keller_002_wm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4355327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355327-nhl25_utah_away_keller_002_wm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4355327"></a><figcaption>A first look at NHL 25</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355327-nhl25_utah_away_keller_002_wm.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355330-nhl25_nextgenvisioncontrol_lhughes_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355331-nhl25_onetimer_qhughes_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355332-nhl25_reactiveactions_dahlin_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355333-nhl25_sapientech_onice_canucks_qhughes_comparisonto24_closeup_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355335-nhl25_sapientech_onice_canucks_qhughes_comparisonto24_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355336-nhl25_utah_away_keller_002_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355338-nhl25_utah_home_keller_001_wm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4355330,1300-4355331,1300-4355332,1300-4355333,1300-4355335,1300-4355336,1300-4355338" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4355330-nhl25_nextgenvisioncontrol_lhughes_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4355331-nhl25_onetimer_qhughes_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4355332-nhl25_reactiveactions_dahlin_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4355333-nhl25_sapientech_onice_canucks_qhughes_comparisonto24_closeup_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4355335-nhl25_sapientech_onice_canucks_qhughes_comparisonto24_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4355336-nhl25_utah_away_keller_002_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4355338-nhl25_utah_home_keller_001_wm.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355330-nhl25_nextgenvisioncontrol_lhughes_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355331-nhl25_onetimer_qhughes_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355332-nhl25_reactiveactions_dahlin_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355333-nhl25_sapientech_onice_canucks_qhughes_comparisonto24_closeup_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355335-nhl25_sapientech_onice_canucks_qhughes_comparisonto24_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355336-nhl25_utah_away_keller_002_wm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4355338-nhl25_utah_home_keller_001_wm.png"></figure><p>What's more, NHL 25 has a new skill-based system for one-timers that will reward players for setting up plays in the right way.

			<p>Avowed is the latest game by Obsidian Entertainment, the masterminds behind Pentiment, Grounded, and Fallout: New Vegas. It is a brand-new action role-playing game set in the same world as Pillars of Eternity, where players explore the familiar world of Eora. While still in development, Game Director Carrie Patel took part in an interview at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqPvOB0cDZI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamescom 2024 with IGN</a> where she spoke about Avowed's endings. So far, the Avowed possible endings have reached the double digits, giving the game plenty of replayability, especially for the completionists.</p>
<p>Being published by Xbox Game Studios, Avowed is set to be released on <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-officially-delayed-to-february-18-2025-new-live-stream-set-for-august-23/">February 18, 2025</a>. Originally, it was set to be released this year but has since experienced delays, pushing the game back to the first quarter of next year. Avowed was first announced in 2020 during an Xbox Series X showcase, where excited fans were introduced to this new role-playing game. Since then, Avowed has evolved significantly and is shaping to look better than it was previously.</p>
<p>In the interview, Carrie Patel discussed the number of endings that players can expect to see in the game, with some of them being ending slides rather than full endings. "I can tell you our ending slides number in the double digits; you can end up with a lot of different combinations of them."</p>
<p>How many "full" endings there are for Avowed remains unseen, and how many make up the ending slides. For those unaware, ending slides are contextual slides at the end of the game that tell you what happened to the player and any crucial characters you may have encountered. Plenty of RPGs have this, as well as games that have multiple endings that can be obtained.</p>
<p>"Your ending really is the sum total of your choices in this game," Patel added. Avowed is set to release on Xbox and PC, with no word of whether this game will be introduced to PlayStation 5 later. Players have the choice to play the game either in first-person or third-person, depending on their preference. At the moment, details regarding Avowed are pretty scarce, but there are multiple trailers for curious people to look at, which can give them a glimpse into the upcoming fantasy RPG.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ULsF7B6bFuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you want more context for the upcoming fantasy RPG, jumping into Pillars of Eternity is an option that may help you piece together contextual clues for Avowed when the game is eventually released in February.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/payday-3-roadmap-promises-new-heist-ui-revamp-and-more.960960/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-roadmap<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Starbreeze has finally revealed the&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>roadmap, detailing what's coming to the multiplayer heist shooter in the next couple of months. As the studio itself says, better late than never, right?</p>
<p>You can see the full roadmap over on Starbreeze's <a href="https://www.paydaythegame.com/payday3/medicbag/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a>. It's all part of the studio's Medic Bag initiative, which is an attempt to turn around the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-payday-3-performance">struggling fortunes</a> of its <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/payday-3">flagship multiplayer title</a> (which is currently performing significantly worse than&nbsp;<em>Payday 2&nbsp;</em>in the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam player count stakes</a>).</p>
<p>This month, Starbreeze has delivered a new paid DLC pack in the form of Chapter 3: Houston Breakout, as well as a new heist, new animations, and more. There's more to come in the pipeline over September and October, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/payday-3-roadmap-september-october.jpg?itok=LnhGCpSc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/payday-3-roadmap-september-october.jpg?itok=2B4v4Dxt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>roadmap has plenty of goodies in store.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, in September, the new "Fear and Greed" paid DLC will be released, and it'll bring a new heist, new weapons, and a Tailor Pack for you to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also look forward to new masks and a new Overkill weapon as part of that month's free goodies, so you'll get those whether you pay for Fear and Greed or not.</p>
<p>October, meanwhile, it bringing a new Year I Edition DLC. It's not entirely clear what this DLC will contain, but it rather sounds like it'll package in all of&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s paid DLC so far, plus maybe a few extras for the die-hard faithful.</p>
<p>Free updates coming in October include a UI revamp, a server browser feature, and a VOIP function, as well as new Twitch drops. This is not, perhaps, the comprehensive roadmap that a game which arguably resulted in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down">ousting of its developer's CEO</a> needs, but hey, it's something.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/payday-3-roadmap-lasers.jpg?itok=LeUAJSKw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/payday-3-roadmap-lasers.jpg?itok=P0IaHGDZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It might not quite be over for&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Presumably, Starbreeze is planning more new features for <i>Payday 3</i>'s future, so this very much won't be all you've got to look forward to. Hopefully, the dev can squeeze in those responsibilities between idea sessions for its new&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026"><em>Dungeons and Dragons&nbsp;</em>multiplayer game</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1272080/PAYDAY_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007263" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/payday-3/9NPZVDCH73SX/0010" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>It is perhaps deeply ungrateful of me that, when presented with the squirrel with a gun of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/squirrel-with-a-gun">Squirrel With A Gun</a>, my immediate reaction is to thrust out my bowl like a ballsy victorian urchin and ask for <em>additional squirrel information</em>. It’s not that developer Dee Dee Creations haven’t shown off the game in action. It’s just that I find myself rooting so hard for this not to just be a vapid bit of meme-ware that I’m getting more concerned as we rapidly approach its 29th August release.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>And look, sure. If I made a game called Squirrel With A Gun, and someone asked me what the game was, y’know, about, then I’d probably just do the equivalent of what these trailers are doing. That is, I’d continuously shout “squirrel with a gun!” until they either left in a huff or started shouting it with me. Maybe we’d start jumping up and down on the spot at some point. Maybe there’d be party poppers.
</p>
<p>And yet, I find myself in the position of - if not a party pooper - at least the equivalent of a commenter on a nice squirrel documentary, writing out a list of horrible diseases you can catch from their bites (salmonelosis, typhus, ringworm). Here’s the launch trailer.</p>

<p>It’s not absent of tangible information, and neither is the game’s<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2067050/Squirrel_with_a_Gun/"> Steam page</a>. We know it’ll be a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> of some sort, possibly in the 3D Mario vein - your goal is collecting golden acorns. We know you’ll use the recoil from weapons to pull off tricky navigation challenges. And we know that the title is a slight misnomer, because the squirrel can actually have several guns. One of them is a six-shooter, and it also comes with a little cowboy hat for the squirrel to wear. You'll collect such apparel by doing side quests for strangers. Also, pets.</p>
<p>In truth, I’ve wishlisted games on less information than this. It’s just that, quite unfairly, Squirrel With A Gun’s memey cuteness means I’m expecting it to work twice as hard to fully sell itself to me. Isn’t this the opposite of how appearing cute to humans is supposed to work in nature? I don’t have time to check how tight the evolutionary science is on that, but I also don’t remember harbouring a deep mistrust for any adorable mammals recently. I’ve had my cat less than a week, mind.</p>
<p>What do you reckon? Is this a hollow meme wearing the skin of a devious tree rat, with nothing much going for it beyond a viral-worthy concept? Or will it have some substance to it? “The squirrel that you kill in jest, dies in earnest,” wrote Thoreau. Might we expect the same earnestness from the squirrel that does the killing? One in the chamber isn't enough, squirrel. I need to know your heart's in it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Lara stays booked and busy, even if the next big game isn’t quite in our field of view.

The roughly 9-inch-tall figure comes with two sets of arms, one that has her wielding the dual pistols she was known for in the early <em>Tomb Raider </em>games and another that has the climbing ax she uses in the reboot trilogy. Right now the <em>Tomb Raider </em>series is trying to build a bridge between the origin story of the reboot games and the seasoned version of Lara we meet in the first games, with Netflix’s <em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft </em>set to finally fill in the gap between the two. So the statue paying homage to both continuities as part of Lara’s story is a nice detail that captures where the series is at right now.</p><p>The statue itself looks pretty good, especially for the relatively cheap price of $89.99.

"And you can end up with a lot of different combinations of them. This is an Obsidian game, so your ending is really the sum total of your choices across the game, across a lot of pieces of content depending on what you encountered and what you did when you found it."</p><p dir="ltr">What Patel describes sounds similar to endings in other RPGs like Fallout (of which Obsidian has experience working on, having developed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-new-vegas/" data-ref-id="5000-42960">Fallout: New Vegas</a>), where a slideshow of different consequences play out at the end of the game showing the results of a player's actions as they pertain to different factions, storylines, and characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Patel further elaborated more on the choices players will be making in Avowed.</p><p dir="ltr">"There are a lot of choices to be made about where your true loyalties lie, who your allegiance is with in the endgame," Patel said. "We're really excited for players to explore those possibilities and build their own story."</p><p dir="ltr">Obsidian is putting a big emphasis on Avowed's companion characters, having recently <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1823056988814635415" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed the voice cast</a> for the group of characters players will be teaming up with over the course of the fantasy adventure.

<p>According to <a href="https://nikopartners.com/journey-to-success-black-myth-wukong-breaks-records-on-day-one/">Niko Partners</a> analyst Daniel Ahmad, that's a new record to go alongside its newly-minted accolade of being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-already-steams-most-played-single-player-game-of-all-time">the most popular single-player game by peak concurrent users (PCCU) in Steam history</a>.</p>

<p>Ahmad also points out that this success isn't just limited to digital, either.</p>
<p>"Physical editions of the game, including collector's and deluxe versions, sold out within seconds on JD.com, as more than 700,000 gamers signed up for a chance to purchase the limited set of 30,000 copies," he said.</p> <div>

<p>"The broader implications of this success cannot be overlooked," Admad added.</p>
<p>"It signals that Chinese studios are ready to compete directly with established Western and Japanese developers in the premium AAA space. Game Science’s transition from mobile game development to creating a world-class AAA title, backed by heavyweights like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> and Hero Games, is a path that many Chinese game developers are already trying to follow with growing success."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/08/21/wukong-game-debut-drives-playstation-5-to-top-of-alibaba-tmall/">Bloomberg</a> reports that Black Myth: Wukong has also sparked a demand for PS5 consoles in China, with sales of Sony's system twice that of the same period last year.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is now Steam's second-biggest game of all time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-already-steams-most-played-single-player-game-of-all-time">clocking up a staggering peak of 2.3m concurrent players</a>, having pushed both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> down a place. Only PUBG: Battlegrounds boasts a higher concurrent peak of 3.2m, and that's a multiplayer battle royale.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong secured three out of five stars in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Eurogamer's Black Myth: Wukong review</a>.</p>
<p>"Its dramatic and spectacular boss fights just about keep Black Myth: Wukong afloat, but behind all its glitz and glamour is a frustratingly hollow and rudderless action game," Katharine wrote at the time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At Gamescom yesterday, developer Hollow Ponds announced a sequel, <em>Wilmot Works It Out</em>, which is much more chill while still capturing some of what made <em>Warehouse</em> fun.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060590/Wilmot_Works_It_Out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wilmot Works It Out</em> </a>is pretty different from <em>Warehouse.</em> You play as overworked-but-still-smiling block Wilmot in their off time, where they enjoy solving jigsaw puzzles. You unpack and arrange the pieces, and once you’ve solved the puzzle, you can hang it on your wall. (Hanging finished puzzles is a thing jigsaw people do, which I can respect but will admit I do not understand.)</p><p>There's a Steam demo out now that's pretty straightforward, containing only a handful of puzzles, but some of <em>Warehouse</em>’s vibes come through. Deliveries contain pieces of other puzzles, so there’s some of the categorizing and cognitive load of <em>Warehouse</em>, as you put pieces aside for later or try to get a sense of a full puzzle within all the extra bits. As more puzzles arrive, I can see it tapping into some of the stress and chaos I liked about the first game, but in a much more relaxed way. According to the Steam page, you’ll unlock new rooms in Wilmot’s house and ways to decorate them as you play.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Wilmot Works It Out | Wishlist today on Steam!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YARyZ2peq3U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><br>Hollow Ponds recently released <a href="https://aftermath.site/flock-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Flock</em></a>, another chill game about categories, and also announced a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHa17b9fJAE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wilmot’s Warehouse</em> board game</a> that I am sorely tempted to buy despite the fact that organizing people for a game night and teaching them the rules are some of my least favorite activities. <em>Wilmot Works It Out</em> comes out in October.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-brings-a-roguelike-twist-next-year.960900/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Thunderful has announced&nbsp;<em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em>, a sequel-slash-followup to 2021's quirky but flawed action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Lost in Random</em>.</p>
<p>The first game felt rather like what would happen if Tim Burton directed&nbsp;<em>A Plague Tale: Innocence</em>, but this time around, the action is shifting to an isometric perspective and moving in a more roguelike-y direction.</p>
<p>You are Queen Aleksandra, and you must explore four distinct realms packed with randomly-generated (see what they did there?) areas, challenges, and enemy placements in order to recover your powers and escape the nightmare realm in which you're trapped.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-scrapyard.jpg?itok=sd2ZN4Lz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-scrapyard.jpg?itok=NyJIdxNU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die&nbsp;</em>serves as a followup to the 2021 original.</figcaption></figure><p>As you play, you'll be able to unlock Relics to "uncover hundreds of combinations of instant effects, chaotic synergies, and powerful bonuses". It sounds rather like this system is replacing the deckbuilding element of the original game.</p>
<p>Just like many other roguelikes, death won't finish your playthrough in&nbsp;<em>The Eternal Die</em>. Instead, you'll be transported to a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hades"><em>Hades</em></a>-style hub area called the Sanctuary, where you'll meet a "fully-voiced band of eclectic characters", unlock new weapons, and choose Blessings to accompany you into combat.</p>
<p>This being a&nbsp;<em>Lost in Random&nbsp;</em>game, you are, of course, also accompanied by a faithful die friend. Fortune can be thrown for a variety of effects, or you can simply watch as it totters along by your side. Aww, how cute!</p>
<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em>, which will let you return to the Burtonesque world of the original, right here.</p>

<p><em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die&nbsp;</em>is set to release across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2564520/Lost_in_Random_The_Eternal_Die/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10011792/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die/9n72g399183f/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, as well as Nintendo Switch, at some point in 2025. Given that&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-2024-switch">many of the games announced at Gamescom</a>&nbsp;aren't coming to Switch, it's nice to see this one's confirmed for Nintendo's console.</p>

A <em>vast</em> Space Marine towers over the crowds of journalists, next to an enormous flag-strewn faux-stone hut that houses half-hourly showings of Obsidian’s upcoming RPG <em>Avowed</em>. There’s the theater-sized temple that showed us Indy punching Nazis in the nose in <em>Indian Jones and the Great Circle</em>, and ghastly neon Xbox-themed counters. But amidst it all, I saw the strangest thing: a large area with just a few people sitting on what looked like enormous motorbikes, wearing VR helmets, all of them laughing or wide-eyed in terror.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193831" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="226" data-playlist="193831,195410,196299" data-current="193831"><div><p>The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19283.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This, it turned out, was Blizzard promoting <em>World of Warcraft</em>’s new expansion, <em>The War Within</em>, which releases on August 27. The game, surely to become commonly known as <em>WoWWW</em>, wasn’t being shown on monitors for people to experience a chunk of, but rather offered as a fleet of ride-on VR experiences. I was <em>sure</em> there wasn’t a VR version of <em>WoW</em>, so what on Earth was it? Obviously I went in. There wasn’t even a line.</p><p>It was bloody fantastic. Called Escape From Dalaran, it was also by far the most wildly exuberant spending of money to promote a game everyone already knows about I’ve experienced since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/why-video-game-press-events-sometimes-go-horribly-wrong-1847165294&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/why-video-game-press-events-sometimes-go-horribly-wrong-1847165294">an ill-fated trip to Poland for <em>Call of Duty II</em></a></span>. I cannot fathom how much this must have cost, to offer something completely unrepresentative of the game to those able to attend a games conference in Cologne, Germany. But I digress. </p><p>To begin, I climbed onto the enormous contraption—one of perhaps twenty in the cordoned section of Hall 7—and wondered nervously about where I was supposed to put my hands. In front of me was an enormous wad of sleek cushioned padding, with metal bars low down either side. It felt silly to hold onto something so low, like I was getting ready to put my head down and plough through a wall. I put on the VR hat, and the extremely lovely and somewhat bemused employee snuck headphones on me without me even realizing. After a peculiarly long loading screen, I was sat on the back of one of <em>WoW</em>’s dragon-like mounts.</p><p>The next few minutes were non-stop exhilaration, as I swooped, climbed, weaved and plunged throughout an epic battle taking place in Azeroth, with buildings crashing down around me, until in desperation me and my companion jumped through a portal to find ourselves in <em>The War Within</em>’s Nerubian Empire. And it only became more frantic.</p><p>At this point, the denizens of the world were not at all pleased about our arrival, and a completely improbable number of enemies rose up to attack. We were doomed, and my steed was suddenly torn away from me, leaving me falling alone. But a very cross lady with floaty magic balls above her shoulders captured me in a bubble, and spoke extremely sternly about how disappointed she was. And then it came to an end.</p><p> On top of all this, it was filming me from the outside, and then created a mixed-media video of the event, so the world can enjoy my wobbly belly flapping through a t-shirt in the considerable breeze. </p><p>What this description doesn’t convey is just how violently I was thrown about by the whole thing, tipping so far to the side at one point that I was holding on with hands and thighs. And those plunges—dear God, I know it was 90 percent a trick of the mind, the slight tilt of the ride exaggerated by the all-senses-consuming nature of VR, but it was spectacular. And I say all this as a VR skeptic who rarely has any truck with the face-melting format.</p><p>But…what was it for? This thing didn’t just throw me around like a bucking bronco, but blew air in my face and all around me, perfectly timed with the swoops and glides to match the sensation of rushing forward, an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/twisters-regal-4dx-theater-experience-tornado-1851598749&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/twisters-regal-4dx-theater-experience-tornado-1851598749">experience that must have been like seeing <em>Twisters </em>in 4DX</a></span>. But this entire sequence was surely only built for this one experience,and <em>there isn’t even a Blizzcon this year</em>! It’s not like it was made for that, and we got a sneaky preview! Heck, the game’s out on August 27, less than a week from this all, making it redundant almost right away.</p><p>I had a whale of a time. I’m delighted someone decided to spend what <em>must</em> have been millions, just for me and the visitors to Gamescom to have such a silly, exorbitant, and utterly disconnected ride, just to remind us all that the most famous game in the world still exists. “That must have cost a fortune!” I said to the assistant as I got off. “Crazy!” he replied. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/PAYDAYGame/status/1826620510286860393" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, an updated Payday 3 roadmap confirms all of the new paid and free content that fans can expect in August, September, and October 2024.</p>



<p>This September, fans will get a new Fear and Greed paid DLC, Heister Pack, and Overkill Weapon. There will also be new masks and Twitch Drops. </p>



<p>This will only be Part 1 of the first anniversary update for the game, which originally launched in September 2023.</p>



<p>October 2024 will continue with Part 2 of the Anniversary Update, adding a Year 1 Edition of the game. In addition to even more Twitch drops, the devs will also introduce improvements with the server browser, UI, and VOIP.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This month, fans can enjoy the Houston Breakout DLC, as well as some fresh challenges, a new secondary weapon, and more. The concrete plan of today’s roadmap update may help renew more interest in Payday 3.</p>



<p>Payday 3 had a rough launch last year, and in February 2024 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-payday-3-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starbreeze did admit</a> that “sales and player activity are currently at significantly lower levels than we would like.”</p>



<p>Just a month after that statement, Starbreeze <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-fires-ceo-tobias-sjogren/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired its CEO</a>, and promptly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-appoints-mats-juhl-as-new-interim-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appointed Mats Juhl</a> as its interim CEO. </p>



<p>In a new quarterly report released this week, Juhl also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-reveals-update-on-dungeons-dragons-game-plans-for-partnerships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offered new details</a> on Starbreeze’s anticipated Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. Currently titled Project Baxter, Juhl said it is “growing as planned,” and mentioned plans to establish new partnerships for the title.</p>

As a modest prison guard your job is simple—get to the last escape pod and get out alive.</p><p>But you aren’t the only survivor looking to escape. Your rivals—a deranged custodian, a violent gangster, a maniacal lunch lady, and more—can’t wait to step over your corpse and save themselves.</p><p>Only one of you can make it off the moon—make sure it’s you!</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_907069"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Fight, Die, Adapt</strong> – Each death is a learning experience. Starting fresh each run, build up your loadout with powerful experiments, weapon schematics, and buffs to battle through Black Iron. When you die (and you will die), use your hard-earned loot to purchase new permanent weapons, suits, and skills. Get stronger, experiment with your strategy, and get out!</li><li><strong>Rout Your Rivals</strong> – You’re not the only person to survive the initial outbreak or willing to use a bit of violence to get to the last escape pod. Some prisoners and even your correctional services colleagues are just as eager to escape and will make escaping harder by attacking you remotely or challenging you to a one-on-one duel. Race them, attack them back remotely, and fight them to the death to make it out in one piece.</li><li><strong>Fight Your Last Corpse</strong> – When you die, you leave more than a coverall-clad carcass. Defeat the reanimated corpse of the last guard to succumb to the prison’s dangers to earn a powerful experiment. But beware, it’s not going to be an easy fight. The semi-alive guard has the same loadout they had when they met an untimely end and a few extra tricks up its sleeve to keep things spicy.</li><li><strong>“Game Over, Man”</strong> – You’ve made the perfect build, battled through bosses, ran through rivals, killed your corpse, found all the files, and now you’re standing in front of that last escape pod. Sure, you could leave it all behind for the sweet taste of freedom… or risk it all in one last hardcore do-or-die run back through the prison. Fail and you lose all your purchased gear, skills, suits, and weapons.

                <p>The Callisto Protocol developer Striking Distance Studios has announced its next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/redacted-2/" data-ref-id="5000-567224">Redacted</a>. Set in the same sci-fi horror universe as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-callisto-protocol/" data-ref-id="5000-523747">The Callisto Protocol</a>, the game will see players return to Black Iron Prison and face off against mutant prisoners and other survivors looking to escape the facility. It'll launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on October 31.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QwJWGHHJ6k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4QwJWGHHJ6k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Billed as a roguelike dungeon-crawler with a punk-rock attitude, the game will follow the genre formula of fighting, dying, dying again, fighting some more, and dying yet again until you eventually get a perfect run. As a security guard caught in the middle of rioting prisoners and scientific abominations, you'll have access to an arsenal of weapons, skills, and more to help you survive.</p><p>Striking Distance says it is taking the classic roguelike formula and "cranking it to 11" in Redacted, while also throwing in a few ideas of its own to make each run feel different. The one interesting twist is that when your character inevitably dies, the next run will see you eventually fight your own reanimated corpse from the previous run. The stronger you <em>were</em>, the stronger it <em>is</em>, as your corpse is armed with the same weapons, upgrades, and skills from your last run.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355248-02_redactedscreenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355248" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355248-02_redactedscreenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355248"></a><figcaption>Redacted</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355248-02_redactedscreenshot.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355249-01_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355250-03_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355251-04_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355252-05_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355253-06_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355254-07_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355255-08_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355256-09_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355257-10_redactedscreenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355249,1300-4355250,1300-4355251,1300-4355252,1300-4355253,1300-4355254,1300-4355255,1300-4355256,1300-4355257" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4355249-01_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4355250-03_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4355251-04_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4355252-05_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4355253-06_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4355254-07_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4355255-08_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4355256-09_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4355257-10_redactedscreenshot.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355249-01_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355250-03_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355251-04_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355252-05_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355253-06_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355254-07_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355255-08_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355256-09_redactedscreenshot.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4355257-10_redactedscreenshot.jpg"></figure><p>If that wasn't bad enough, the other survivors attempting to reach the last escape pod in Black Iron Prison will throw challenges at you or attempt to take you out before you can reach the pod, adding another wrinkle to the survival experience.</p><p>In case you missed it, Striking Distance's first game was The Callisto Protocol, which was released back in December 2022. Game director Glen Schofield, who left the studio following the disappointing critical and commercial success of the game, recently claimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-shipped-too-early-at-publishers-insistence-director-says/1100-6525586/">that the game was forced to ship early</a>, which resulted in content being cut from it and impacting its development.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has confirmed it's shutting down <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-review">Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</a> at the end of the year, shifting focus to a "paid version of Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp" which will release "in the future".</p>
<p>The current free iteration of Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp - which has been running for seven years - will close at 3pm UK time on 28th November 2024. In a statement, the developer/publisher said it would share more information about the premium game in October 2024, and thanked players for their "patience and understanding".</p>

<p>Nintendo confirms that in-game events and item distribution will "continue until the service ends", although the sale of in-game Leaf Tickets will "cease" shortly before servers shut down.</p>
<p>From 28th October, you won't be able to purchase a new Pocket Camp subscription, and any existing subs will not renew. Players are advised to use all their Leaf Tickets before the game closes.</p>
<p>Players who'd like to try the new premium game will be able to transfer over their save data (albeit not Leaf Tickets), and the new Animal Crossing game will not require a constant internet connection, nor "contain any in-app purchases".</p>
<p>"We would like to thank everyone who has supported the game since it launched," Nintendo said.</p>
<p>This marks the fifth mobile game Nintendo has shut down. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-tour-updates-end-next-month">Mario Kart Tour closed in 2023</a>, Dragalia Lost in 2022, and Dr Mario World in 2021. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/miitomo">Miitomo</a> was also closed in 2018, just two years after it launched.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
