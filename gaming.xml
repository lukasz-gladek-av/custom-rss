			<p>Let It Die: Inferno is a new rougelite-survival game from developer GungHo Online Entertainment a the next game in the Let It Die series. Announced during yesterday's Sony State of Play event, it'll arrive on PC and PS5 this coming December 3, 2025.</p>



<p>Let It Die: Inferno is a PvEvP title that will constantly have you doing whatever you can to survive as you try to work your way towards the legendary 'Eye of the Reaper' treasure that can give whosoever finds it immense untold power.</p>



<p>You'll search for it by descending into the Hell Gate, plunging into its depths for this treasure to hopefully be the last one standing with it. On top of dealing with the creatures and demons you'll find on your way to the treasure, you'll also have to contend with other players in this third-person action roguelite.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Within the Hell Gate, all bests are off,</em>" writes Allyson Nicholas, associate community manager at GungHo Online Entertainment, in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/survival-action-roguelite-let-it-die-inferno-launches-december-3-on-ps5/">a PlayStation Blog post</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>In order to survive, players must not only fend off grotesque creatures and human enemies in melee-focused combat, but also other players. It's rougelite survival action in a chaotic PvEvP environment. Upon each descent, your Raider will be equipped with a character-specific weapon</em>, <em>which can be switched out with any weapon you find as you explore. All Raidrs are dual-wielding and the combination of weapons in your equipment slots will unlock new special attacks. Needless to say, no two playing experiences will be the same; stage layouts and item placements shift every descent, so players must use a strategic combination of unique weapons and special abilities to make it out alive</em>."</p>



<p>The last time we saw the Let It Die series was with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/deathverse-let-it-die-will-be-redeveloped-service-to-be-suspended-on-july-18/">free-to-play title Deathverse: Let It Die</a>, which was taken offline in 2023 to be "<em>redeveloped</em>" into something new. Well, GungHo Online Entertainment doesn't directly come out and say that Let It Die: Inferno is that redeveloped title, but that could very well be the case.</p>



<p>Regardless, at least Let It Die fans won't have to wait too long to check out Inferno with its December release date, and while it might not be free-to-play, it is only costing you $24.99 to jump in.</p>

I came across it in yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@IndieFanFest">Indie Fan Fest</a> stream, and I quite like the cut of its torpedo bays.
</p>
<p>
Nullspace grabs me for a couple of reasons. One is its "retrofuturistic universe", which strikes me as both sleek and cosy. It's kind of <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/39LP0B">chibi Homeworld</a>. The kitbashed ships come alive with swivelling turrets and manoeuvring jets, but something about the way they're proportioned, patterned and lit also makes me think of freshly piped cake icing. I also quite like the Star Fox-style jabbering heads of unit commanders in the bottom corner.

<p>
The other thing I like is that this is one of those possibly borked genre hybrids, like Shiny Entertainment's Sacrifice or Activision's old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlezone">Battlezone</a> reboot. On the one hand, it's a real-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> with planetary bases, various resources to gather, a choice of fleet formations, and the option of either using asteroids for cover or blowing them up for disruption. On the other, it's a dogfighter, with the ability to seize control of any ship and hose the badniks with your own two thumbs. 
</p><p>
The result may prove to be more akin to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> or a punch-up in an Airfix factory than the Battle of New Caprica. There are a couple of moments in the trailer when ships barge into each other like shopping trolleys. But I do like the bustle of it all. 
</p>
<p>
There's a story to reckon with, when you're not making battleships kiss. It channels both "the Golden Age of Sci-Fi" and "deep existential themes". According to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2363280/NULLSPACE/">the Steam page</a>, you will "lead or challenge factions like the democratic Hegen, the transhumanist Dominion, and the resourceful Junkers as they vie for survival and dominance." Apparently the game contains a "unique take on the Fermi Paradox", this being the contention that we really should have run into some advanced extraterrestrials by now given the amount of stuff there is in outer space. Interested to learn more, I guess.
</p>
<p>
As for those factions, they put me a little in mind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sins-solar-empire">Sins of a Solar Empire</a>, though they don't seem quite as vicious. Here's the blurb in full:
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>The Junkers: Survivors and scavengers, the Junkers live on the fringes of space, salvaging remnants of humanity's past to build a precarious future. Their resourcefulness and ingenuity allow them to adapt to any situation, but their distrust of centralized authority makes them fiercely independent--and difficult to unify.</li>
<li>The Hegen: A powerful, militaristic faction rooted in discipline and order. The Hegen values tradition and hierarchy, believing that humanity's salvation lies in strict control and unwavering loyalty. Their massive fleets and technological prowess make them a force to be reckoned with, but their rigidity may blind them to alternative solutions.</li>
<li>The Dominion: Visionaries, innovators, and seekers of progress, the Dominion is driven by the belief that humanity's evolution lies in embracing new ideas and technologies. They see opportunity in the chaos, pushing boundaries to forge a brighter future, though their relentless pursuit of advancement often clashes with the values of other factions.</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>
All told: I can dig it. But do I dig it more than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nebulous-fleet-command">Nebulous: Fleet Command</a>? I can see representations of gravity wells in the trailer, there, but I doubt it's simulating quite as much stuff. Nullspace hath yet no release date beyond "coming soon".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A generation of Nintendo fans grew up playing the <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> on GameCube at every sleepover. And now this slept on kart racer’s franchise is finally coming back. It’s kind of crazy that the Nintendo Switch 2 is only getting a small handful of exclusive titles this year and two of them are kart racers. I guess Mr. Sakurai—director of the <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> games and creator of Kirby—really just wanted to see his pink ball back in the driver’s seat of a warp store and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4307/">Nintendo said “Fine.”&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders </em>is now available for pre-order over at Amazon.</a></p>
<p>The first <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> had a limited roster, just letting you race as different colors of Kirby. You could unlock Meta Knight and King DeDeDe, but they did not allow the option to choose your machine.&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is fixing that by giving you a huge new cast of racers — all of which have full access to the different machines to race on. Choose between Kirby, King Dedede, Meta Knight, Bandana Waddle Dee, Chef Kawasaki, and so many more characters. Each racer has their own unique special move they can unleash to give them the edge in a race.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4307/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The machine choices have greatly expanded, but lots of fan favorites are returning. the speedy Turbo Star, the slippery Slick Star, and the intimidating Rex Wheelie are all back. New machines such as the heavyweight Battle Chariot are looking to be a fun time as well.</p>
<h2>City Trial Is Back</h2>
<p>Real fans of <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> know that the heart of this game is not in the racing modes. No, sir. You play this game for one thing and one thing only — City Trial. This multiplayer free roam mode is back in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> and it’s looking to be better than ever before. Zip around the floating city known as Skyah as you have minutes to find a good machine, collect power-ups and upgrades, then compete against up to 16 players online in a random field event. These could be standard races, battles to the death, darts but on karts, and so much more.</p>



<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4307/">You can pre-order either the physical version or a digital code which you can enter into your Nintendo Switch 2 to install on release.</a> The game is set to release later this Fall on November 20. Pre-order today for $70. Remember before pre-ordering that this title is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2 and will not run on your old, standard Nintendo Switch console</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4307/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

                <p>Over the last couple of years, developer Insomniac Games has earned critical acclaim for its work on Marvel's Spider-Man series. Following two main Spider-Man games and the Miles Morales game, the studio's next project is one that has Marvel fans excited as a legendary mutant is stepping back into the spotlight.</p><p>The last time that Wolverine had a solo game was all the way back in 2009 with X-Men Origins: Wolverine. A tie-in game to the film of the same name, Raven Software's single-player adventure was a gruesome and action-packed spectacle of blood, guts, and adamantium claws. More than a decade later, Insomniac's take on the X-Man is looking like a spiritual successor, and while the game is still deep in development, a few new details about Marvel's Wolverine have been revealed recently.</p><h2 id="When_will_Marvel_s_Wolverine_be_released_">When will Marvel's Wolverine be released?</h2><p>As revealed during the September 2025 State of Play, Marvel's Wolverine will be popping its claws in Fall 2026. </p><p>Insomniac is something of a miracle worker when it comes to video game releases, as since 2018, the studio has shipped Marvel's Spider-Man, expansive DLC for the game, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, with Spider-Man 2 launching in October 2023. Insomniac has a reputation for surprisingly short development cycles in the current era of multi-year game projects, and it has been suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolverine-will-be-m-rated-game-could-launch-as-early-as-fall-2024-report/1100-6511117/">Marvel's Wolverine could launch in Fall 2024</a>. That didn't happen, of course, and most recently, Insomniac <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolverine-dev-refuses-to-comment-on-2025-release-date-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement/1100-6528944/" data-ref-id="1100-6528944">refused to comment when asked if Wolverine is coming in 2025.</a></p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_platforms">Marvel's Wolverine platforms</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, Marvel's Wolverine will be headed to PlayStation 5 as a console exclusive, given Insomniac's position as a PlayStation first-party studio<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-sony-bought-insomniac-games-we-felt-that-this-/1100-6469237/" data-ref-id="1100-6469237"> since its acquisition by Sony in 2019</a>. It's highly likely that the game will eventually come to PC, as several other Insomniac-developed titles have also wound up on that platform following their PS5 release.</p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_gameplay">Marvel's Wolverine gameplay</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQXgLjwdM98" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sQXgLjwdM98" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Wolverine isn't the kind of hero who wins a fight with quips and hugs, and naturally, Insomniac wants to create an experience <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-trailer-reveals-2026-release-window-and-very-bloody-gameplay/1100-6532076/" data-ref-id="1100-6532076">that feels fast and ferocious</a>. The studio says its aiming to create "the ultimate Wolverine fantasy" and enhance that vicious combat with action-packed set pieces and a gripping story. The first gameplay trailer hinted at this savage side of Wolverine, as the X-Man was using his adamantium claws to impale enemies, rip them apart, and brutally dismember them.</p><p>As for the tone of the game, Insomniac is aiming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-will-be-full-sized-and-mature-in-tone/1100-6496210/">deliver a mature experience</a>, which is fitting considering Wolverine's nature as a walking weapon. Insomniac's recent games have also been showcases of slick action, so there's a good chance that the studio will deliver some cutting-edge gameplay with Wolverine that's balanced by the developer's ability to dig deep into the emotional core of its characters.</p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_story">Marvel's Wolverine story</h2><p>Insomniac isn't sharing too many details on what the storyline for Marvel's Wolverine will be, but the studio did tease that it will be original take on the character to uncover the secrets of a dark past that has eluded him. </p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_actor">Marvel's Wolverine actor</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6cSbKIwGWQ" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P6cSbKIwGWQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To bring Logan to life, Insomniac recruited Australian actor Liam McIntyre to voice the character and provide motion capture for him. McIntyre has a long list of acting credits, and he's best known for playing the lead role of Spartacus in the TV series Spartacus: Vengeance. He also has extensive voice-acting experience, having voiced characters like Captain Boomerang and Aquaman in several DC animated films.</p><p>"Fans out there know what Wolverine is, who he is," McIntyre said in a dev diary video. "My job is to try to find the essence of who Wolverine is--especially as to how it applies to our story.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>It’s Monster Hunter mania at this year’s Tokyo Game Show, with Capcom giving over a huge amount of floorspace to every version of Monster Hunter currently out there, from the mainline Wilds and crossover events in Final Fantasy XIV, through to the upcoming mobile title <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/monster-hunter-outlanders-preview-what-if-this-is-the-best-monster-hunter-of-2025/">Monster Hunter Outlanders</a>. The next big release for the franchise, though, is Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection - Release Date Trailer | TGS 2025 Extended Cut" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gkJ1qtTPRZE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The third entry in the turn-based RPG spin-off turns monsters, or Monsties, into rideable pals, fusing Pokémon-style collecting with a slower-paced take on Monster Hunter’s inimitable style and genre-defining combat. It’s a spin-off that’s earned plenty of accolades, and with Stories 3 it looks as though Capcom have created the best entry yet.</p>


<p>So much of the game’s appeal stems from its visuals. The anime-inspired art direction is effortlessly appealing, and here it feels closer than ever to Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Breath of the Wild</a>. That’s no bad thing, and when it’s combined with the unique armour designs and iconic creatures of the Monster Hunter universe, you’ve got one of the best-looking anime-style games in recent memory.</p>


<p>As a JRPG, there’s a far greater focus on storytelling than you’ll find in the mainline series, and that means more conversation, more world-building, and more characterisation. Luckily for us, we got to experience a good portion of the game during our hands-on at TGS. You’re Captain Leo, a prince of the kingdom who’s sworn to lead a group known as the Raiders. Alongside Simon, rookie Thea and Felyne pal Rudy, you set out to find the truth in a foreboding prophecy, in a world where various species are going extinct, and the kingdom is on the brink of war.</p>
<p>We got to play the demo build on Switch 2 in handheld mode, and I was initially concerned whether Capcom had been able to iron out the performance issues that plagued Monster Hunter Stories 2 on the original Switch. Thankfully, it seems that frame rate issues have been hunted into extinction, though I think it’s running at a more modest 30fps rather than the PS5’s 60fps. Still, for a turn-based game, that makes very little difference, and the exploration felt smooth and issue-free. Oddly, the only place where I thought I caught a couple of stutters was during cutscenes, but with these outside gameplay, and kinks should be ironed out before launch in March next year.</p>
<p>Three games in, the fundamental combat system remains in place, with you and your Monstie fighting alongside a companion and their creature. There’s three different types of basic attack, with Power, Technical and Speed attacks each holding sway over one other. If you end up in a head-to-head and you’ve picked the more powerful attack, then you’ll cause extra damage, and avoid taking any yourself, though if you get it wrong, you’ll be punished accordingly. It promotes learning each monster’s attacks and weaknesses, and it’s a clever way to bring across a facet of the mainline games.</p>

<p>It doesn’t stop there. As you fight, you build up Kinship with your Monstie. You do that just by fighting alongside each other, but you can amp it up with Double Attacks, where you and your monster have chosen the same type of attack. Once you’ve charged your Kinship, you can leap onto your monster pal and then unleash a Kinship attack that’s both graphically rewarding and massively damaging. Fundamentally, that’s the core loop of battle.</p>
<p>The demo featured a small selection of easily recognisable monsters, starting with the fodder of Velociprey, before increasing the difficulty with the Velocidrome and a Paolumu. Through the demo you saw the importance of focusing on attack types, and working with your Monstie in order to dish out the most damage.</p>
<p>The close of the demo showcased the final form of that, with you facing off against a Feral Chatacabra. Feral creatures have been afflicted by some kind of growth – haven’t they always? – and you have to think through which part of the animal to attack, and when.</p>
<p>Choosing the wrong time and the wrong part results in a vicious counterattack, so you have to bide your time before trying to remove the growth from its back. In the meantime, it covers its forearms in a different substance, and if you then aim for those limbs, you can topple it over, giving you and your teammate the chance to unleash a Synchro Rush, once again hammering it and its health bar.</p>
<p>Whether the additions to the turn-based combat make all that much difference remains to be seen, and in some ways, it’s just kicking the can a little further down the road. I do hope that the overall difficulty is a little higher than the previous games, or that there’s the option to make it more challenging from the off, so that veterans and turn-based fans can really get the most out of it. That said, it does exactly what you want, which is give you more Monster Hunter Stories.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is the obvious next step for the series. That’s taking the graphics and the turn-based action up a notch, while expanding the world of Monster Hunter into newfound territory. The previous two games have given fans a totally different take on the mythology and magic of the series’ iconic creatures, and on early impressions alone, Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection looks as though it’s going to carry on that tradition.</p>

<p>We're zwei-back</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/panzer_dragoon_zwei_remake">Panzer Dragoon Zwei: Remake</a> is alive and well, and currently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/panzer-dragoon-zwei-remake-resurfaces-will-be-playable-at-tgs-2025">playable at Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>. And while the press (and eventually public) are going hands-on with the game, publisher Forever Entertainment has shared the gameplay footage for the upcoming remake for the first time.</p>
<p>That's... kind of amazing, given that Zwei: Remake was announced back in 2018. Forever Entertainment has basically been radio silent on it since then, though <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/panzer_dragoon_remake">Panzer Dragoon: Remake</a> and various <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission Remakes</a> have been released since then.</p>
<p>Anyway, for those who have played the 1996 Sega Saturn rail shooter <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/saturn/panzer_dragoon_ii_zwei">Panzer Dragoon II Zwei</a>, things will look pretty familiar, though everything has been given a new lick of paint.</p>
<p>The footage is all from Episode 2, the name of the second stage of the game, featuring combat mostly from the ground (there is plenty of flying in game, so don't worry).</p>

<p>Some comments on the video do share some concerns, such as the size of the dragon's wings and the design of the boss at the end. And Forever Entertainment doesn't exactly have the best track-record, with the first game's remake getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/panzer_dragoon_remake">an average review from us</a>. Still, we're glad this sequel is still kicking and we hope to see more of it very soon.</p>
<p>Panzer Dragoon Zwei: Remake is coming to Switch at some point — there's no release date yet, but we'll be sure to tell you all about it as soon as we know.</p>

Then oh boy, does Xiaomi have the phone for you.</p><p>Today it announced its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785693/xiaomi-17-pro-max-china-launch-specs-price-second-screen">flagship 17 series phones</a> in China, led by the 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max (any naming similarity to Apple is resolutely <a href="https://weibo.com/1892653244/Q4EeinmG4"><em>not</em> a coincidence</a>). Those two Pro models mostly stand out for the inclusion of a second screen on the back, which stretches across the wide camera island. It can be used to frame selfies, set timers, and control music playback, but all I can think about is Xiaomi’s official accessory to convert the phone into a ratchet Game Boy.</p><p>The ¥299 (about $40) Retro Handheld Console Case includes four face buttons, a circular D-pad that looks more like an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/21/18105423/ipod-click-wheel-button-music-control-hardware-design">iPod Click Wheel</a> than anything else, and a 200mAh battery that Xiaomi says should deliver 40 days of gameplay, at three hours a day. It even comes with <em>Angry Birds 2</em>.</p><p>The sole downside — apart from what I can only assume is an incredibly awkward, cramped gaming experience ruined by the two lenses on the screen — is that you can’t use the phone’s wireless charging while the case is in place.</p><p>No word yet on if, or when, the 17 Pro phones will launch in Europe or anywhere else outside China, but let’s hope the retro case comes with them when they do. Maybe this is a sign that the mad scientists in Xiaomi’s accessory lab are cooking up something even weirder for the fourth-generation <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/622432/xiaomis-new-photography-kit-is-really-really-red">photography case</a> for next year’s 17 Ultra.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785720/xiaomi-retro-handheld-phone-case-17-pro-gaming#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTI1"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Dominic Preston</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/785720/xiaomi-retro-handheld-phone-case-17-pro-gaming]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Good morning and good day. I’m very busy right now, so let’s not waste any time and get right to today’s news. Welcome to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily roundup of news and other stuff you might care about. This time we’ve got info on a big <em>FBC</em> update, news on multiplayer in the <em>MGS3 </em>remake, and some other stuff, but I’m very busy and…yeah, okay, cool. Bye.</p> <h2><strong>Remedy is trying again to relaunch its failed co-op shooter</strong></h2> <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/fbc-firebreak-remedy-co-op-fomo-live-service-preview-1851771133">FBC: Firebreak</a>,</em> Remedy’s co-op shooter released earlier this year, hasn’t been a big hit for the studio. While I enjoyed it for a few days, the game failed to hook me due to finicky menus, frustrating progression issues, and other complications that made it hard to enjoy with friends. Since launch, Remedy has spent a lot of time fixing and improving the game. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/530984095140809426">Now, as announced in a Steam post on September 25</a>, the studio is releasing a massive free content update that will change <em>FBC</em> in some big ways.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:4nci4ly3xu3nau7hzr373bte/app.bsky.feed.post/3lznz3jf2wo2y" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreialowfft3zs2hlowkpcwh6mttkp6u4rh2fmwzw4ujmspttjwsqtqe"> <p>Our 1st free Major Update to FBC: Firebreak launches on September 29th. Breakpoint brings with it systemic overhauls, new content, and quality-of-life improvements. </p> <p>Read our latest blog post for all the details (it's a big one): https://bit.ly/BreakpointFBCFirebreak </p> <p>#FBCFirebreak</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4nci4ly3xu3nau7hzr373bte?ref_src=embed">Remedy Entertainment (@remedygames.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:4nci4ly3xu3nau7hzr373bte/post/3lznz3jf2wo2y?ref_src=embed">2025-09-25T13:01:03.362358702Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>The new update, named “Breakpoint,” is launching on all platforms on September 29. Perhaps the biggest change in this new update is the removal of the Job Board. It’s being replaced with a Crisis Board that fills up with randomly generated missions with various modifiers. The idea is to make <em>FBC</em> more replayable, surprising, and chaotic. To help with that, Remedy is also adding more variety to missions, new weapons, and fresh enemies to kill or be killed by. I’m also excited about the changes to progression, which will simplify some parts, making it easier to get cool guns and have fun, but will also add more customization options for weapons as players spend more time completing missions.</p>

 <p>“We have taken a lot of feedback to heart,” explained the studio. “Over the summer, we have worked hard on releasing updates to the game. Still, Breakpoint is only the first major step, we know we need a few more<b>,&nbsp;</b>bringing significant improvements and new systems, as well as content, into the game, incorporating community feedback alongside our own ideas.” The team also thanked players for “sticking” around as it essentially redevelops <em>FBC</em> post-launch. I hope it all works out, and I’m excited to hop back in to the new <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> as we enter spooky season.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Payday 2</em> is getting a subscription service for all its DLC</strong></h2> <p>Did you know that 2013’s<em> Payday 2,</em> a co-op heist shooter, has over 60 pieces of DLC? That’s wild, huh? The game has so much DLC that developer Starbreeze is now offering people a monthly subscription service that grants them access to all of it. The new sub comes in two flavors: $4.99 a month or $19.99 for six months. It’s not a horrible deal, and for new players or folks just wanting to play with friends who might own everything, it’s a fine option.</p>

 <p>But many players aren’t happy that, alongside this subscription launch, the studio has increased the price for a bundle that includes all the DLC. Previously, buying all the DLC cost around $135. Now it’s marked up to $170. Yikes! <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/payday-2/subscription-service">Starbreeze tells <em>PCGamesn</em></a> that the price increase is “completely unrelated” to the subscription service. Sure! Regardless, it’s left a bad taste in many mouths and is likely to make folks assume the new sub is just a way to squeeze more money out of folks not willing to pay $170+ for all the DLC.</p>

 <h2><strong>Nintendo just released a new <em>Fire Emblem</em> game, but…</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250925.html">So a new<em> Fire Emblem</em> game was shadow-dropped overnight on September 24.</a> That should be exciting. However, people who have downloaded and played <em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em> have discovered it’s a not-so-great <em>Among Us</em>-like free-to-play social deduction game. That’s not what a lot of<em> Fire Emblem</em> fans wanted, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marioprime.bsky.social/post/3lzmpnsogls2i">early impressions are bad</a>, with some people reporting that the game feels extremely underbaked and barebones. But don’t worry, there’s a battle pass and plenty of ways to spend money.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>MGS Delta’</em>s multiplayer mode is launching next month</strong></h2> <p>On September 25, as part of Tokyo Games Show, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-online-multiplayer-mode-fox-hunt-has-a-release-date-fresh-update-out-now">Konami announced</a> that the multiplayer mode for its recently released <em>MGS3</em> remake will launch on October 30. It will be part of a bigger free update arriving for <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> next month.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">The cat-and-mouse online PVP stealth mode will support up to 12 players across all platforms and is arriving about two months after<em> MGS Delta: Snake Eater</em> launched to mostly positive reviews. It doesn’t seem anything like my beloved <em>Metal Gear Solid Online,</em> but it could be fun, I guess.</p> <h2><strong><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>‘s beta will include Zombies content</strong></h2>  <p>For the first time in the franchise’s long history, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-zombies-deep-dive">the next <em>Call of Duty</em> game’s beta will include some Zombies content</a>. Players will be able to check out a small survival map and mode in the upcoming October beta, as well as standard multiplayer action, too. <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-deep-dive">The beta starts on October 2 on all platforms.&nbsp;</a></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258">Here’s everything Sony showed off at yesterday’s State of Play</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-ii-the-kotaku-review-2000628064">Read our <em>Hades 2</em> review</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-last-gen-player-count-ps4-not-holding-black-ops-7-back-2000628253"><em>Call of Duty</em> devs say last-gen isn’t holding the series back</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This</h2>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-yotei-review.1308828/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sequels are opportunities to either build upon a predecessor and push boundaries, or refine what was already great and deliver <em>that </em>again with a stronger focus. With Ghost of Yotei, developer Sucker Punch leaned heavily into the latter approach, and the result is more captivating open-world action and unbelievably striking visuals at every turn. It doesn't try to revolutionize things, sticking pretty close to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-review">2020's Ghost of Tsushima</a> in general, but I don’t necessarily mind when that means it can expand in aspects that matter and offer a tighter distillation of the samurai fantasy that was originally promised. Not many games in recent memory can hang their hat on having combat as fluid and satisfying as this, and it's packed into a revenge tale that makes for a more human story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming off of Tsushima, the novelty of imitating filmmaker Akira Kurosawa may have worn off a bit, but the cinematic stylings of his samurai classics still effectively seep into Ghost of Yotei's look and vibe. Whether it be the cinematography of cutscenes, the standoff before a duel, or the letterboxed framing of riding horseback across the gorgeous fields of Ezo (which is modern-day Hokkaido, home of Mount Yotei), it had me mashing the screenshot button and frequently pulling up photo mode (conveniently mapped to the D-pad). We've seen technically impressive worlds across Sony's other PS4 and PS5 games in recent years, but it's the artistic flourishes and intentional environmental effects that elevate Ezo's lush plains, snow-covered mountains, and vibrant forests – it's a sort of biodiversity Tsushima didn't entirely have.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The picturesque vistas and dense flower fields lend Yotei its own identity, but it's the new lead character, Atsu, who gives the wandering samurai tale a more enticing edge as well. It's a story far less concerned about the romanticized idea of the samurai and instead focuses on the lengths one would go to exact their justice. Tsushima's protagonist, Jin, was just fine for the purpose of its story, yet he wasn't a particularly interesting lead on his own. Moving to Atsu who's fiery and brash gives Yotei the kind of personality it needs. Actor Erika Ishii lends their likeness and voice (if you play with English audio) to Atsu and brings something that's more rough around the edges for a more believable character. She's stubborn and has trouble seeing beyond bloodlust, sometimes frustratingly so, and the ways the world and people around her push back on her kept me curious enough to see things through.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this revolves around a fairly by-the-numbers revenge plot, where Atsu seeks to take down the Yotei Six led by an equally vengeful villain, Lord Saito. They're a group of outlaw samurai who killed her family when she was young along their path to becoming the de facto leaders of Ezo by force. (If you played Assassin's Creed Shadows from earlier this year, you may notice Yotei closely mirrors the story of Naoe, one of its two protagonists.) While they don't have much screentime and aren't really nuanced characters, they're easy to hate, making vengeance pretty sweet. In its roughly 30-hour journey, a large majority of the story unfolds in predictable fashion, and gives you the runaround more often than I'd like. Multiple times events build up to a big moment, only for the target to conveniently escape in a cutscene without much of the plot moving forward or evolving.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's a story far less concerned about the romanticized idea of the samurai.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not to say it doesn't have its moments, however. A couple of clever twists in a middle chapter show signs of brilliance, and some bittersweet scenes throughout had me emotionally invested in ways I didn't expect. Atsu has a few companions on her journey, like Oyuki who is one of the standouts and adds a little depth with her wisdom and contrasting perspective on the revenge motif. So is Atsu's mom, who brings texture to Yotei's themes of music and family being tied together, as you see through childhood flashbacks that flesh out their past. But when it came time for Atsu to square up against one of her targets, I couldn't help but grin, sit forward for the fight, and sense that intensity of dealing a final blow. Although I wish it took more creative swings with its storytelling, it is a strong-enough vehicle to carry you through what it does best.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And what Ghost of Yotei does best is combat – very few open-world games compel me to clear out optional content across the map just for the sake of starting fights. Movement has an unmistakable fluidity, as does the flow of each attack, ability, and parry, yet each weapon carries a certain weight that makes landing hits and those impact frames so satisfying. Without a lock-on mechanic, encounters feel natural at the expense of frustrating mishaps with the targeting system. But because you're given so many tools, being able to weave them into your rotation or use them at opportune times keeps each fight consistently exciting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whereas Jin had stances with his katana in Tsushima to counteract the different enemy types, Atsu carries multiple weapon-types of her own. She's skilled with the sword, but relies on a chained sickle, spear, and dual-katana setup, as well as a hulking odachi blade for heavy units. This creates a rock-paper-scissors dynamic against enemies – with the right weapon, you can inflict more stagger or bypass some of their defensive techniques, letting you cut through them with greater efficiency. All of these weapons control distinctly, especially with the kusarigama being a highlight since it lets you break shields, swing it around for crowd control, and even assassinate enemies from a distance by yanking them towards you like Scorpion from Mortal Kombat. Weapon-switching is smooth and fast so it's not as much of a pain as it may sound, and mastering the cadence of combat makes me feel (and Atsu look) like a badass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The role of projectiles has also expanded with the advent of firearms during this time period (Yotei takes place X years after Tsushima). So, not only does Atsu not give a damn about honor, she also has no qualms about letting her chopper sing (well, musket or flintlock pistol). Sure, the musket takes forever to reload, but landing a shot comes with an emphatic punch that pierces through armored foes, and the flintlock pistol is handy for staggering or finishing off enemies at point blank; man does it make me miss Bloodborne. Then there's smoke bombs and metsubushi dust to obscure enemy vision, and a flame attachment that temporarily sets your blades ablaze, all of which are effective in their own right. This is all to say that you have a lot to juggle and no shortage of options for overcoming Yotei's challenges whether it be an entire camp's battalion or a high-stakes one-on-one.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Few games in recent memory have combat as fluid and satisfying as this.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Stealth is still a prominent part of the mix, but largely relies on basic mechanics we've seen time and again in these kinds of action games. Tall grass and enemies with their backs conveniently turned and no vertical vision; we know the deal. I won't deny that an aerial assassination or triple-kill chain feels great in the moment, though, and let me shout out the kusarigama ranged assassination one more time. Broadly speaking, there's seemingly a lighter emphasis on stealth than we saw in Tsushima, and Yotei never really pushes you hard in that direction – if you get caught, then you just fight, like…<em>oh no, I have to engage in combat, the best part of this game! What a shame!</em> I found that teeing up as many stealth kills as possible before going loud to be the most enjoyable way to play, and it seems like Sucker Punch understood how to make that approach work well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yotei's main questline does hit you with a handful of large-scale battles to drive a sense of scale, but feature plenty of duels are spread throughout its world, packaged as deadly boss fights where you're chipping away at their stagger meter and health. Here, mastering the timing of parrying and dodging is of utmost importance, and even though they play out quite similarly, I still got a kick out of connecting on multiple parries in succession (lest I get one-tapped myself). Parrying and countering is one of the great joys in games, and Yotei delivers wonderfully – I see that blue glint, I lock in. So much so that I almost exclusively played with the Bounty Master armor equipped, which disables normal parries to slightly increase the perfect parry timing window. And it was worth the high-risk and high reward because nothing is cooler in this series than flawlessly deflecting an attack and slicing an enemy Bushido Blade-style. Standoffs are back, letting you go mano-a-mano to kill an enemy (or two or three) in a timing-based Iai sword swipe before going all-out on the rest of your foes; it's another way Yotei (like Tsushima before it) adds a satisfying variety to combat.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Michael Higham's 10 Favorite Open World Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It was smart for both entries in this series to do away with level-based experience points and relegating progression, relying more heavily on teaching us to improve our own skills and understanding of our toolset. Progress in Atsu’s skill trees is tied to finding shrines, many of which are optional, making its open-world activities more meaningful. Unlocking charms for genuinely effective perks, getting new armor sets that emphasize specific gameplay mechanics, collecting cosmetics, and improving weapon efficacy are mostly woven into sidequests, and thankfully they often don't feel like throwaway objectives to check off of a list. Some of Yotei's more interesting skills and techniques are found deeper in these skill trees, and it's a bit of a double-edged sword – part of me was somewhat irked at how much Yotei relies on optional quests for progression, but ultimately, it's a smart move.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A few surprising turns in these quests thrust you into tough duels and chaotic battles, ushering you through more of the map than you probably would have seen otherwise. While this works mostly because Yotei's fundamentals are solid, there are also enjoyable little stories along the way, like supernatural mysteries to solve, elusive outlaws to chase, and even a superboss that took me well over an hour and countless retries to defeat. A few cultural nods that show a bit more appreciation for the region and its history. With the latter, I'm talking specifically about the inclusion of the indigenous Ainu people who are from what is now known as Hokkaido. Some of their traditions are celebrated in a way that is a natural extension of what Yotei does in certain parts of its story.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Tsushima, Yotei's map is built with a veneer of discoverability, finding ways to nudge you in certain directions without plastering waypoints or markers on screen. The wind navigation mechanic is back where swiping up on the touch pad visualizes a wind gust toward your active objective. I also appreciate how songs Atsu learns on the shamisen, that you can play at any moment to guide you to finding collectibles or hot springs to boost health, create a little extra thematic coherence through music as well as a way for completionists to do their thing. Although the activities themselves may still feel formulaic after a while, especially ones where you're exclusively doing Uncharted-style platforming and rockclimbing, at least there has been an effort to dress them up organically as the map expands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone generally burnt out on traditionally structured open world games, I appreciate the way Yotei expresses just enough restraint with its separate zones while maintaining the impression of a gigantic map. And letting the vibe carry you from one thing to the next doesn't feel at odds as this is Atsu's path of vengeance that mostly works on her terms. With aesthetic options like the returning Kurosawa mode that turns everything black and white with Japanese audio, or new modes like the Takashi Miike option that ups the blood and gore by 1000% and the Samurai Champloo-esque Watanabe mode that turns on the lo-fi beats, Ghost of Yotei has several nice touches atop its penchant for spectacle.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">A predictable but well-executed story takes you through Ghost of Yotei's gorgeous landscapes and satisfying, fluid action combat. With a strong lead in Atsu as a vigilante who does not care about honor in her quest for revenge, you get a stronger lead character and an expanded weapon-set that elevates the gameplay principles set by Tsushima. Although the novelty has lost a bit of its sheen, the Kurosawa influence is still strong and used to great effect. So while it may not be transforming open world games, Ghost of Yotei is a great refinement of the samurai power fantasy.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-review]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has revealed a new Fire Emblem game available now for smartphones, which includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a>-style social deduction.</p>
<p>Called <a href="https://shadows.nintendo.com/en-GB/index.html">Fire Emblem Shadows</a>, it has three players battling enemies - but one is a traitor. Afterwards, players vote on who they think the traitor is, before battling each other.</p>
<p>And honestly? It's absolute rubbish.</p>

<p>Fire Emblem games are known for their tactical strategy, but Shadows is simply a grid-based auto-battler where you character moves and attacks automatically. You then select from a handful of moves that regenerate on cooldowns to either heal or activate different magical attacks.</p>
<p>And that, really, is the extent of gameplay. There's little interaction, barely any strategy. It's just watching little chibi characters hit each other. You can win without selecting anything.</p>
<p>Then there's the touted social deduction, which boils down to which of the other players may have <em>accidentally </em>on purpose hit you. It's usually pretty obvious, but worse is the fact there is barely any consequence for guessing either way. The second round proceeds accordingly, with good players now battling evil, and if you previously guessed correctly you get a piddly amount of extra health.</p><p>The reason Among Us worked and popularised social deduction is being able to actually speak to people and screw over your friends. Here you're matched with random players online with no form of communication. You just select another player and move on to the battle without really caring.</p>
<p>On top of all that is the usual gacha nonsense for a free-to-play game. There's a season pass, multiple currencies, various weapons and abilities to attach to characters, and new characters to unlock. I spotted another player as a cute little Dimitri from Three Houses, but I have neither the cash or the will to find out how to unlock him.</p>
<p>I was excited to try out a new Fire Emblem, even if it is on mobile, but its deception-based gameplay is fundamentally flawed and shallow.</p>
<p>If you want to try it out, it's available now for free across iOS and Google Play.</p>
<p>But really, just hold out for the next mainline entry in the series - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reveals-new-fire-emblem-game-coming-to-switch-2">Fire Emblem Fortune's Weave was revealed at Nintendo's recent Direct</a> and will come to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> next year.</p>

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision is rumored to launch in Europe before the end of the month, retaining the price of the currently available model.</p>



<p>In a new report shared today on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-nouvelle-version-de-la-ps5-pro-arriverait-bientot-voici-ce-que-lon-croit-en-savoir-60579">Dealabs</a> by billbil-kun, who has proven time and time again to be extremely reliable regarding new video games and hardware launches, it is claimed that a new hardware CFI-7121 hardware revision discovered via Japanese certification documents is in the works and set to be launched in Europe on September 30. The changes to this new hardware revision are expected to be limited to better energy efficiency, so there won't be any change to the console's design nor to the system's SSD capacity, which will remain at 2 TB as in the current model. It is also claimed the new hardware revision system will retain the current €799.99 price tag. A launch in North America is uncertain at the time.</p>



<p>Although the new PlayStation 5 Pro hardware revision has yet to be confirmed officially, given billbil-kun's excellent track record and the listing of the new revision in the same certification documents that confirmed the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-digital-edition-hardware-revision-smaller-ssd-price/">existance of the base model Digital Edition CFI-2000 revision</a>, which indeed launched in Europe this week, there's a high probability the system is indeed launching in the region in a few days. </p>



<p>This time around, however, there should be no need to rush to purchase the current PS5 Pro model, as storage will not be reduced as a not-so-subtle way to avoid raising the system's price, which is already high compared to every other current-generation system.</p>



<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has plenty to offer over the base PlayStation 5 models, including support for the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, which will <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-amd-fsr-first-quarter-2026/">improve next year</a>. You can learn more about what the system exactly offers by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">checking out Kai's review</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update-hopes-to-turn-the-games-fortunes-around-next-week.1308768/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has officially unveiled&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>'s Breakpoint update, and it comes complete with a ton of seismic changes to the first-person shooter, although whether they can turn its fortunes around remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Back in July, Remedy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-whats-next" rel="nofollow">promised</a> that it would release&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>'s first big update in September, and the studio has made good on that promise; Breakpoint launches on September 29th (that's this coming Monday at time of writing).</p>

<p>According to Remedy, Breakpoint is "packed with systemic overhauls, new content, and quality-of-life improvements" with a view towards making&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>"more fun, varied, and rewarding to play".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update-monster.jpg?itok=xXi0Afvl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update-monster.jpg?itok=CdHCAshj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>FBC: Firebreak</em>'s Breakpoint update aims to turn the game's fortunes around on Monday.</figcaption></figure><p>Breakpoint's first big addition to&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is the Crisis Board, which will replace the Job Board and offer "curated playable content" in order to make the shooter "feel more dynamic, less predictable, and closer to the first-responder fantasy" Remedy intends.</p>

<p>The Crisis Board will show you situations emerging around the Oldest House, and you'll be expected to respond to them; after all, Remedy says, you should be "reacting to dynamic, unpredictable dangers" rather than "being asked to create danger for yourself".</p>

<p>You can also expect a brand new tutorial mission by the name of Orientation, which will be "accompanied by onboarding improvements across the game", so if you felt a bit lost when you jumped into&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, this should hopefully improve that experience.</p>

<p>There are a ton of other huge changes coming to&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>as part of this update as well, so if you want to know everything that's changing, be sure to check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/530984095140809426" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full announcement right here</a>.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, it's a multiplayer-oriented first-person shooter set in&nbsp;<em>Control</em>'s Oldest House. You play a member of the titular Firebreak team, and it's your job to contain a range of bizarre supernatural threats within the Federal Bureau of Control.</p>

<p>The game launched back in June to a mixed reception, and player numbers have dwindled significantly since launch according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> (although&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is also available on both PS Plus and Game Pass, for which I don't have player data).</p>

<p>Remedy itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-fbc-firebreak-launch-sales-financials" rel="nofollow">admitted back in August</a> that launch sales of&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>had been disappointing, but the studio described the game as having a "solid" foundation and expressed optimism that it could turn the shooter's fortunes around. Breakpoint is, presumably, the first step in that effort.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/fbc-firebreak/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fbc-firebreak/9PDCN8Z4HKRN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's available as part of certain tiers of PS Plus and Game Pass as well. Make sure to give our Luis' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fbc-firebreak-review-trouble-in-old-house" rel="nofollow">review of the game</a> a read too!</p>

            <p>A year on from its debut, would-be challenger to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civ</a>'s 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> throne <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a> has gotten what looks like its most substantial overhaul yet. So substantial that its developers are hailing this Revolutions update as the arrival of Ara version 2.0, in the same tone of voice you might use for someone who's gotten a swanky new hairdo.</p>
<p>While the base version had a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ara-history-untold-review">fair few hangups</a>, the Xbox folks who're keen to see Ara stand the test of time have pushed plenty of updates and tweaks for it since then. Current developers Stardock Entertainment and Oxide Games, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ara-history-untold-gets-a-beefy-update-that-promises-significant-micromanagement-reduction-and-more-competent-ai-not-civs">aimed to wipe out a number of the biggest gripes earlier this year</a>, and this latest update aims for plenty of further refinement.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As detailed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2021880/view/518598560814465237?l=english">Steam post</a>, the update introduces the likes of new culture and influence systems designed to provide an alternative to conquest as they do in Civ, unique historical units for every civilisation, and another unit that's just really annoying. No, seriously, at the end of the Renaissance you can now unlock an "agitator unit" that can be deployed to sow rebellion in other nations and engage in a bit of ideological subversion. We'll see if they're just a slightly less Bondy version of Civ's spies, but colour me intrigued.</p>
<p>Beyond that, leaders have been revamped with "with unique mechanics, traits, and abilities", there's a new priority and quota crafting system to ditch some of the micromanagement that's long plagued Ara, and the AI's been improved with a view to making more realistic moves. The interface, map generation and performance have also been tweaked as part of the update, to round out its main bits.</p>
<p>It certainly looks like a big enough overhaul to make it worth dipping your toe back in if you've previously bounced off of Ara, even if just for a brief fling ahead of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-dev-explains-how-the-revamped-4x-map-generator-bolts-together-continents-from-voronoi-diagrams">Civ 7's next update</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker’s 8-in-1 Charging Station Is Less Than 1 Inch Thick and Now Within $1 of Its Black Friday Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-8-in-1-charging-station-is-less-than-1-inch-thick-and-now-within-1-of-its-black-friday-low-2000628715</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-8-in-1-charging-station-is-less-than-1-inch-thick-and-now-within-1-of-its-black-friday-low.1308753/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It used to be easy to pick out the most powerful charging stations and power strips. Simply put, bigger was better: The bigger the device, the more plugs it contained; the more plugs it contained, the more power it delivered. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4302/">Anker’s set that old-school thinking on its ear with their Prime Charging Station, which is just $100 right now thanks to a 33% limited-time deal at Amazon.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>The Anker Prime Charging Station is definitely not bigger, but it’s definitely better than any of those bulky power strips or charging blocks. With 240 watts of power delivered across 8 outputs that somehow fit in an ultra-compact device that measures 3 x 5.4 inches around and — amazingly — only 0.7 inches thick, it can charge all of your devices while taking up next to no space.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4302/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Universal Appeal</h2>
<p>The 8 outputs built into the Anker Prime Charging Station cover the full gamut of charging options to cover all of your devices, from your laptop to your wireless earbuds or other small portable tech. There are 2 AC outlets which can pop up or sit level with the charger, 4 USB-C ports, and 2 USB-A ports. Each USB-C port can carry 140W of output, enough juice to take a 16-inch MacBook Pro from completely dead to 53% charged in just 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Even when all six USB ports are used at once, the total output of 237W will quickly and safely charge your devices, and that’s while both AC outlets are also in use. The LED screen at the top of the Anker Prime Charging Station shows you the vital charging statistics, including a countdown timer and if any charging errors occur. The Anker app also shows you those statistics from anywhere and more, and also allows you to fully control the charging station, including creating charging schedules.</p>



<h2>Take It To Go</h2>
<p>The Anker Prime Charging Station comes with a 5-foot AC power cord, giving you enough slack to place the charging station in your ideal location. It also makes it a great travel charger, especially since the power cord is detachable for easier storage and transport. As with most of Anker’s high-end chargers, the Prime Charging Station comes with ActiveShield 3.0 and PowerIQ 4.0 technology to protect both the charging station and all of your devices from surges, overheating, and other electrical hazards.</p>
<p>Upgrading and downsizing are the same thing when you switch from an outdated power strip or oversized charging station to the Anker Prime Charging Station. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4302/">It’s just $100 right now at Amazon for a limited time.</a></p>
