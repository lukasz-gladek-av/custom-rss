			<p>Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NjgzNDY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzU3NDM5NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMVoyQTRHUTdMRlEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.iGoAomXADlAaCsr4KgsTEy8oHTbv4k9XTSl7NVtRZXo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> that the Perfect Dark remake was nearly saved before a deal between Microsoft and Take-Two fell through, <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs-tomb-raider-unaffected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leading to the recent round of layoffs for developer Crystal Dynamics</a>.</p>



<p>Schreier's sources reveal that, following the cancellation of the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in early July alongside the closure of The Initiative, key people at The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics (which had been helping on the Perfect Dark project) tried to seek funding from another publisher. The most interested was Take-Two, which was looking to purchase the game rights from Microsoft. However, the agreement failed because the two companies could not find common ground on the IP's long-term ownership, which, therefore, remains with Microsoft. </p>



<p>This also means there's no chance of seeing this Perfect Dark project ever come to fruition. Originally announced at The Game Awards 2020, the project could not be developed by The Initiative alone. In September 2021, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-being-available-for-perfect-dark-was-too-precious-of-a-resource-to-pass-on-says-xgs-head/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the studio would partner with Crystal Dynamics for this remake. The Tomb Raider studio already had extensive experience with reboots, after all, and the founder of The Initiative (Darrell Gallagher) had worked at Crystal Dynamics for over a decade, supposedly making the collaboration even easier. </p>



<p>After three years, fans finally got a glimpse at the game in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-first-gameplay-footage-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay trailer distributed during the Xbox Games Showcase 2024</a>. The footage was promising, showing a tactical first-person shooter game with influences from stealth games and even immersive sims. It was also supposed to have a parkour-like movement system and in-depth environmental interaction. The plot saw Joanna Dark trying to uncover a conspiracy spearheaded by megacorporations that had stepped in to save the world following major ecological crises, only to use their deployment of advanced technology as cover for their own agendas. The likeness of Joanna Dark herself was crafted using real-life model Elissa Bibaud, while her performance capture featured Alix Wilton Regan (credited in Dragon Age: Inquisition, Assassin's Creed Origins, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, and The Elder Scrolls Online).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864"><em>Perfect Dark</em></a> was one of the most anticipated blockbusters in the first-party Xbox portfolio when it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531">suddenly canceled</a> earlier this summer amid mass cuts at Microsoft. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NjgzNDY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzU3NDM5NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMVoyQTRHUTdMRlEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.iGoAomXADlAaCsr4KgsTEy8oHTbv4k9XTSl7NVtRZXo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em>Bloomberg</em> now reports</a> there was briefly an attempt to find the troubled game a new publisher so that it could still come out.</p> <p>Unfortunately, those talks apparently fell through, at least in part due to disagreements over IP rights. The idea was that Embracer-owned Crystal Dynamics, which was co-developing the stealth shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732">with now defunct Xbox studio The Initiative</a>, would complete the project under a new publishing deal with Take-Two. The two companies reportedly came “close” to a deal but one of the things that ultimately sunk talks was disagreement over who would own the <em>Perfect Dark</em> franchise, which currently belongs to Microsoft, over the long term.</p> <p>If <em>Perfect Dark</em> had been a success, the IP rights would have become way more valuable overnight with the potential for sequels or TV and movie adaptations. But for that to happen it would have had to come out. How much will the IP be worth with no new game in over 15 years?</p>

 <p>This deal falling through is seemingly why Crystal Dynamics announced new layoffs last week. “This decision was not made lightly,” the studio <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/">posted on LinkedIn</a>. “It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market.”</p> <p>Microsoft has found a way to give some of the casualties of its mass layoffs a second lease on life. <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> maker Tango Gameworks briefly shutdown in 2024 before <a href="https://kotaku.com/tango-gameworks-hi-fi-rush-revive-shutdown-krafton-xbox-1851619190">being resurrected</a> later that year under South Korean publisher Krafton. It’s a shame the tech giant couldn’t find a way to make that happen for <em>Perfect Dar</em>k, both for fans but most of all for the people who were working on it.</p>

<p>Here in the year 2025, it's not every day that a classic gaming console from the 20th century becomes playable via emulation for the first time. But that's just what happened last week with <a href="https://ares-emu.net/news/ares-v146-released?ref=readonlymemo.com">the release of Ares v146</a> and its first-of-its-kind <a href="https://techdocs.exodusemulator.com/Console/PioneerLaserActive/Software.html#emulation">support for Mega LD titles designed for the Pioneer LaserActive</a>.</p>
<p>Even retro console superfans would be forgiven for not knowing about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaserActive">LaserActive</a>, a pricey LaserDisc player released in 1994 alongside swappable hardware modules that could add support for Sega Genesis and NEC TurboGrafx-16 games and controllers. Using those add-ons, you could also play <a href="https://segaretro.org/List_of_LaserActive_games">a handful of games specifically designed for the LaserActive format</a>, which combined game data and graphics with up to 60 minutes of full-screen, standard-definition analog video per side.</p>
<p>Mega-LD games (as the Genesis-compatible LaserActive titles were called) were, for the most part, super-sized versions of the types of games you'd find on early CD-ROM console of the era. That means a lot of edutainment titles, branching dungeon crawlers, <em>Dragon's Lair</em>-style animated quick-time event challenges, and rail shooters that overlayed standard Genesis or TG-16 graphics on top of elaborate animated video backgrounds (sometimes complete with filmed actors).</p>

<p>The LaserActive's sky-high prices ($970 for the base unit; $600 for console add-on modules; $120 for LaserDisc games in '90s dollars) and lack of must-have software made it a relative curiosity even among the many game console curiosities of the mid-1990s, with total sales across Japan and the US <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150211202811/http://www.pinkgorillagames.com/console_histories">estimated around 10,000 units</a>. Yet the obscure console has <a href="https://www.pcenginefans.com/forum/index.php?topic=10096.0">still developed a small cult following</a> of <a href="https://laseractive.wordpress.com/">fans</a> who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfHxPjD7PAc">seem to revel</a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamecollecting/comments/8wyesp/got_a_pioneer_laseractive_clda100_laserdisc/">tracking down the hard-to-find hardware and software</a> to play some of the few '90s console games that couldn't be enjoyed via emulation.</p>
<h2>“I really don't think it would be very hard to do”</h2>
<p>The new emulator, which has finally made the LaserActive accessible to the masses, was a long-time passion project from a coder going by the handle Nemesis. The excellent Read Only Memo newsletter has <a href="https://www.readonlymemo.com/this-is-the-first-the-16-year-odyssey-of-time-money-wrong-turns-and-frustration-it-took-to-finally-emulate-the-pioneer-laseractive/?ref=read-only-memo-newsletter">an excellent interview with Nemesis</a>, who spent over 15 years working on and off to intimately understand the inner workings of the LaserActive and apply that knowledge to an emulator.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>A Sega fan and collector since his youth and an emulator hobbyist since the early '00s, Nemesis tracked down his first LaserActive unit for $200 in 2004. By 2009, he was <a href="https://gendev.spritesmind.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=563&amp;ref=readonlymemo.com">publicly musing</a> about what might be needed to finally get emulation support working for the short-lived system. "I really don't think it would be very hard to do," Nemesis wrote in a forum thread at the time, in what would end up being a hilariously large understatement.</p>
<p>While monitoring memory registers and reverse-engineering the actual system logic of the LaserActive was relatively straightforward, getting the necessary game and video data from the Mega-LD discs was a massive undertaking. Nemesis explained that the only way to get at the crucial "table of contents" data (needed to make sense of everything else on the Mega-LD disc) was "solder[ing] a bunch of physical tapping wires into my Sega PAC-S10 module, and us[ing] a Saleae logic analyzer clone to do a streaming capture of the data lines."</p>
<p>Then there was the problem of capturing the massive amounts of analog video on a LaserActive disc in a lossless format suitable for emulation. Commercial analog capture cards that worked for standard LaserDisc movies proved unequal to the task, since they usually ignored the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_blanking_interval?ref=readonlymemo.com">VBI control data</a> that was hidden beyond the borders of the 480i CRT displays of the time. The lossy capture cards also often had trouble correctly interpreting the multiple streams of overlapping video data that could be arranged in nonstandard ways on a LaserActive disc.</p>

<p>"Rarely is the [LaserActive] player just playing back a video normally," Nemesis explained to Read Only Memo. "Games will often have completely different video footage per field, with only one shown, or skip over every second frame, to mix four or more video streams in the same area of the disc. Many games use this for seamless 'branching' such as whether you go left or right, and this can change constantly and seamlessly during playback."</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>By 2016, Nemesis had resorted to building his only video capture setup, tapping directly into his LaserActive hardware to get the raw video signal out. But he couldn't decode that raw footage into a usable format until years later, when community work on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDlbwl3f39Q">the Domesday Duplicator project</a> and Nemesis' own work on <a href="https://github.com/happycube/ld-decode">the open source ld-decode software</a> finally allowed lossless versions of full, uncut Mega-LD video to be captured digitally for the first time (albeit in a format that requires upwards of 28GB per game).</p>
<p>Once those Mega-LD discs were finally ripped successfully, Nemesis said getting the actual emulation working was surprisingly&nbsp;pain-free. "<em>Space Berserker</em> was quickly running, and after that, as more games finished decoding most of them worked on the first try, with no issues," Nemesis said. "Since I'd set out to emulate the complete hardware, with all its quirks and unusual features, whatever a game tried to do, it should just work."</p>

<p>Some might scoff at all this effort to emulate what Wired's Chris Kohler called "quite possibly the most poorly conceived and spectacularly useless game console ever created" <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/09/laseractive/">back in 2009</a>. Still, for gaming preservationists, the new emulator provides a valuable opportunity to study these gaming curiosities without having to track down rare physical hardware and software that's prone to age-related wear or disposal.</p>
<p>And even casual retro gaming fans may get a kick out of <a href="https://techdocs.exodusemulator.com/Console/PioneerLaserActive/Software.html#emulation">digging through the Mega LD library</a> and imagining an alternate reality version of the '90s where LaserDiscs, rather than CD-ROMs, offered gamers a very different take on the full-motion-video fad of the day.</p>

                <p>It's the end of the road for two 2K Sports titles, at least for their online services. The publisher has announced that the servers for two aging golf games--The Golf Club 2019 featuring PGA Tour and PGA Tour 2K21--will go offline on October 30, 2025.</p><p>As of August 30, however, 2K Sports removed the ability to purchase any virtual currency for either game. Beyond that, however, the publisher said players "won't see any effect."</p><p>On October 30, 2K will close the servers for both titles, meaning each game's store, along with all online game modes and functionality--including progression rewards--will no longer be available.</p><p>2K Sports informed players of these changes in an email.</p><p>The publisher did not provide a reason for why the servers are going offline, but it's not uncommon for online servers for older games to close down over time. The games feature official PGA Tour licensed content, so expiring contracts could be a factor as well.</p><p>Released in 2018, The Golf Club 2019 featuring PGA Tour was the first game in the series to feature the PGA Tour branding. There was no entry in the series in 2019, but the franchise came back in 2020 as PGA Tour 2K21.

                <p dir="ltr">There could be new content added to the Final Fantasy Tactics remake--and even a full-fledged sequel somewhere down the line--but that will require fans putting money where their mouths are with Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles. However, that's not a guarantee. </p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/final-fantasy-tactics-refresh/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired</a>, game director Kazutoyo Maehiro discussed possibly adding features from 2007's Final Fantasy Chronicles: War of the Lions release on PlayStation Portable to the remake. “Our first and foremost goal here really was to recreate the original game,” said Maehiro. He acknowledged fan feedback for that content, such as the Onion Knight and Black Knight classes, but "cannot make any promises" about them coming eventually to The Ivalice Chronicles.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The remake will introduce a new difficulty option called Squire, which is aimed at helping newcomers to the spinoff series and genre. In addition, The Ivalice Chronicles does utilize the script from War of the Lions for the classic version included with the remake. As for a proper sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics, that will depend on the game's reception and sales.</p><p dir="ltr">"If [The Ivalice Chronicles] were to become a success, I do feel that that would then lead to discussions around potentially bringing out sequels, for example, or newer tactical RPGs," said Maehiro, who served as events planner for the original Final Fantasy Tactics in 1997. Earlier this year, the original's art director talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ff-tactics-original-art-director-wanted-to-make-it-under-one-unusual-condition/1100-6532552/">becoming obsessed with Final Fantasy Tactics running at 60fps</a> on PlayStation.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-is-happening-trailer-and-release-date-announced-during-state-of-play/1100-6532075/">The Final Fantasy Tactics remake was announced</a> at the PlayStation State of Play event in June.

<p>Update: It's officially over</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Satoru Iwata Louvre" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9d7866e0533a4/satoru-iwata-louvre.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-09-02T18:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Tue 2nd Sep 2025, 7:30pm</time>]:</strong> It's official - the Louvre has finally laid its Nintendo 3DS audio guides to rest.</p>
<p>Reported by <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2025/09/02/louvre-says-game-over-to-its-nintendo-3ds-visitor-guide_6744946_13.html">French newspaper Le Monde</a>, the world-renowned museum ended the service on 1st September 2025. It originally announced it would be retiring the novel museum guides sometime in September.</p>
<p>It's an extremely novel concept, so it's a little sad to see it concluding, but it makes sense at this point — maybe Nintendo could get a Switch or Switch 2 audio guide running for the museum, hmm?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/3ds/related-articles:36010,35977 @ 1756841407 --><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> The Louvre Museum in Paris, France is retiring the Nintendo 3DS audio guides for the museum later this year.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/louvre-museum-removing-nintendo-3ds-audio-guides/">Nintendo Everything</a>, the <a href="https://www.louvre.fr/en/visit/visitor-amenities">official website for the world-famous museum</a> confirms that the 3DS console audio guides are going "out of operation" sometime in September this year in place of a new system which hasn't been confirmed. A Nintendo Switch 2 app, perhaps...? Oh, come on, you thought it too.</p>
<p>The collaboration between the Louvre and Nintendo first dropped in 2012 — where you could "rent" a 3DS at the Louvre to use as an audio guide. Nintendo even held <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WavLP_3ew-A&amp;ab_channel=NintendoofAmerica">a dedicated Direct</a> on the collab in 2013 to announce a purchasable version of the software, so people could experience the Louvre from the comfort of their own home. We'll pop that Direct below, because seeing Satoru Iwata and Shigeru Miyamoto together gave us the warm fuzzies.</p>

<p>The software itself contained high-quality photos and 3D models of much of the museum's iconic artwork. Over 600 images, 30 hours of audio commentary, and more than 400 3D reconstructions of museum rooms are part of the software.</p>
<p>It was, and still is, an extremely unique collaboration, and we're a little bit sad to see it go. But it's been around for 13 years, so it makes sense. So, if you want to experience the Louvre in a truly unique way, then you've got until September 2025 to rent one of those special 3DS's.</p>

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>In July, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/697125/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-2025">Microsoft’s sweeping layoffs hit Xbox hard</a>, and shuttered the entire game studio that was building <em>Perfect Dark</em>. Officially, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696877/xbox-perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-the-initiative-layoffs">the game was canceled</a>. But unofficially, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through">reports <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Jason Schreier</a>, Microsoft gave <em>Perfect Dark</em>’s other set of developers — <em>Tomb Raider</em> studio Crystal Dynamics<em> — </em>a chance to revive the game.</p></div><p>Here’s where it gets potentially confusing: Microsoft doesn’t own Crystal Dynamics — that studio belongs to the Embracer Group, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/630234/embracer-group-aftermath-saber-matt-karch-stephen-totilo">has had</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163110/embracer-laid-off-more-employees-than-riot-games-entire-workforce">many</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/28/24114402/embracer-selling-gearbox-borderlands-developer-take-two">troubles</a> of its own. So Embracer was trying to cut a deal with <em>yet another</em> publisher, the giant Take-Two, to buy, fund, and publish the game. But, Schreier reports:</p><div><blockquote><p>the talks collapsed at least in part because the companies involved were unable to come to terms over long-term ownership of the <em>Perfect Dark</em> franchise, said the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about sensitive negotiations.</p></blockquote></div><p>When that deal fell through, it reportedly led to the new round of layoffs at Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-more-following-perfect-dark-cancelation">that <em>IGN</em> reported last week</a>, and Schreier writes that Crystal Dynamics has now “fully” abandoned the game.</p><p>Seems Microsoft didn’t want to give up the rights to <em>Perfect Dark</em>, which it presumably obtained when it bought Rare in 2002. (For the uninitiated, <em>Perfect Dark</em> was a spiritual successor to Rare’s hit <em>Goldeneye 007</em> on the Nintendo 64, a game that itself went many decades without a revival because of <a href="https://licensinginternational.org/news/mgm-and-eon-productions-partner-with-nintendo-and-microsoft-to-bring-iconic-goldeneye-007-video-game-to-a-new-generation-of-gamers/">a complicated licensing situation</a>.) That feels like a crummy reason for the game to stay canceled, but we don’t know the details.</p><div><p>Microsoft <em>was</em> able to broker a previous deal to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24218424/hifi-rush-studio-tango-gameworks-saved-krafton-microsoft">save <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>developer Tango Gameworks by selling it to <em>PUBG</em> giant Krafton</a>, but it was under a lot of pressure there. <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> had already been released, had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152137/xbox-hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-matt-booty">become a “break out hit” that won “prestige and awards”</a>, and gamers were pissed that Microsoft had rewarded its developers with layoffs.</p></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769372/microsoft-perfect-dark-revival-take-two-deal#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/769372/microsoft-perfect-dark-revival-take-two-deal]]></content:encoded>

<p>Perfect Dark could have been saved, according to a new report. </p>



<p>The reboot, done by Crystal Dynamics, The Initiative, and Xbox, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-and-xbox-no-longer-working-crystal-dynamics/">cancelled earlier this July</a> out of the blue. Given the game’s well-received gameplay trailer and excitement, many were disappointed in the news. Plus, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-holds-layoffs/">last week’s layoffs</a>, it felt like a nail in the coffin for the classic shooter from Rare. Sadly, it does look like any chance of the game coming out has been silenced.</p>



<h2 id="h-take-two-could-ve-released-perfect-dark-but-declined">Take-Two Could’ve Released Perfect Dark, But Declined</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NjgzNDY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzU3NDM5NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMVoyQTRHUTdMRlEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.iGoAomXADlAaCsr4KgsTEy8oHTbv4k9XTSl7NVtRZXo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> from industry insider Jason Schreier for Bloomberg, Crystal Dynamics cut staff last week because they were unable to secure a deal with a new publisher for Perfect Dark. Embracer, which owns Crystal Dynamics, was reportedly close to striking a deal with Take-Two Interactive. If it went through, the publisher would’ve bought the game from Xbox and then seen the game to completion. Sadly, the talks ceased due to Perfect Dark’s ownership, though exact details were not disclosed.</p>



<p>Along with the cancellation of Perfect Dark, its studio, The Initiative, closed down. However, the report also states that leadership from the studio and Crystal Dynamics have been trying to get a publisher for the last two months. While negotiations did happen with a few, Take-Two was the farthest along.</p>



<p>While chances for Perfect Dark to return are seemingly unlikely, it could see the light of day. Tango Gameworks, which Xbox shut down after the success of Hi-Fi Rush, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tango-gameworks-acquired-by-pubg-publisher-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bought by Krafton</a> and can work on their IPs again. Whether The Initiative meets that same fate is unknown, but it all depends on the IP of Perfect Dark and if the rights can be purchased.</p>



<p>Are you disappointed to see Perfect Dark cancelled and, likely, never coming back? Let us know in the comments and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the forums</a>!</p>

Your skills, timing, and agility are the key to your success!</p><p><em>Radiant Starlets</em> is designed with replayability in mind. Each playthrough with a different romantic partner will have you unlock new minigames armor sets, and a unique ending.</p><p><strong>Narrative</strong></p><p><em>Radiant Starlets</em> is set in a world facing challenges that develop from its advanced technological progress.</p><p>In a bleak future where the world’s population is on the brink of collapse, you play as Dream, the only Perfect Companion Robot ever built; designed to be the ideal partner. You must avoid the grip of the Starlets who seek to claim you as their own.</p><p>Your permanent power supply has been broken and split into eight pieces that you need to retrieve or else you will run out of power within the year. Each piece that you gather will bring you closer to understanding what you really are.</p><p>Explore the stages and find your armor sets and upgrades for your health and power-ups. Uncover secret routes and collect your parts so that you can continue to survive and escape your would-be captors, as well as learn a bit more about your potential partner!</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>In <em>Radiant Starlets</em>, you are equipped with two phase cannons. These excel at ranged combat and will be necessary to neutralize your enemies. These cannons can expel different kinds of energy and be modified for even greater capabilities.</p><ul><li><strong>Traverse Challenging Environments</strong> – Play eight main stages and face against Starlet Overdrive, a world-famous S-Pop group bent on obtaining Dream for themselves.</li><li><strong>Per-Relationship Speed-Runs</strong> – Each partner provides a separate speed run and endings. With <em>Radiant Starlets</em>, you’re encouraged to try every boss order. Replay to experience each partner’s armor set, minigame, and story.</li><li><strong>Partner Specific Mini Games</strong> – Each partner has a custom mini game, designed to unlock partner-specific power-ups and narrative.</li><li><strong>Armor Designed by your Partner </strong>– Each partner playthrough will have a custom armor set with unique properties, creating variances in gameplay between runs.</li><li><strong>Custom Partner Charge Shot</strong> – Each partner provides you with a custom charge shot that you blast!</li><li><strong>Get Power Ups From Each Boss</strong> – The Starlets have all modified Dream’s power source to power their equipment. When he retrieves them he will get a part of their powers.</li><li><strong>Endings for Each Romantic Partner</strong> – Each Romantic partner provides narrative changes and their own distinct ending.</li></ul><p><strong>World</strong></p><p>The world of <em>Radiant Starlets</em> is different than our own. Dense populations exist in city clusters but the birthrates all over the planet are staggeringly low. An increasingly aging population puts pressure on social programs sending the world into disarray.</p><p>Cities are full of people distracting themselves, growing more self-centered. You’ll get to explore locations from all over this world, learn its lore, and interact with and learn about the immensely popular Starlets.</p><p>Locations include:</p><ul><li><strong>Revorit</strong> – Once the vehicle manufacturing capital of the world. Now it’s in complete disarray. Highways are fragmented shells of what they once were. Once populous, now completely barren. Daneka used her <a title="Genres > Racing [273 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> winnings to buy the now abandoned desolate city, both for its history, but also to build the world’s largest and most dangerous race track. Now it’s only populated by her and her vehicle robot hybrids. Look out for pitfalls, patrolling vehicles and hazardous chasms while you approach Daneka.</li><li><strong>Neon Flowronto</strong> – A non-stop party, Flowronto never sleeps. It’s streets are dominated by restaurants, events, arts, and nightlife. Nyannaly bought up a city block and turned it into her studio as well as endless party flats. People relentlessly dance, coming night after night to the sleepless city. A city populated with lights and streams of automated vehicles filling the sky going from event to event. Jump, climb, and evade the challenges and obstacles Nyannaly laid out as you ascend to her studio and challenge her for her piece of your core.</li><li><strong>More to come!</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Boss Order</strong></p><p>Select your boss order! The order in which you challenge bosses will change who you can date.</p><p>As this is also an action platformer, we’ll endeavor to make it so that the actual dating does not mean a sea of text to drown in. Instead, it means minigames in between missions to unlock boosts, brief but tantalizing story elements, and armor sets as your relationship progresses.</p><p>Players will need to get a scope of different stages to find things to power up and unlock partners. You may find some Starlets more daunting than others as your first challenge, so you may find it easier to change up the order in which you play until you’ve mastered their moveset.</p><p>Games like this are played to be enjoyed but also to be mastered, encouraging you to play it again and again to find everything and shave off every second you can.</p><p>Each Partner represents a different playtime for speedruns. My history with <em>Mega Man</em> games is one where, ultimately, you end up playing the fastest route over and over after figuring out your best route. One of the goals of <em>Radiant Starlets</em> is to break open the map based on your choice of partner and their associated powers, encouraging you to try every path and date every partner to speed up each route as best as you can.</p><p><em>Radiant Starlets</em> mixes action <a title="Genres > Platformer [734 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/platformer">platformer games</a> like <em>Mega Man</em> with romantic hybrid games like <em><a title="Series > Persona [90 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a></em> and <em>Fire Emblem</em> (though <em>Radiant Starlets</em> acknowledges that some people just want to go fast, and the dating dialogue is skippable) and amounts to fast, fun stage incentives and short, snappy minigames which reward you with armors and attacks. All in all, it creates a wide variety of experiences for each time you play the game.</p><p>Each Armor Set will have some changes to movement and attacks, providing a movement change (ex. Double Jump, Up Dash, Hover), as well as providing a unique charge shot that may open up sections of levels or make some challenges and encounters easier.</p><p>Dates are short minigames and your performance on them will provide level buffs, as well as increase your relationship progress, which is necessary to unlock your charge shot and armor set.</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Dream</strong><ul><li><strong>Role</strong> – ???</li><li><strong>Power</strong> – ?????</li><li><strong>Speed – </strong>?????</li><li><strong>Description</strong> – Dream was designed to be a Companion Helper Robot. His design was based on aggregated preferences for S-pop stars and drama actors in order to be ideally attractive in the North Eastern and Eastern Regions of the planet. Due to declining birth rates and political dissent, he was the only model ever designed. He was put away in storage in an undisclosed location; however, after being so thoroughly covered in all forms of media, his location was leaked to the most elite bidders for an exorbitant price. Little is known about him, and he knows less about himself. He has little time to discover himself, though, as he must obtain his power core parts or he won’t last long enough to find out.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Rika</strong><ul><li><strong>Role</strong> – Mechanical Engineer</li><li><strong>Power</strong> – ?????</li><li><strong>Speed</strong> – ?????</li><li><strong>Description</strong> –&nbsp;Having lost her arm when it was crushed in a work accident, Rika built herself a robotic arm to continue her work. She immediately took an interest in Dream but felt terrible for his fate. She found Dream’s location first and made modifications to him so he would be able to defend himself from his pursuers.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Daneka</strong><ul><li><strong>Role</strong> – Racer</li><li><strong>Power</strong> – 6,000</li><li><strong>Speed</strong> – 100</li><li><strong>Description</strong> – Daneka is a world-renowned racer, having won the last 7 Moto-XP competitions. She used her massive earnings to buy up the abandoned City of Revorit, which was known for its history of automobile manufacturing. Daneka has turned the city into her personal racetrack, and now she is looking for someone who can keep up with her but isn’t after her for personal gain.</li><li><strong>Dating Mini Game</strong> – For Daneka’s date mini game, you’ll need to beat her in motorcycle races to maximize your relationship and unlock your armor and charge shot.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Nyannaly</strong><ul><li><strong>Role</strong> – World-renowned DJ</li><li><strong>Power</strong> – 12,000</li><li><strong>Speed</strong> – 40</li><li><strong>Description</strong> – Nyannaly is the most energetic and talented DJ in the world, constantly traveling from place to place playing electrifying gigs. She’s built a reputation as an unstoppable force of the nightlife at every party she graces with her presence; however, beneath her vibrant exterior lies a deep emotional void. She’s never met anyone who can match her intensity; no one with enough energy to keep up, and so when she hears about Dream, she becomes fixated. As a (Perfect Robotic Companion), Dream doesn’t tire, so to he,r he represents an ideal partner; someone who can finally match her pace.</li><li><strong>Dating Mini Game</strong> – For Nyannaly’s date mini-game, you need to prove your rhythm to her to increase your relationship, unlock new dialogue, and get your armor set.</li></ul></li></ul></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/mega-man-style-action-platformer-x-dating-sim-radiant-starlets-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-switch-2-and-pc]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">The report states that the deal for Take-Two to take over the funding and publishing of Perfect Dark fell apart at least partially because all the parties involved were not able to come to terms over who would have long-term ownership of the Perfect Dark franchise, which currently still resides with Microsoft. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-dev-crystal-dynamics-cuts-staff-for-second-time-this-year/1100-6534338/" data-ref-id="1100-6534338">Crystal Dynamics laid off an unspecified number of staff</a> last week as a result of the deal with Take-Two collapsing, according to Bloomberg.</p><p dir="ltr">Perfect Dark was announced in 2020 as a reboot of the dormant sci-fi shooter franchise to be in development at Microsoft's first "AAAA" studio The Initiative. In 2021, it was announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-being-co-developed-by-tomb-raider-dev-crystal-dynamics/1100-6496517/" data-ref-id="1100-6496517">Crystal Dynamics would step in</a> to help as the game's co-developer. After years of radio silence, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-gets-first-gameplay-trailer/1100-6524084/" data-ref-id="1100-6524084">gameplay trailer for Perfect Dark</a>, revealing it to be a first-person shooter with what looked to be immersive-sim elements, was revealed in 2024 as part of an Xbox showcase.</p><p dir="ltr">A report from shortly before Perfect Dark's gameplay-trailer debut stated the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-is-allegedly-in-bad-shape/1100-6523261/" data-ref-id="1100-6523261">reboot was in rough shape</a> and hadn't come together, despite assistance from Crystal Dynamics.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft's July layoffs saw the tech giant reduce its headcount by an estimated 4%, resulting in around 9,000 people losing their jobs. Among them were those who worked at The Initiative, which was shuttered as a result of the layoffs. Other games canceled alongside Perfect Dark included a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">MMORPG from The Elder Scrolls Online developer</a> ZeniMax Online and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's long-in-development Everwild</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><i><a href="https://shorturl.at/IWQxO" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">Click here</a> </i><i>to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google.</i></p>

<p>Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-maehiro-minagaintewa-interview-sequel-advance">Inverse</a>, game director Kazutoyo Maehiro stated that if the upcoming launch does well, then this could potentially open the door to remasters of both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/final_fantasy_tactics_advance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/final_fantasy_tactics_a2_grimoire_of_the_rift">Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift</a> along with brand-new sequels.</p>

<p>"If The Ivalice Chronicles can do well, that’s good for the fans, they can enjoy it. But, at the same time, it shows the business viability of the strategy RPG genre. So that could potentially open the door for doing something with <em>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</em> or <em>A2,</em> or maybe even sequels and new titles as well.</p>
<p>"I think I speak for everyone who’s worked on the original <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>, and is working on <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> as well — we’d really like to see that happen."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tactics Advance (2003) and Tactics A2 (2007) launched for the GBA and DS respectively to strong critical reception, though it's fair to say that neither were quite able to match the cultural impact of the original PS1 game.</p>
<p>That said, we're certain fans would love to see both titles remastered for modern systems, and y'know what, we definitely would too. For now, we'll have to make do with The Ivalice Chronicles. If you're excited to play this one, then be sure to vote with your wallets if you want to see more from Square Enix.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158400/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Regarding modern augmentations, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> — released not even a month apart — have a lot of overlap. Yet, after 45 minutes of play, I was convinced that Art of Vengeance is one of the finest 2D Ninja action games ever made. Perhaps <em>the finest;</em> and such praise doesn’t come lightly.</p>
<p>After Ragebound’s dazzle, I was unsure if Shinobi could top it; yet it has. Visually beautiful, broadly artistic, and almost calligraphic in nature, the styling is well-married to its Japanese thematic. Natural elements of wood, cloth, and stone fuse with heavy machinery, concrete and military steel, the rural areas reflecting the painted landscapes of Hokusai and Taikan.</p>
<p>Lizardcube’s artists use a softening filter for a brush-like, watercolour flavour, and the grading is exceptional, bringing a picture book of panoramas to life without ever drowning out the foreground sprites. The hazy glow of orange-lantern-lit cities, thundering cornfields, and dense, raining cityscapes are majestic to behold, the camera often drawing out to allow a particular diorama to marinate. Where <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/streets_of_rage_4">Streets of Rage 4</a>’s multimedia clash was jarring in places, Art of Vengeance nails its aesthetic with pure, curved grace. That said, on Switch 2, the game's resolution isn’t properly optimised, resulting in jaggy upscaling. Something to consider if that’s your primary console.</p>
<figure><a title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158398/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The score is provided by the eminent Tee Lopes (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sonic_mania">Sonic Mania</a>), and a smattering of additions by the legendary Yuzo Koshiro. It’s a fitting, occasionally haunting arrangement of traditional Japanese instruments, layered with rhythms to complement the pace of the action. As locales get more industrial, the tempo becomes increasingly dance-oriented.</p>
<p>Joe Musashi, the returning hero, cuts a fine form. Voiceless, and amusingly grunting his way through cutscene exchanges, he moves with fox-like agility and strikes with a rubber band snap. The animation flows with impeccable detail, from that slight spring of the heels to the graceful arc of a backwards evasion.</p>
<p>Joe's a blast to control; sprinting by default, and double-jumping and air-dashing freely. His invulnerable roll is cat-like, passing through dangers to position him for the kill. He can fire off Kunai for ranged attacks, drop kick onto the heads of enemies, and wields light and hard sword strikes that combo with the greatest of ease. Ninja action has literally never looked — or felt — this good.</p>
<figure><a title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158401/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet, what really separates Art of Vengeance from the aforementioned Ragebound — despite sharing so many of the same ideas — is its combat implementation. Shinobi doesn’t just give you a nice set of attacks and dodges: it gets <em>deep.</em> The technical opportunities here are so unflappably cool, so tightly engineered, and so seamlessly applied that each new mix-up routine leaves you with a foolish grin.</p>
<p>Unlike past Shinobi games, enemies now have life bars, tying into its new combat approach. Not dissimilar to a fighting game in its core mechanics, Joe is constantly granted new attacks and attack alternatives to try in the field. What it’s careful not to do, however, is blunt ambitions or alienate players with overbearing complexity. You don’t have to employ every trick to get through the game, as basic light and hard attack tandems, the odd Kunai, and whatever super attacks you have at your disposal will serve you well enough. You’re so tooled up by four stages in that the swordplay writes itself most of the time, leaving you to focus on your dodging, the game’s most essential move.</p>
<figure><a title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158403/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, if you want to get surgical, it’s ninja heaven. The impressive animation doesn’t interfere, as most of everything is cancellable into the next attack. To get an idea of the game’s motion, you can dash forward, tap 'R' to hop over a box without losing pace, before rolling through an incoming Shuriken. From there you light attack twice, tap 'R' to leap through the enemy, and slap the button again to whirlwind into them, layering the combo meter. Direct Joe to land back centrally, employ two heavy swipes and then leap for a one-two juggle, before shooting three Kunai through the opponent while they're still airborne. By this point the Execution Gauge is full, and slamming both shoulder buttons will send Joe ripping through them anywhere on the screen, releasing a bounty of health icons and gold.</p>
<p>If that sounds sublime, it’s because it darn well is. The devs have also implemented a hard-hitting use of slowdown, providing feedback when a critical hit has landed, or when you’ve taken a blow. And the full-screen super attacks, rumbling in with a falling bass line, are a sight to behold. The game also allows you to return to your training dojo from the World Map screen at any time, where you can hone new techniques and acquired skills.</p>
<p>There are some absolutes, however, that can't be ignored. For example, the charge fist, acquired early on, is required to punch through shielded enemies and inaccessible green barricades. The bosses, too, an impressive assortment of demons, machines, and guardians, are pattern-based and won’t submit to spamming. These encounters are thrilling once you get them down, compelling you to exploit your dashes, dodges, and supers in experimental ways. Art of Vengeance can be challenging, and although not quite on the level of some of Ragebound’s encounters, you are expected to be nimble, especially when navigating moving platforms or threading yourself through deadly obstacles.</p>
<figure><a title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158404/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Those concerned that the game was <em>another</em> Metroidvania can breathe easy, as it’s a largely linear affair. From the World Map screen you can see percentages of completion, and backtracking is optional. There are five hidden orbs on each stage, and three areas where you can enter “Elite Squad” skirmishes: single-screen crowd battles to test the reflexes. Hidden orbs open up new skill options in the shops that, once purchased, can be applied through your gear menu. Here, you can customise Joe with your preferred attacks, upgrade Kunai to perform different functions, and even refashion the way the combo meter rewards you. It will be interesting to see how skilled players go down different routes with this.</p>
<p>Every checkpoint refills your life and doubles as a new teleportation spot. This means you can return to a stage — and, within that stage, a specific point — at any time. The most Metroid thing about it is that there are certain barricades that can’t be broken until you have a particular skill - but returning to them is neither obfuscated nor tedious, and in many cases either reap a quick reward or help you get closer to 100%. The primary impetus to do this is if you want to upgrade Joe faster, extending his health and super stocks. It's worth noting that even if you play it in a straight line, it's a lengthy campaign that will require around 10 hours to finish.</p>

<p>Stage layouts are broad but focused, with width for exploration. They run horizontally and vertically, are full of switches to trigger, and are inventively formed, with things to hang on, walls to run up, and air-dash extending portals to keep you in-flight. As per-Shinobi games of the past, Joe moves through the mountains and into more industrial territory, from factory smelting works to neon-draped cities full of fan-service Sega signage.</p>
<p>The action offers variety, too, whether racing on the back of a Yamato, Joe’s faithful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/shadow_dancer_the_secret_of_shinobi">Shadow Dancer</a> canine, or outrunning encroaching walls of flame. There are a few places where you're unsure if going down leads to a death or a new area, and it can occasionally be unclear where to go next - but this is what the map is for, ultimately. Perhaps there could have been more arcade-like variety in places, like the mountain factory’s awesome saw blade chicane, but the maps are well-engineered to exercise Joe’s skillset. Series fans will also note many a callback to the series' Mega Drive entries, with a fair lump sum plucked from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/shinobi_iii_return_of_the_ninja_master">Shinobi III</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of scoring, if it performed well, Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is a straight nine. It’s glorious. And that makes its frame rate issues all the more painful. Where Ragebound’s frame rate on Switch was its primary negative, Shinobi is buttery smooth for the most part. But, in certain spots where the camera scales out against busier backgrounds, it seriously suffers.</p>
<p>Initially, these instances are so brief they can be mostly overlooked, but in the Mountain Factory it suddenly becomes prolonged and increasingly severe, causing a jarring, peculiar sprite judder the like I’ve never seen before. We contacted Sega PR to see if this will be addressed in a promised patch, but we've had no response.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In reinventing the retro wheel, Shinobi: Art of Vengeance leads the way: a demonstration of how modern tools, accompanied by thought and talent, can be expanded upon to not just reboot franchises, but actually rebuild them in new and incredible ways. It’s one thing to revisit an arcade action game with new graphics, moves, and weapons, cherry picking familiar set-pieces and nostalgic visuals; it’s another entirely to create a new experience, utilising craftsmanship and a belief that the hardware can offer more.</p>
<p>Art of Vengeance, its cadence and flow, its violence and exhilaration — and the fact it makes you feel like an absolute badass from one slain enemy to the next — is a trendsetter. Fix that frame rate, and it’s pure ninja gold.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It feels like just yesterday that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>was only on my radar because the internet was memeing the hell out of one of the musical’s early scenes in which Huntr/x, the fictional girl group that would give Dante from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-netflix-review-season-1-dante-lady-vergil-1851774417"><i><span>Devil May Cry</span></i></a> <span>a run for his money on the demon-slaying front, devours their pre-show snacks in a way that can only be described as bestial. If I had listened to the dismissive jokes, I might have thought the movie was just some goofy animated slop in Netflix’s never-ending content mill and passed on loading it up to see what all the fuss was about. However, even if I hadn’t taken the plunge, </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>would have become a phenomenon too big to ignore. In the two months since the movie launched on Netflix’s streaming service, the movie Sony was too cautious to release in theaters on its own has become arguably one of the most important moments in pop culture this year. How did we get here? What can we learn from the movie’s resounding success? Given how well the first movie has performed for Netflix, is there any need for the inevitable sequel to do anything differently?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ success can be attributed to a few factors, but all of it leads back to it having every advantage in a world where it’s increasingly imperative that a project achieve viral recognition and good word of mouth. Launching on Netflix was undeniably a boon for the film, as kids love to watch movies on repeat, and if an audience readily has easier access to something at home, it feeds The Content Machine. YouTubers can create entire reaction videos from the comfort of their own homes, clips that aren’t just grainy camera recordings in a dark theater can circulate on social media, and its soundtrack of catchy K-pop earworms can be available on streaming the day the movie comes out. Even if its title and premise didn’t grab your attention, </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>was uniquely positioned to find its audience, and that audience is historically very loud.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000618423" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618423"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618423">© Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The K-pop audience is merely one slice of the pie, however. </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ stunning </span><i><span>Spider-Verse</span></i><span>-esque animation, anime-inspired action, and Disney-like musicality means that even if the core premise doesn’t appeal to you, the movie probably has something that will catch your eye. As specific as its audience appears on the surface, the film isn’t just gunning for the biggest Twice stan with a Netflix subscription. Casual K-Pop listeners like myself found a lot to love in the film’s story of self-acceptance punctuated by some absolute bangers. The end result is something that transcends K-pop fandom and has rooted itself in the hearts and minds of audiences worldwide.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>is a chart-topping success story on multiple fronts. It’s now Netflix’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-most-popular-netflix-streaming-2000620409"><span>most-watched film of all time</span></a><span>; </span><a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/KPop-Demon-Hunters-(2025)#tab=summary"><span>topped the box office</span></a><span> with limited </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><span>singalong screenings</span></a><span> that the AMC theater chain </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/kpop-demon-hunters-gives-netflix-first-box-office-win-rcna226872"><span>didn’t even participate in</span></a><span> its self-love anthem, “Golden,” has </span><a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/huntrx-golden-global-charts-number-one-sixth-week-1236051236/"><span>been at the top of the Billboard top 200 for weeks</span></a><span>; and the movie’s soundtrack is the first to have </span><a href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/news/kpop-demon-hunters-soundtrack-charts-golden-lyrics-singalong-b2813992.html"><span>four songs in Billboard’s top 10 at once</span></a><span>. All of this success with a movie for which Sony made the “safe” choice to have Netflix foot the production bill in exchange for </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/kpop-demon-hunters-sony-netflix-sequel-talks-1236353972/"><span>exclusive streaming rights</span></a><span> and a split revenue in soundtrack sales. While some, myself included, have called Sony’s decision foolish, given the movie has done nothing but thrive since it arrived on Netflix, there is part of me that wonders if Huntr/x would have become a household name were </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>not so easily accessible. So much of its spread has been because it is easily clippable, screenshotable, and shareable across social media like TikTok and YouTube. Sony’s hesitation to put the movie in theaters may have been what led to it becoming the viral hit it has.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000620410" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620410"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620410">© Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>But what is the source of that hesitation? Is it because someone up top thought K-pop was too niche, or the mix of genres was too off-putting? Or is it just that </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>was a new property led by women? The film</span> <span>is the latest example of women-led cinema doing huge numbers, and then the rest of the world acting surprised that something ostensibly targeting young girls has an audience. The </span><i><span>Barbie </span></i><span>movie made over a billion dollars, the </span><i><span>Frozen </span></i><span>movies are some of the most successful animated films of all time, and we still need astronomical success stories to convince us that there’s demand for women-led films. </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>is breaking through multiple ceilings both for its own success and to pave the way for others, but only time will tell if anyone actually learns anything from this, or if the film industry’s goldfish brain kicks in again and we forget until the sequel rolls out in a few years.</span></p>

              <p>Just ten years back, it’d be tough to imagine Disney being willing to put its name to something as outstandingly gory as <em>Marvel: Rivals</em>. The new trailer reveals some incredibly gloopy deaths, outlandish violence, and blood absolutely everywhere. It’s surely one of the goriest things Disney has ever made? The show will also feature the voices of big-time Hollywood names like Paul Rudd, Florence Pugh, Elizabeth Olsen and Awkwafina.</p> <p>It’s Disney’s rush of acquisitions that mostly seems to have contributed to the once prim company now releasing some very adult content. Buying Marvel and Fox meant the not so family-friendly <em>X-Men</em> movies arrived on streaming platform Disney+, and the two combined in spectacular fashion in the&nbsp;<em>Deadpool</em> movies. It’s quite something that such films appear alongside the gallery of princesses on the subscription service. Now add <em>Marvel Zombies</em> to that discombobulation, because damn, this trailer has all the gore.</p>  <p>I had no expectations for this. The&nbsp;<em>What If…</em> series has mostly left me very flat, but <em>What If… Zombies?!</em> has inspired a whole new miniseries, due to be added to the streamer September 24, and this trailer has me absolutely in.</p>

 <p>It helps that the voice cast is absolutely incredible. <em>What If…</em> occasionally got the movie actors, but often not–this time, though, it’s a stunning collection. As you’ll hear in the trailer there’s Florence Pugh revising her <em>Thunderbolts*</em> role as Yelena Belova, along with David Harbour as her father, Alexei Shostakov. But there’s also Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, Awkwafina as Xu Shang-Chi’s bestie Katy, Elizabeth Olson as Scarlet Witch (naturally a zombie), Wyatt Russell as the unimprovably named John Walker, Tessa Thompson as <em>Thor</em>‘s Valkyrie, and Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan. And that’s barely half the list.</p> <p>The whole thing is obviously entirely non-canon for the MCU, rather offering a chance to let the characters behave in ways they otherwise never could, in circumstances that Disney would <em>never</em> let reach the big screen. Or would they? I mean,&nbsp;<em>Deadpool</em> got to keep going! Maybe one day.</p> <p>The trailer’s highlight for me? Definitely Spider-Man (still voiced by Hudson Thames as in previous animated series) taking the heads of so many zombs at once. Very not Peter Parker-like behavior.</p>

<p>Activision has announced that all players of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone will receive 20 Battle Pass Tier skips. The move comes as a thank you to players as updates for the game wind down ahead of the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>In order to get your free Battle Pass Tier skips, players simply have to login to either Black Ops 6 or Warzone between now and September 16. Once you do, they will automatically be added to your account.</p>



<p>Activision says that the Black Ops 6 Season 5 Reloaded update will <strong>“be larger on some platforms”</strong> due to <strong>“reorganizing&nbsp;Call of Duty&nbsp;content to prepare for the&nbsp;Black Ops 7&nbsp;Beta on October 2.”</strong> Because of the size of the update, Activision will be giving players a number of double XP tokens on all platforms.</p>



<p>Those who download the update and login to the game between September 4 and October 1 will get <strong>five 1-hour double player XP tokens</strong>, <strong>five 1-hour double weapon XP tokens</strong>, and <strong>five 1-hour double Battle Pass XP tokens</strong>. That equates to 15 hours of double XP in order to unlock and level up what you’re still grinding for. </p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 5 Reloaded launches on September 5. The update includes a new multiplayer map, more Zombies content, new and returning modes, and more. Full details for the update can be found on the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-season-05-reloaded" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty website</a>.</p>

<p>We were pleasantly surprised to see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac</a> make an appearance make an appearance in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">July Partner Direct</a>, and as we close in on its <strong>26th September</strong> release date, Bandai Namco has some fresh gameplay footage for us so we can see how it's shaping up.</p>
<p>The new gameplay trailer (above) gives us our closest look yet at the upcoming remake, with Pac-Man himself walking us through all the new additions. This includes a breakdown of his new moveset, the assist Fairy Mode and challenge Time Trial Mode, and the Pac-Village minigames.</p>
<p>The newbies are all well and good, but we're enjoying simply seeing more gameplay from the damn thing. Bandai Namco released a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pac-man-world-2-re-pac-is-a-big-glow-up-on-switch-and-switch-2">side-by-side comparison</a> of the 2002 original and the remake shortly after the game was announced, and it seems to be an almighty upgrade as far as visuals are concerned.</p>
<p>As a reminder, we thought that the last Re-Pac release was perfectly solid slice of PS1 platforming, even if it did play things a little too safe. Here's hoping that the sequel can muster up something a little more imaginative.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s latest patch is following up the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76-is-currently-testing-the-one-thing-that-makes-every-game-better-fishing">addition of fishing</a> in the only way that's natural. Bethesda have opted to revamp its base building mechanics in an effort to make thing easier for newbies and offer veterans some extra freedom to stick huge shacks full of stuff together in different ways.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/4xj9qqfxl7bKHnRVkXKPKm/fallout-76-c-a-m-p-revamp-release-notes">Patch 62</a>, dubbed 'C.A.M.P revamp', menus have been rejigged and placement restrictions relaxed in an effort to have you spend 60 more hours slapping bits of wood into accomodation, rather than going off and ruining some super mutant's day. Then again, I can't imagine the green folks are too happy about the wasteland being turned into a showroom of properties that'd probably cost several million quid despite the fact they can barely keep the radiation out, such are modern house prices.</p>

<p>The aspect of the patch - which drops today, September 2nd - that's most caught my eye is the restriction loosening that the devs say will allow players to stick a number of items anywhere, "even in the air". While this doesn't apply to everything, with some stuff still demanding you set it down on the ground, the patch's trailer shows off a number of houses built atop rocky outcrops that'd usually turn everything red outside of modded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>.</p><p>To paraphrase a British TV show, when it comes to houses it's the whereabouts, whereabouts, whereabouts that can be key, and this looks to be making killer views much more accessible. Is it wise to build your house up high and out in the open if there are nukes flying around? Probably not, but hey, video game.</p>
<p>In line with that general restriction loosening, the need to snap home components directly together has also been relaxed. "Walls can also be built beneath the floor, and upper floors can be attached to walls without the need for a staircase," Bethesda say. Yep, just get rid of your stairs and use a power armour jetpack to get upstairs. I'm sure that'll end well if your fusion core runs dry and you're bursting for the loo. Actually, I'm forgetting, this is a video game house. The very swanky and totally unnecessary downstairs commode was the second thing you built.</p>
<p>Finally, there's the building menu revamp, which aims to make it easier to find the thing you're looking for without as much rummaging through interface drawers. "We've arranged our thousands of items into main categories and subcategories. For example, our lighting main category now has multiple subcategories such as freestanding lights and wall-mounted lights." There's a quote you'd just as likely find in an email from your flat-pack furniture retailer of choice.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, Bethesda's got a bunch of community building competitions planned for the rest of the year, with the first set to run from the revamp's release to September 29th. Good luck beating out the loose collection of floor-walls with random clutter slapped onto it that I might submit.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last year, Sony released a new PS5 Dualsense controller themed around the then-upcoming platformer <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280">Astro Bot</a>.</em> The game was a huge hit with critics and fans, as was the controller, which sold out quickly and became hard to find. But now, a slightly tweaked version of the popular gamepad is returning in October with pre-orders later this month.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1962908501270827092">On September 2</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-five-new-free-levels-july-10-cameo-bots-ps5-1851786014">after some teasing in July,</a> PlayStation revealed that the new “Joyful” version of the<em> Astro Bot</em> PS5 controller was officially launching just before Halloween, on October 30. And gamers who missed out on buying an <a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-sony-parappa-1851653602"><em>Astro Bot</em></a> controller last year will have a chance to pre-order the new version on September 12 at 10 a.m. local time via PlayStation’s own online store and “participating retailers.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Astro Bot returns with a new delightful twist! </p> <p>The limited edition Astro Bot Joyful DualSense launches October 30. Pre-orders start September 12 at 10am local time at <a href="https://t.co/y9oEB5a3CG">https://t.co/y9oEB5a3CG</a> and participating retailers. <a href="https://t.co/TLqJEyEZSt">pic.twitter.com/TLqJEyEZSt</a></p> <p>— PlayStation (@PlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1962908501270827092?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This isn’t the same controller that was sold back in 2024 and <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/astro-bot-ps5-dualsense-controllers-are-being-scalped-for-over-150-second-hand-market-exclusive-items/">quickly gobbled up and scalped on eBay</a> for more than twice the price. Well, it’s mostly the same controller. The only real difference is the touchpad. On the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/29/first-look-astro-bot-limited-edition-dualsense-wireless-controller/">OG <em>Astro Bot</em> gamepad</a>, the eyes were open and always watching you play. This time around, the eyes are slightly closed, simulating joy and happiness. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-edition-dualsense-astro-bot-pre-order-1851607894">It’s a bit less creepy, which is nice</a>.</p>

 <p>No price was shared for this new version of the controller, but last time PlayStation sold the <em>Astro Bot</em> Dualsense controller, it was priced at $80. Still, the new<em> Astro Bot</em> pad might cost a bit more. <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-ps5-controller-last-of-us-dualsense-ugly-price-sony-1851768135">The boring and ugly <em>Last-of-Us</em>-themed Dualsense controller from Sony cost $85 earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>Whatever it costs, you can expect it to go for much more when resellers inevitably grab up a ton of them and sell them on eBay. Heck, the original <em>Astro Bot</em> Dualsense controller still goes for <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Astro+Bot+controller&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4432023.m570.l1313">$110 to $160 sealed on the internet’s ancient auction house</a>. So if you really want a joyful <em>Astro Bo</em>t-themed Dualsense controller and you don’t want to pay $200 or whatever, I’d be hanging out at your computer on September 12, ready to pre-order the moment they go live. Good luck with that!</p>
